{"product_name":"B00CQ7CIMS","description":"","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"Great, if atypical, addition to Mario platformers","reviewText":"\"New Super Luigi U\" is downloadable content for \"New Super Mario Bros. U\", staring Luigi rather than Mario.  Two months after its first appearance in the Nintendo eShop, priced at $19.99, Nintendo has released the game as a retail boxed version at $29.99, ten dollars more. The DLC version requires you to have the \"New Super Mario Bros. U\" disk in the Wii U to play this extra content.  Obviously, the boxed version can be played as a stand-alone title.Please note: Mario does not appear at all as a playable character.  After beating the game, you can play as Luigi using the standard physics of his brother.To put it kindly, the Wii U has had a rough first year.  The sales have simply not been there, and Nintendo is fighting tooth and nail to get the install base up for their new machine.  One of the key factors has been lack of software titles.  Nintendo skipped the full blown dog and pony show of E3, instead issuing a Nintendo Direct (an online presentation of the new software titles that the company was launching).  In April 2013, we first learned about \"New Super Luigi U\", a full blown game starring Luigi.  To say we were surprised due to \"New Super Mario Bros. U\" had jut launched November 2012 is putting it lightly.However, this isn't the whole story.  \"New Super Luigi U\" straddles the fence between a \"brand new game\" and an extensive \"downloadable content\" addition to an already existing game.  I personally believe we have gotten a retail version of \"NSLU\" for a two fold purpose: this DLC is long enough to merit a stand-alone release, and, much more importantly, acts as a stop-gap release in preparation for the all important Christmas season for the admittedly very slim library of Wii U games that have been available in its first year.While Nintendo has first issued DLC for the 3DS \"New Super Mario Bros. 2\" title, this content was largely confined to brief level packs.  With \"New Super Luigi U\", which has been available as a digital download since July, is completely unprecedented in Nintendo's (admittedly very brief) history of DLC: far from being brief level editions, this game is a whole new compaign staring Luigi, perfectly in key for Nintendo's Year of Luigi which is what they have dubbed 2013.For new purchasers, let's define what this game is specifically.WHAT IT IS: A four player game, starring Luigi, two Toads, and Nabbit.  Nabbit is invincible and impervious too any damage and cannot take power ups.  The game features the exact same world map as \"New Super Mario Bros U\"; however, all the levels have been reworked and almost all of them start with only 99 seconds.  Luigi's physics have been reworked, making him floaty in terms of his jumping and very loose, slippy traction.  Due to the time limit, you have to move quickly through the levels.  While four players, the levels here are claustraphobic in nature with more than two players, because of how quickly you must beat them (especially for levels where ground is at a premium). While four player mode has been chaotic in the Wii and Wii U \"New Super Mario Bros.\" games, it is even more frustratingly difficult in \"NSLU\" due to short level times and the deeply increased challenge of the levels in comparison to the other two Mario games.WHAT IT IS NOT: a full-fledged, brand new game staring Luigi..  People are comparing this too \"Super Mario Bros 2: The Lost Levels\" and the original \"Super Mario Bros.\".  This analogy simply does not hold water.  While \"The Lost Levels\" was little more than a mission pack sequel to the original; this title does not feel or play like a true sequel to \"New Super Mario Bros. U\", largely due to the brief running times of the levels (99 seconds) and the fact that, although the game has been released as a stand-alone title, this is first and foremost DLC (granted, very expansive DLC, the likes of which we have never seen from Nintendo).  Also, given the identical world map, the game plays simply like a reimagined campaign mode for the first game.  What also should be noted is this game, unlike \"NSMBU\", contains no extra modes and features only the 82 levels of the world map as playable content.Likewise, the price point of this first party Wii U game (29.99 instead of the usual 50-60 dollar range) tells us \"New Super Luigi U\" is not on the same playing field as Nintendo's other first-party titles.  Mario games are famous for keeping their MRSP (or close too it) for years after their initial release, especially Mario titles.  \"Super Mario Galaxy\" and \"The Legend of Zelda: The Twilight Princess\" did not become noticeably cheaper until the red-cased \"Nintendo Choice\" games of 2011-2013, four to five years after the release of these games.Another thing to be noted is challenge.  The game's difficulty ramps up from the very beginning, and it is clear even in the opening levels that the developers are designing this content for more experienced players. Such unrelenting difficulty (spread throughout the entire duration of the game's playing time) has not been seen since \"Super Mario Bros. 2: The Lost Levels\".  Mario, obviously, is Nintendo's bread and butter, and while the Mario games can be challenging, over all they are widely accessible to players of all skill levels.  Such skill level required, consistently maintained at such a high mark throughout the entire duration of the game's worlds, would simply never be considered by Nintendo on a mainstream Mario game, as that would drive away many potential customers and would somewhat hamper the impeccable Mairo brand.Like Greenland as the largest island in the world (but not a continent), \"New Super Luigi U.\" blurs that perhaps hard to define level between new game and simple DLC.  For reasons already outlined, Nintendo has released this has a stand-alone title, but buyers should be aware that this game will not have the same amount of hours as its parent title, due to the intentionally  brief, speed running design of the levels.For those expecting a full-fledged sequel to \"New Super Mario Bros U.\" will find this disappointing to some degree.  For those who go into the game expecting a brief, fun excursion as an extra campaign mode to an already existing title, they will find a lot to enjoy about the game.  Just be aware the game is extremely challenging, and due to that increased challenge, the first \"New Super Mario Bros U\" game will be better if you are looking for four person multiplayer, or, better yet, wait for \"Super Mario 3D World\", which will feature four person multiplayer in a 3D Mario game for the first time ever!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2013"}

Rhodes","summary":"Another MUST HAVE Title","reviewText":"Who says the DS doesn't have great games?  Liars, that's who!  And with DS Mario Kart you can say you've got one of the best titles to hit the DS!  And with Nintendo DS now with Wi-Fi Connection, you can play online and enjoy the fun with up to seven other players!Mario Kart DS, like all the others, features grand prix races for you to race in.  Most of them won't be availible until you complete other races, but that's the fun of Mario Kart.  The races are not too hard, and they're a load of fun!  Four of these tracks are brand new, but several are taken from previous Mario Kart titles.  From the SNES, to the GBA release just a couple of years ago. You can enter cups at 50cc, 100cc, or 150cc.  This, of course, is the difficulty level.  You'll not only notice your opponents get faster, but they'll get more aggressive as well.There are eight characters with two vehciles each.  Well, at first.  As you progress through the game you'll unlock more.  When deciding on a character you of course are looking at speed, acceleration, etc. but you may also want to look at things like... the drifting... or their item attribute.  A low item attribute will often net you items that are pretty much useless.This is NOT just a rehash of an old game, though.  I noted that there are four new tracks, and that it actually combines earlier titles.  But there are also new powerups in this one.  You now have a Bullet Bill power up which will increase your speed (and send you temporarily into auto-pilot).  You'll also be able to fire off a Bob-omb (that'll really mess your opponents up) and you can now release a blooper (those squid guys) to squirt ink on the screen of your opponents.  These new editions are worth it.In addition to the new power ups and tracks, you've also got \"Mission\" mode.  This will pit you into courses where you'll have to perform certain task to move on.  For example, you may need to pass through gates in a certain order.  There are six groups with nine levels each.  Each group ending with a boss.Now let's move on to the best stuff.  The reason a lot of us still play Mario Kart games.  The battling!  You can do the balloon battles and shine runners in a single player mode, but not do them on multi-player would be a sin.  Mario Kart DS takes complete and total advantage of Nintendo's Wi-Fi usage.  So challenge some people!Getting on the Wi-Fi has great oppurtunities.  You can have up to 36 rivals, and you can challenge people all over the world.  The problem of course, being you could lose the connection.  There's little problems with the Wi-Fi connection, though, and it's much more fun than it appears to be.As you might have guessed, the game looks and sounds great!  It's smooth, like the visuals of the N64 version, only smoother--not as blocky.  The sounds are great and so are the sound effects.  And because the DS in Stereo, you'll love it with all your heart.Mario Kart DS is another must own DS title.  It isn't just some port of an old game, it throws in a ton of new stuff.  So don't think of passing this up by saying, \"I've got it on N64!\"  The N64 version has nothing on this.  So grab it!The Good:+FUN STUFF TO UNLOCK!+Great Graphics+Great Sound!+You can play multiplayer with a single pack!+Fully takes advantage of Nintedno Wi-Fi+Not just a rehash of Super Mario Kart 64, it's actually it's own title!The Bad-Your friends and family will certainly feel neglected--unless they have this game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2005"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"You still can't beat the GameBoy","reviewText":"With Sony's PSP and Nintendo's own new portable, the DS, the days of the incredibly long running GameBoy are coming to an end.  With the SP, the fifth incarnation of Nintendo's classic portable gaming machine, gamers finally got a backlit screen and a rechargable battery pack, two additions which make this the best GameBoy system ever (and yes, it's still better than the recently released GameBoy Micro), and yes, not only does it play GBA titles, it also plays the old GameBoy and GameBoy Color cartridges as well.  Not to mention that there's a ton of classic Super NES ritles that have been ported to the GBA as well.  That feature also helps make the SP the absolute best GameBoy system ever, since the Micro and the DS aren't compatable with them.  With all that, there is an absolutely huge library of games to choose from, and since it's from Nintendo, there's naturally a large library of quality first party games.  I'd take this over a PSP any day of the week because the SP proves that it's the games, not the features, that make a portable system worth owning.  There's a ton of essential original GameBoy and GameBoy Color games that are worth owning (including the Super Mario Land series, Super Mario Bros.

Brain Age 2 supplies just what the cover of the box says it does: it's more training for your brain.  The game is easy to get into for newcomers and veterans alike thanks to offering the same, simple structure as before while offering new takes on the mini-games themselves.  Combine that with some solid multiplayer capabilities, more great sudoku, and much more complicated math problems; and Brain Age 2 ends up being a winner.  The biggest flaw of Brain Age 2 however remains left over from the first game: the handwriting and speech recognition features are still somewhat shaky.

{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"WhitWire Reviews \"Ryan\"","summary":"Not as Good as the Playstation, but Come On!","reviewText":"Back in the day--and by that I mean the late 90's--my family and I owned our own Sony Playstation console. It was an amazing console with games such as Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon. Without any real competition from Sega during the mid 90's, Playstation and the Nintendo 64 struggled to show everybody who was the best.Released in 1996--about 2 years after the debut of the Playstation console--the Nintendo 64 picked up steam fast. Games such as Super Mario 64, Zelda's Ocarina of Time, and Mario Kart 64, it's no wonder Nintendo's new system did so well.So now let's see just how the Nintendo 64 compares to the Playstation. For starters, the picture clearly indicates one thing the Playstation didn't have: four controller ports. The only way to play with four players on the Playstation was to attach a multi-tap to its front. In terms of the controllers themselves, the Playstation wins; with its sleek, ergonomic design and simple button layout, it's no competition. The Nintendo 64, on the other hand, has an awkward-to-handle controller with three handles--almost as if Nintendo expected there to be gamers with three hands looking for a new Nintendo console. The only thing better about the Nintendo 64's controller is how it was the first to have a built-in thumbstick--which Sony later took to but into their Dualshock controller.Another thing you may notice about the Nintendo 64 is how it has a cartridge slot--as opposed to the Sega Saturn and Playstation having disc drives. Because of the Nintendo 64's lack of a disc drive, its games cannot hold the space or audio quality of disc-based games. But--because the discs are on cartridges--the long loading times we experience with the Playstation are virtually nonexistent here.As Nintendo's last home console to use cartridges and their first console to use 3D 64-bit graphics, it became a major success. Its games set the status quo for many 3D platformers, 3D racers, and adventure games to come.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0007D4MVS","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"A great \"wherever\" game.","reviewText":"Late last year, I finally got a copy of WarioWare: Touched!, after always being on the fence about buying 'just' a collection of mini-games. The first one for GBA looked fun but I didn't get a chance to play it. Boy do I wish I had, because this DS installment constantly provides me with entertainment. WarioWare: Touched! is a perfect example of a game that you can play anywhere at any time. In the bathroom, on a bus, while waiting in a long line, waiting for a movie to start, you name it.This is a fairly large collection of mini-games that you keep playing until you lose all your lives. There's a very short, simple 'story' to it, though it's mostly just Wario and his crew coming together to play a concert. There are cutscenes before you start the mini-games that show the story, but you can skip them, though they're pretty funny here and there. The games are just a few short seconds long, never longer than 8 seconds, and cover a bunch of styles. One has you squishing fleas on a dog, one has you undressing a heavily clothed guy at a beach, another has you pop bubbles, and one just has you pass a basketball. There's a ton of different games, each one using a different style of play (blowing into the microphone, tapping, scratching, etc.) so that things don't get reptitive. You can always choose to play just one mini-game over and over until you lose, going for a new record each time.What I love is how zany the game is. It doesn't take anything seriously, and the obscure additions to some classic art pieces had me smiling. In fact, the graphics are different for every mini-game. Some are 8-bit NES segments, others are just stick figures and others only use a few frames, kind of like a short flipbook. You might want to set your DS' brightness on a lower setting though if you have sensitive eyes, because things can get very bright in some of the games. The soundtrack's just as quirky, though you might never even notice it because of how short the games are, and how focused you'll be on accomplishing the tasks. 'gotta love the voices though.The only complaint I have is that I wanted more. There are a lot of people in Wario's group that you can select to play their games, and there are a lot for each person, but I wanted even more. I don't know how much free space was left on the game chip, but I sure would've been fine with them taking out the useless 'toys' like the calculator, piano and coloring book if it meant more games.WarioWare: Touched! is great for any age group. My daughter was playing this at 2 and a half, and still loves it now that she's almost 3. Anyone can figure it out and have fun. Always keep this on you when you know you're going to be waiting for something during your day. It'll help the time go by faster, trust me.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2010"}

I've returned it twice and am on my third disk, so I know it's not an errors on the disk itself.  It's just tons and tons of software glitches on the import from PC to 360 (which is funny since the 360 is just a PC in a pretty case).  Three of my close friends are all playing the 360 version as well, and they're all having the same problems I'm having.There are plenty of downloadable features (The Orary, the horse barding, priate ship, etc.), and these seem to have a negative effect on the software and cause a lot of trouble.  However, I didn't donwload any of this, and my game is rife with bugs.  If you go to Bethesda's forums, you can read tons and tons of posts discussing these problems (you might even find me there!).  But I'll sum them up for you.1) The game freezes constantly.  I think it has something to do with the DVD drive trying to load sounds and locking up.2) \"Unreadable Disk Errors\" are VERY common.  The game will pause, go black, and give this type of errors.  Some times it even says to remove the disk and put in a game designed for the 360!3) Strange loads.  Sometimes, you'll load saved files and appear in the world paralized and halfway inside of your avatar.Bethesda is no help with any of these problems.  On the forums many people have posted their customer support replies, and they're all the most generic, \"I'm not listening,\" plug your ears and hum responses I've ever read.As I've said this is one of the best games in a generation.  But stick with the PC.  You may be one of the fortunate ones with no bugs, but if you're in my boat, you'll be spitting mad at dumpting $60 for a coaster.

After mammoth games like Metal Gear Solid 4 or Uncharted 2, the main game just does not cut the mustard in this day and age.  But if you bought this game to play as Soap McTavish, you don't really care.  For me, just like its predecessor, Modern Warfare 2 is all about multiplayer.You are going to read rave after rave review of Modern Warfare 2 from anywhere you look.  Much like what happened with COD4, the reviews hardly take a broad, measured look at the full experience.  Let's avoid the temptation to fan the flames of hype and take a good look at some of the shortcomings in the game.A friend of mine asked about the \"No Russian\" mission on SP.  There really isn't much to say.  You can skip it or just watch, or you can participate.  The level feels like an experiment they left in.  When their single player game lasts only about 4 and a half hours, with lame trophies (or Achievements on XBL), throwing in a shock  level for attention makes some sense.  The content is maybe over the line a little.  But in my feeling, \"No Russians\" is a poster boy for Infinity Ward's Virtua Cop rails gameplay.  Stick to the \"Bling\" in MP.  Spec Ops does add some replay value, but you are still fighting the same SP enemies that stand in one place and fire bullets like a fire hose without reloading.  Uncharted 2's co-op and survival modes I believe play better.Sound effects are great.  The game runs mostly smooth.  There are some frame drops when there is a lot of smoke on screen.  Overall, the graphics get the job done on the strength of the consistent frame rate, but not on beauty.  The engine looked dated in COD4 and though it looks better now, Modern Warfare 2 is not up to par with the best of 2009.Maps are hit and miss.  Some are well done with some verticality to them.  Others look like they were designed in 10 minutes.  Though most of the maps seem large, they feel a little on the small side. Besides the \"Rust\" map, which for some reason never comes up to play, there isn't a good equal to \"Shipment\" from COD4 (either you love it or hate it) and that is a little disappointing, but there are expansions coming.On the PS3 you still can't listen to your local music collection when playing.  However, thankfully, there is now vibration for muzzle feedback when firing weapons.Lag is still a problem from time to time.  I would hope in future updates, Infinity Ward can pull out a better ping filter.  Host migration is implemented, but that doesn't mean it always works.  I have a solid 10meg connection and games still end from \"lost host connection\" errors.There are tons of kill streak bonuses and perks.  In fact there are so many, it doesn't feel that special to get a kill streak anymore.  Calling in an airstrike and then following it with a devastating chopper strafing run always felt good.  Even if you got them over and over again in COD4.Sure there are lots of new perks and upgrades, but one annoyance I have with MW2 is sometimes it just feels like you are playing a pinball machine.  There is so much XP, rings and points popping up, you can get points from anything you do.  BAM!  WAP!  Its like watching an old Batman tv show sometimes.  Which is...well...kinda lame.  I think the simplified old system was probably better.Ok so the game is far from perfect and somebody had to say it after all the near perfect reviews.  Modern Warfare 2 is a lot of fun, but feels a bit dated.  The game play is fast and furious online, but there are more than a few rough edges to be found.  Nevertheless, its a good time sink online.8/10","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

The only worthwhile titles for GameCube that you can't get for the other consoles are the Mario games, the Zelda games, and Pikmin.Well, the Mario games so far for GameCube (&quot;Luigi's Mansion,&quot; &quot;Super Mario Sunshine,&quot; &quot;Mario Party 4,&quot; &quot;Mario Party 5&quot; and &quot;Mario Kart Double Dash&quot;) don't add much to the franchise, truthfully. The Party games have more minigames, but they still get old quickly. &quot;Double Dash&quot; adds nothing of real use -- you could always drive and throw things at the same time; who really cares that now it's separate characters doing the two things? And &quot;Sunshine&quot; is one of the most overrated games ever.The lone Zelda title for GameCube (&quot;The Wind Waker&quot;) was an OK entry in that series, but nowhere near as good as its best (&quot;A Link to the Past,&quot; for SNES, and &quot;Ocarina of Time,&quot; for N64).&quot;Pikmin&quot; is a really innovative, cute and entertaining (if frustrating) game. But worth buying a console for? Not really.Practically all of the other worthwhile games for GameCube are also available for XBox and PS2 (&quot;SSX Tricky,&quot; &quot;SSX 3,&quot; the Simpsons games, &quot;Gauntlet: Dark Legacy,&quot; &quot;Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance,&quot; etc.) In addition, there are *lots* of games worth playing that are not available on Nintendo, like the Grand Theft Auto games (and many other adult-skewing titles).This was the first of the new consoles that I bought. I wish I had gone with a PS2 (which I eventually bought anyway). The siren song of Zelda lured me to Nintendo, but in the end, unless you're buying the system for a young child, you're better off with PS2 or XBox.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2003"}

Your teammates just don't stand around in the open looking stupid. Heck, you can even shoot thru certain types of obstacles to get a bad guy, like thin walls, or something like that.You have night vision, you've got help from a flying remote vehicle, you can place teammates anywhere you like, you can have your mates do some recon for you, you can even look thru your own team member's helmet cam for a different perspective on the battlefield.The CONS:GRENADES:It's almost impossible to have a grenade land where you want it to land. Which is why I love the SOCOM games so much, because, in SOCOM, you know exactly how hard to throw it, and you KNOW without a doubt, where the  grenade is going to land! In this game, it's guesswork, at best. And 9 times out of 10, you miss your targets....Which is a total waste of a good grenade!ENEMIES:Sometimes there are SO MANY bad guys at one time (in one concentrated area), it's a REAL CHALLENGE to get them all, unless you have a bazooka or something..... But, when there's 3000 bullets ripping your way, you sometimes can't even get a few shots out....Which is a bit annoying.HEALTH:While you can get help from a medic in this game, there's not much margin for error in terms of getting shot at...You better hide as often as possible....I guess it's just like real life, but, being a game, one would assume that even on an easy setting, that would change just a little bit??? But, it does not! So, be prepared for that when buying/playing this game.OVERALL:Other than those few bad points I have mentioned, it's a really fun game to play, it's very realistic, and has some pretty cool features...Let's face it, no game is perfect, and this game is no different, (and I still love my SOCOM games better) however, Ghost Recon 2 is certainly worth the price of admission, and probably the better (maybe the best) new military game thus far, for the PS3 game system!Chris","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2008"}

Oh My Yes","reviewText":"On the one hand, \"Halo 3: ODST\" isn't technically a stand-alone game:  it's an \"add-on\".  On the other hand, the distinction seems more like a way of saying, \"This one isn't as huge as Halo 3...but it still fairly well stands on its own\".  ODST's story dovetails around the events that take place in Halo 3, but unlike the other entries in the Halo series, you are not playing The Master Chief.  This time around instead of a SPARTAN you are an Orbital Drop Shock Trooper, or \"ODST\".  You are less armored, you have to be a bit more careful about your health, and you work more with your teammates.  Another interesting twist is that just as Halo 2 put together segments of story where you play another character, here you switch back and forth among the different characters in the story.  The flash-back/flash-forward way the events unfold can be confusing at times, but by the end it'll make sense as everything that happens comes to a head.The good news is, even if you're not as devastating to the enemy as The Master Chief, your ODST is still a very playable soldier.  While not gifted with a shield, you have a very nice heads-up display that looks a bit like the \"Detective Mode\" in Arkham Asylum:  it doesn't have the ability to see through walls, but it lights up a dark environment, outlines objects, and highlights friendlies and enemies in green and red.  You also have the ability to review objectives, replay audio logs, and look through a very nicely outlined 3D map, all projected across the glass of your helmet.  I thought it was a nice touch that doing these things in the heat of battle doesn't pause the game--if you want to check the map in a firefight, you'd better find cover first.Another nice touch in the single player campaign is that the enemies are a bit smarter:  rather than wait for you to come to them, they will actively chase you down.  They will try to flank you if they can, and they won't hesitate to hop into an empty turret or vehicle to come after you.  The single player campaign isn't as huge as, say, Halo 1.  However, ODST keeps all the multiplayer maps from Halo 3 and adds in three new ones, for those of you who enjoy online action.The single player story is fairly dark; you're walking through the ruins of a city that has been thoroughly invaded by the Covenant.  Empty plazas and burning wreckage seem to underscore the disaster aspect of the story (as do the many bodies scattered everywhere).  The story is propped up with some very good voice acting, including Nathan Fillion (Firefly, the TV Series/Serenity, the movie) and each member of the team you play through seems to have their own distinct personality.If you enjoyed the Halo series, consider this something to tide you over in between titles and you won't be disappointed.  The new character type isn't as enhanced as The SPARTANs, but I found the same amount of enjoyment to the gameplay.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2010"}

I love playing all the World War II games that are made for the PC.  I decided last week I had to get a Xbox 360 just to play Call of Duty 3 and Gears of War.  So I went to a local Gamestop and bought the Xbox 360 along with Call of Duty 3.  Gamestop didn't have Gears of War in yet.  I ended up getting Gears of War at Circuit City.Okay so I went home and I set up the Xbox 360 on my tv set and I put in Call of Duty 3 to play and I noticed the picture wasn't that good.  So I disconnected the Xbox 360 and I hooked it up to my PC flat screen monitor.  Boy, let me tell you something.  There was a huge difference in the quality of the picture.  I couldn't believe it.  And the sound was 100 times better. What is so cool is I can turn on my PC and my Xbox 360 at the same time and switch back and forth playing games from my PC and games from my Xbox 360 on the same PC flat screen monitor.  This is the best investment I ever made.Now my review just has to do with Single Player only.  Call of Duty 3 looks even better than Call of Duty 2 on the PC flat screen monitor. Call of Duty 3 is a great game that should have been made for the PC too.  The battles are very intense and very realistic.  The AI is very good.  Both Allies and German troops advance and retreat when they need to.  They both use cover very well.  It is so cool to fight in huge battles and have large number of troops from both sides fighting against each other.  It is especially cool when you have artillery shells exploding all around you while you are right in the middle of fighting a large battle.  The graphics are very good.  Call of Duty 3 has some the best looking grass and best looking water I've ever seen in a game.  I really like the storyline in the game.  This game is based on actual battles fought in France during the summer of 1944.  I can't wait for Call of Duty 4 to come out next year.

Others are saying that it takes too long to earn money to buy all the cars but that's the biggest improvement over Forza 4. When it takes little effort to earn cars there is no feeling of accomplishment or reward when you get new cars. With Forza 5, unless you are willing to pay out cash, getting all the cars is going to take time and effort.When others complain that there are few tracks, this is a valid complaint but not one I have. For me, I prefer quality over quantity. All the tracks from previous games have been redone and the improvement is obvious. For example, I never really enjoyed Laguna Seca because I thought it had too many visibility issues but in Forza 5 it is one of my favorites.The biggest improvement in Forza 5 are the drivatars. WIth Forza 4, the AI drivers were predictable and beating them was just a matter of learning how they move, but with Forza 5 the drivatars are unpredictable and act like human opponents.Rather than focus on the number of tracks or cars, just enjoy the game. If Forza had 500 cars people would be complaining that most were slight variations. If Forza had 100 tracks, people would mostly play the top 20 as they did on Forza 4.Forza 5 has plenty of cars and tracks to keep you more than busy until Forza 6.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000IMYKQ0","description":"The Wii Nunchuk controller is a secondary controller that adds even more innovation to the next generation of gaming, and does it all with less physical movement.Used in conjunction with the standard Wii remote, certain games need the Nunchuk controller for additional control options. Contoured perfectly to fit a player's hand,The Wii Nunchuk (left) connects directly to the Wii remote.View larger.the Nunchuk controller builds on the simplicity of the Wii Remote controller. The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.","reviewerName":"James A.

{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"Stephen Schultz \"S. S.\"","summary":"Let's Give A Round of Applause to Naughty Dog","reviewText":"I absolutely had a blast playing Uncharted 2. Everything about it was exceptional. The story, the acting, the puzzles, the combat, the music, the graphics. Everything. Uncharted 3 is no different. I thought that Naughty Dog may have reached the peak of their potential during Uncharted 2, but now I am sure that their peak is yet to come. Uncharted 3 is everything I wanted a game to be.While Lazarevic as the bad guy in Uncharted 2 will probably never be topped (he was the perfect bad guy with his deep voice and everything), many other things that I thought could never be topped were topped in Uncharted 3. The graphics are as realistic and vibrant as ever. Many times I can almost feel the sand hitting my face, but hopefully not the bullets! The physics are really good too. On the few levels with waves I was amazed at how real the water looked. The good ol' Uncharted crew is back and ready for more too. Expect more of those memorable lines that will have you laughing.I'll leave the details of the story for you to find out, but let me just say the search is for the Atlantis of the Sands and I was entertained along the many locations visited, such as Columbia, France, Syria, England, and more. As for the action, well it's better than ever. The hand-to-hand has undergone an upgrade, now enabling Nate to counter enemies and in some cases smash objects into their heads. All those trusty weapons that saved your butt before are back too. And they are just as fun to use. And Uncharted wouldn't be Uncharted if there weren't those super-close-I-can't-believe-Nate-just-did-that moments. Some of which take place in completely new and extremely fun locations like on a ship or on a plane. Just look at the cover of the game to get a hint of what happens to the plane (and it was fun to do, maybe the most fun part of the game)!Another thing Uncharted excels at is puzzles. They are back as well. And of course, Nate's little handy clue book is back to. The puzzles are not too hard and are always fun to crack. Some of them are very interesting. Oh a little side note here: you might want to think twice about getting this if you really hate spiders. That's all I'm going to say about that. And of course the music is great too. Heart pumping at times and pretty to listen to at others.Overall I give Uncharted 3 a 5/5. I was very pleased with this game. It even surpassed my expectations which were pretty high after playing the second installment. I would recommend this to any action and adventure loving gamer who is ready to beat the bad guy (and lady) and figure out the mystery. Great job Naughty Dog.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2013"}

You'll probably shed a tear. Bungie does a great job of pacing and variety and everything is very well put together.-Multiplayer is phenomenal. You can play in the tons of playlists casually, or for more competitive players, play the Arena in which you rank up in standing. Every month it resets with your current/highest standing on record.-Forgeworld is like nothing you've seen before; it makes Halo 3's Forge look like childs play. The map alone is so extremely massive that Bungie remade Blood Gulch and it was only a fraction of the map! You can do whatever you want and make anything you dream of, even flying fortresses. Upload them, become popular, etc. Invite your friends to help you make maps. The limit is endless.-Firefight! Now with Matchmaking, so you can be set up randomly with people against wave after wave of enemies. Then you have Versus Firefight, which is Firefight but with 2 opposing factions (you can be elite or spartan). Then you have customization firefight where you can make anything happen. Unlimited ammo, no physics, jump 20ft in the air, all skulls on (suicide practically), etc etc. It's such a blast to play.-Armory. You can customize your Spartan with hundreds of different armor pieces, all which you have to earn (be the correct rank) and pay for using in-game credits you earn playing campaign, firefight and matchmaking, or through completing daily and weekly \"challenges.\" Give him/her a unique color scheme and emblem to top it off and you'll never see a double of yourself! Elites have unlockable armor, too, based on their hierarchy.Theater - Award winning feature from Halo 3. Every match you play is recorded and you can view them anytime, at ANY ANGLE. From your own, from teammates, enemies, even a ghost cam: it's the perfect feature for a game like Halo where amazing/hilarious things happen all the time. Upload them, show everyone and become a \"Bungie favorite!\"There is SO much praise I can give this game and I can probably go on for a long time, so I'm trying to give you the gist of it.

I also worked in the industry of gaming. After having played dozens of modern games on all current gen systems I've began to lean toward classics to give me some gaming diversity and to experience historical gaming.As you may know Midway as a company does not exist now. They bankrupted sometime in 07 or 08 and the brand was eventually purchased by Warner Brothers who are now the owner and publisher of all Midway games. Until Midway went down Xbox Live had very nice versions of Midway games in digital download form. They were made by Digital Eclipse and were very nice. They always gave a perfectly emulated original game as well as newer and &#34;improved&#34; versions with higher definition art and backgrounds. These versions were taken off XBLA and for some time no one had access to Robotron 2084, Smash TV, Joust, etc etc.This collection of games is developed for WB by somewhat legendary developer Backbone Entertainment who made collections of Sega games and other retro games before. They are all well emulated versions of original games. They have good screen options and background selections, but the actual games are just identical original games. You do not get options to play any kind of &#34;improved&#34; or HD versions of the classic games. Just a lot of original games.I have to give this game 4 out of 5 because the original classics are all well done and emulated, have leaderboards, and decent controls. But since there are no improvements of any kind at all such as was done before by Digital Eclipse for XBLA a star has to be taken away.I had to get it because currently it is the only way to play Midway games on modern consoles.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2012"}

But then I played Ninja Gaiden II which in a strange way is even worse and yet I somehow improved on my skills. Sure I'm a long way off from Master Ninja but that's kind of the addicting factor and where the fun comes with Ninja Gaiden: the long trek to finally be good is worth it when you're slicing enemies left and right.Story: You play (mainly) as Ryu, a ninja in the Hayabusa clan. But when the village's sword is stolen, the maiden slain and you knocked out by the evil Doku, it's up to Ryu to get revenge and get the Dark Dragon Sword back. Occasionally you'll meet up with/play as Rachel, a well-endowed female with a big axe who's searching for her twin sister, Alma. The story at times is convoluted and a bit too familiar and I can just imagine the MIDI music playing during a text-cutscene whenever I read this story like in the old days but it works well enough though I wish there was more diverse environments.Graphics: The game is a remake of a remake since the original Ninja Gaiden was released on the Xbox and then an enhanced version was released a year later (!) called Ninja Gaiden Black. This is basically the same but it's been \"HD'd\". The character and enemy animations are smoother and crisper and the fluidity is constant. During cutscenes, everything's quite stylish though the more advanced looking cutscenes suffer from that frequent Team Ninja problem of having shiny, plastic-y looking characters.Only main problem is the backgrounds which, except for the first few chapters which look awesome (the first chapter, with falling leaves and colorful scenery is quite nice), are bland and there's the occasional screen tearing and \"Now Loading\" screens during exploration, combat and even opening up a chest despite the optional install. It feels like more time could've been used to make it seamless but having the game load just so you can open a chest just seems strange.Sound/Music: The music's rather inconsistent at times since some works like the more ambient stuff such as a Phendrana Drifts-esque piece from Metroid Prime during an ice level but then occasionally it hits us with turgid rock or bass-and-drums music with some electronica flourishes and it's like \"ugh\". Also, the voice acting at times is rather flat and 1996-ish in its delivery since it's either melodramatic to the point of distracting or it's so wooden, it's like they just said their lines and be done with it. That's why I love when developers add the option to switch to Japanese w/ English subtitles, makes it that much cooler. Odd how Ayane went from a young-sounding girl to a woman though.Gameplay: One issue I had with Ninja Gaiden II was that there was frequently parts that were almost put into the game because they sounded like fun but they didn't bother testing if it'll work. The original however is nearly flawless and aside from occasional platforming woes where Ryu misses his jump, doesn't climb up a ledge or camera goes out of control, the game never feels like \"okay, seriously, what the hell's with this part?\" Sure they'll add rocket launching baddies at you but they're more easier to evade than the 10-rocket firing punks from NG2. Sigma ultimately strikes that perfect balance between a difficult game by bad design and difficult that requires skill.Oh and you need to be skilled and fast because enemies right in the first level show no hesitation to cut you down. In fact I was surprised how much they kept running after me in this one whereas the sequel sometimes they'd stand still for a moment. While combos are built on combinations of button presses with the occasional direction input, the fluidity and just sheer fun of the combat is why these games are so highly regarded and why I consider it a funner combat system than the overrated God of War games and the so-so Devil May Cry ones. Blocking, evade and counterattacks are must and knowing the best moves are essential if you're going to get the most out of this. Speaking of which, best to learn the technique known as an \"on-landing charge\", it's incredibly effective.The big addition to the game is Rachel, a HEAVY-ily buxomed babe with a giant hammer who you play as in a couple of chapters. While I got used to her and could actually hold my own, she's more of a tank character, dishing big damage in small bursts but she's more slower and her combos don't really have the satisfying punch that Ryu's does. Other weird design choice is that you can find different hairstyles for her to wear. Not a bad game design idea mind you just...odd.If there is any woes with the game is that the camera is as usual, a little annoyance but not to the point NG2's camera was, the bane of all cameras right up there with Dino Crisis 3. Many times I had to re-adjust it in battle and in the heat of things, last thing you want to do is figure out where everybody is by just rotating the thing. Another issue is the platforming sections since they're a bit uneven and more than once did Ryu plummet to the bottom and have to repeat an entire section because he wallrunned up a wall rather than across it.While the difficulty can be initially off-putting and the platforming sections are nightmares, the fighting and flying across the screen to lop heads off is oh-so-satisfying and makes for one of the funnest and beautiful action titles on the Playstation 3...just watch your yelling and controller-throwing tendencies on this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2008"}

So I'm very disappointed. I believe that a new generation of consoles shows a better graphics quality and a higher processing speed. I have the Playstation 3 slim with over 30 games, including the entire series of Call of Duty, Battlefield, Batman, Uncharted and others. I have the Playstation 4 with only 3 games: Watch Dogs, InFamous Second Son and Killzone Shadow Fall. So I can compare these two consoles. So far, I have not seen the difference between the Playstation 3 and Playstation 4. I believe the graphic quality depends on the game. So I hope that new games present a better quality graphics. The Joystick of the Playstation 4 is larger and more comfortable than the joystick of the Playstation 3, but so far have not seen much use for the touch pad. However, for those who will buy a new video game, I recommend buying the Playstation 4, because I believe that the games that come out for it will be superior to games done for the Playstation 3.

{"product_name":"B00012TIW8","reviewerName":"Matthieu P. Raillard","summary":"Great single AND multiplay.  A rarity!","reviewText":"I had a love/hate relationship with the first Splinter Cell.  It was so infuriatingly hard at times that I actually put it down for a month before finally sitting down and beating it.  It was brilliant, but a bit flawed.  Pandora tomorrow addresses the majority of the gripes about the first, and adds a superb multiplayer that is sure to keep servers busy for months.GRAPHICS: A.  Superb.  The first one set the gold standard for console graphics, and this game does it again, although the improvement is less dramatic.  Stunning lighting effects and terrific animations make this an addictive simulation.SOUND/MUSIC: A-.  Very good, my only gripe is that they recycled a lot of the sounds from the first game (Sam's moan when he heals himself, the annoying alarm sound).CONTROLS: A.  If only every 3rd person game could control as well as this one.  The analog control makes skulking around in the shadows as easy as running full speed, and minute movements are faithfully reproduced.  Even climbing has been improved, although you still have to be positioned in front of a ladder, pipe, etc.GAMEPLAY: A/A-.  Terrific, gripping and realistic action.  The settings are dramatic and very varied, and the challenges you face are both fun and clever.  The only downside is that the game is still too linear, in that you can't just rapel down any wall, you must follow the more or less \"on rails\" path that the level designers have laid out for you.  There is more freedom than in the first game, but you're never really at a loss for where to go next.  Allowing individual creativity in approaching certain situations (infiltration missions, for example) would make this the perfect game.  The enemy intelligence is also a weak point, in that it's sometimes superhuman and can spot you in the dark, while at other times it will be dumber than a post.ONLINE: A.  Great fun, but only if you like online.  The cooperative mode is challenging and riveting, but like any multiplay over the internet, you will run into some jerks, prima donnas (and also great people).  Some people prefer this mode over the single play, some dislike it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2004"}

This one manages to have a new feel too it while doing a great job at keeping the nostalgic final fantasy feel. What's new is there are no longer random encounters and no battle screen to load. Instead your characters walk around among visable enemies that you can fight.The battle system is a lot like XI but much faster paced. The character development is controled by a licence grid in which you use licence points you gain from enemies to unlock certain abilities. I like this system because you feel like your characters are continually developing, however it doesn't take long to cover the majority of the licence grid and all your charaters end up about the same.Gambits are a cool addition that allow you to essentially preprogram responces to different situations. The down side is at times you just walk around and let the game take care of everything for you, against harder enemies you will still have to be involved though.The game is good enough to make you want to keep playing and the music is good too.

{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Sloopydrew","summary":"This handheld is horrible ...","reviewText":"What a disappointment. The Nintendo DS is something of a joke and now the PSP comes out and it's worse. The console's setup is simply ugly. When you glance at it, it looks fine, but why must there be buttons up and down the system -- with features that could just as easily be on a menu screen? And why is the system so fragile? And, lastly, why doesn't it work? I inserted a disc into the first PSP I bought and the machine spit it out, shattering the disc. I exchanged the game and the PSP, went home and experienced the DREADED dead pixels. With two broken PSPs, I decided to cut my losses (since I can't return the game) and return the system. The PSP did have potential, but it turned out all wrong. If Sony wanted it to work as an iPod, they should have included a bigger memory card. Does anyone feel like paying another $150.00 for memory, after paying $250.00 for a console? If Sony wanted to make a portable system, they should have gone with cartridges or flash memory (something the Nintendo DS got right). If they wanted it to play movies (the most unneeded feature ever seen in a portable GAMING system) -- they should gotten out of the gaming business and went into selling portable DVD players (bigger screens, better picture and they play the DVDs you already own). The proprietary game and movie discs -- which are grossly overpriced (the movies have no extras, the games are $20.00 more than DS or GBA games) -- burn the batteries out FAST. I played for just over 2 and a half hours when the batteries died (the pixels were dead from the beginning). Sony -- when are you going to get some quality control folks at HQ?!? A quarter of the PS2's first released were broken (including the first one I bought). The PSP is deja vu all over again. I'd like to say the Nintendo DS is a nice alternative, but with its HORRIBLE ergonomics (holding it with your left hand while trying to use the stylus with your right becomes painful after a few minutes) and lack of decent games, I just can't. Right now, I'd say hold off on both systems and stick to the Gameboy Advance. If you feel you MUST own a new handheld, I'd take the DS over the PSP, being that they both pretty much suck, but at least the DS is durable and isn't broken out of the box (and is $100.00 cheaper and $20.00 less per game title). Plus, the stylus on the DS makes for incredibly fun gameplay (when done right, which it rarely is) -- if you can handle the pain you'll be feeling in your hands and arms, after a few minutes. For comfort, I would have to give the PSP a higher rating than I'd give the DS. It wasn't bad to hold onto. If it actually worked and had some decent titles, it may even be a keeper. As things are, I'd say wait until November, when the new GameBoy comes out (rumor has it it will be able to play GameCube games directly) and pick one up. If you're still set on buying a PSP, I'd wait a few more months, until Sony gets them working properly. By that point, the price will have also dropped (I'm guessing they'll be $149.99 to compete with the next GameBoy's $99.99 price tag in November).","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2005"}

Its an added plus, that you can change the song for each level, so you can hear your favorite, which the first game didn't have. If you're ever in a bad mood, just play any song from this game.Buy I Love Katamari!

Fun wise, this game is pretty fun, the guns and shooting is good. Could have been a little better but good enough. Good choice and range of guns. Good choice of missions and they make sense etc. The single player I think is better than the multiplayer, I wasnt shocked when playing the multiplayer it isnt nothing.So get this ONLY, if you want a decent shooter, a game that is long enough, I RECOMMEND DEFINTAELY that you \"RENT\" this game first and foremost.

For those of you wondering I did not Beta test I simply got the game yesterday so my review is a little fresh from those who have been playing a while now. First off the Character Creation is one of the best for an MMO I have ever played. More options then most offline games these days. You start off with a prelude that explains both space and ground combat. Overall both feel thought out and fun to play. Unlike most MMO's this game is not one long boring grind. The missions I played all felt unique and for a first day player and were easy to navigate. Completing them isn't simple button mashing like some other MMO's, you need to use tactics and your crews abilities to have a fighting chance. Which brings me to my favorite part of the game... building your own crew.Your crew has as many customization options as your main player. Most Alien species are available for play, all with their own special abilities. (EX A Vulcan Tactical officer has different abilities then a Klingon Tactical Officer.) With the customization of your character, your crew and your ship you feel unique from everyone else.Overall this game has been fun to play and I see myself exploring the universe for quite a while. Its defiantly a change of pace from what's out there, if you are a Trek Fan this is a must play. Overall 4 stars because it won't be for everyone, but fun factor is defiantly 5 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2010"}

My plane just crashed over the ocean and now I'm stuck on this island in the middle of nowhere. There's only one palm tree bearing coconuts that I can't open and . . . what's this? A treasure chest? Let's see what is in it: A laptop with a copy of the game of Morrowind. Hmmm, well, I have nothing better to do, so I guess I'll try it out.Okay, I'm in the game now. What! I'm on another island! Albeit a MUCH bigger one. A bit too close to home right now, but ok. I think I'll create a character for this adventure that is good at stealing things because I could certainly use some items right about now.*back to reality*As you can see, if you were stranded on a little island in the middle of nowhere, this would be one game that you would want to play. Occasionally I think that people should beat the game in question before writing a review of it, but in the case of Morrowind, I think that prerequisite can slide. For one, yes, there is a main quest. But, like the Grand Theft Auto games, some of the most fun is had by doing whatever you want in this brave new world that is yours for the taking. You want to steal that book and sell it? Go right ahead. You want to be a law-abiding mage and use your magic to only defeat the forces of evil? Go right ahead! You want to try and climb this mountain, even though you honestly don't think you're ready for it or whatever may be on the other end of it? GO RIGHT AHEAD! I just love games that really put YOU in command and let you do things at your own pace.There really isn't much bad to say about Morrowind. The bartering system requires a bit of patience, sometimes you don't have the right skill or ability when you need it the most (opening level 100 locks, if you're not trying to cheat), and the unrealistic fact that if you hit a bald-headed NPC with a monstrous Claymore sword you sometimes fail to kill them in one hit (even though in real life the results would have been much more disastrous).But those are minor gripes. The bartering is only if you don't want to pay the asking price, there are cheat codes for about everything, and even though the combat is little more than frantic Left-Mouse button tapping, at least it is all in first-person real-time and not Turn-Based.*back to the island . . .*I don't know how long I've been on this island, playing this game.

I don't usually buy game when it first came out - I would either buy used games or wait for more than a year before I buy the new release.  After finishing the whole game, I can say the wait is very much worth it.The game is very well executed.  The story line is very interesting.  Most important of all, I had fun playing it.  While there are a lot of button-smashing during the fights, the gameplay is not difficult.  The story is quite linear, but there are side-goals that you can perform.  Most notably trying to solve Rildler's ridlers.  Instead of trying to solve all of them, I was so intuned with the game that I want to get to the end.The boss-fights are few and they are very easy to defeat.  I think it was more difficult beating the hordes of bad guys.  Sometimes you get up to 10 bad guys trying to pummel you.One of the best things about Batman in this game is that you could feel he is very human, not a hero with superpowers.  In his quest to capture Joker, Batman would be hurt along the way.  This is shown how Batman gets cuts and bruises on his face.  His Batman suit and cape get scratched and torn.This game is well made and definitely recommended to anyone who wants to play something different.  From what I heard the sequel is much better.  I guess I will wait for another year before I can play it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2011"}

It was a veritable glut of games and it was hard to pick out the winners from the losers. One game I remember coming out and wanting to buy was simply entitled God of War. I had no expectations on this game so I popped it in and was treated to a great storyline, pulse pounding action and the whole experience left me wanting more across the board. When the Playstation 3 came out I was stoked as I thought \"Yes! we are going to get a PS3 God of War game.\" But as time passed it seemed more and more unlikely that this game would be released. Now the time is at hand as God of War: Ascension has been released for the PS3 but is this game we have been waiting for?Ascension is set ten years before the original God of War game as you still play Kratos as it has been six months since you were tricked by Ares to murder your wife and child. Now you are put on this path to gain your revenge against Ares and break out of this prison that you were cast into. The gameplay is similar than the previous incarnations but there are twists and new additions to make gameplay more lively. First you can steal weapons from your opponents giving you countless numbers of combinations to inflict pain on your enemies. There are also new attacks as you can pummel enemies with your fists, sling them around these new environments or unlock various minigames where you will dish out pain and blood on your foes. The graphics for this game are gorgeous as we finally get to see a God of War game on the PS3.But the main difference between this and any other previous God of War titles is that this has multiplayer options. Yep, you heard right there are four multiplayer modes as you try to garner the favor of four gods (Poseidon, Hades, Zeus or Ares) and each of these gods gives you a different fighting style. As you win matches in multiplayer you will gain xp, weapons, armor and relics that are different in the single player campaign.So to sum it up you're getting a new God of War game on the PS3 with 4 multiplayer modes and a ton of unlockables? Sign me up! This is going to be one of the best God of War games to date.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

The curse that plauges movie tie in games that makes them awful to anyone but the most devoted fans.  Seeing the pictures of this game early in development, if finially seemed that it would break that curse.  Did it?  Well, yes, but just barley.The Two towers starts off very well, using the prolouge footage from the first movie to tell the story of the ring.  When we get to the battle of Mount Doom, you take on the role of Isildiur fighting orcs, and trying to stay alive.  This scene does a good job of introducing the player to the concepts of gameplay, such as fierce attack, and the vital parry move.  After that, you play as Aragorn on Weathertop, wielding off the Ringwraiths and protecting Frodo.  Here, you must learn the Parry move, which will save you... many times over.  Then the game goes into full swing, and the action begins.The Gameplay for the Two Towers is pure hack-n-slash.  you go through a linear path, hacking up enimies, and...well...uh... hacking up more enimies!  After the level is over, you are given points that you can spend to purchuse new skills and combos, along with other things such as more health, and better bows and arrows.  The game does very well in this section.The graphics and sound are easily the high point of the game.  The visuals are top notch, and the charachters are very detailed.  They look exactly like thier movie counterparts (Except for Gimli during the FMV scenes).  They also sound like thier movie counterparts because they are voiced by the real actors.  Every actor (Except for Christopher Lee) did voice work for thier digital selves, and it adds a really big bounous that lends an air of authenticity to the game.  Another big bonous is the cool factor that comes in when re-playing the scenes from the movies, such as Balins tomb, Aragorn vs. Lurtz (Or, you can do Legolas vs. Lurtz, or Gimli vs. Lurtz, or Secret charachter vs. Lurtz) and of course, Helms deep.Unfortunitly, the two towers did not escape \"The Curse\" entirely.  My biggest gripe with the game is the very thing that makes it a brawler,The combos.  Combos are a string of moves strung togethor to kill enimies fast, and get more experience points.  For example, to do Isildiurs/Balins/Elronds swift terror, you would rapidly tap, X,X, triangle to do a damaging attack that would good damage.  However, as the game goes on, the game, in a sense, forces you to use combos to meerly survive.  When you reach Helms deep, you have to use every combo in your arsenal to move on, and frankly, its a pain...to memorize all these combos (On a side note, it is possible to finsih the game with a minimal amount of combos, its just very very hard).  Also, some of them dont work very well, if at all.  One attack has you strike your enemy, then charge forward to knock him down, and then finish him off.  3/4 of the time, I rush forward and stab my blades into the ground, while my intended victim slashes me to the ground.  If you get hit while you are in the midst of a combo, it ruins it and you have to start over.Some of the later levels are a pain ...to get through.  The last last level in the game is really hard, but conquerable.  The trick is to shoot ALL the archers before resuming fighitng.Other little niggies.  Where are the other hobbits?  Frodo is the only hobbit to appear in the game, so Sam, Merry, and Pippin are completly absent, aside from Merry and Pippin in a movie scene.  All the charachters seem to move a little too fast, and some voice work of Gandalf seems a bit...off.But I dont want to paint an excessivly poor picture of this game.  Its a blast to play, and a lot of fun.  The DVD style extras are very cool, such as the actors talking about the game (John-rhies-Davies (Gimli) is probobly the neatest one).  There is also a secret charachter to unlock (Who is pretty cool).  And the cheat codes are nice.  Probobly my favorite feature is (WARNING: GO NO FURTHER IF YOU WANT A FUNNY SUPRISE REVEALED) the mini enemy cheat code.  Whenever I feel sad or depressed, turning on this code shrinks all the eniemes to absoloutly tiny size, and brightens my day.  Its absoloutly hilarious to see goblins that are 12 inches tall, Uruk-Hi two feet tall, Wargs the size of Chiwalwas,trolls, who are absoloutly gut bustingly funny, and funniest of all, the ringwraiths!  And wait untill you see Lurtz boss battle! (END SPOILER).Overall, this game is great for Lord of the rings fans, but If you hate stringing togethor combos like I do, I recommend renting it first.The good:Superb graphics and soundfun gameplayneat levelscool extrasa certian hilarious cheat codeThe not so good:People who do not like stringing togethor combos will not like this game so muchsometimes a bit too hardcharachters move a little too fastLurtz appears to give you \"The finger\" in a cut scene","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2003"}

The cutscenes are amazing, had they been a movie I would have seen it. They really do bring you into the story, and you feel like you know the characters.

A ferocious race, now extinct, has left behind relics of their once powerful warrior culture. Now bounty hunters from across the galaxy are racing against each other in order to lay claim to these relics hoping to harness their power for themselves. It's the race of a lifetime, as you guide Samus to the relics before other hunters can reach them - and use them on her.","reviewerName":"Lestor neeker Wong","summary":"Samus and the Shooting Stars","reviewText":"A good First-Person Shooter on the Nintendo DS may sound like an April's Fool joke, but Metroid Prime: Hunters is definitely more than just that. The game is one of the very few in the DS' library that can rival Nintendo's competitor (namely, Sony) when it comes to graphical presentations on a handheld. Add in an ass-kicking multiplayer mode, and the potential to appeal to mainstream gamers ensues.Butt-kicking Bounty Hunter Samus Aran returns to star in this action-packed adventure. This time round, Samus is in an area called the Alimbic Cluster, and she's on a quest to locate eight \"octolyths\" (whatever that is) scattered across various planets in the cluster itself. The purpose? A powerful energy source is hidden in the Alimbic Cluster, and it's believed that the octolyths will hold to the key in unlocking it. Here begins a journey for Samus to unearth the mystery.The DS works neither like a computer keyboard nor a console controller with analog sticks, so it's understandable for potential players of Metroid Prime: Hunters to be concerned about how the game actually plays. Seasoned First-Person Shooter players may want to know that traditional FPS controls do not apply for this particular game. Replacing the norm is the default stylus method of controlling the game. You'll get to aim by touching the (duh) touch screen, move around by using either the D-Pad or the four alphabetical buttons (depending on whether you're left or right-handed), and shoot using the shoulder buttons (again, depending on your written orientation). Awkward while this may sound, it actually works out pretty well, especially when you get used to it. The only downfall of this system is that you can't exactly time your jumps to perfection, since you'd have to utilize the touch screen (by double-tapping) to do so.You can always switch to a more conventional mode of controlling if you prefer, which uses the D-pad and buttons for common actions like moving, aiming and shooting (depending once again on whether you're left or right-handed), and the shoulder buttons for jumping. Aiming is, however, greatly discounted with this form of control. As a result, you may find yourself switching back to the stylus-based controls over time, since they offer better fluidity. Regardless of which method you favour, however, be prepared to get your fingers cramped, since the learning process is rather steep.In the single player mode, Metroid Prime: Hunters is a relatively short and linear adventure. Unlike the classic Metroid games that involve plenty of exploration and platforming, this one basically runs you through four areas and a handful of levels along the way. There're some puzzles to solve, some back-tracking to do, and yes, some bosses to fight even with the limited number of levels. But some of these battles are painfully repetitive, since they're basically recycled from earlier bosses. Don't be surprised if you find yourself taking on the same old buggers over and over again, just because the developer got lazy. Thankfully, you'll still have to take on rival Bounty Hunters in some levels, which at least spice things up a bit. Beating rival hunters also allows you to unlock them in the multiplayer mode - you'll begin with three hunters in your roster (including Samus), but the more is obviously the merrier when you attempt to take on the world.On the topic of multiplayer mode, this is where the game really shines. You can host a game for up to four players with a single cartridge, although your options will be rather limited - you can only play the standard battle mode, and all four players can only play as Samus. When you play with others who have their own cartridge, the situation becomes more exciting. You can play as any of the rival hunters that you've defeated in your single player mode, and with this, utilize their weapons and execute their specific moves as well. This applies also for the online play via Wi-Fi, but the usual need for Friends' Codes slows down the searching process a little. When you play a multi-cartridge or an online game, the number of options greatly increases. In fact, you'll find yourself battling in no less than seven game modes, ensuring that the action are more varied and exciting. The game also does well in providing your usual online stats like number of games played, number of opponents killed and the likes. This is standard fare, but seeing the body count increasing by the day is motivation enough for you to spend hours on the game.Metroid Prime: Hunters' presentation provides a high level of involvement for the player, which is always welcomed in a video game. I mentioned earlier, the graphics in Hunters are among the best that you can find on the DS.  You'll get to access various locales over the course of the game, and the details on these places are all pretty outstanding. The game throws in a fair amount of cut-scenes, and the animations are great to look at. In some of these cut-scenes, the action could even span both screens on the DS (and at times, show you different angels of the area on both screens). These create a rather picturesque experience, and add more brownies points for the game's presentation. The audios are also top-notch well, incorporating the action with some solid music and great special effects.On the whole, Metroid Prime: Hunters deliver an immersive FPS experience for its players. The controls may take some getting used to, but the fun really begins once you find yourself acquainted. The single player mode is rather poor though, and remains its major weakness despite its excellent multiplayer and online modes. For players who seldom, or couldn't go online, the value of the game greatly decreases. Still, as Metroid Prime's first venture onto the DS, the game scores brilliantly, and will no doubt be a classic on its own in time to come.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00149ILDO","reviewerName":"SnS \"&#34;Those are my principles and if you ...","summary":"Impressive, But Not Without Its Flaws","reviewText":"Honestly, I wasn't going to get this game.  Between my contempt for EA and a general feeling of \"been there\" with sandbox games, I was expecting this game to be a horrible rip-off of GTA.  However, after a great deal of procrastinating, I rented this from Gamefly and wound up keeping it.  Here's why:The world is pretty massive.  It doesn't all take place in Paris.  In fact the map consists of Paris, the countryside and other villages and towns all connected to each other and, I might add, with no load times going from place to place.  Not only is it massive, but the graphics are pretty darn good.  While not great by the standars of what has been released, they are good enough for PS3 standards and manage to look crisp (as long as you don't look too closely during cut scenes).  I am willing to forgive even mediocre graphics in exchange for a game this large without waiting for loads in free roam.  As touched on in other reviews as well, the Sin City treatment to occupied Paris is a nice artsy flair to what may have otherwise been the same ole song and dance. To further add to the fun, the hero is well voiced with a few rather funny things being said (\"It's fun, but it's murder on me hands\" while zipping down a wire bare-handed for example).  There is a bit of swearing and nudity, but if you're a mature gamer, then these shouldn't be deal breakers.The game, while repetitive, manages to keep things pretty fresh.  Yes, the bulk of your quests involve going to point A, destroy object/free person, escape the aftermath.  However, the ability to go in guns blazing or sneaking in allows you to play each quest as you like.  However, the stealth aspect of the game is rather annoying at times since, even walking slowly, you are forced to give enemies a WIDE berth.  For them being so slick to pick you out of your disguise in short order, they are pretty stupid at the same time.  Typically, you can shoot, raise an alarm, retreat back out of range, go back to the same spot and repeat.  If they wanted the AI dumb then make it universally dumb and don't give us restrictions on how close we can walk.  Aside from this problem, however, quests are pretty fun and easy enough to figure out even on higher difficulties, but not without some retries.  Controls can be a bit fussy, but nothing you can't eventually get accustomed to.  Still, even after getting my bearings, there have been a few times where my character did something that I had no intention of doing.There are quite a bit of GTA rip-offs including car collecting.  It's fun, but as is always the case you are at the mercy of the game if it decides to randomly place the vehicle you need in front of you.  However, Pandemic managed to make it still fun and enjoyable.  Combine this with the thousand or so free roam objects to find and/or destroy and you can enjoy yourself for a few hours without doing a single quest.The perks are a great addition and give you something to strive for.  However, as is the case with many EA games, they give you the ability to buy your perks instead of earning them.  While not cheap, it does lessen the pride you receive for earning a perk on your own.  Be that as it may though, the system is well conceived and gives you that little extra push to experiment with different weapons.In short, especially now that the game has been out and come down in price, anyone looking at these reviews should not hesitate to pick this game up.  The artwork combined with a solid gameplay mechanic makes this an easy bargain choice.  Make no mistake, if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Rockstar should be blushing with pride.  Vive la Resistance.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2010"}

You die from poor jumping mechanics all the time there are no infinite portals so it makes you restart the whole level  over and over and over...blahThe campaign is only 2 hours long for $59.99??level building is a real time consuming pain and unless you have tons of time and patients they wont be fun or work right.The community offers some fun levels but for every good one there about about 10,000 bad ones and they is no way to mark the ones you don't like so you will often reload those poor levels people make and the loads times are killer. In one hour you may be lucky to find one good level and will spend the rest loading and frustrated being stuck on some poor design level.Playing together also doesn't work well , if one of your friends goes off screen its over they auto death and that's it... Nicecamera angle problems.Had they offered some infinite spawning portals for kids ages it would have been much better. My kids have beat Dragons Age, Metal gear but they cant come close to playing this game and just don't have the patients to spend 90% of the time reloading.In the next version (LBP2) they promised to address some of theses issues. In the mean time pick it up for 10$ or rent it.Recommended for rental first.This game can still be a lot of fun to play muti-player, when it works well it is fantastic!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2010"}

Movie mogul, talent spotter or film director. You can be one or you can be all three. That's the magic ofThe Movies.","reviewerName":"Andrew C.","summary":"Fantastic idea ... good execution","reviewText":"The concept behind this game--make your own movies--is brilliant. And fortunately, there is enough material that comes with the game to make a wide variety of productions. The tools available in the \"sandbox\" mode of the game are fairly simple to use and allow for a lot of creative expression. The story mode of the game, while interesting for a few hours, is actually the weak link. But I assume that the average person will buy this game for the movie-making ability, so the story mode's limitations are fairly easy to look over.Gameplay: There are two gameplay modes: story mode and sandbox. The story mode starts you off in the 1920s as an up-and-coming studio manager. You are responsible for building up your studio lot with various buildings, sets, decorations, pathways, and so forth. Also, you have to staff the studio with builders, janitors, crew members, researchers, directors, and, of course, actors. This has to be done on a budget, so you'll have to manage your money wisely. The overall goal is to produce films that gain experience for your actors and directors, get good ratings, and receive awards (which are given out every 5 years). As you manage your studio over time, new costumes, sets, and props become available allowing for a greater diversity of artistic creations.Overall, the story mode serves as a very long tutorial for the sandbox mode. Some people will be put off by the tedious nature of the story-mode gameplay. Much of your time will be spend on micromanaging actors' attitudes, repairing buildings, hunting for new recruits, and the like. After about 3 hours, it really can get mentally numbing. However, the developers of the game made playing the story mode necessary, since you can only have access to certain props, sets, and costumes in the sandbox by playing through the story mode.  Thus, expect to play through 20 hours of the story mode before unlocking all of the sets and other things.The sandbox is really where the game shines. This is where you can make your own movies. Rather surprisingly, the process is quite straightforward. The tutorials and in-game instructions are very good, and there are tons of scenes, props, costumes, and other times. A very nice element of the game is the star-maker program, which allows you to model the face and appearance your actors. Movies can be as simple (and rough) as you want or as sophisticated (and time-consuming) as you desire. In essence, you create a movie by stringing together pre-set scenes which you can change in a number of ways, including length, intensity, lighting, weather, subtitles, actor positions and expressions, and so forth. You can even add voices and music if you'd like. There are some limitations. For example, you don't have full control over camera angles, and you can't determine precisely where an actor will be in a scene (you have a few pre-set options). Still, there is an incredible amount of potential in the tools and material that you do have available. To get a sense of the possibilities, take a look at some of the 4- and 5-star movies at [...]Grapics: The visuals are good overall. The actors do have a somewhat cartoonish quality about them and can seem awkward on occasion.  Still, there's nothing quite like seeing an actor, whom you just spent a half hour creating in the star-maker program, walk into a scene. It's really a magical gaming moment. The sets look pretty good, as well as the props. Also, the scenes and technologies seem appropriate to each era of film-making. I wish that the game had a mini-map for your studio lot, so that you could instantly jump to a particular building (instead of having to scroll there). Also, the lot should have been expandable, since you'll have it covered with buildings in no time. Still, the graphics are good enough to allow for some fairly immersive gameplay.Sound: All of the music is good and appropriate, from the music played during game installation to the in-game tunes. There is some voice acting in the game, but not among the actors themselves. There are a number of sound effects that can be added to movies. Also, you can add your own voices, music, and effects.Replayability/Technical elements: The game has huge replayability. No two people will experience it the same way, at least not in the sandbox mode. You are largely limited by only your imagination. The instruction manual is pretty good, and the in-game tutorials and instructions are great. If you want to jump into the game, you could figure it out fairly quickly. The game seems well polished, even slick in its presentation. It did crash on me once, but only after a 8+ hour session (you can save all of your film work, sets, actors, etc.). There is a patch available, which I recommend.Overall, I thought that this was a worthwhile purchase. The story mode could have been better, but the sandbox mode easily makes up for it. If you are interested in a game that allows you to direct, cast, and produce a movie, this is it. It's not perfect, but it does generally fulfill its promise. I hope that there is an expansion forthcoming which add more props, costumes, sets, and the like, along with better control of the camera.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2006"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Sonic the way he should be","reviewText":"There are some things that are just better in 2-D.  Castlevania, Street Fighter, and Contra are prime examples of this, but perhaps there is no other series that is best in it's 2-D roots than Sonic the Hedgehog.  With Sonic Rush on the DS, the blue colored hedgehog is back in his 2-D glory as Sonic Rush utilizes both screens as you bolt through the levels at break neck speeds with all the classic elements you'd expect from a Sonic game: tons of rings and enemies, loop de loops, bouncing springs, and so on.  You can play as Sonic or new character Blaze the Cat as you take on Dr. Robotnik (he's refered to as Eggman more and more these days, but he'll always be Dr. Robotnik to me), but there's not much difference between the two heroes, which you'll notice as you progress through the game.  Since the game goes at such a break neck pace, it's easy to miss something you're supposed to grab on to or bounce off of, which can lead to many deaths unless you memorize the area.  This hurts the overall gameplay aspect of Sonic Rush, but the fact that this is a new Sonic game in all his classic 2-D glory more than makes up for it.  It's intense and fun, and for DS owners who had a soft spot for Sega and want some classic action on the go, Sonic Rush deserves to be picked up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2006"}

One review complained that rally racing should be point to point and not racer against racer. If that is what you want Dirt 2 still provides that with time trials and the staggered start races are a compramise that gives you that to a degree. I think the handling of the cars is great and the varied locations are an improvment over the original.

While the game has under gone a drastic amount of changes is it enough for this game to stand on, or have the changes made done nothing but sink the ship? In short a bit of both! Dungeon Siege 3 simplifies the experience and gears the entire game for console users essentially putting the PC experience on the back burner. In doing so gone are the micro managing of your comrades, a basic inventory system with a very basic leveling system that does little to promote individual variety(you eventually unlock everything).Still what we have here is a solid game that will not be a disappointment to the Hack & Slash RPG fans of ye olde day such as Diablo, Titan Quest, etc.GAMEPLAYWhat can I say.. it is a hack n' slash RPG. Be prepared to go through dungeons grinding away on mobs and collecting loot! Dungeon Siege 3 does not disappoint in this category. It brings lots of gameplay something crucial to any video game; especially a hack and slash type. You have a choice of 4 pre-made characters which of course breaks down into typical Warrior, Caster, Rogue etc. When not in dungeons you will be visiting towns to buy and sell goods, pick up some simple quests that are not to bad to complete, and of course continue the storyline. It is fairly simple but gets the job done. Dungeons are varied as are the types of mobs you encounter so things get changed up enough to not get boring. Throw in a variety of difficulty levels and drop-in/out co-op and you have a pretty solid gameplay experience.Combat is handled exceptionally well I feel for a hack & slash on a console. Your main attack and 3 skills are bound to your attack buttons while blocking and your stances are controlled via the shoulder/trigger buttons. During mid-combat with the warrior-type lets say, a bunch of trash rushes you just switch to a 2-handed stance and hack away. By doing this you open up your 2 Handed skills. Middle of the fight a boss mob comes in you can just switch, on the fly, back to a sword/shield stance and of course unlock 1 handed skills. You can map 3 skills per stance which makes you have to choice between the available skills per stance. Toss in Proficiencies, which add some customization to the skills by allowing you to pick a perk for that skill, and you have a simple yet somewhat diverse set of skills. While it is no Diablo or Titan Quest in skill variety and customization it keeps it very simple.GRAPHICSThe game looks pretty good on the console. I have not checked it out on the PC but it is a very pretty game. The fire effects aren't bad and the variety of colors and effects for your skills are awesome. By no means is this a perfect engine here but it has graphical appeal and does help to make the world a bit more recognizable. I did notice some slow down on the PS3 version when I was looking awkwardly at fire with the camera, but I tend to try and kill the frame-rates on purpose at times. Combat however was very smooth and I noticed no difference between the PS3 or 360 versions when it came to the FPS during combat or cut-scenes.SOUND/STORYThe effects and sound track here aren't bad. I would say average. Nothing special to talk about but the voice acting I would say is sub-par. Many times it seemed as is the actors/actresses really did not care much about their lines. This puts a damper on the already boring storyline. Yes there is a storyline here for a Hack & Slash! A detailed storyline to boot! Problem is I found the storyline incredibly boring and uninteresting. A lot of it had to do with the dialogue as it really didn't sell you on the story. Still there is some meat here to give purpose to your adventure.REPLAY/LENGTHWhat good is a hack & slash without replay!? Well this game boasts some solid replay value if you are up for it. Where as past Hack and Slash games I have played allow you to continue on harder difficulties with your existing loot... not the case here. There is no Game+ feature here. Instead you just start a new difficulty from square one again. Replay value will come down to simple trophy/achievement collecting, simple enjoyment of the game and of course Co-Op. The game itself took me around 13-15 hours to complete on my play-through; and I have yet to replay it on another difficulty since nothing carries over.*** CO-OP FEATURES *** ( 4 player ONLINE support, no LAN support, 2 player LOCAL co-op )A crucial part of this game that people have been getting confused about. Co-Op works very strange in this game and while it does work.. it doesn't at the same time. Much like how the game really simplified the elements almost to a fault, the Co-Op was simplified far past a fault. Not only is there a lack of Game+ here, but Co-Op works fairly backwards for a game of this type. If you hop into a game online or with your friend only, your SP character WILL NOT be used. No progress you make with your friend/PUG will carry to your account. You are simply there for moral support you could say. To make things worse, even if you are doing Co-Op on different accounts (like a 4 player PUG group) the host is who the camera centers on. Meaning you are locked into the hosts camera frame. While this just takes time to get used to, it seems like a colossal step backwards compared to previous hack&slash; titles. The overall Co-Op experience can be a lot of fun if you put aside gear, level and just work as a team to have some fun.OVERALL 73% (7.3) .. CDungeon Siege 3 is not a bad game by any means. It simplified the Hack & Slash elements to suit the console but in doing so it over-simplified the elements down to a no-brainer. While perhaps a disappointment at first glance Dungeon Siege 3 still brings gameplay to the table and lots of it. There is plenty to do here, and despite a slightly simplified dungeon design you still have tons of baddies to plow through and loads of loot to gather.A weak inventory system holds it back as does the Co-Op method used by the game but still... this is the kind of game Hack and Slash fans have been craving for a long time. It is a fresh change of pace for the genre despite being simplified. While not a full-price for some, it is a game worth picking up if you are a fan of the genre. The flaws in DS3's armor are not bad enough to ruin the game but it might leave a sour taste if you set expectations to high.**NOTE: I was disappointed with the absence of SET items.  However with no real game+ mode, and a 10-15 hr campaign it is understandable why they were probably absent","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2011"}

Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"Machinegun and chainsaw:  two great tastes that go great together","reviewText":"I've beaten the campaign mode of Gears of War 2 (GOW2) on hardcore and I play multiplayer regularly on Wednesday nights (friend Talien if you're interested).  I switched from our Halo 3 weekly games, so I will use that as a point of comparison.The campaign is great.  GOW2 fixed a lot of things you wanted to do before, like taking on a chainsaw with another chainsaw, holding someone hostage, fighting Reavers and even Brumaks, drive tanks, and more.  More importantly, Dom's quest to find his wife adds pathos to a brutally violent game - pathos, I might add, that was so heavily hyped in Halo's campaign but never really pulled off.  That's the difference between having a faceless protagonist and a character that's fleshed out through flashbacks.  Through his heartbreaking quest to find his wife, Dom comes to life.  It reminds us of the human cost of war, and helps take the edge off the endless macho posturing of four hugely juiced combat gorillas in armor.There's also some weird plot involving Lambent Locusts, a revolution, an awfully humanoid-looking hottie of a Locust queen, Marcus Fenix's father, a computer gone mad, and the sinking of Jacinto. Mind you, I thought we were supposed to save Jacinto, not sink it; once it becomes clear that it would hurt the Locusts more by destroying it, the COGs seem to do the job on behalf of the bad guys.  But those are minor quibbles and more than made up for the fact that the action is relentless, a pace difficult to keep up even in first-person shooters.There are flaws in the campaign.  If I never play another rail game again in a multiplayer, I would be happy.  GOW2 also forces some button-mashing battles that are very different from the normal run-and-gun tactics that are part-and-parcel of the rest of the game.  From a cinematic perspective this is great; from someone who just likes to shoot stuff, it can get frustrating.The multiplayer is where GOW2 really excels.  It's like a bloodstained Santa showed up and gave us everything we ever wanted that was missing in GOW. Want to be able to play with up to ten people?  Check.  Want to be able to just fight wave after wave of Horde cooperatively?  Check.  Want to play against computer-controlled opponents in multiplayer until you can fill the slots?

Dotzler \"Kasaru\"","summary":"Absolutely amazing!","reviewText":"I know this game came out almost a year ago, but I just picked it up a little more than a month ago, and  I just cannot put it down! I've already gotten a platinum trophy, which was a little too easy, and I started a new game, and it just hasn't lost its charm! Its brilliant! For the record, I'm not a big fan of RPG's, especially Eastern RPG's (I know its a Western, just saying), but this game is most definitely one of my favorite games. The fun of it is just addicting.The gameplay is solid, as I said before, not a big RPG gamer, so I don't have much to base things off, but the graphics are obviously top notch, and PS3 is the most inferior version... which brings me to the fact of the various bugs and glitches. There are plenty of graphical glitches, mainly unfinished mountain textures, where you can see right through the map, or character glitches, such as with various Companions that will not go away. Some of the glitches are game breaking, and destroy the fun of the game, but I think not all too much a big problem.The mechanics in Skyrim make it the most immersive game I have ever played, in the sense of game time. I easily put in about 100 hours of the first week I got it, which is bad I know, and within the next week, beat the game and received the Platinum trophy. Even on my second and even third playthroughs, I am seeing new things, encountering new NPC's... it seems this game has endless things to offer.Gameplay is great. Weapons, Apparel, Potions, Food, Ingredients, Books, Scrolls, etc... all easy to access and use. I am not a big fan of the favorites option, so I don't use it, but I'm sure its a big plus to someone else. I really like the leveling up system, but some things are too hard to level up, such as Smithing and Alchemy, and some are far too easy, such as Armor and Weapons. I found myself at 100 Archery in just about no time. However, trying to reach level 60 for Smithing is such a chore, and drains me of all my money. Nothing major to report in that sense, but there are some things that could be changed.Skyrim is a large open world game, which I found to be almost too big. I hardly ever use horses, but when I do, I noticed just how glitchy and horrible the animations for navigating tough terrain is. However, horses are much better at climbing than your character, which is more than odd. I don't like that you can't kill certain characters... if you kill a character, it should be on you and you just won't be able to do the mission, or whatever else reason you can't kill them. I am also sick of walking into a city and a vampire, and everyone immediately attacking. Wearing full steel plate armor... how do they know if I'm a vampire? Also, invisibility is just about pointless, people attack you and detect you as if you weren't invisible at all. Like I said, nothing absolutely game breaking, just some annoying mechanics that should be fixed.All in all, Skyrim is one of the best games I have played, and the best RPG I have played, and most definitely deserves your time, perhaps on a better platform, such as PC, where there are numerous mods that enhance the gameplay even further. Skyrim is awesome... buy it now!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2012"}

Skyrim's framerate has a tendency to fall off a cliff.  When it does this I reset my machine.  I also disabled all autosaving.  My save file is over 8GB and It's totally playable for the MOST part.  FYI, Bethesda will be releasing patch 1.4 later this month which they allege will fix the lag-due-to-save file size glitch.The game itself is nothing short of epic.  It's massive.  And what's better is that it's a massive sandbox game.  Want to be a valiant member of the Imperial Legion, the College of Winterhold (mages guild), or The Companions?  Go for it.  Want to be a member of the Thieves Guild or the Dark Brotherhood (assassins)?  Go for it.You can dungeon dive to your heart's content or follow the main quest.You can be a pure warrior who is skilled with a sword and shield and wears heavy armor...Or you can be a pure mage who prefers robes, can conjure powerful minions to fight for you and unleash deadly flames or bitter cold on your enemy.Or a thief who can pick any lock (or pocket), and has built up his sneak skill to the point where he can access the crazy stealth attack perks (15x damage on sneak attacks FTW!) and dual wields Daedric DaggersOr a hybrid....A Battlemage who is skilled with a sword and can also toss a fireball at a moment's notice.A Stealthmage who uses illusion spells like Muffle and Invisibility to get the drop on his opponents.Whatever you want to be, you aren't confined to a certain kind of character.  Your character grows based on your tendencies so you can be what you want.Skyrim is probably the best game I played in 2011.  That's saying something because 2011 was a heck of a year for gaming.

The attention to accuracy is exceptional and the sense of isolation and dread this game invokes in the right environment is downright creepy.  Wii graphics have rarely looked better particularly the climbing scnes and a big plus for me is the excellent sound design throughout.  The controls are not broken nor butter smooth just functional and implemented to push you down a fairly linear story that dodges, and weaves, and satisfies.  I am surprised to find a game like this on the Wii as the market for titles with this much reading, factual history, and introspection required of its participants is almost microscopic.

The mail system to unlock certain secrets also gives the NPCs a little more depth.  However, despite SquareEnix's effort, there just isn't enough character development to get us really attached to these characters.  Although, that isn't to say that this is a bad game.  There's just enough story to get you to move onto the next dungeon, which brings me to my next point.Money is scarce in this game, so you'll find yourself exploring and fighting a lot.  It might seem like a dungeon crawl or level grind at first, but when you start to get different classes to play with, there's actually a fair amount of depth and customization that you can do with your party.  You'll spend a lot of time leveling up a job to see if you like its abilities and if it works well with the other party members' job abilities.Also, the new camera system lets you zoom in to find hidden switches and treasures.  This really helps keep your trips into dungeons interesting.Finding new weapons and armor is always a treat, and the game definitely delivers on that front.  As you progress, you're given a pretty constant stream of decent \"loot.\"  The weapons and armor that you find will also help you decide which jobs you want in your party and force you to reconsider certain jobs.There's enough to do keep you busy for at least 30 hours, which is pretty impressive for a handheld game.  Overall, I consider FF3 DS a good game and would recommend it to anyone who likes Final Fantasy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2007"}

MUCH OF IT IS RECYCLED FROM SAINTS ROW 3.","reviewText":"Saints Row 4 is the best job of game recycling ever with maybe the exception of the Dead Space franchise they are geniuses at recycling visuals.  Saints Row 4 is a very nice game.  The cars drive extremely well.  I stay away from the sports cars myself they are way too temperamental for a guy with the reflexes of Alice The Goon!  The graphics are very nice.  The sixteen bit modes were a kewl tribute to gaming of yesteryear and did not go on too long. The villain in Saints Row 4 is without honor so do not believe a thing he says.  I found the motorcyles hard to ride but other than that nice.  The streets of fictional Steelport looked even better in some ways than in Saints Row 3.  I share the opinion that there are far fewer makes and models of cars in Saints Row 4 than in were in Saints Row 3.  Also there are fewer variations of pedestrians on the streets.  I know that Steelport is a blue collar town but the fact that all the older dudes walk around in yellow plastic safety helmets and work vests strains credibility to the extreme making the game feel rushed and not well thought through.  All video games have a bit of repetition regards characters but Saints Row 4 makes it so noticeable it takes away from the game a little bit.  Also the digital water squares I know are meant to emphasize this is a \"simulation of Steelport\" but it looked tacky.The game despite all its flaws is a LOT of fun and fairly easy to play.  I find funny that in Saints Row 4 the so called easy challenges I have trouble with and the so called hard challenges I complete with no trouble at all. Flying the Alien close support fighter ship in Steelport is impossible because; the controls for it are worse than garbage.  The close combat support ship controls are so unresponsive to input that they are in effect useless.  The directional arrows during the high speed run challenges are also inaccurate making it difficult to determine the intended directions.  Also quality control missed the fact that in too many places the color tints and hues of instructions were washed out by adjacent colors that share too much in common.  The game directional indicators lacked a high & consistently visible contrast making them difficult or near impossible to see clearly at higher speeds.Saints Row 3 is not that much different from Saints Row 4 in overall appearance of Steelport and you spend much of the game in a Steelport simulation.  The spaceship scenes are first rate in quality.  The spaceship flying scenes that happen outside the simulation are absolutely beautiful so true to life it blew my mind.  Flying the spaceships outside the simulation is sweet, I had a real seat of the pants flying experience there.  I enjoyed the main characters the voice acting was a bit stiff and repetitive at times but well done on whole.  I paid full price for Saints Row 4 getting it on release day and I do not in any way feel ill used for my choice.  Saints Row 4 delivered a satisfying video game experience treat even if the taste is heavily recycled fare.  I took a star off my overall rating due to issues I site herein but, Saints Row 4 hit the mark for fun.  The plot is funny inventive and brings life to lots of recycled content that have otherwise been a real drag.  Saints Row 4 is more like Saints Row 3.5 instead of a full upgrade but given Saints Row 3 was so good Saints Row 4 delivers a hardy fun entertaining gaming experience one I was happy to have.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2013"}

Alas, my hopes were dashed when I realized the developers wanted to re-create Grand Theft Auto with Jak and Daxter, sending them to a bustling metropolis, filled with hovercars and criminals engaging in illegal activity.Jak II unfortunately takes a turn from the original and introduces new concepts that take the fun out of what was a great platformer. Jak II strays from the platform genre and instead, thrusts you into mini-games, stealing hovercars, outracing time trials on a jetboard (still pretty fun) a la Tony Hawk, and various other deeds. Armed with guns now, Jak is a little darker this time around, and the Dark Jak metamorphosis was a nice touch should you collect enough metal hearts or something, but overall, I was let down. Platforming puzzles are few and far between, with the game relying on the driving and city searching a bit too much. The graphics, sound, presentation, and controls are all top notch, but I was never worried about those aspects since Naughty Dog knows what they're doing.Still, if I wanted to play Grand Theft Auto, I would've bought Grand Theft Auto. I want a platformer sequel to Jak and Daxter. I did not get this with Jak II. Hopefully, the third time is the charm.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2004"}

After an extensive research and via the reviews here at Amazon.com, I decided to purchase Hori. It's supposed to be Nintendo licensed and the best on the market.  I  haven't used my gamepad except to adjust the settings.  So I  followed the instructions carefully  on how to apply the screen protector and even checked out a YouTube video and it was very easy to apply even to someone like me who is not dexterous.  There were a few air bubbles but I was able to smooth them out except for one because the screen protector I received had a dent. So the air bubble was trapped under it. (I asked Amazon for a replacement so that's not the reason for my one star review. )The main reason for my poor star rating is simply because the gamepad became absolutely unresponsive. At first I thought it was odd since my gamepad was working beautifully.  Whenever I tried to access the game or press any icon on the screen,  it wouldn't respond at all or it would become wonky and the homepage would jerk from side to side.  I recalled another reviewer for the 3DS's Hori screen protector saying that her/his touchscreen was non-responsive after using it.So I decided to take it off and the second I took it off my  gamepad became responsive again. I don't recommend this screen protector at all. I loved its easy application, but it was pointless since it rendered my gamepad unresponsive. What a complete waste of money.UPDATE:So I received my replacement for the damaged one, and after applying it, my touch screen has become responsive. As I've originally said, the air bubbles could be smoothed out and its application is as easy as ABC. Do I recommend this product? Not really- since it's packaging is awful, it's almost like gambling your money away. Many people have complained about its packaging, and I agree. Plus, it doesn't seem to be a reliable product since it made my touch screen go wonky. Another issue I have is that it does not cover the entire screen so that means that dust could creep into its parameters.  If you have cash to burn or don't mind buying two of these filters just in case one of them is damaged, then I say go for it.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00095LIC0","reviewerName":"E. David Swan","summary":"Best game yet for the DS","reviewText":"Kirby's new adventure seems like the completion of the effort put into `Yoshi's Touch and Go' although I actually prefer the control in YTG. Too bad Yoshi's adventure played more like a demo than an actual game and was tragically short. There is quite a bit more control over the main character, Kirby, who can be stopped, sped up and made to launch attacks. Although both the Kirby and Yoshi games involved drawing paths (Yoshi had his clouds and Kirby his painted rainbows), Kirby's path is much more flexible. Kirby can be sent straight up and even loop backwards and made to turn around. In the case of water, drawing the path is reversed as the player needs to paint above Kirby rather than below. It took me awhile to figure out the trick of maneuvering through water. In fact there are a lot of environmental effects that cause the player to have to rethink how they draw including fans, wind and even gravitational fields.Canvas Curse ramps up gradually from a casual walk in the park to frantic fast paced action in the later levels. It's a game that's easy to pick up and go with but after a few hours the comfort level increases to the point where it becomes very intuitive. Certainly the directional pad or even an analog stick would never be able to perform the subtle twists, turns and loops that Kirby will be performing. In fact I'll go out on a limb and say that no game has ever managed to produce the kind of ballet movement that Kirby is capable of. Occasionally there can be some difficulty in seeing the screen since your hand sometimes obscures the view but it's nothing that destroys the fun.The core game is rather short and most of the playing time will probably spent collecting coins and opening up unlockables. There are also Time Trials, mini games and Paint Trials. If you bought the DS I can't see a reason not to buy Kirby since the game uses the strength of the DS as well as any game I've seen produced so far.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2005"}

Anyways, it's too bad they couldn't use the real name(because of a band with the same name?!) but if you want survival horror to the extreme then perhaps you should try the Silent Hill series. As far as Resident Evil 6 is concerned, it's an experience like Resident Evil 5 only with way better control and 4 times as long. Or maybe 3. Well, it's really long with a story that is somewhat unexpected yet appealing in ways that Capcom fans should understand(I'm a Capcom fan BTW). So...if you're not a Capcom fan then you should be. And please don't comment about how you don't like Capcom, I've heard all the issues and quite frankly I get it but others don't.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2013"}

But while I started off hating Civilization for no real reason, I grew to love it and become addicted to Civilization IV. Then that addiction fell off quicker than eight months in rehab, and I came to realize just why that addiction ended so abruptly.This game is not really a \"game\", but more a pleasant little time-waster for two or three hours a week, then two or three hours a month, and so on.My first encounter with the Civilization series was Civilization III, which unfortunately I could not get over the fact that each turn ended passed some 500 years, in which the most primitive and basest of technologies, such as the wheel or fire, would take 10,000 years to acquire, and thus by 300 BC, where most civilizations in reality are conquering huge landmasses, conquering rudimentary plumbing, and developing philosophical and scientific theories that would dominate the cultural landscape for THOUSANDS of years to come, my Civ3 Civilization had just learned how to ride horses, and learn how to count, but not how to read.It also didn't help that my city spend some 3,000 years on fire. I suppose that fire was supposed to represent unrest, but considering it's a FIRE, and fire was a VERY HUGE DISASTER in ancient times, I thought it was both highly inaccurate and highly offensive.Civilization IV doesn't suffer as much from this, but unfortunately it does do this system whereby the natural evolution of civilizations is not at all organic and dependent upon the location, the people, the religion, the government, etcetera, but is all on a fixed line where your civilization advances at the same rate as everyone else. You can be guaranteed to research certain technologies around the exact same time period each game---gunpowder circa 1300s - 1700s AD, that sort of thing. There is absolutely no chance of a sudden sharp advancement in civilization---unless you waste valuable resources building a certain monument FIRST that grants you certain privilages, you can expect to not be able to experience such things as Democracy in an ancient Athens, or free speech in a Medieval kingdom.You have to have certain ideals happen in certain times, and there is no way and no chance of defying the rigid construct and having a revolution occur in your civilization that defies all others (such as a Democracy in Athens, or a Republic in Rome or Carthage). As such, it would be impossible to recreate such civilizations as the Roman Republic (because Rome can't be a Republic in this game until some time in AD, well AFTER the Republic was long dead and gone). You can't have Alexander the Great spreading religious tolerance in the 300s BC. You can't defy the median civilization setup, you have to have your civilization develop on a straight and narrow line.Because of this, not only is there no chance for innovation, but almost all the other civilizations on the map will you will advance at the same rate and advance with the same technologies. This means that there is no chance for an encounter such as that of the Imperial Spanish/French/English with the \"New World\" Native Americans---in this game, they would be just as heavily armored and gunpowdered as the Europeans, though maybe without the compass invention.Another problem is the diplomacy. To put it simply, there is none. This is in no way advanced enough to come close to reality during these times, save for maybe the most ancient pre-historical examples.I've played half a dozen games, and the diplomacy in ALL of them has consisted of this:New Leader meets me, offers alliance. I choose alliance.Ten turns later, they offer Open Borders.Fifty turns later, they offer a heavily unbalanced trade that I reject.Five turns later, they demand I cease trade with another civilization. I do so. That civilization comes back and re-offers trade. First civilization seems to completely ignore this fact.One civilization randomly threatens me with war for no reason. I tell them the equivalent of \"bring it on\", they never do.There is no advanced diplomacy here. There is no intelligent AI. All other civilizations ever do is offer peace, then trade, then try to get you to give them your researched technology for inferior ones that take less time or you already have being researched and completed in one turn, or just plain don't want (like Communism). They sometimes threaten hostile actions against you for no reason, and proceed to never follow up. They sometimes threaten you to give them a technology or else, and that \"or else\" turns out to be nothing, then they have the OBNOXIOUS AUDACITY to come back to me a turn or so later, demanding THE EXACT SAME TECHNOLOGY, but this time with a cock and bull story of how their civilization is suffering and they need charity.No civilization ever goes to war with me unless I declare first. No civilization ever asks me to mediate disputes. No civilization ever asks for trades that are not routine \"One corn for One rice, yes?\" or \"Nationalism for Gunpowder and 100 gold, yes?\". No civilization ever asks for military assistance or cultural exchange.Even the diplomacy in Rome Total War is better than this! At least the RTW factions randomly declare war on you for some reason of necessity or greed.The map interface itself is quite simple in itself, but the larger your civilization gets, the more cluttered it becomes. Towns and farms and mines and windmills and roads all take up individual spaces, making for a highly inaccurate display where cities are evenly distributed, and not resemblence of reality, where larger congregations of people would flock to seaside areas rather than in the middle of a desert. This is also a horrifying ordeal to handle in times of war, when some random pack of enemy jerkwads come and start destroying minor towns and farms and the like. You move your city garrison out to attack them, only to have ANOTHER pack of enemy jerkwads have the OBNOXIOUS AUDACITY to fly RIGHT PAST YOUR UNITS and completely destroy a city two or three squares away from you!The worst aspect is the military. I am a military historian and I love games like Rome Total War and Medieval II Total War.There is no military aspect in this game. It's all literally an arms race for getting the best unit first for a slight advantage against the randomness of a dice roll decision. It's frequently common to see ONE enemy warrior successfully defeat THREE of your enemy warriors. The animation only proceeds to enrage you, as ONE BY ONE your warriors stand up in front of the enemy, only to be beaten aside by their club or sword, without ever swinging first themselves.There is no concept of realism in military conflicts, as I've once had a pair of enemy swordsmen DEFEAT a fresh new pack of WAR ELEPHANTS. I've had chariot riders be killed flawlessly by enemy crossbowmen. I've had MONGOL HORSE LANCERS defeat TWO UNITS OF MACHINE GUN INFANTRY. And not the WW1 style machine gunners, but the type who hold a machine gun in one hand, AND A ROCKET LAUNCHER IN THE OTHER HAND!How is that supposed to be a part of a grand and pleasant game experience when your space-age civilization has half its army destroyed by MEDIEVAL HORSE LANCERS? Just because they outnumber you?One of the worst parts involves destruction of cities. All it takes is ONE enemy unit of ANY KIND to wander into your city with no defending units, AND THEY COMPLETELY DESTROY THE CITY! BURN THE RUBBLE, CLEAR THE ASHES, SALT THE LAND, EVERYTHING GONE!So I lost my capital because I sent the units away to attack a pack of RANDOM BARBARIAN ARCHERS only to have those archers SOMEHOW slip past my units from another square, enter my capital, AND COMPLETELY DESTROY IT!Repetitive, singular, with virtually no replayability. Make sure never to go to war, because it will always be a disgustingly short, plodding, ridiculous affair where 50% of gameplay is hitting \"End Turn\" and waiting.Update: The expansion packs COMPLETELY change much of the AI and \"randomness\" experience for the better.  It's an immensely more playable game with them.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0050SWUTQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Genryu","summary":"Very accessible entry into the series for newcomers but less of a horror-survival game","reviewText":"First of all let me say that Dead Space 3 is definitely more of an action-game than a survival-horror game as its predecessors were. Whether this is a good or bad thing is going to depend on where you're coming from into the series. I am a big fan of Dead Space 1 and 2, and came into this game looking for another entry in one of the best horror-survival games series I've played. What I got was more of an action-game, that while fun in its own right, was not nearly as tense or frightening as the 1st and 2nd games were. I've detailed below what I think is good and bad depending on what you're looking for.For the 3rd Person Action Game Fans:- Dead Space 3 has solid combat mechanics complete with a cover system and plenty of ammunition. So if you were drawn away from Dead Space 1 and 2 because of the lack of things like a cover system, punishing enemies, or low amounts of ammo then Dead Space 3 might be the one for you.- There are lots of guns to mess around with and customize that can be a lot of fun to use- There's Co-op play so you can jump in with a friend to help you along the way- This is still a horror-genre game so there will still be scares and an appropriate tone throughout that can get quite creepy if you aren't into that, but it's considerably less intense than Dead Space 1&2.For the Horror-Survival Game Fans/Fans of Dead Space 1&2- The game continues the story almost directly from Dead Space 2, so you will be able to pick things up and get into the story quickly- The plot definitely progresses the overarching story of Dead Space considerably, so you will be rewarded for playing through if only for the story- The game is just plain less scary and much easier because of the plentiful ammo, easier to kill enemies, and just less emphasis on &#34;tactical dismemberment&#34; that defined the series.- Inventory management is considerably revamped and is easier to use, but they universalized ammunition so again it's less tactical/true to horror-survival games.- The co-op mode is optional, but unfortunately some side-missions are limited to co-op play only so you'll need to find a friend to complete everything/experience everything.The storyline I think is solid and has plenty of surprises and shocks to entertain both new players and veterans of the series alike. It's a fun game worth playing I think, especially with all of the sales I see for it. The graphics are great as well, and they made great use of the snow-environment effects/visuals. It adds its own unique flair to things and helps differentiate it from previous Dead Space games. I personally played through on single-player first to enjoy the story privately, and am playing through again now to help my friend who's a newcomer to the series. I highly recommend playing through yourself first and then with a friend, both because you get to enjoy more of Isaac (the main character's story) first and then also the 2nd character's story during co-op play. I appreciate that the developers make what each character sees in co-op play different. For example Isaac may be recalling a vision from his past as he looks at something, which your co-op partner will not see even though they're standing next to each other - and vice versa. This game has a lot of polish to it and is fairly lengthy so you'll have hours of enjoyment ahead.Though this isn't a horror-survival game anymore, it's still a fun game and one that I would happily recommend to newcomers and previous fans of Dead Space alike.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000SSPH3E","description":"","reviewerName":"Son of Tiamat","summary":"The remake from your nightmares","reviewText":"I know there are plenty of negative reviews out there already but as this will be the only one star rating I'm hoping I can get this message out quickly, because I'm already sore at not having done this sooner.For anybody who has played the original Final Fantasy Tactics on the PSONE loved it (seriously loved it) I implore you, do not buy this game! Of all the negative reviews out there bashing the games flaws(the lag on spells, the useless new job classess, etc.) nobody is saying what REALLY needs to be said. And that is as follows...Squenix ruined this game when they increased the amount of JP necessary to gain skills and go up joblevels.For anybody who played the original we all known how hard the game could be and how very necessary it was to spend a good portion of your time developing and training your characters. The game can be quite time consuming in this one aspect, albeit, but it was quite fun and very satisfying (not a word I use often) to see the pay off in characters that could dish out the damage and hold their own in tough situations. Your own A-team, so to speak. The demand for more JP utterly KILLS! this experience.Take for instance the Lancer's jump abilities. The level 8 jumps only required 900JP to master. Now they require 1500! and thats just one example. In Final Fantasy Tactics, the higher a characters job level the more JP they could aquire. Simultaneously increasing JP required for leveling a character's job level AND gaining skills makes it even more time consuming. It increases exponetially the amount of time needed to level your characters. If feels like you're getting corn-holed from both ends. You can't gain as much JP AND more JP are required to gain skills. AGGH!For instance, I always like to get Ramza the Ninja's two-swords ability before his one on one duel with Gafgarion. In this way he can use sword break two times in one turn and turn Gafgarion's game completely on it's head. With the PSP version of the game, however, it probably would have taken far too much time to develop Ramza that far. I sold the game after I beat chapter one after realizing getting to this point would require hours, and hours of training while my eyeballs slowly fell out of my skull after staring down at that tiny little screen for so long. Wander around, enter a battle, ingnore the monsters and start doing all the thing us veterans do to gain JP like the Squire's Accumulate, only however much time you spend leveling your characters in the PSONE version, times that by 2.5 and you have a rough estimate of how much you'll playing (and feeling like a nerd with no life!)I am terribly dissapointed with this game! There is Oh, so much Square enix (or Squenix) could have done to make this better! Giving access to jobs only the bosses had, such as Arc Knight, Sorcorer, Assassin, and many others. Elmdor's Teleport 2 ability, better weapons, better jobs, more missions...All of this, FOREVER out of reach it seems because the sadists at Squenix saw fit to give us this inferior remake.

While the game seems like it's essentially an expansion pack of the first, what an expansion. The levels are all new and have great settings. You also get to play as Yoshi and Luigi on some levels.GameplaySame, but better game controls. There are some cool new challenges, including a test of how many enemies you can jump on consecutively. There's also the boulder and drill, which are fun to use. Some levels are almost entirely in 2-D, really giving a classic Mario feel to them.The enemies are a LOT better in this game. Super Mario Galaxy 2 resurrects some Mario franchise favorites, including the Hammer Bros. (!) and Lakitu. The bosses are also a lot better - no more silly moles. They look pretty serious this time around.GraphicsOf course an improvement from the first game (not that there was much to complain about the first time around). Graphically, the game looks almost like a CG animated movie.ChallengeThe game starts out easy - easier than the first in my opinion - but ramps up the challenge level later on. The first few levels are fairly easy, whereas some of the third or fourth stars in a galaxy are really tough. My sense so far is that it has enough to satisfy everyone.MusicThe music in this game was fully orchestrated, and you can tell the difference. Even the overture, though largely the same as the first game, sounds much more crisp. You can find it online for sale as a CD, or possibly download it as a mp3 files.MiscellaneousThere are a couple of other things I should note:This game does not have a central \"observatory\" as in the first game. Rather, you fly Starship Mario on a map. This saves you a LOT of time, so you don't have to keep searching for the room just to begin a level.Also, each level has Bowser flags that you can switch to Mario flags, thus marking your continue spots (in the first game, there was no indication of where you would continue if you died).As in the first game, I was disappointed Super Mario Galaxy 2 did not have any additional rewards for collecting power stars. I've always thought it would be awesome if with every 30 or so power stars you unlocked a new character (imagine getting Link or Samus for unlocking all of the stars!). As it stands, players don't have much incentive to try to get all 120 stars after beating Bowser.OverallOverall, if you liked the first game, you'll love the sequel. If you didn't like Super Mario Galaxy, or got too frustrated, don't be surprised if you hate this one! I'm loving it so far. It seems like everything that was wrong or annoying with the first one is now fixed. Enjoy!ShoppingWord to the wise: if you want to save some money, this game is available for around $35-40 on eBay or Amazon. I got my copy for $32.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000B43OY4","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"Awesome console, lacking on games","reviewText":"After about a year, I finally decided to get the 360 on an impulse since the store had this version for $100 off after a mail in rebate.  So effectively for $299 I got the 360 premium.The console itself seems pretty solid, it can play just about any CD media, burned or original, and it also has USB ports that you can plus flash drives into to view pictures or play media.  On problem I had with the original XBOX was that for some reason mine only played Verbatim branded CD-RW discs and that is after I switched out my thompson and put the Samsung DVD drive in it.  However the 360 can read any CD media.The games look great on the 360 on my 53\" Sony HDTV.  One drawback is that since my TV is a full screen, there are the movie style black bars while playing the game, but honestly while playing the game, I don't even notice them.  I have 3 games with the 360; COD3, GOW and just recently I took my rarely played SC:Double Agent back to the store and exchanged for the 360 version.  So far all of the graphics in these game look pretty much flawless in HD; but I have no idea how they would look on regular TV.  In addition to the HDTV, I also bought the optional optical audio cable so I could play my games in true surround sound with my home theatre system, and I was very happy with the results.  Playing the games is like watching a movie.  The sounds shift from speaker to speaker while you turn in the game.  In COD3 you can litteraly hear bullets flying by your head.  If you have a home theatre system with optical input, then this optional asscesory is highly recommended.As for the controller, I thought it would be hard to get the hang of it, since I am a BIG fan of the XBOX original large \"Duke\" controllers, and absolutely hate the Controller-S.  However the small 360 controller is pretty easy to get the hang of.  Every button is where its supposed to be and the only game that gave me a little problem at first was SC:Double Agent, and I believe that was largely due to the fact that I was so used to playing it on the regular XBOX with the original Duke controller.  Another cool thing about the wireless controller is that you can turn on your 360 by just pressing and holding down the \"Xbox\" button.  You don't even have to get up if you are too tired and the game you want to play is already in the console.  Similarily you can turn off the 360 in the same manner, witout having to get up.  I am not sure if the wired controller can do the same thing.The amount of things the 360 can do is almost too much to list.  Before I got any games for it, I spent all night playing around with it and discovered that it can play media from other PC's on your home network; without any additional stuff to buy.  You do however have to download stuff from microsoft in order to use this functionality.  Another feature that carried over from the original XBOX is that it allows you to rip audio CD's directly to the hard disc, and best yet you can name your tracks while the 360 is still ripping, which saves time, and something the original 360 could not do.  There is other stuff the 360 can do which I may never get around to doing.Now for the cons.  From my perspective there really arent that many games that I want to play for the 360.  I knew this going in, but a $100 off deal was something I couldn't pass up.  The only games I am interested in so far are the ones I already have an Rainbow Six Vegas and maybe NBA 2K7.  I would like a football game for the 360 but being that my only choice comes from EA, I will have to pass.  I am looking foward to Halo 3, and Fusion Frenzy 2, but that it about it.  I really hope there would be more good games for the 360 in the near future.  To be fair this con isn't really any fault of the console itself, it just seems that not many people are willing are able to make good games for the 360.  Another small con about the games are that they are generally $10 more than current gen games; which is why I buy them used and if I don't like them, I can return them to the store and not throw away my money.I conclusion I do like the console, but am waiting for more games that I am interested in. I also would suggest if you are going to get one, get the premium, that comes with the Hard drive, wireless controller and a couple of other goodies you don't get with the Core.  It only $100 more, and by the time you buy all the extra stuff with the Core system, you would spend more than the $400 price tag.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2006"}

Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar. As weapons disintegrate over time, they might jam or even explode in your hand.There are also a large range of vehicles such as gliders, trucks, cars, and boats that will let you fly, drive, slide, and hover over the open landscapes.Multiplayer Options for up to 16 PlayersFar Cry 2 supports up to 16 players and has four gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising. Players can choose from six different classes in multiplayer, each with its own set of pros and cons. Just as in the single-player mode, multiplayer games will feature dynamic elements, making each session unique.You can explore the world of Far Cry 2 from inside a car or flying on a glider.","reviewerName":"Bryan \"BMG\"","summary":"Great game, one of my new favs, muti-player, xbox live","reviewText":"I usually don't write reviews, but I think this game is underrated, and think Halo is overrated. I want lots of people to buy this game so there will be more people playing online. I'm sort of disappointed with Xbox live for all my games, because there's not as many people playing as I thought. The single player mode is fun and easy but it gets boring after awhile, I didn't finish, the multi-player mode is too addicting. Every time I play online, I pretty much play on a new map, how great is that? It's new and so I don't get tired of the game. This is because there is a map making mode that is a 100000x better than Halo's forge. There are maps that look like junk-yards, deserts, beaches, cities, jungles, and other stuff. People even make crazy interesting maps that change the game play like in one you're trapped in a building and you must snipe to fight. There are different game modes online as well. There is a turf war thing called uprising where winner controls 3 posts, there is a capture the flag mode, and of course there is a death-match and team death match mode. You can rate all the maps too so to fitter out the just ok ones. The bad thing is you can't really pick your character, but this isn't a big problem. You pick the weapon and a different guy will hold it, for example the basic sniper is always a dude with a cowboy hat (but at least 3 different guys wearing it). You can change weapons everything you die. You get new weapons when you buy them during the game. You can figure it out when you play, but the main thing is that you can progress your weapons while you the play the same match and map. So read other reviews for single player mode, but really you should buy this game just for the cool multi-player mode. Unlike Halo the maps have good places to snipe and hide, you can actually go inside buildings too. The graphics in this game are the best I've seen yet, but really video games need to catch up with movies. Like all games, the scenery is good, but unlike most games I've played the people in this game look more real, their skin looks rounded, smooth, and shinny, and the blood and fire look great as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2010"}

World at War is an amazing game!  I still love Modern Warfare, but there has been so much more improvements to WAW.  The game is more 'brutal' meaning parts and guts splatter all over for realism.  Graphic wise, WAW is a bit more sharper and cleaner looking.  The sound is top notch amazing, being a sound guru myself.  After playing WAW for a few months and going back to Modern Warfare, the sound is really muffled and not as strong and intense as WAW.The only drawback about WAW is that I personally don't really like the good ol' day guns back then.  The pace in WAW is also a lot slower, weapons and the action is also a bit on the slow pace.  Modern Warfare, is a faster, run and gun pace especially on-line.  Overall, I thought Modern Warfare was better, but now I think WAW is just as good or even better because of the improvements from COD4.  This is a must buy for a shooter!

This one is as about as difficult as they come - and I'll not lie to you, I cheated my way through, when it was all said and done. Even in doing so, SHATTERED SOLDIER was no breeze, despite its length, which is quite short (and one of the game's largest failings).In the grand CONTRA tradition, one hit from an enemy or enemy fire will kill you deader than a doornail, and the default setting gives you a mere 3 lives and hundreds upon hundreds of enemies to dodge, duck, leap over, and ultimately kill. It's nightmarishly difficult, and the impatient and uninitiated will most likely HATE this game because of the sheer frustration it can cause. More tolerant gamers will find a lot to like, especially if they feel a certain sentimentality with the CONTRA series. This game goes back to the roots of the franchise, and throws in some flashbacks to older games in the series as an added delight (for example, you'll recognize a monstrous alien turtle that spews flies if you're at all familiar with SUPER CONTRA, and a jungle-bound fortress that spews fire from turrets as you struggle to put hot lead into its bulbous vulnerable spot). The action is non-stop, and will leave your palms sweaty and your heart racing. Add into the fray some well-designed and grotesque boss encounters that are truly surreal in nature, and you've got the ultimate side-scrolling action title for the Playstation 2. Of course, side-scrollers have seen better days on all platforms, and if you've never been a fan of the mechanic, SHATTERED SOLDIER isn't the game to convert you. Still, the graphics are superb and the scripted segments will make you feel like you're at the arcade, and if that's your cup of tea, then by all means drink up.On the downside, SHATTERED SOLDIER is short. Add a pretty much non-existent story, a complete lack of vocals, and an unsatisfying ending (to put it mildly) to the mix, and you may want to wait until the price goes down a few rungs before you green light the latest CONTRA game. Still, if you loved the original and its Super Nintendo sequel, you can't afford to pass on this one - after all, it's the best CONTRA yet, and one heck of a kick in the pants if you dig the genre. Just be prepared for a difficulty that may force even the most hardcore gamer to dabble into the cheating arts.Final Score: B","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2002"}

In that amount of time you would think I accomplished some type of milestones, but truthfully most of that time was spent just running around exploring the city and beating up some random thugs. I didn't realize how much fun I would have in this game just grappling around rooftops, swooping down and taking out a gang of henchman over and over again. If you've played Arkham Asylum, you'll feel right at home with the combat system and it's still fun as ever making Batman take out a group of 10 or so thugs by himself. The inclusion of Catwoman is a nice addition, and she's just as fun to play with as the bat himself. The opening credits scenes are fantastically done setting you up for the epic time ahead. Voice acting is, of course, very well done. Characters look great, the overall city looks great, and so far the story is definitely keeping me interested. The only complaint I have for this is that so far, and it doesn't look like it's going to come to be, is that you still can't drive the batmobile. Also, I would've liked to have been able to have a small part of the story playing as Robin & Nightwing like they did with Catwoman since they're usable in the challenge maps. But, overall i'm very happy that I bought this game. I played through Asylum 3 times, and i'm sure this one will get multiple playthroughs as well. Bottom line: If you enjoyed Arkham Asylum, you will enjoy Arkham City, because it attempts to expand on it in every way possible and succeeds in doing so.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2011"}

Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars.

This is kind of a disappointment, because I never appreciated the series back then. Once the game went 3D free-roam, was when I got hooked.Don't get me wrong, the game isn't horrible, but it's not what I expect from a GTA game, and is the least impressive GTA game on the PSP. It lacks 3D free roam, and real radio stations(All of which were available in the previous 2 GTA stories games)However, I should also state that if you absolutely MUST get this title, then the PSP version is the best one to get. It looks better than other console versions, and plays much smoother.Bottom line, get this ONLY if you enjoy the original GTA games, but if DO enjoy those titles, then you will be pleasantly surprised with this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2013"}

The background music is some weird techno, and the voice-acting is loud and annoying -- It's seizure inducing. I wouldn't be surprised if this game causes blindness. This is the first fighting game I've ever played but I think you're supposed to SEE what's happening to your character and not have your ears destroyed by techno and bad voice acting.Now there's another thing I want to talk about : No one cares about Deadpool anymore.

H.A.M.M.E.R?) The entire Fantastic Four, The Punisher, Ronald McDonald and lastly, Cyclops.They've got Taskmaster, but no Cyclops. Cyclops, apparently, isn't important.

It's only fitting that Marvel would even be involved in all of this, because they've been getting completely destroyed by Morrison, Winick and Johns.

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet.

It is equally well crafted in its gameplay, graphics/sound, and atmosphere. The story is not bad for a non-rpg, though you won't get a whole lot of character development.You are Rau, a young warrior trained to fulfill a prophecy and protect the land from a vile clan that wishes to unleash powerful dark magic. Through your quests, you develop your skills, expand your weaponry, and uncover the plot to bring about your own downfall.The graphics are GORGEOUS! The environments you play through range from tropical jungles to ancient cities in winter. The art direction here is primo. It all seems to have influences from the barbarian fantasy genre with ancient south american/ polynesian motifs mixed in. Very cool.Play control was excellent. The game uses a unique targeting system that allows you to quickly shift your focus during combat and even allows multi-targeting  for some of Rau's wider ranging attacks. Stealth kills are also an option, allowing you to thin out the herds of enemies before they catch on to your presence. The ability to send out your bird helper is a nice touch, allowing you to plot your strategy and find a way to take out as many baddies without getting overwhelmed.It definitely pays to learn the different melee combos and know which weapon's are most suited for a certain situations. Once you get skilled in combat, it feels good to mop the floor with a group of enemies that used to give you trouble. This game is definitely not a typical button-masher. In fact that's a good way to a quick death. So if you like combat games that require a little more thought in combat then this is a good choice.The story is a simple one and does not involve a great deal of dialogue. In fact I don't think the main character gets any at all, which is odd considering the story mostly revolves around him. But the characters you do meet are interesting enough.Rau's trainer could have used a different voice over though. I've heard the voice before somewhere (you'll know what I'm talking about when you hear it). It reminds me of one of those 7-foot tall smoker's voices that shout out deals in a sinister tone on national car commercials. \"Get great deals on 2006 SUVs with no money down.\" Kinda took me out of the element when I heard him during training sessions.Overall, I highly recommend the game. If you want a better than average combat/action game, you'll find that this is one of the better games in the genre.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2006"}

It is truly a sand box style environment that you can explore as much or as little as you like.  I've played it through to the end only once and there were many areas I didn't explore and many quests I did not complete.  (it has more replay value if you don't do everything the first time through)  Some of the elements (like Tranquility Lane) were very imaginative.I just have a few thoughts for the developers (if any of them read these reviews).The only thing lacking in the game for me were some diversions from the basic explore, kill and loot routines.  How about some gambling games or sporting competitions?  You could have radroach killing contests where contestants would compete to see who could kill the most roaches in say 60 seconds. (bare handed) The interaction with women in the game was extremely limited.  The one woman who could be \"hired\" didn't really do anything.  I don't know why an M rated game can't have the content of an R rated movie but most adult games at least have a blackout scene with sound effects.  The average video game player is over 30 years old so give us something other to do than just killing.  How about the opportunity to move in with Moira or Phoenix?  In my game I ducked into Dukov's place to escape from a deathclaw and the thing followed me inside and killed him.  After I dispatched the wounded deathclaw I thought sure the dialogue options would allow something to develop with Cherry and Fantasia (like offering to let them move into my Megaton apartment) but no such luck.It seems like many developers of rpg's would rather be working on straight shooters.I would gladly sacrifice some of the size of the game's area in order to have more diverse options for the player character.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2011"}

I really enjoyed playing FABLE, but was kind of disappointed by how the story ended (in my opinion all of the four endings are lame). The graphics are at times visually stunning.

The graphics, character models, and menue system are all good, but during the single player campaign, the friendly and enemy AI do a lot of dumb things that will send you back to the reload screen, and the story and motivations of the enemy deserves a bit more attention to detail. Killing enemies such as talking flowers, bazooka weilding houses, and giant mutated teddy bears in a game such as Final Fantasy is ok. (no one's gonna question the enemy and their motives in a Final Fantasy game).  Killing enemies such as terrorist in a modern day game however, is a bit more tricky of a subject matter for game developers to handle and dish out.  It should be the duty of game developers to present intelligent material in their games that helps people make sense out of these senseless times that we live,(and in this case) play in. Instead, they are possibly giving ammo (literally and figuratively) to kids (who play games such as this one) that are prone to believe that Islam (and other \"un-American\" beliefs) and all its followers should be shot. In the game, something drives these men to do what they do. Something moves men and women enough not only to kill, but also to die. Unfortunately, that something is never fully explained in this game.  I don't think, \"just shoot and kill\" is the message that the game is trying to present to gamers, but subject materials like killing terrorist in a video game should be more fully explained, since this is a very sensitive part of life nowadays, just so that people dont get the wrong impression of the game.  Maybe this is the reason why it got a \"M\" rating. It doesn't take long to get through the SOCOM games (I finished the single player campaing in 4 SOCOM games... socom 1,2,3 & Combined Assault in 14 days) but the meat and potatoes of the game is having fun destroying all of your friends in on line multiplayer matches.

Long single player that I never wanted to end.  Awesome voice acting for Payne and Passos and I'm picky about that.Let me just emphasize this game is freakin HARDDD.  I died soo many times in this game.  But it's realistic.. I don't know of a more realistic type shooter than Max Payne 3.

Try playing in arcade mode where there are very few cutscenes.. Holy **** problem solved.  Amazing! The cut scenes are fantastic anyway.  Stop complaining.  Oh by the way, you can skip most of the cut scenes by pressing ENTER.  Clicking the mouse won't skip the cut scene.Also, when you get hit and have painkillers, sometimes the game allows you a second chance in bullet time mode where you have to hit the enemy who just hit you in order to live.  Sometimes in this moment you have no shot and you have to sit there for 4 seconds waiting to die which is annoying but it doesn't happen nearly enough to be a huge problem.  edit: Actually I figured out you can change your over the shoulder view by pressing H which fixes this most of the time.After like 100 hours of play I can walk through this game with a revolver in old school mode.  My parents are very proud of me.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2012"}

Seriously, there is so much to love about this game. Puzzles, dungeons (which, too, are puzzles), secrets, RUMORS, mini games, AWESOME BOSSES. If this sounds like a formula for winning, you sir, are correct. Because the Legend of Zelda has never looked so fun before. Excuse me though, for I have not played Ocarina of the Time that so many people swear by. But what I do know is that this game is a 10/10 in my book. I am rewriting this review after beating Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword, nothing like good ol' Wind Waker. I heard that its loose gameplay around the 30 hour mark was criticized by some angry ungrateful reviewers who get paid to write reviews! I am just shocked. This \"loose\" gameplay is the Legend of Zelda evolving from linearity into a masterpiece opting for more of a open world approach while still retaining the awesome flow of story and progression. Besides, I think that was the best part in the whole game. Searching the vast sea for pieces of triforce! So ignore complaints, and set sail into a world of pure joy.

Im at 90 hours or so on the in game clock, and have been playing it on the Difficult Setting. I also have only used the control pad and skipped the stylis.If you need to pass some time on a long trip this is the game to do it because the battles take a looong time to finish, but it never gets dull.This is a game you pick up, play a battle or two, and then do something else. Best part is that you can do a quick save during a battle, tern of the game and start from there later, so there is no rush.I loved the old FinalFantasy Tactics game on the PS1, and this one is like a souped up version with a more light/forgettable main story.Bottom line: if you like/liked the FinalFantacy tactics games, this is a no brainer.Its bright, its colorful, there are lots of character classes to build up, and there are a HECK of a lot of missions to play through if you want.Also Difficult Mode is just right for a old player like me, tough enough to make me think, and if I lose, its because I messed up, not because the game is cheep.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2011"}

Since the reviews seemed positive overall and I found out about Patrick Stewart doing the voice work,I had to give this game a try. I am not far into the game but I have mixed feelings so far.Positives+ This game is absolutely beautifully rendered. The visuals are top notch, near the quality of Uncharted. I'm not sure if it is 1080p but the environments and character/enemy models are crisp and sharp with excellent detail.+ The story isn't exactly unique but interesting enough to motivate you to keep going.+ Bosses are gigantic and unique.+ Very high production value. Everything from the level design to music score and voice acting are done with high quality.+ The puzzle segments of the game provide a nice balance to the game. There is a very nice feature is that you have the option to skip a puzzle if you choose without adversely affecting the progress or outcome; you simply forgo the bonus that you would have earned from solving the puzzle. This is fantastic thinking on the part of the designer since you don't need to worry about getting stuck or having to look up cheat codes just to move on with the story. Simply awesome!Negatives- The very obvious issue is with the camera. Being that it is set at a fixed angle, it is difficult to see where you are relative to possible paths and enemies. This isn't a huge issue most of the time but can be problematic when you are looking for some specific treasure or fighting a large group of enemies.- This is a very diffcult game, even on the easiest setting. This game is hard on your fingers as there is constant action. I'm not as young as I used to be but I think this game is likely to be physically demanding for most players. Boss fights can take up to 20 minutes with non-stop action, which might be a good or bad thing depending on your personal preference. For me, it was just too grueling especially when you replay segments of a boss fight after dying. The game tries to help you out by placing checkpoints but they don't help a lot.All in all, this was a disappointing game for me given that I wanted to fully enjoy the experience, but simply could not due to the long, tiring/repetitive battles. The plot, environments, and the music drew me in, but my overall experience was tainted by the battle mechanics.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2013"}

Just like Super Mario World you kill enemies by jumping on top of them. And like Mario and Luigi collect coins to earn extra lives, Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong collect bananas because they're monkeys.King K. Rool, the biggest, cruelest enemy in this game has stolen all of the bananas form the Kongs' banana hoard and your goal is to defeat him to get all of the bananas back and to beat the game, but first of all you have beat each level and world (just like in Mario games) before you get to King K. Rool.But luckily the Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong have many friends who help them along the way. The smart-mouthed Cranky Kong is always there to provide a few laughs and tell some great stories. Funky Kong will give you a ride in his plane-like barrel that brings you to other worlds and levels that you want to play again or find the bonuses in. And Candy Kong is always there to save your game and blow you a kiss. There are also many animal friends such as Enguarde the swordfish, Rambi the rhino, and Winky the frog who help make the levels easier to beat.Donkey Kong Country became the best selling Super Nintendo game of all time for a good reason. The levels and trying to find all of the bonuses is very fun and challenging. The graphics seem way better than the 16-bit that they actually are. Donkey Kong Country also has great sound effects when you kill an enemy or lose a life and great music during the levels.If you beat the game or just get bored of playing by yourself you can change over to two player mode where you can chose to be a team where one of you controls Donkey Kong and the other Diddy, or play against each other. All 3 modes are very fun and provide several hours of fun.This is one of the best SNES games ever and should be added to your game collection as soon as you can get it. It's one of the best games of all time for a classic system!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2002"}

And it so far is a decently told story, not a great blockbuster but if you have watched enough Hong Kong cops and robbers movie, this is what you are getting. The story is simple: Drug kingpins are killing cops....kill all the kingpings until you find head kingpin....does it need to be more complex than that? NO!You will be too busy destroying everything in sight and I do mean everything. While you are making your merry romp thru the streets of Hong Kong, not only will you find that you can shoot up the set around you but also there are certain peices that you can shoot out to cause more destruction....properly placed baddies can be killed by exploding barrels, dropped air conditioning units, rocks and much more.And of course as you proceed, you get power ups as you go to slow down time (Tequila Time), hit enemies in certain spots (Precision  Aiming) and all out mass killing (Barrage)not to mention the signature Woo Mexican Standoff (which really is a mini game in and of itself).there are also many weapons including the Golden Pistols which you ca get early on if you know where to look.Does it get repitive after awhile? Sure...but it doesn't stop the fun. In fact there is one level that you play that lifts the idea from G.R.A.W. where you face attackers from a helicopter.How well does it control? It handles itself pretty well once you get it down pat. There are no changes to controls once you are dual wielding guns and if you ask me, sticking yourself behind coverage in some aspects handles a lot better than Gears of War. One button push, look and fire and run when done.Graphically speaking, the game looks pretty good. Tequila looks pretty well refined but the baddies look just like in the movies...a whole bunch of forgettable faces trying to kill you. The scenery also looks great but you won't have time to enjoy it as you are too busy shooting it all up and after you cleared it you get to see what's around you. There is a lot of attention paid to some of the details. You start wondering if these guys are gonna catch lung cancer from all the well rendered cigarettes smoked, the alleys look like some of the most unsafe places this side of New York.Soundwise, this game is gorgeous. The ambient sound from the city scenes will make you feel that this is a crapmed city. Babies crying, TVs being watched...yeah...you are there....when the guns go off they sound like they are all around you and when things blow?Well let's just say, turn down your subwoofer if you feel your neighbors paying a late visit if you wake them up. This is one of the most ambient sound sets I have heard since Call of Duty 2 interms of gunplay.To a point, I think maybe a brief tutorial could have been added to give players a chance to learn and practice some of the moves but on the other hand it's really hard to pull out some fo the moves used when it's hard to exactly get an idea where your enemies are going to appear.Also, some may complain that the game may be too 'railish' as you can't go everywhere in some sections but think of how much of a good thing that may be...while you are concentrating on trying to pull off a hard combo, you have to worry about sliding off a pier into the water. On the other hand, you can jump off a lot of objects and don't have to worry too muich about dying...whether it takes away from the realism....it's up to you...but then one man going up against 10+ enemies all shooting at him and not dying is a tiny bit absurd too hmm?To sum it up, if you want some mindless gunplay to tide you over til Halo 3, this is the game to play. This is the closest you can get to being in a Hong Kong flick without having to sign on stunt man. Try it as a rental first but if you really like it, buy it.Now if we can just get a decent Die Hard game......8 out of 10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2007"}

I like the game a lot the idea is unique and the world is so colorful and interesting it is almost art work at it's best a true vision with a twist.I would never tell anyone to pass this game up because of that above it is just fun. But there are some issues with the game. I continuously find myself getting lost in the game and this is a problem because it is not a free roaming game it is scripted. so that alone is a huge issue because you are following a story line but not always able to find it.The camera angle is enough to piss you off there is no lock feature and you must constantly dodge and move while in battle with some times 8 or more enemies while the camera does not follow you constantly causing you to die when fighting larger bosses.The idea of taking control of other characters memories or completely sniping them to use against your enemies while changing them to suite your needs in the story line is a unique and amazing idea it is actually fun to do when put alongside the fact that you are pretty much a memory assassin set out to change the world against the corporate tyranny that has turned the world into a chaotic mess.the main character is constantly struggling with what she has to do, while seemingly realizing that she must do it anyway for the greater good, it really adds some humanity to the game that is usually always lost in games these days. and that alone makes this a great game.There are a few minor annoyances, but it is a great game with a unique idea that is completely worth playing and supporting in a world of COD & WOW remakes.

(Probably it reflects my standing as a Ninja, eh?). But I managed to pull through convincingly at the end (with a lot of thought put into it) and the experience was just rewarding. To finish what I believe to be the Game of the Year on such a high was a deeply satisfying experience.The next time, I played the game on successive mode, and to my shock, I was able to finish it in less than 12hrs!.No it was not because Ninja Gaiden became easier (it gets tougher actually!), but I found certain subtleties in Ryu's combat I didn't know existed and learnt to use them intuitively. In short, Ninja Gaiden teaches a willing student a lot more than what the student perceived the first time. It isn't unfair, it just rewards a gamer whose adept and skillful at play. Ultimately, the more you learn, the more u'll come to appreciate this fantastic work of art.Story:Simple and straightforward. For centuries, the Clan of the Dragon Lineage has protected the Dark Dragon Blade, a legendary sword of unimaginable evil, that when wielded in the wrong hands, would unleash unspeakable horror upon the world. When the blade is stolen and the village is massacred, you, as Ryu Hayabusa, the last man standing, seeks to avenge the death of your fellow clan members by pursuing your mysterious and sinister enemy. You carry with you, the Dragon Blade, another legendary sword that is the counter part of the Dark Dragon Blade. The one who wields this to perfection will have nothing to fear, not even its twin-sister.Yes, to many (including me sometimes), the story starts on a strong note, but becomes second nature. The plot as the game progresses is trivial. However, a game of this quality needs only a few strings attached together to bring forth a conclusion. Because the beauty of the game lies somewhere else.Graphics:I said somewhere else....the beauty starts here. I have played Halo and had the opinion it was the most impressive looking game on any platform. I am sure most of you would feel the same with fond memories. But NG is THE defining game for graphics. It is cutting edge. Everthing, from character modelling to environment rendering is beyond compare. Mesmerising.Ryu himself is perfectly rendered, and fluidity of combat is something to be seen. Everthing looks 'shiny' that adds to the overall feel of awe. Each object has been rendered in great detail and texture rendering is pitch perfect. Astonishingly the game doesn't slow one bit even though it could choke most high end computers. Till now, I had a limited opinion of the XBOX (maybe coz' I don't use it too often).I had no idea of its power, until now. I am proud to own it. Trust me, this is a system seller and consoles other than XBOX cannot run this game. They just cannot. It is too taxing on the hardware. I feel sorry for you is you don't have this console.Gameplay:If graphics is the cream, then the gameplay is the icing on the cake. This is my first Ninja game,so my opinion is not derived out of comparing with other similar titles. From what I have seen, the gameplay is unrivalled. You don't wield guns and bombs (though your foes do!) ; it is all melee combat with a dose of shuriken and bow shooting. The fighting is intense and fast. It involves extremely intelligent play and rewards players who use brain than brawn. More than anything, Ryu is successful when he understands his foes. Everthing you do involves instinct and adriotness. This along with graphics is alone enough to make NG a killer. But no, there is more...Replay:NG is long. It spreads across 16 Chapters and each level, let alone a chapter, is massive and different. When you finish the game the first time, you unlock more difficult modes and in successive play mode, you carry with you certain precious items from the first play, to trade for some important stuff earlier than usual. Also you would want to experiment with the weapons you have and perfect urself in all combos. You will discover that some work better than others at certain situations u didn't know the first time. U'll also learn to play with a greater sense of speed to achieve higher Ninja rankings. Along with that, u get to unlock the original NG classics, the cinematics and the soundtrack. Hence all this adds tremendous replay value. It goes without saying you gotta be a Ninja by now or die in the first level itself!.Sound:The minute you listen to a track called 'Vanished memories' that plays when Ryu first enters his massacred village, you'd be baying for more. It is simply inspiring. A little bit of Japanese, a little bit of percussion. The end effect is just an uplifting piece of orchestra. U'll feel the same throughout the game with different set pieces and each level has distinctive music that characterizes the setting and the tension.The ambient sounds are also terrific and offer great variety of effects like when u smash u'r sword on different surface or foes. Top notch.Cinematics:Watch them to come to the conclusion that they are unmatched! Warcraft 3:Reign of Chaos (PC) was stupendous, but this is of a different league. 15 high quality movies that can numb your senses. They don't really push forward the story. But thatz besides the point isn't it?. They are there to reward you for a job well done. And add to this, the engine rendered cutscenes of such fluidity that u'd believe they were pre-animated. Phew!.Overall:If you are an FPS player, then NG may not be for you coz itz combat can either be glorious or totally frustrating. The camera also makes life difficult sometimes and you'd end up dying, which can be a total let down. But then, such minor flaws cannot overshadow a game of such quality. Ninja Gaiden's presentation has been detailed to perfection, even the end credits. You cant help but admire its authority over all other games, even if you aren't a fan of this genre. More importantly, you'll come to appreciate the sheer programming skill required to execute this game and believe me, it is ingenious. This game is now the benchmark, the pinnacle of programming. Buy it. Happy slashing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2004"}

{"product_name":"B000P297EI","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Fun","reviewText":"Devil May Cry 4 simply adds more demon slashing action to the series and doesn't really go anywhere new, however it looks amazing, so if you just want fun gameplay and some fantastic architecture to admire, you'll have a good time with this.This time around we have a new character called Nero who lives in a city called Fortuna that seems to be suffering a demon outbreak. Worse still, none other than Dante himself has appeared and done something shocking that puts him squarely on the side of the bad guys! Can this be true? All will be revealed if you play the game...As you would expect, the game charts your search (as Nero) through the land, fighting monsters all the way, searching for Dante. You'll travel through the elaborately detailed city, a huge castle, a lush jungle and several other locations, all of which look superb. I honestly spent several minutes in each area just enjoying the view!The graphics are amazing. The gameplay is also great fun, but as it mainly consists of fighting, this means it is familiar and not really changed from the other games of the series. You simply enter a new area, see that familiar \"blocked exit\" and then kill everything so that you can progress onward. The designers have added a few new bits and bobs, such as a dice rolling \"board game\" section, plus some new gimmicks like time-slowing devices and controllable masonry, but the general feel is the same. Nero looks and behaves almost exactly the same as Dante, so with his silver hair, black clothes and long coat, you won't really notice that you are playing a different character most of the time. Of course his moves are different, and he has a new \"reach out and grab\" move that I really liked (and which is the only really different thing about his set of skills), so things do feel a bit new here.So how hard is the challenge? Well I'm pleased to say that it's no breeze, but not hair-pullingly difficult. I found DMC1 very tough, DMC2 easy, and DMC3 I was too scared to play until they brought out the directors cut with an easy option! But on DMC4 I played on \"Devil Hunter\" mode and it was just the right level of challenge. The bosses were still pretty hard but I managed to cope with them - until the point where Nero has to fight Dante himself...oh my god at first I thought this was going to be the end of the game for me, but after much practice I finally learned what was required to beat him (hint: think of what Nero can do that Dante can't). After that, things got easier again for a while, and Dante becomes a playable character for a while - hooray! There is an impressive ending with both characters having to engage in epic battles, so it's all quite good fun.What you might be disappointed in is the fact that the areas of the game get re-recycled for Dante once you finish the first half the of the game with Nero. You also have to learn how to control Dante's skills just when you have played Nero long enough to be an expert in his moves - and THEN you have to switch back to Nero again right at the end of the game after becoming familiar with Dante! Monsters look good, although not as creepy...I didn't think the Scarecrows were as good as the Marionettes at the lower levels, and the Mephistos didn't spook me like those Sin Scissors used to (I think it was all the crazy cackling).Anyway, the bottom line is that it's fun. Not a long game - unless you play around with the extra modes and the Bloody Palace - and not with much depth, but it still packs a punch, so it's a good way to enjoy the visual capabilities of your PS3.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2009"}

You control one character while the other two act on their own, which frees you up a bit, and you can also change between all of them at your convenience. The story itself is fun, and the plotline goes along fairly smoothly. The graphics are pleasing to the eye, and I liked the elemental creatures that would join me during my quest. Some of the dungeons and palaces were beautiful.However, the repetition required for leveling up magic spells took away from the game. Much like Final Fantasy 2, you can only build up your magic through repeated use, which gets annoying and frustrating after a while. Having magic level-ups contigent on use is one feature that has never worked for me. I also didn't like the seemingly random opportunities to power up my weapons. Weapons upgrades coming with level ups would work just fine, but it got harder to upgrade weapons later on in the game, since the higher-level upgrades became increasingly difficult to find because they were dropped at random. I actually ended up using a cheat (Game Genie) to unlock all the weapons upgrades near the end of the game.If not for the magic/weapon upgrade hoo-ha here, this game would have gotten five stars from me. Still, it's overall a fun game to play, and I enjoyed it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2010"}

E Jackson","summary":"great collection... except X3","reviewText":"X2 was a pretty good, but nothing spectacular follow-up to the original MMX (even with its share of problems) but the third installment comes pretty close to being nothing more than a piece of garbage.Only two (count 'em, TWO) great things about this game: One, you can play as Zero. He may not be powerful (which is really odd when you think about it) and playing as him confirms Mega Man could kick his butt any day of the week, but even then, Zero has more noticeable problems. One, Capcom made the game so you can't fight the final boss in each stage with Zero (or even the halfway mini boss, for that matter). If you're playing as Zero and you want to go into a room where a boss is located, the game will force you to go back to Mega Man as your playable character. Want to fight Neon Tiger as Zero? Forget about it. Another bad thing about X3 is that, once you pick Zero as your playable character, you can only play as him once per level. So, for instance, if you enter Gravity Beetle's stage, you can't keep switching between him and Mega Man. Once per stage, and that's it.Zero is also pretty weak, taking a LOT more damage than Mega Man. That's the thing that surprises me the most. Why is he weaker than Mega Man? A simple shot from a typical robot will drain a good deal of Zero's health. So much for thinking Zero was some kind of indestructible monster. Zero can't use any of Mega Man's weapons, either. Zero has a sword and a blaster (the same blaster as Mega Man) and that's it. And the worst part: if you die with Zero one time in ANY level, you won't be able to play as him anymore in the game. This will also affect the ending of the game.Despite the problems, at LEAST you can play as him which gives the game some points.The other good thing is that the graphics have improved considerably. Shiny and crisp graphics in X3, which is a wonderful improvement over the first two X games.Now the bad. Everything else. The eight boss stages are a little longer than those in the previous two X games, but unfortunately, longer stages weren't even necessary because they're all so EMPTY (except Blizzard Buffalo's stage, perhaps). All the stages lack enemies. You basically just dash jump through many empty areas, and this happens at MANY points in each of the eight stages (and the Sigma stages, too). You can probably dash through most of these stages without even hitting the shoot button because hardly anything is there to shoot!The design of the stages are all lazy and boring. You have your ice, electric, forest, acid, and rock levels (variety is what we've come to expect from a Mega Man game) but it doesn't even matter because none of those stages are interesting to dash through. It's like Capcom said \"ok, we need a forest stage, let's put trees in there and then put it on the market\". They SHOULD have said \"ok, we need a forest stage, let's make it fun and challenging\". As for the other three stages... unfortunately, they all feel pretty much the same (and are very very boring). The first two stages of Sigma's castle are fun, even though they too, feel similar to each other.Horrible weapons. If you thought the weapons in X2 were bad, you haven't seen ANYTHING yet. Worthless weapons pretty much tell the story in X3 such as Acid Burst (which shoots a tiny green ball of acid) Tornado Fang and Frost Shield (which are basically the same painfully SUPER-slow weapon, with only minor differences separating the two- the Tornado Fang is like a drill, and the Frost Shield is a hunk of ice). A LITTLE drill moving across the screen and a LITTLE hunk of ice moving across the screen. SLOW and BORING. You have Gravity Well (a weapon which *very* slowly kills nearby enemies- I hope you're a patient person) and the Parasite Bomb is just a weak bomb that slowly shoots forward and locks onto an enemy, and kills them after a few seconds go by. Maybe I could forgive the weak-looking weapons if they actually did some serious damage, but they don't. Heck, throwing dirt on those robots would probably do more damage to them (if such an option existed!) Only THREE weapons save the game (somewhat). The Ray Splasher is quite powerful, the way it shoots numerous mini bullets, and the Triad Thunder is an electrical triangular flashy delight! The Spinning Blades are pretty fun too.Another problem is that X3 doesn't FEEL as fast overall as the previous two X games (probably in part due to, again, the weak weapons, and the absence of things to shoot). The pace has calmed down, and that's the LAST thing a Mega Man game should be doing. Mega Man himself moves just as quickly as before, but everything else surrounding him seems to be in slow-motion. Even the bosses feel like they are moving in slow motion. X1 and X2 moved MUCH faster. Must be the special chip in the game making things move so damn slow (though if that's the case then I can't explain why the pace was so fast in X2, since that game also had a special chip).Finally we arrive to the last problem (that I can think of right now, anyway). The bosses are very boring because half of them fight you the EXACT same way. You shoot them, you jump on the wall, they run at you, you jump over them, you shoot them, you jump on the wall, they run at you, you jump over them, you shoot them, etc. Bit, Byte, Toxic Seahorse, Sigma, Dr. Doppler, Blizzard Buffalo, Volt Catfish, Vile, and a few others will give you pretty much the exact same fight. And before you say \"it's always been like that in a Mega Man game\", keep in mind that before this game came out, bosses fought you in a more creative and unpredictable fashion (not just the X series either). I fail to see ANY creativity here. Too many slow, lazily-designed and predictable boss battles in X3 which in turn is just another reason the game is so incredibly easy (because you know what they're going to do). If the bosses did more interesting things to try and defeat you besides a simple back and forth battle, then I'd think more highly of the game. Granted, it's not simple if you consider yourself a slow player (because some of those bosses speed up as they get closer to their death). But when it comes to strategy, yes, it's simple. You'll know what to do, believe me.And this game is, how much? WAY too much. Only buy X3 if you can find it cheap, which you can't, so avoid. Don't worry, you aren't missing much.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00BGAA29M","description":"","reviewerName":"GarionOrb","summary":"A surprisingly great game that quickly became my favorite PS4 launch title!","reviewText":"Knack has the distinction of being the very first PlayStation 4 game ever revealed, and the reception to it was tepid, to say the least.  As the PS4 launch inched closer and Sony showed more of the game, that tepidness didn&#8217;t go away.  In fact, it got worse.  Lead game designer Mark Cerny didn&#8217;t help matters when he went on record saying that Knack was &#8220;old fashioned&#8221; and &#8220;a good secondary purchase&#8221; for the PS4.  I admit I wasn&#8217;t all that interested in Knack.  The pre-release videos showed a very unpolished game with a low frame rate and sub-par visuals for a next-gen console.  Then, Sony graciously set up PS4 demo kiosks in stores, and I got my first impressions of Knack.  It was actually a lot of fun!  Not the most polished, but very competent.  I preordered the game the next day.Now, the PS4 is finally here and Knack was the very first game I played on it.  I am extremely pleased to report that it very quickly became my favorite PS4 game, and I can&#8217;t believe I almost passed up on it.  Knack is tons of fun, looks absolutely stunning and has all the makings of a hit franchise for Sony.  However, it&#8217;s not without some shortcomings.We&#8217;ll start with the good.  The gameplay is rock solid.  You control Knack, a magical golem made up of &#8220;relics&#8221;.  Throughout the game, Knack will absorb more relics and increase in size and power.  You walk through the game&#8217;s levels and punch through enemies in a fashion similar to God of War and Ratchet & Clank, though not as varied.  Knack has an evade maneuver and can also do a jump attack.  Also at his disposal are three powerful special moves that can take out multiple foes at once.  These use up crystal energy, which is limited and can be replenished by smashing crystals liberally sprinkled throughout the levels.  The combat in this game is extremely satisfying!  It doesn&#8217;t take much to kill Knack&#8230;most enemies can kill you in 2-3 hits while some can kill you in a single hit.  Therefore, you can&#8217;t simply go in fists blazing.  Combat is more strategic and methodical.  You must dodge, jump and strike when the moment is right.  The difficulty can get pretty high, but I was surprised to find that not a single death in this game felt cheap, or as a result of game design.  Believe me when I say, combat is tight and is clearly where a lot of the development focused.  The enemies themselves are varied throughout the game, with new types introduced at a regular pace until the very end.  This does a good job of keeping things from getting repetitive.  Death results in restarting from one of the many regularly-placed checkpoints, so you never end up replaying large chunks of level.  Be wary though, your crystal energy does not replenish after you die, which means saving these powers strategically is important.The game&#8217;s presentation is surprisingly top-notch.  Graphics are vividly colorful and environments are strikingly detailed.  The early previews made it difficult to judge how &#8220;next gen&#8221; the game truly looked, but rest assured that these ARE next generation visuals.  The PS4 easily handles moving around such detailed environments 99% of the time, and while you do get an occasional frame rate dip it doesn&#8217;t happen often nor does it interfere with the gameplay.  The voice acting is also nicely done, and the characters are memorable.  The story proved to be better than expected, though still predictable at times.  There definitely could&#8217;ve been more polish here&#8230;several times the story gets by with some truly laughable deus ex machina.  But overall, I found myself enjoying the narrative and wouldn&#8217;t mind seeing it again on another playthrough.  The soundtrack is fantastic, with upbeat and cinematic orchestral flair.Yet for everything that the game gets right, it does sometimes seem as though everything stops just shy of completion.  It&#8217;s as if the team at Japan Studio had a ton of great ideas, but ran out of time to bring them all to complete fruition.  The afore-mentioned deus ex machina in the story is one example.  Another is the linear level design.  The levels have so many opportunities to branch out, yet they don&#8217;t and so you are traversing a very set path.  I&#8217;m not saying it should be open world, but the developers should have looked at God of War, Jak & Daxter or Ratchet & Clank for inspiration on how to do these kinds of levels completely.  Collectibles are scattered unevenly throughout the game, but there should be more of them.  Especially since collecting parts leads to game perks that 90% of players will never see.  The way it works is that treasure chests are placed in (pretty obvious) hidden areas, but the contents of the treasures are random.  You might collect special relics, which unlock different versions of Knack (e.g. Vampire Knack), or you might collect components that become boosts to your abilities.  But there aren&#8217;t enough treasure chests to collect everything, so by the end of the game you MIGHT unlock one or two special components.  Forget about collecting all the special relics&#8230;you need a huge amount of them.  Now once you beat the game, you unlock New Game+ where you can replay from the beginning with all your collected trinkets intact.  This adds replayability, but alienates those gamers who don&#8217;t generally replay games.  Also, the player has no control over how large Knack gets.  It would be cool if you could regulate that yourself, which could lead to some cool moments.  However, the largeness of Knack is fully dependent on the story.  It doesn&#8217;t really hinder the game that much, but it would&#8217;ve added another layer.All this results in a very fun game that has room for improvement.  If they ever make a Knack 2 that improves upon all this (which I would LOVE to see happen), it could truly be a triple-A title for the PS4.  As it stands now, Knack is a better-than-average launch title.  I&#8217;m actually very disheartened by the low scores it&#8217;s getting from professional reviewers, because it deserves so much more than that.  Plus it seems as though many people who actually play the game find themselves equally perplexed at how it&#8217;s managed to score so badly despite being such a great title.  I&#8217;m definitely glad I decided to purchase Knack.  I really wouldn&#8217;t have wanted to miss it.  You shouldn&#8217;t either.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

Granted, now and then there would but they were few and far-between.  It's now been remade with MGS2's gameplay and graphics style and while it may not have that coolness when you played it for the first time on original Playstation, it's still highly enjoyable.Story: Terrorists have kidnapped 2 powerful men and want the remains of Big Boss(the villain who died in Metal Gear 2) returned. If not, they will launch a nuclear weapon. Your job is to rescue the 2 and find out if they can launch and disable them if they do. Over the course of the game, you'll encounter a unique group of enemies, an old enemy and many twists and turns.Graphics: Maybe it's just my copy but some of the graphics, particularly skies looked rather bad and blocky. There's more detail in character models and surroundings. Familiar places in PS1 now get a more polished run through. The graphics really shine during the cutscenes although there's a sense of overdoneness to them.Sound/Music: Probably the best use of voice acting ever. They've been redone so some of the original lines are altered and some just don't work but the voices are great anyways. My personal favorite is the oh-so-arrogant sounding Liquid Snake and the gruff hero. The music is nice but it doesn't have that epicness that Harry Gregson Williams brought to 2 and 3.Gameplay: Everything's pretty much the same as PS1 besides some new features. Hanging over rails and first person shooting(which makes some of the areas and boss fights so much easier(may be a bad thing but personally I hated trying to shoot Ocelot in the original, now it's easier). One complaint I had was that the Map and CODEC screens are now done by pressing Start and B or A respectively while it was just one button in PS1 and PS2 games. The control scheme is slightly awkward too. I couldn't lower my gun in First Person without wasting a bullet.One thing that made me replay the original quite a few times was the story. Complicated but easily understandable with twists and turns that kept you interested(unlike MGS2 where it was just complicated for the hell of it).One complaint is in the cutscenes which normally I wouldn't mind. While well done, there's a degree of too much to them. Snake flips and dodges and rolls all over the place Matrix style and simple movements get the slow motion treatment. In the original, one scene involving a character decimating an entire hallway of guards was only heard and you saw the carnage afterwards, here it's in plain view which to me takes away the mystery of the first one.All in all, I tend to hate remakes of any form but this is definately one to pick up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2004"}

But, for those who've never played a Resistance game, please understand that these are not complaints. These are good things.Stage and sound design are ridiculously good in this entry. But the story didn't do much for me. And I've never actually been drawn enough to the Resistance multi-player to even try it out.

You are Jason Brody and, along with two of your brothers, your girlfriend, and other friends, you arrive at what appears to be an island paradise.  It turns out that the islands have secrets.  You and your companions are captured by pirates and are to be ransomed and sold into slavery.  You must escape, rescue the people that you arrived with, and escape the island.Since you are a stranger to this land, you will need help to navigate and to survive.  You find this help through local people known as the Rakyat.  You trade favors with them and others to progress.  During your adventure you undergo psychological changes that will test your resolve because to survive . . . you must kill.GAMEPLAY:There is plenty to explore on the islands.  From caves both above ground and underwater to hidden areas that can only be accessed with explosives, you will find a lot to do.  Simply standing on a mountain top and soaking in the view is breath taking.Gameplay and controls are solid throughout the experience and boredom is unlikely.  This is an open-world first-person-shooter action/adventure.  The elements of story draw you in from the beginning and convey feelings of adrenalized excitement, sorrow, fear, and badassery.You have objectives to progress the main story, but there are no time constraints.  You are free to procrastinate on the objectives and explore, which can actually help you out.  There are, however, certain elements of the game that will only unlock once you achieve main story objectives.Climbing dilapidated radio towers to disable frequency jammers will unshroud parts of the map.You hunt to collect animal skins so you can upgrade items such as your rucksack.  Upgrades allow you to hold more inventory items, weapons, ammo, etc.There are three skill trees to enhance your performance and during the course of the game you will be able to activate every skill.There are enemy outposts throughout the world for you to conquer.  Once you clear out an outpost, friendlies move in to keep it guarded and it becomes a fast travel location.Besides fast travel, you can get around in various ways.  There are land vehicles such as cars, jeeps, trucks, dune buggies, and quad-runners.  For water transport you have boats and jet skis.  You can also swim and will be required to do so at times.  Air travel is another available option.  Hang gliders are a great way to travel, conduct surveillance, or just take in the sights.  Eventually, you get a wing suit and a parachute and both of these items never need restocked.There are animals, both predator and prey.  You will often catch sight of a predator hunting its prey and, if it sees you, it will hunt you too.  Some enemy outposts have caged predators and you can shoot their cages which will allow their escape.  They will then commence attacking everyone in the camp until either they kill everyone or are killed themselves.  This is a great way to help clear outposts of enemies.The animals look and sound authentic.  Usually, you will hear them, and before long, you will be able to identify them by sound alone.Some animals that I found particularly interesting were the bear, the shark, the Komodo dragon, and the alligator.  The Komodo dragon is very low to the ground and they like tall grass so sometimes they are hard to spot, but they make a distinguishing hissing sound.The A. I. for animals and enemies is rather good.  If you are concealed, you can hide from both, but if you are too noisy or if an enemy spots you, they will attack.  Some enemies will rush you and some will take cover to protect themselves.  If the enemy is not sure where you are then they will split up and search different areas.Controlling the vehicles is easy and fun.The entire adventure is a blast, not only due to game content, but also because everything looks so fantastic.Side quests abound and can entail hunting a particular animal with a specific weapon type, killing a certain individual with a knife, or trials that are like mini-games that have you killing as many enemies as possible as the clock counts down.A couple of times I found myself stuck in a crevice and thought that I would have to reload the save game.  Ubisoft, however, has built in a nice feature for such occasions.  When caught in this situation, simply jump a few times toward the direction you would like to go and the game gives you a boost-like a super jump-to get yourself out of this predicament.  This is the first game, that I know of, to offer such a feature.  This could be a glitch, but to me it felt like the programmers put this in intentionally.There are times when you can't step up without jumping.  An example is that a piece of flat wood may stop you.  Also, you will enter swim mode in very shallow water.  While the former is only a minor annoyance from time to time, the latter just seems a bit odd.  Neither of these things hinders gameplay.Boss fights are quicktime events.  I have no issues with quicktime events, but for boss fights it seemed a little anti-climatic.  They were still a lot of fun though.GRAPHICS:The graphics are phenomenal.  This is clearly one of the best looking PS3 games ever made.  Character lip synchronization is spot on right down to how people use their tongues to form words.  This adds a definite realism and makes encounters more compelling.There is occasional graphic pop-up.  This can occur when you are traveling in the open and distant objects can appear as you close in on them.  The issue is minimal.  I only noticed a couple instances of graphic tearing and they involved a fallen enemy partially sunk into the ground.SOUND:Footsteps are appropriate to the terrain.  Whether you are walking or running on grass, dirt, rock, metal, or water; the sound is realistic.  Vehicle motors, animals, wind, weapons, thunder and rain, and all character's voices sound realistic.  The music rocks and melds with the moments of your adventure.  The music on the radio of vehicles is horrible, but when you are on an island in the middle of nowhere I suppose you are lucky to get anything at all.  It fits the situation.  No FM radio here.NPCs:I classify this area as high-level and low-level NPCs.  High-level NPCs are characters that are part of the main story and low-level NPCs are standard enemies.  Each high-level NPC is interesting with their own personality.  As in real life, some are good and some are just plain crazy.  One nemesis you have is called Vaas (see cover art).  Vaas is a psychopath.  He murders without remorse or regret.  I don't think he is capable of feeling either.  Since Vaas is the leader of the pirates, I expected to see much more of him, however, Vaas's presence in the game is fairly minimal, but in the time you get to spend with Vaas you absorb just how crazy this guy really is.  I nominate him for villain of the year.As far as the low-level NPCs go, this is a world of clones.  Not only will you see clones in different areas of the world, but you will see them grouped together at times.All NPCs are well rendered with great detail.  Their faces show emotion very well.  They go about their own tasks in this living virtual world.ISSUES:The only real drawback that I found with this game was with the selling of items in your inventory.  Even if you have ten identical items, you must sell them one at a time.  There is no option to choose the item, select how many to sell, and then make one transaction.  Other than this, I found no other issues of note.SUMMARY:I have not yet experienced the multiplayer aspect of the game.  Uplay is available and can be used to treat yourself with a PS3 theme and items that can be used in both single and multiplayer.Far Cry 3 looks amazing.  It is loaded with content and detail.  Gameplay and controls are solid and the story is involving.  There are plenty of side quests and just exploring is a blast.  If you are a fan of FPS or adventure games then you will enjoy Far Cry 3.  It is on my list as one of the best games ever made.  This is an adventure worth taking.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2013"}

Unlike other music games, which penalize players if they don't play perfectly,Wii Musicis a musical playground where there are no mistakes. Here anyone can pick up and master the huge array of instruments available, through simple motions like strumming and drumming. Musicians in your band jam by simply playing their instruments to the beat of a song or by improvising to their heart's content. Play faster. Play slower. Skip a beat, or throw in 10 more. No matter what you do,Wii Musicautomatically transforms your improv stylings into great music.Your music, your waySimple pickup and playability.View larger.Easy controls and learning curve.View larger.Huge array of diverse instruments.View larger.Make music by yourself.View larger.Or with up to 3 friends.View larger.Gameplay: Getting Your Band TogetherInWii Musicevery band has six members: Two play the main melody, two cover the percussion beats, one covers the bass groove and one uses the song's chords to support the melody. As a band, the six members often play their special parts at the same time, though each player can jam however and whenever he or she wants. Play all at once. Take turns in the spotlight. Pair up in creative ways throughout the song. You can bring the band to life by yourself, playing one part at a time-or with up to four players. See game mode below:Solo Play: When you play by yourself, you can add one part at a time to arrange the whole song exactly how you want. The Tutes are on hand to back up your band in any parts you need filled.Multiplayer: When in a band with friends, up to four people can be band members.Wii Friends: Using WiiConnect24, you can send your jam videos to Wii Friends who own Wii Music. They can then watch your performance, modify it to their liking and send their jam videos back to you.Tutes: Your Own Private Back-up BandWhen not playing with friends, you can invite jam masters known as Tutes to play with you. They'll join a session playing an instrument that each thinks is strong for a specific song. You can simply enjoy the musical camaraderie, or pick up instrument tips by watching them jam. If you choose to watch, the Tutes will show you lots of techniques for many of these instruments, then ask you to follow their examples. They'll start with the simplest techniques, then as you master each one, show you even more nuanced ones.Key Game Features:Easy to Play Improv Jams- All members of your band jam by simply playing their instruments to the beat of a song or by improvising to their heart's content. Play faster. Play slower. Skip a beat, or throw in 10 more.Wii Musicchallenges you to transform your improv stylings into great music. There are no mistakes and no game scores-just playing for the pure joy of playing.Wii Controls Immerse You in the Music- You can play most of the 60-plus instruments inWii Musicusing simple motions with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers. Strum to play guitar, banjo and sitar. Drum to play jazz drums, congas and snare drums. Hammer away to play piano, vibraphone and marimba. Unlike most music games,Wii Musicdoesn't make you use many complex buttons. You only need to imitate playing the instrument.Virtually Endless Ways to Make Music- You choose the song and instruments and decide whether to blaze through a rock take on classical songs, put a jazzy spin on folk tunes or transform Nintendo classics like theSuper Mario Bros.theme into Latin-flavored numbers. The song list is only a takeoff point-it's how you improvise with the songs that matters.Share Your Band Jams With Friends- They'll see your Mii band members, your players' improv styles and your instrument selections. They can watch your recordings, or play over parts of your song, then send their modified recording back to you. So you can send improv jams back and forth over WiiConnect24, changing them again and again.60+ InstrumentsYou can play most of the 60-plus instruments inWii Musicusing simple motions with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers.

Make them play quickly, slowly, strongly or gently-the orchestra is at your command.Handbell Harmony: In this musical mini-game, you'll play in a handbell ensemble by swinging your Wii Remote and Nunchuk. Everyone on the team has a job to do: play one of your notes only when the tune demands it.Pitch Perfect: How good is your musical ear? In this whimsical musical quiz, you'll have to solve challenges, like putting note-playing Miis in order from lowest to highest pitch.Drum Mode: In the one mode that uses the Wii Balance Board accessory (sold withWii Fit), you can feel what it's like to play a real-life drum set. You'll use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk as drumsticks, and place both feet on the Wii Balance Board-which work as virtual pedals for the bass drum and hi-hat cymbal.","reviewerName":"Kyle Slayzar","summary":"Musical Creativity with Limitless Potential (With Minor Issues)","reviewText":"I love the recent string (no pun intended) of musical games coming out from Guitar Hero to Rock Band.  Problem is, those kits are flippin' expensive and I'm not too keen on storing either plastic guitars or bulky drum sets.  Don't get me wrong, I own them anyway but lugging them to a friend's house is no fun task.Enter Wii Music.Wii music is pantomime meets Rock Band.  The bulk of the game revolves around the player mimicking gestures to simulate sound according to the actual song being played as the notes are hit automatically unless the player's timing is off.  The player does this up to six different instruments to simulate melody, bass, percussion etc.  When the player is done, he or she can make a CD jacket to label the track and make a music video of it.  On top of this, there are three minigames.1:  Wii Conductor.  Move your arms similar to a conductor to make an orchestra go.2:  Hand bells like the ones some people use in Christmas musicals or church services.3:  Music quiz thingy similar to the memorization game on Wii Play.That's it!  That is, in a nutshell, the entire game.While the game itself is simplistic, that is also the idea.  Nintendo, in it's grand scheme of marketing to the casual gaming audience, has created a very simple, yet elegant, game to allow the player to easily mimic music without real lessons or going nuts while trying to play Through the Fire and Flames on Guitar Hero 3.  In doing so, Nintendo has appealed to anyone who desires a musical experience but either A) doesn't have the time to master easy, medium, hard, and extreme mode and/or B) does not have at least $80 to spend on a Guitar Hero set.  All that is needed is at least one full Wii remote and nunchuck set although more sets with more players make it more fun.While up to six instruments may participate in a song, only four players can go at a time although this does not mean the player can record tracks for all six instruments.  This means four people at a time can go nuts with over 60 instruments including cowbell (which we all know we need more of), a DJ turntable, recorder, flute, sitar, and much more.This game is very addicting.  My graduate students friends are playing the game in my apartment as I type this, not only having a blast but hogging the darn TV in the process.  They're hooked on Ode to Joy, which we arranged with sleigh bells, a flute, and a clarinet.  When working on my thesis for more than five hours at a time gnaws at my brain, I love saddling up the Wii and playing Twinkle Twinkle on the piano.Now, with all the goodies in Wii Music there are a few drawbacks especially with the sound and selected songs.  Unlike Guitar Hero, Wii Music's musical selection is mostly derived from the public domain track list.  This means it's very generic songs like Twinkle Twinkle, Yankie Doodle, Ode to Joy, and Swan Lake.  This constitutes the bulk of the soundtrack.  There are a few good licensed songs like September by Earth, Wind, and Fire along with Loco-Motion.  The real songs that everyone bought Wii Music to play are the Nintendo mixes like Legend of Zelda and the Mario Bros Theme Song.  Unfortunately, there are only seven Nintendo songs and of that only three are any good (the aforementioned two and F Zero Mute City).The soundtrack could have been soooo much better even with more licensed songs by Nintendo such as Castlevania, Star Fox, Metroid, and Paperboy.  Anything would've been better than the ragtag bunch of songs from Europe that were used.  Not to mention they could've used some greater public domain songs like Greensleeves or Battle Hymn of the Republic.The next con is the sound itself.  While the majority of the woodwinds and drums sound magnificent, several other instruments do not.  The most notable bad sounding instruments are the trumpet, saxophone, violin, and viola.  Don't even get me started on the more... interesting instruments like the cheerleader, the black belt, cat and dog suit, and the rapper.  Those wacky things seemed to have carried over from Mario Paint despite a 15 year gap.  While having an all-male cheerleading squad sing the Legend of Zelda theme song was disturbingly amusing, I would never be so bold as to show that in public.The only other cons are basic Nintendo ones such as the use of weird instructional characters.  The Maestro instructor looks and talks like a more flamboyant homosexual version of Beaker from the Muppets.  The other issue is how the remote distinguishes movement for the cursor and that of the instrument itself.  It can get very annoying but I find that if I want to switch, just hold the remote in front of the TV for two seconds and the cursor switches over from the instrument.All in all, Wii Music is a really fun game for the whole family and your friends if you've consumed enough alcohol... seriously.  I give it a solid A- as it fully utilizes the Wii interface but lacks in some sound and musical selection issues.  It's too bad you can't really go heavy metal... *sigh* party on Wayne!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2008"}

Washington \"CogsnWheels\"","summary":"This game is a sleeper","reviewText":"I can honestly say that I wasn't expecting this game to be as fun as it is.. I think that part of what makes this game fun is that it wasn't hyped up like some other titles that hit PS3 like Haze, Star Wars Force Unleashed. Not taking away from any of these games but typically hype can be a double edged sword because games never quite meet expectations when there is hype. Anyway I rented this game because I wasn't sure about it & honestly I wish I would of bought it.. You feel like you are in a science fiction/horror movie flick reminiscent of Event Horizon, Aliens, etc. The graphics are excellent because they are dark, but very detailed & the sound is superb. When low on health your character labors for breath because he is weak & when running great distances his breathing is labored. Not to mention the suspenseful music when the enemies jump out at you & scare the crap out of you. This game reminds me of the very 1st Resident Evil that was created back in the 90's on the 1st Playstation. This is definitely a survival horror game at its greatest. I am not going to go into the specific details in my review because there are several reviews that have covered the technical logistics on the strong points of this game. All I can say is that if you are a fan of sci-fi horror flicks, get this game!! Turn all the lights off & crank up the sound & prepare to have the crap scared out of you LOL..","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2008"}

It seemed like it would be really different from the first two, and it was, but in a good way. It was fresh, something new. I really enjoyed it the entire way through and it had a deep story to it. No spoilers, but I thought that the ending was really good. I had heard a lot of complaints about it, but I guess different people-different opinions.The game itself had me entertained through pretty much the whole thing. It has a lot more &#34;slow&#34; moments than the first two did, but it gives you a chance to look around the incredible environment. My computer is too weak to turn the settings way up, but even on mid-low, the scenery is just wow good. It took me a while to re-learn everything with the different names and effects, but the learning curve isn't too bad.While I definitely miss Rapture, I'm glad they didn't drag it into the ground and I can happily remember it. Columbia is a really interesting world to explore. BioShock Infinite is also much less linear than BioShock 2 was, and probably even less then the first one. You can go back to different areas fairly often, and your not &#34;trapped&#34; to one place.Overall, I would definitely recommend BioShock Infinite as I had a load of fun playing it for the roughly 13 hours it took to beat it. It really got me into it and I had trouble taking a break. Great game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2014"}
{"product_name":"B002I0KOSI","description":"","reviewerName":"the gamer","summary":"Not as good as the first 2 but still good.","reviewText":"Okay I got this because I enjoyed the first two Bioshock games and was eager to see this one in action. Now when you start off it is a bit strange and reminiscent of the first game. Once you beat the game things will make A LOT more sense but also confuse you as well. I wont ruin the plot or surprises for you just letting you know.Now once the game starts going you will find yourself using guns and vigors (basically plasmids from the first 2 games). However with this being up in the air on air ships and such with the sun always around and people acting like there isn't a care in the world it isn't as scary as the first game. Some of the plasmids are fun while some are kinda a waste. Same with the guns only a few seem all that great.Something though that bothered me a heck of a lot while playing this game was realizing no one else ever uses vigors. They are advertised like crazy and they are thrown away or hidden here or there yet everyone you face (except for 1-2 that maybe are using vigors, such as someone who throws fire but looks like they are in a fire retardant suit, and a guy who disappears and reappears and uses crows to attack you) all just use guns never vigors. Why would all these people who live in a world where there are these powers that can help you in a battle only use guns against a single guy who can throw fire or ice etc? Made no sense to me at all.Also from gameplay and trailers before the game came out there was talk of Elizabeth starting to get hurt or something from using her powers to often. She seemed to have telekinesis as well as bringing things into the world such as turrets etc. But in the trailers and such (even the game developers talked about it) she would get a bloody nose and seemed to get hurt. I was under this impression when playing the game so I tried to limit using her powers unless I absolutely needed to. Then near the end of the game you see that was never gonna happen it kinda pisses you off you played it safe with her life when there was no danger.Also one gameplay video showed something like time changing while you were playing. Such as signs and buttons etc changing in real time while your playing. Such as a man talking to a bunch of empty chairs about bringing up arms or something then when you grab one of the guns in a barrel he has set up around he gets all upset and while you look at him his button on his shirt changes. It was obvious something more was planned for this game that would have made it more fun possibly but something happened which caused those things to be thrown out and I don't know why. I don't know why they changed up the game so much but they did.If I could talk to Kevin Levine and ask him what happened with those things and why he made those changes that would be great cause im thinking while making the game they started to do those things then had to take them out and because they were set with a schedule they had to rush which is maybe why this game just didn't seem as great as it should be.At the end of the game it will answer some things you were wondering about but it will also kinda make you question a lot like many gamers have stated. However, you might find yourself thinking back to the first game (and the second possibly) and kinda being like &#34;this game wasn't as much fun as those&#34; because unfortunately that's how I felt a bit.After seeing an interview or two with Kevin Levine he stated how he isn't all that interested in making games or at least helping with the game only making stories. Since this game he had more control probably it kinda shows that gameplay took a back seat to story telling. And I think that's what made this game suffer.I also felt it was to short. I kept expecting it to keep going in some spots where it just ended.This game was a lot of fun but it fell short here or there and that's kinda why I took a star away. Some people might feel differently but my impressions/hopes going into this was expecting something more fun then what I got.The ending of this game kinda opens the door to more sequels but at the same time maybe not. I know a lot of gamers seemed to want him to return to Rapture and with the DLC he kinda did but I heard that wasn't that great as well. I am not sure what the future holds for this series but im kinda worried its gonna start turning into just stories, good ones but just stories and the gameplay will fall short.I hope my review helped I can't really say much more cause otherwise I might start ruining the plot or something.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2014"}

Well this game is a tiny  bit better as far as visuals, and a little more bloody (which I like; if you're playing a shooter, it's more realistic to have a HAVOC type engine with blood, ragdoll physics and so on, instead of the \"enemy\" just dropping where they are, and their body disappearing 20 seconds later). but it's too short, too linear, and in my opinion, not worth $60.You play as 2 characters, sort of like in \"The Getaway,\" but this is back in about 1870 so there are no cars to jack, the weapons are simple, and you don't have too many original things to do. The controls to me were awful; very confusing; I'd try to draw a gun, but bring out a Bible instead, now, I like the Bible, but it doesn't do much good when you bring a Bible to a gunfight, ha ha. The shooting part is frustrating; the enemies can take like 10 hits, unless you manage a head shot, but you can take about 4. You only have limited ammo; you can take guns off dead enemies, but they usually have less ammo than you did, because they shoot at you non stop, whether you are hiding are not, (and hit you sometimes at random, when they cant even see you, which SUCKS); and since headshots are hard to hit with the lousy controls, you have to use 7 or 8 shots to take an enemy down, so when you get to that big gunfight parts you will have like 5 bullets left and die quck. And unless you hide a lot and \"rest\" you will die, and reset a lot. The save system sucks; autosave at certain points, no quicksave.The gameplay is disappointing; very linear. You can only go to certain areas. You can't shoot innocents (at least I was never able to), which I HATE in a shooter. \"Freeform\" games are supposed to give you the choice of being evil or not. A big part of  that `is getting to kill innocents. If you cant do that, the game sucks, IMO. (I know, I'm bad, but thats my preference-I don't ALWAYS kill innocents I just like to know I CAN).Gameplay is too short-not even 10 hours. Multiplayer didn't impress me. There's either no one else on line, or brats that think theyre playing Halo 2. This game is not recommended; especially at full price. If you're interested, get the demo first; you'll see a good sample of how the gameplay and controls are frustating (stupid me, I figured the full game would be better. I was mistaken). If you're still interested, RENT first. If you STILL want it, wait at least till the price drops DONT pay $60 for it.NOT reccommeneded. If you want something like this \"GUN\" is a better game and is $19.95 now.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00BI83EVU","description":"","reviewerName":"H Kim","summary":"Gotta give it a try","reviewText":"The only downside about this game is graphics.  When I was playing Knack and Killzone Shadow fall, graphics blew my mind away though the game-play was just mediocre. When I was playing this game, for example, Aiden's sister Nicky's face was clearly last gen's graphics, with hair look so blurry. I guess that's what happens when the game is developed cross-gen. But the graphics alone is not enough for me to bring it down to a four star game.Besides graphics, the gameplay is awesome. Shooting and driving are very smooth. I just want to finish the campaign as fast as possible so I didn't bother hacking other players, though I myself got hacked three time and I killed the hacker just once.  The puzzles are really simple; just look for the cameras and it will solve everything. I personally don't like complicated puzzles because when I play, I want to enjoy, not use my brain to work out something. Give it a try and you won't be disappointed.For the purpose of better graphics, I really look forward to next gen only games, like Assassin's Creed Unity.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00019HNNM","description":"The close of a trilogy is a touchy thing. Miramax's slasher pic Scream 3 highlighted the role of each part: Chapter one sets the rules. Chapter two bends the rules. And chapter three throws them all out the window in favor of taking the story full circle.Which brings us to the third part of the Onimusha trilogy, subtly titled Demon Siege. In the first of many switches from the franchise's usual MO, there are three playable characters &#8211; Jean Reno's Jaques, the first Onimusha's Samanosuke, and Parisian military woman Michelle. Each offers wildly different play mechanics, and this coupled with the game's time warp storyline (more on that later) offers needed variety to a survival horror franchise that was never really know for its fear factor.Each character will upgrade their weapons and skills through the course of the game (much less so for Michelle, as she's playable for far less of the game than the other two) in the usual fashion&nbsp;&#8211; collecting souls. Without a combo-laden combat system, Demon Siege relies heavily on timing and strategy to master each of the three warriors. This mechanic is very reminiscent of Enter the Matrix for two reasons: minimal button presses result in onscreen action that looks very, very cool. Two, the timing of action is far more crucial than combos. The difference is that Demon Siege is just a much better game &#8211; the enemies offer more variety, the control is more precise, and the elemental weaponry is extremely varied.While some action hardcores will likely fault the game for its simple control scheme, most will appreciate it for the satisfaction it brings to the screen. Kicking a demon away so you have better range with the Ball and Chain of Doom (my name for it, not the game's) is quite cool, after all. Just keep in mind that plot and combat play equal roles in the Onimusha universe, and each are doled out fairly.On the story side of things, Demon Siege has that dual time period hook. How well is the idea executed? Well, Paris really looks like Paris; and without being able to experience feudal Japan firsthand, all I can say is that it looks beautiful in the game. The plot unfolds at a lightning pace and requires players to use one character (in one time period) to do something, which has an effect on the other character (in the other time period). Switching frequently, the game's pace is so well crafted that there are few places that seem to be a pause &#8211; you'll always want to do that next thing.What I really like about this game is that I always felt like I was getting a new weapon, going to a new area, or fighting a new boss (most of which are ferociously tough, by the way). There was no drag for me. That, and kicking Genma butt made me look badass. Personally, I wouldn't want anything else for my favorite samurai/horror sendoff.Concept:Craft a compelling, edge-of-your seat action game to conclude the Onimusha seriesGraphics:3D backgrounds don't mean that players have camera control, but it does mean that everything looks really greaSound:The score alternates between totally inspired and super cheesy &#8211; but it does fit the gamePlayability:Timing is the key to success and I rarely felt robbed, so it did what it was supposed toEntertainment:Demon Siege is one of the most cinematic games to date, and I soaked up every second gratefullyReplay:HighRated:9 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:The final chapter of the Onimusha trilogy radiates excitement and is the very definition of epic. The opening CG cinematic is so detailed and explosive that I wouldn't be surprised if George Lucas started handing out pink slips to the ILM crew. I know this clip is only a few minutes in length, but it is worth the price of admission alone. Further justifying that you absolutely need to add this title to your library, the gameplay is equally exquisite and is brimming with non-stop intensity. The methods with which you dispose of your assailants remain simplistic and true to the series. Plus, the battles are much larger in scope, the pacing of levels is relentless, and the visuals that you breathe in are all the more majestic. This truly is game development at its finest. While I would have liked to see more interaction in the environments, and depth in the combat, I really couldn't ask for a better conclusion to one of the PlayStation 2's finest series.Rated:9.25 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Tom D.H.","summary":"Jean Reno in an Onimusha game.

However, there are a few things about it that made me a little mad. First of all, I bought two copies of this game, so I could play multiplayer on my 2 PC's. Then, I install the game and patches, etc and find out that you cannot run two copies of this game, even with two CD keys, on the same modem. That is so bogus!! I spent a hundred bucks to play two player and I cannot do it, and why? I don't know but their reasoning is flawed. Anyone who buys two copies of their game should be able to play two player. Period.Second, during the multiplayer, it's really annoying to get killed again and again by air power. The airstrikes and heli's are much too easy to get and bombs are raining everywhere. There is no option, when you host a server, to turn these annoyances off. Plus, there are many many cheap ways to kill people, including claymores, stun grenades, grenade launchers and it seems like it's always raining grenades. Don't get me wrong, it is possible to get \"in the zone,\" and pwn people with say, a 25 kill streak, but it's very difficult with all the cheap ways to kill you on the game.Overall, an addictive game with lots of replay value (if you play online).

{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"Chuck Bittner \"Disabled comedian & gamer!\"","summary":"Some game tips for new players & Check the digital copy for PS3 might be cheaper.","reviewText":"At the time of writing this review you can get a digital copy for PS3 for cheaper than a physical copy And I'm so glad this is finally happening. I'm of the opinion that physical copies of games should be more expensive than digital copies. And also this is the best way to gift copies of games.To redeem the code: All you have to do is take the code that Amazon sends you (You might have to go in your account and look up your digital purchases to get the code) login to the PlayStation network store scroll down the left hand side to redeem code button at the bottom, and you're all set.Another thing that's great about digital copies on the PlayStation network is that when you want to upgrade to next generation versions of games you don't have to swap the disk from one console to the other. Like with call of duty ghosts if you bought it for PS3 on disk you can upgrade to the PS4 version but you need to move the disk from the PS3 to the PS4. But I bought the digital version and no disk is required in both consoles have the full game. Now the reason is important is I believe that eventually will see a next-generation version of GTA 5 and if you bought it on the PS3 I'm sure they'll have a cheap upgrade option.Grand Theft Auto 5 is my first GTA I've ever played and it is amazing. The open world is incredible and really will blow your mind if you've never experienced what Grand Theft Auto can do. It truly is breathtaking and find myself in awe at just what this game can do. And the hours upon hours of gameplay you can have with GTA5 really is nearly limitless. If you can get this game for under $40 I think that is so worth the price.Here are a few tips if you're just starting out in single player and online.For single player:  Making money in single player isn't really hard but here's something that can help you. At a certain time in the game you meet a character named Lester and he'll have you do assassination missions. These missions will affect the stock market that's in grand theft auto you will want to invest in the company's Lester tells you to. Once you complete the mission wait about 12 game hours maybe 18 and then sell your stock. it's definitely an easy way to make some loot in the game and can really maximize your profits.I wouldn't recommend investing in any of the businesses in the game they are really a hassle and they take hundreds of weeks to pay themselves off. One thing you definitely want to do is invest in Los Santos customs with your character Franklin buying that store allow you to get free upgrades for your car which will pay for themselves 100 times over.  This also allows you to see just how cars are affected by certain parts without investing your hard-earned money on it. Even though it's located outside of the city it's always worth the drive.One last thing when you're doing heists be sure to select the best people for the job at hand.  You have to pay them more but in the end you make out with more because if you choose somebody who's a low level they usually get nabbed by the cops and you lose their portion anyway. So always get the best people for all the heist that you do.For multiplayer: making money in multiplayer can be a challenge but I would recommend a few things. First be very careful when entering multiplayer for the first time your character is weak and everybody else is really strong. I would recommend starting and \" invite only session\" the way you do this as you load single player hit the start button go to online and then click on create invite only session. The benefits of this are you'll be by yourself on the map all the multiplayer options are available unlike if you start \"solo multiplayer game\".Be sure to visit all of the characters that are introduced to you via your phone. Usually their marked on the screen with an L or a T. Because visiting these people allows you access to different things and multiplayer. One example is I hadn't met everybody when I first started playing online I kind of just robbed convenience stores and did some races and I never saw an armored truck which are great for making loot.  On my second play through I started visiting all those areas marked on the map and lo and behold I opened up some of things that were previously not showing up in my first characters gameplay. So make sure you do that.Also I found a nice way to level up is using the gang wars battles. they are areas marked on the map and their only active for an eight hour period every game day. With these battles you get about two grand and 500 RP ( grand theft auto's equivalent of experience points or XP). But also you get tons of free ammo which is nice. Just Google gang attack map to find one that shows you every location.I have something robbing convenience stores is an easy way to make money be sure to hold your gun on the store owner while he empties the cash into the bag. This gets you the most cash and by holding your gun on him he moves faster. If you have a microphone you can get them to move even faster simply by yelling at him or just blowing into your microphone. Personally I belong in the my mic verse talking to him but if I do talk to him I tell him he looks attractive!Also when you start up grand theft auto five online you get to create a character. When you're doing this one Of advice I can give is Max your stats out in regards to strength and lung capacity. These are two of the most difficult stats to build up in the game whereas driving is the easiest. When I started my first character I mistakenly buffed up the driving stat which was stupid because that stack can get buffed just by driving around whereas strength you actually had to physically assault people which takes forever. So be sure to do that I think you invest hours into partying and that bus strengths you'll understand what I'm saying when you start this game up.Buy a 10 car garage this is a must.  There are different garages and apartments all that hold varying amounts of cars. I have always saved up to 230 grand and bought the 10 car garage.  The reason it's important to have a 10 car garage is that you can stuff cars you want to sell later in this garage and it helps you pay for the more expensive property. I'd recommend the $230,000 apartment that's right in the middle of the city because it has easy access to the helipads and is a straight shot to Los Santos customs.One last thing you can do is sell cars to Los Santos customs the in game auto body shop. You can sell one car every 48 real-life minutes (24 in game hours). The cars can range from anywhere from $1000-$9000. The most expensive being SUVs for the most part. While you're playing identify what cars of the best price tag and then be sure to keep an eye out for them and when you see them spawning stuff them in your garage. Then what I do is a semi-iPhone alarm for 48 real minutes and then once the alarm goes off I reset it and sell a car. Doing this will net you an easy 100k per day.If you're really hard up for money you can buy cash cards from the in game store menu. Now $100,000 will cost you $3 and you can buy $1.25 million for $20. Now I'm not somebody that would drop that coin for in game currency but you might want to. You can also buy $500,000 for $10 and if you're going to drop real coin on fake cash I think $500,000 would be the perfect amount as you can instantly by an apartment with 10 car garage.Also be sure to download the GTA5 app to your iPhone or android device. The reason is that you get a free supercar that you can buy in multiplayer and you can add custom license plates to your automobiles in single player and multiplayer and that's kind of cool.Those are just a few tips if you're new to Grand Theft Auto 5 definitely I want to encourage you to be cautious when entering online for the first time as you may get utterly destroyed. I hope you enjoyed this review I do love this game and I hope you do too.Thanks for reading","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2013"}

That's pretty much it outside of buying the DLC packages which are really just more of the same...Gravity Rush has a large open world but not much to do in it.

{"product_name":"B000056KDW","description":"After making a name for himself with horror classics such asThe  Damnation Gamenovel,The Books of Bloodshort-story collection, and  the feature filmsHellraiserandCandyman, Clive Barker has slowly  moved away from the horror genre toward more fantasy-centric work. Barker hasn't  completely forgotten about his first love, however, andClive Barker's  Undying, a first-person action game from Electronic Arts and DreamWorks  Interactive, beautifully captures the type of horrors that populated Barker's  earliest works. And not only is this game genuinely frightening, it's also a lot  of fun to play.Cast against the backdrop of Ireland in the year 1923,Undyingfollows  Patrick Galloway, an investigator of the paranormal. Galloway has been summoned  to Ireland by his old war buddy Jeremiah Covenant to put an end to the strange  occurrences at the Covenant family estate. What Galloway finds is a house of  horrors that is populated with Jeremiah's dead siblings (and other ghastly  creatures), all of whom want to snuff out Jeremiah so they can complete a spell  cast when they were children.Graphically,Undyingis first rate. TheUnreal Tournamentgraphics  engine has been used to great effect and the result is amazing character models  and environments. The haunted mansion is suitably dark, with wispy draperies and  macabre paintings. The estate's grounds are a mix of lush Irish countryside and  crumbling ruins, all set against vivid skies.Pretty pictures aside, the most impressive thing aboutUndyingis its  atmosphere--this game is flat-out scary. Every element of the game, be it the  gothic architecture, eerie story, great weather effects including rain and  lightning, or amazing sound effects, perfectly complement each other. The result  is a gameplay experience that rivals theResident Evilseries in terms of  generating sheer terror in the player.The great atmosphere isn'tUndying's only innovation--it also features a  very cool two-handed attack system. Most action games saddle the player with an  attack system where one hand controls all the weapons and the other hand does  nothing. InUndying, the left hand (and left mouse button) controls the  standard weapons, such as the pistol and shotgun, while the right hand (and  right mouse button) casts spells. This is a great gameplay device and ensures  the action stays at a frantic pace.Of all the spells in the game, the coolest is the Scrye spell. When cast, it  lets the player see and hear past events--some of which are quite  horrific--and  occasionally it shows you how to progress beyond a certain level. This help can  come in the form of highlighting certain objects or unveiling a portal, but  whatever the method it is a very well-designed gameplay element.The only real complaints withUndyinginvolve the long loading times  between levels and the system requirements, but even those aren't enough to  derail this excellent--and terrifying--action game.--Kilmic RobbinsPros:Very, very creepyAmazing sound effectsExcellent graphicsSlick controlsCons:Long loading timesStory is a little convoluted","reviewerName":"Jeff","summary":"OMIGOD","reviewText":"I got this game the day it came out and omigod is it awsome.  i have had it for awhile, so i have already beat it, but even though ive beat i can still play it over and over again because this game does not get boring.

I thankfully work with someone who doesn't know the meaning of \"shut up\" and had been pestering me to buy this game constantly proclaiming that it's the best game of 2009 so far. I did give in and although it wont teach him about anything, it taught me that I should listen to him more as this is sincerely one of the most impressive games I've played on the PS3 so far. One of the main draws for this game is due to the epic and cinematic nature of the campaign mode. This game and its trailer was the benchmark for the advertising of the Playstation 3's hardware capability before the systems launch. The original glimpse of the game was over 3 years ago and now, Killzone 2 is finally here.The plot of the game follows the ISA as they try to invade the planet Helghan. This follows the original Killzone game in which the Helghan soldiers the Helghast took part in an attack on Vekta. The retaliation of the ISA is a mission to capture the Helghast Leader, Scolar Viscari and bring the Helghast war machine to an end. You take the role of Sergeant Tom \"Sev\" Sevchenko as you are dropped behind enemy lines along with your ISA unit and fight to secure the capital Pyrrhus. The ISA seem to have underestimated the enemy they were facing as they are not only well armoured and adapted to their home world, they are lead by an insane Colonel Radec and have hidden weapons that will take the entire fleet by surprise.Now to be a part of the campaign is like being part of a $200 million blockbuster movie that seeks to have a million things going on at once to immerse you into the battlefield scenario. Apart from the cut scenes, the game play is shown from an FPS (First Person Shooter) perspective as you blast your way through massive maps to complete a particular objective. Upon your first introduction to the Helghan world, you're immediately dropped into what is quite obviously a war zone. Throughout the game, there's never a moment where you're left alone to fight a single Helghan fleet. You're mostly accompanied by your pal Rico, but even he goes missing from time to time and you will have to endure a few minutes alone until you both find each other again.Your enemy is quite basic as they have almost the same vulnerabilities as yourself. If you see them first then they die, but if they see you first, then you better get running as they will kill you if they can. They do have certain differences in your enemies and one of them is known as a \"heavy\". This is a heavily armoured, drugged up loyal soldier who you can only take down with a shot to the head and making the gas canisters on the soldiers back explode. They also have a mean rapid fire heavy duty gun which you better make sure you don't get hit by. There's also the fearsome Colonel Radec and when you come to face him, you'll wish you were somewhere else entirely as he's sincerely not to be messed with. Thankfully the \"cover and peek\" system allows you to take cover from that relentless fire whilst your health regenerates so you can go back for the attack.The multiplayer is also a massive triumph as up to this point the Call of Duty series held the crown as the best FPS online experience, for me anyway. Then Killzone came along and knocked COD off its top spot and is currently mocking the series relentlessly. The multiplayer is much like the campaign in that it takes on a very epic feel with the massive maps and the ability to have up to 32 players in any one game making the chaos even more fun and brutal. The main online game of Warzone takes you through a number of different mini missions to allow your team to get the win. You compete to increase your rank which makes a number of different weapons and character styles available including medic and sniper. With the medic you can revive downed comrades and the sniper is self explanatory but there are a number of other soldier classes which make the experience that bit more enjoyable.Apart from the multiplayer and campaign discussions, there is one more thing to really talk about and that's the realism of the whole experience and the detailed environments. The cut scenes really make you feel involved in the story as they push the story of your unit and your enemies along with the shocking events that lead to the games conclusion. One of the more spectacular cut scenes is the scene in which a Nuclear Bomb is set off and if you were to compare that to Call of Duty, you would be tempted to laugh at COD's inferiority as the scene is truly spectacular on scale and detail. To shoot your enemies and to see the blood splatter against the wall and fly off your victim also adds that higher level of realism and enjoyment that may seem a bit disturbing, but there's no denying the fun factor.Genuinely this is one of the best games I've played in a long time. It's fast paced, quite difficult and just a lot of fun. There's a plethora of stuff to see and experience and many ways in which you can take on the game with your team at your side or if you just want to run ahead with all guns blazing. The scale of some of the more intense battle sequences are something you don't see very often and can be very frustrating when you're getting shot and you don't know where from. This game reached a budget of just up to $60 Million and there's no doubting that every penny was well spent. I sincerely can't recommend this game highly enough and everyone should own it, even if you're not a fan of the FPS style of game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2009"}

Most noticeable is that when your fighting the AI just continue to pop out of the ground indefinitely, for ever. You can shoot at them all you want and they will keep popping up out of the ground, you could shoot 100,000 AI and it would make no difference.The ending of the game relies so heavily on re spawning it makes you think \"what where they thinking during the 5 years of production\".There is no climax to this game, each level is the same, 5 guys pop up and come towards you, the next scene, 5 guys pop up and come towards you, that is it. That is all there is to it. You have a brief moment in a tank that controls like an awkward mess. Each level is almost exactly the same with a different background.What makes this game more disappointing is that it took them 5 years to make it and this is all they could come up with.Its more based on you walking forward than defeating the enemy. You will enjoy picking it up and shooting, but will likely get bored once you realize it doesn't make much difference how many guys you kill, they just keep popping up and just running forward isn't much for strategy.Adding some vehicles, story, acting, some variations and cut out all the res pawning, this game could have been in the upper 9's.Killzone 2 REVIEW SCORE = 7.6Rental","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2009"}

It has a great story, is loaded with action, and is quite a bit more challanging in regular setting then most FPS games are in hard. Unfortunately this is one of the first titles to come out on PS3, so finding anyone to play online is not going to happen at all (I tried the other day, and only found one game host in Brazil, and it was a private game so I couldn't even play then). Perhaps they have all moved on to Killzone 3, I wouldn't know because I want to finish Killzone 2 before I move on to 3. But if multiplayer is the only reason you will think about buying this game, you might want to pass or make sure that you know people that have Killzone 2. At the same time though, the single player campaign mode feels like a co-op since you always have at least 1 other person helping you out on missions, and that comp player will make kills, provide cover fire, and help you out along the way, instead of acting like a bullet sponge that you have to guide all the time like the other FPS games we've all played.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2013"}

Wow was I suprised by how good the campaign was. The graphics are really good, they are dark but that is the feel they were going for. I didn't know alot of the story from the first one but I was able to jump into the action, and the story made alot of sense. This game should have definatly been mentioned for Game of the Year. I don't think it should have won it, but it deserved to be mentioned.Presentation- The menus are pretty unique. You can move the angle of the menu with the sixaxis. There is some great music as well, along with some pretty good cutscenes, and voice acting. Some of the repetitive phrases while your playing could have been done better, but overall good voice overs. 4.5/5Graphics- The graphics are amazing, and show just how good a game can look on the PS3 even though it is now nearly a year old. The facial features could have been done a little better, but overall it is stunning to look at. 5/5Game play- The aiming is a little hard to get used to. It's a little slow to turn, but you get used to it. There is a cover system, but it could be done alittle better. You have to hold the R2 button to stay in cover and it gets annoying having to hold it. In order to aim you have to tap the R3 button. I wish it would have been L1 like Call of Duty. Also there is no grenade indicator. Sometimes it is hard to figure out where you're being hit from, and the enemies sneak up on you, killing you with one punch. None of these issues distract greatly from a fun campaign. On a positive note you are not the center of attention. The AI will actually target your teamates as well, and they will actually fire back and kill the Helghast. There are also alot of weapons to choose from, eventhough you have to keep the pistol at all times which is annoying. You use the sixaxis for setting bombs and opening passageways. I'm glad the motion control is still used on this console. 4/5Story/Campaign- The story is easy to follow, but that doesn't mean it's any less epic. It has a well developed plot and leaves you wanting more as you wait for Killzone 3. The campaign has alot of different locales that keep it from getting boring. The variety lets you see just how good the graphics engine is with it's various environments. There is never a spot that the action stops. The campaign keeps you sucked in from start to finish. There are a few levels with vehicles which is a nice change of pace. It is somewhat short though and will only take about six hours to beat. It does conclude with an epic boss battle that is the most difficult part of the game. Which it should be. 4.5/5Fun Factor- This game was a blast all the way through. I could not put it down, and had fun shooting those helghast. 5/5Lasting Appeal- This game begs to be completed again before the sequal is released. It does only last for six hours at most though. Online gaming is not my cup of tea so that will not keep me playing it. 3/5The Verdict- This game was well done. How it was not nominated for Game of the Year boggles my mind. One of the best FPSs I've played this year. It did have some control problems, but played well and kept you on the edge of your seat the enitre time. I was never a fan of this series, but I am now.Overall 4.3","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000LSJKAM","reviewerName":"R. McAdams","summary":"Mario Party 8 is a good game.  Not a great game.","reviewText":"(...)It still has a lot of the same obnoxious problems from the last 7 versions.-You STILL cannot skip a lot of stuff, including the opening cinematic of ALL mini-games.  That gets old rather fast.  You also cannot skip viewing computer player traveling on the board, etc.  Also, the general pacing of the game is still in the range of 6-7, fast, but not quite fast enough.-Some of the mini-games are the SAME mini-game from previous versions of Mario Party.  This isn't a crime, but there were more than I thought there would be.  They usually re-work them to use motion controls, or have a different theme though.-Random luck games are still alive and well.  These types of games tend to drive \"good\" players up the wall.-Not as much variety in the game as I had hoped for its Wii debut -- very similar to MP6 & 7.-The motion controls are not as precise as I would have hoped.  If you have played Wii Sports, Wii Play, or Raving Rabbids, you know what I am talking about -- same deal here.Now that the bad is out of the way, the rest is pretty good.  There are 5 main zones in the game to choose from, which is set in a carnival this time around.--------------------------------------------------------------------------In the Party Tent: you do exactly what you have done in every other MP.  Pick characters, set options, choose a board, and play.  There are 3 main modes in the main party mode.  You can choose \"Battle Royale\" which is the traditional Mario Party 1-4 player game.  \"Tag Battle\" is the traditional teams setup, and a new mode is \"Duel Battle\" which is JUST for 1-2 players, and this is where the previous version's versus modes, and play types are all banished now.  The Duel Battle mode is a fast paced game, and is MOSTLY just the board game.  The only time you play mini-games is when one of you lands on a versus space.  If you like the board game more than the mini-games, you will LOVE this mode, if not, you will HATE this mode.In the regular games, there is also a new type of space called a \"Lucky\" space, it causes you to generally go to a special area of the board to get a nice bonus (usually with a star) or something special to happen.  Also new are coin block spaces, and the fact that the DK spaces share the same space with the Bowser spaces (once a DK space has been landed on it switches to a Bowser space, and vice versa.Finally \"Candy\" has replaced \"orbs\" as power ups.  Same basic idea, but now they are only for power ups, no placing them on the board (that I have seen so far anyway).  Similar to the power ups in MP4.The Available boards at start are:\"DK's Treetop Temple\" - classic MP board, plays like you would expect it to play.\"Goomba's Booty Boardwalk\" - this is a weird board.  It is a single pathway to the end.  Coins are used to get to the end fast, because the star is free, lots of strategy on this one.  The Spring and Whirlwind powers are very useful here.\"King Boo's Haunted Hideaway\" - This board is a maze that is always changing, you are looking for the hidden star room in it, this board can be frustrating.\"Shy Guy's Perplex Express\" - The board is set on a train that randomizes itself.  The path goes through the train, and then back over the top of it.\"Koopa's Tycoon Town\" - This board is similar to the Windmill board in MP7, you buy hotels on the board to get their stars.  You can steal a hotel from another player by putting more coins into one.  The combined coins in a hotel can upgrade it to a 2 or 3 star hotel.  Once it is a 3 star hotel an extra 100 coins from the owner can make it impossible to steal (coins are very important on this board!)Also viewable, but not playable yet is \"Bowser's Warped Orbit\" which is locked at start--------------------------------------------------------------------------In the Star Battle Arena: you play through the single player game, similar in theme and design to MP6 & 7.  There is the twist of progressive rankings and a ladder of achievement to climb though.--------------------------------------------------------------------------In the Mini-Game Tent: you can play all of the mini-games you have unlocked, just like in previous versions of the game.  The 5 modes you can play in right at the start are:\"Freeplay Arcade\" - which is exactly what it says it is (1-4 players).\"Crown Showdown\" - locked at first, you need lots of mini-games unlocked to play.\"Flipout Frenzy\" - you compete to win 'tiles' on the game board (every tile you own also claims unclaimed tiles to the 4 directions surrounding it) flip as many tiles as you can by winning games (1-4 players).\"Tic-Tac Drop\" - basically a game of tic-tac-toe, with the right to move next given to whomever wins the next game.\"Test For The Best\" - locked at first, buy from the 'Fun Bazaar.'--------------------------------------------------------------------------In the Extras Zone: you can trade in \"carnival cards\" to unlock stuff, similar to the stars in MP6.  You get cards for winning games, and playing the various modes.  This is also where your Miis can play for you, instead of the MP8 characters.  You can use the Miis on the Wii itself, or Miis stored in a wii-mote.  Available when you first get the game are 4 games:\"Bowling\" - basically like Wii Sports bowling, but with less finesse and control. (1-4 players)\"Trial By Tile\" - is a matching game similar to Memory (1-2 players).\"Flagging Rights\" - REQUIRES THE NUNCHUCK ATTACHMENT!  This is the only game I have seen (so far) that allows or requires it.  It is a matching game, you hold up your hands to mimic the prompts on screen. (1-2 players).\"Canyon Cruisers\" - Is a motion controlled vehicle racing game.  You twist the remote left or right to steer, and use buttons to brake or accelerate.  This game requires some seriously cool hands to play, it is difficult (1-2 players).--------------------------------------------------------------------------In the Fun Bazaar: you unlock stuff, just like in previous versions of MP.  The most interesting stuff to unlock is to the immediate right of the main cart you view, this is where you can unlock new modes, new games, and new difficulty levels.  This is where you trade in your 'Carnival Cards.'--------------------------------------------------------------------------Over all, it is a fun game.  As with ANY party game with mini-games, it tends to be only as fun as those you are playing with.  We have a good group to play with, and we like it.  Some of the games are addictingly fun, and we really enjoy, some of them are very cheap, and annoy the heck out of you (as has been the case in every MP.)Have fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2007"}
{"product_name":"B003O680ZY","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason","summary":"It's the End of the World Arcade Racing and I Feel Fine...","reviewText":"Just got this game today and have been playing it for several hours now.  It is a lot of fun.  The controls have been tightened up since Pacific Rift.  The various vehicles still handle differently, but the new cars are very fun, and are a great addition to the Motorstorm series.  The graphics are great in game-play and the city-landscape is fleshed out well, though the colors of the city, the crazy people you end up running over, the (what struck me as) slightly James Bond '70s TV show music and the over-the-top comic cut scenes add a sort of \"don't take this too seriously\" feel to the game.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, in fact, I think it's a good direction for Motorstorm as a franchise, because sometimes I felt Pacific Rift took itself too seriously.You begin playing Apocalypse and notice some interesting ways they get you up to speed with the story and how to utilize the game controls and strategies.  In no time at all you're racing and winning races and thinking to yourself \"this is really easy.\"  But before too long you find some incredibly difficult tracks and the other players make life slightly more challenging.  I was worried with the over-the-top track chaos and the insane \"difficult to handle vehicle\" mechanics that this game would be way to difficult.  I feel those fears have been revealed.  The skyline track you probably have seen if you've watched demos of the game showed an insane track that was almost impossible not to die in and have numerous frustrating \"really?\" moments.  It's true that at times the game is frustrating and there are moments I found myself upset at the game for killing me.  But half those times, I really did realize deep down that I crashed because I was stupid and made a mistake-other times I was driving a mudplugger at 90mph and hoping to make it turn left to avoid a bridge support and let's be honest, that's probably not going to happen.The more I play this game the more I realize just how much it is about chaos.  It's insane fun ripping around the track and while I have many times hit those \"oh snap\" or \"that's not cool!\" moments where you feel either the insane grace the game has given you or the way in which it seems to be cheating, it's still just a lot of fun.  It never feels like it's impossible to win, just difficult, you have to learn the tracks later in the game to do well and when you're racing through a track that's falling a part that's when this game is at its' best.  Sadly, towards the end of the game I am noticing less of those kinds of tracks.  However, the destruction and devastation still looks great even \"after the fact\".  Besides almost ever track still provides tons of intense racing, lots of different paths to choose from and crazy competition even if the track isn't falling apart as you race it.  Let me be clear, half if not more have real-time changing effects altering the track some of which are on the verge of insanity which is one of the many elements that drives this game towards awesomeness.  I loved Motorstorm Pacific Rift but this one beckons me to continue playing where as I have yet to finish Pacific Rift to the final leveling up.  I think the reason this one is more addictive is due to the intense sense of speed, the tracks and the great feel of arcade racing.What I love about this game is the sense of insane speed, the chaotic tracks and the over-the-top feel the game has to it.  It really scream \"arcade\" and it really feels arcade down to the \"what were they smoking?\" cut-scenes.  The game does a great job of creating great tracks with an insanely fun arcade racing experience and it does it so well you'll be unable to take your eyes off the road to look at what place your in let alone what time it is or where your girlfriend has wandered off to.If you like arcade racing games, motorstorm games, great racing tracks then what are you waiting for? Get this game!  This game is a pure arcade adrenaline rush from start to finish.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2011"}

Definitely not as great as the original Bioshock.","reviewText":"I have played around 10 FPS games and this might be the 3rd best FPS I have ever played. The two best FPS I have ever played are the original Bioshocks and the original Resistence Fall of Men.This is a very well made game. It hits on all cylinders. It hits the intellectual/historical/scientific/philosophical bent. It hits the play action. It hits the storytelling. So why not 5 stars?Every aspects of this game was merely good, but not great.I thought the SongBird could have played far bigger role. I wish, for example, there was a way to fight the Songbird (but there isn't). The skyline fighting sequence is very cool. But the action options were limited, and there was nothing that added to the excitement after the initial sequence.What I would like to see is a much more refined version of this game in Bioshock 4, especially the skyline concept.In my view, what makes a great video game is adding one great feature on top of another. I would like to have seen a sequence, for example, that allows combat on skyline against the Handyman, which has very limited abilities on the skyline in the current game. Getting the Songbird to overpower Lettice and her twin would have been fun to watch.I don't think anyone would be disappointed with this game. So I recommend it.Pros:1)Good FPS game that won't disappoint.2)Great graphics on PS3.3)Highly refined arts/graphics/historical content.4)Made with lot of imagination.Cons:1)Tries to do too much and it can't be great in all the areas.2)Everything could have been just little bit better in order to be great.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2014"}

Close.","reviewText":"God Of War is a GREAT action adventure combat type of game, similar to Onimusha, Castlevania, Devil May Cry, and Ninja Gaiden. My favorite genre BTW. Prior to playing God Of War, Ninja Gaiden was the best game I've ever played. I played Onimusha, Castlevania, and Devil May Cry AFTER Ninja Gaiden, I was shocked how HORRIBLE these games are! THESE games have fixed camera, the backgrounds do not rotate.... so its pretty much like playing 2-D Double Dragon, Streets of Rage or Golden Axe with more flash.God Of War uses a fixed camera system. I was very suspicious about this before I got the game. I assure you this fixed camera system is TOTALLY AWESOME. The camera engine will always give you the best playable angle, it will zoom in for combat sequence which is important because it makes the characters and actions come ALIVE, it will auto-rotate with your runs, and more. The game designers really put a lot of effort into the camera system. Actually this game uses a semi-fixed camera system, because the background rotates. Games of this genre for the Playstation 2 dont offer adjustable cameras because PLAYSTATION 2'S HARDWARE IS INCOMPETENT! THIS IS PRETTY MUCH THE BEST PLAYSTATION 2 CAN EVER DO.The setting for this game blows any action adventure combat game away. Its Greek mythology! You will meet many famous Gods, monsters, and people. The stage design is magificent, they are HUGE, detailed, and beautiful. You will feel like you are in ancient Greece. The stages totally blow away all other games. Its like playing a movie and watching the Traveling Channel. The levels are very well designed, I've never seen any games like this. You dont go into rooms after rooms like other games, other games' level has that divided sections design within a level. In God Of War you will play a truly huge continuous level design with no loading time.The combat is awesome. This is not a dumb simple hack and slash game like Baulder's gate, Champions of Norrath, or Dynasty Warriors. The bloody actions have a Mortal Kombat feeling to it. The combat is like a fighting game. There are lots of BLOOD, myriad of execution moves, and the motions all look REAL! However the RPG element is a bit lacking, it seems to offer only 2 weapons and 4 magics. The weapons can be upgraded 4 times and the magic 2 times. The weapons and magic dont look all that different thru its upgrades....The platforming for this game is actually fun! Very Indiana Jones like. The puzzles are cool action puzzles, not stupid little brain puzzles like all other games. Lots of cool innovated ideas in this game! This game is very dark and very adult! Expect lovely nudity, simulated sex mini-games, extreme bloody violence, profanity, etc.... The boss fights are cool, very fun, funky, and unique and not just all chopping like Ninja Gaiden. However there are NOT ENOUGH BOSSES.The graphics for this game is awesome, it looks like XBOX game. Lots of cool cinematic effects and CGI cut scenes. Make sure you set the picture soften option to OFF. The music is sweet, very epic, classical and perfect for battles.Ninja Gaiden has better action and bigger characters, it gives player a dynamic feeling that GOW don't have at times. IMO Ninja Gaiden and GOW ties for best action/adventure/combat game of all time.Overall this is a must PLAY game! Go buy it now! SONY please make God Of War 2 NOW!Update: 4/16/2005 NOT enough BOSSes.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2005"}

This is a very tactical stealth based shooter with a complex story.  Some people will nominate this as a Game of the Year Contender, while the run and gun crowd may be turned off by the deliberate pacing of the game.Concept:  9/10Set in a dark and not so distant future, where human beings are getting cybernetic implants, you play as Adam Jensen, an Ex-SWAT operative with a mysterious past, and you're on a corporate backed espionage mission to uncover a vile plot to alter the course of humanity.  Armed with the latest in Cybernetic Stealth Technology and an arsenal of weapons, you travel the world to expose corporate and government corruption.Story: 10/10!!!This is one of the best stories that I've ever seen in a game!  Without spoiling anything it is about the boundaries between freedom and anarchy, and the limits that should or should not be placed on technology.  The story is complex, so you will have to pay close attention.  The story is told through cutscenes, cinematics, in game dialogue, and if you hack computers in the game, there's even more information backing the story.  It is truly immersive and will make you think.  Your actions will determine which ending you get, so it is crucial that you pay attention.Gameplay:  8/10As you play through the game, you earn PRAXIS POINTS, which you use to upgrade your character.  There are loads of upgrades to choose from and they will all affect the style of your gameplay.  Some upgrades enhance your stealth, like silent movement, more info on enemies' behavior, or temporary invisibility.  Some enhance your strength, like the ability to wield heavy weapons with no recoil or bursting through walls like the old Cool-Aid guy.  Other implants enhance your shooting, your vision, your radar, your armor, resistance to special damage attacks, close range combat, and hacking.The game is basically 4 HUBS with a few load screens breaking them up.  There are main quests (which drive the story) and side quests (which supply additional info to the story and allow you to gain extra XP.)  When you Accept a Quest, important info shows up on your HUD.  The majority of quests deal with you infiltrating areas protected by armed guards.  This is where the game shines.  It is up to you how you complete the quests.  You can sneak past enemies and use a tranquilizer rifle to knock them out.  You can use a heavy machine gun to mow them down.  You can use sniper weapons and hack computer systems to turn off security systems or even turn them on your enemies.  When you get to the end, there is usually a multiple choice conversation you have with your contact that will affect the story and give you an XP bonus.The save points are generous and you usually have the ability to load the last 2 auto-saves or any of your (up to 20) manual save points.Weapons:  9/10There is an excellent selection of modifiable weapons in the game.  Tranq Gun, Combat Rifle, Sniper Rifle, Plasma Gun, Laser Gun, Shotgun, Pistol, Revolver, Rocket Launcher, AOE Stun Gun, Normal Stun Gun, Mines, Grenades, etc...  The weapon choices really allow you to customize the game to your style of play.  Put landmines by a door, then trigger the alarm to blow up your enemies.  Bribe an NPC and then hit him with a stun gun to get your money back.  You can pretty much do anything that you can imagine with this arsenal at your disposal.Haxx0rZing!!1: 8/10If you choose the route of Hacker, there is a FUN mini-game that you play in realtime, where you try to take over terminals on a network and reach your goal.  The terminals are connected by paths and there is a starting point and an ending point with multiple paths.  Each terminal has a % chance that you will be discovered.  If you are not discovered, you can move from terminal to terminal and hack the computer, gain XP, information, and sometimes access to the enemy's security systems.  If you are discovered, a counter appears and you have that much time to get to the end goal.  You also have countermeasures at your disposal to show down the Network.  (Nuke allows you to access 1 terminal without fear of detection, Worm gives pauses the countdown for 5 seconds if you are discovered, and Fortify slows down the enemy Network when they reach terminals.)  If you are discovered, the system is locked down for 30 seconds and enemies usually are set on alert.Bosses:  6/10The low point of the game are the Boss Battles.  In a game where you specialize your character for infiltration, the worst situation you can find yourself in is a small arena against a super soldier that can insta-kill you.  Fortunately, there are only a few of these.  When you play, keep this in mind, and bulk up your armor.  I died on the first boss 4 times, even though I sniped him in his helmet-less head 3 times and blew up an exploding barrel next to him.  I eventually beat the first boss by hiding.  He threw a trio of grenades, and they all bounced off walls, back at him.  The boss fights would have been much better if the boss chased you through an area where you had to be stealthy.  Then you could use your infiltration skills in the fight.  All of the Boss fights are arena battles.  Grenades, Armor, Heavy Weapons, the Typhoon, and health powerups will all aid you.Graphics:  8/10The world is dark and... shiny.  It's not the best looking game, but it delivers on atmosphere.  The futuristic visions of New Detroit, China, and Montreal are interesting.  The characters are well animated and the enemies are nicely defined so you can tell the difference between a light armored, medium armored, and heavily armored guy.  (Except for the helmetless first boss who shrugs off head shots with a high powered sniper rifle... sigh)Sound:  7/10The music is very cool and the sound effects highten the suspense and punctuate the action.  There isn't anything that you'd download from itunes though.  I also have to knock the game for using slang from 1995.  \"I heard someone jettin'\", \"Fly Girl\", and \"I gotsta get back to my crib, cholo.\"  *Cringe*Replay Value:  8/10There is no multiplayer, but you can replay the single player campaign using different tactics.  Play through once as a stealthy hacker.  Try again as an armored terminator who can burst through walls.  There are also 2 achievements that you can try:  Complete the game without killing anyone (gas grenades, stun guns, KO moves...) and Complete the game without setting off any alarms.Maturity:  Older TeensThe plot is complex and there is violence and swearing.  This is more of a political intrigue story, so the \"I just wanna kill bad guys\" crowd might be a little overwhelmed.Overall:  9/10This is a Great Tactical Shooter that will take you 15-30 hours to finish.  It's a full on RPG with excellent user friendly stealth / combat elements.  The story is outstanding, especially if you have been keeping up with what is going on with our current government.Buy it if you love the Deus Ex series.Buy it if you love Stealth Action RPG's.Buy it if you love Stealth Games or Tactical Shooters like Metal Gear of the Tom Clancy Games.Buy it if you love a good government conspiracy story.Rent it if you can finish an RPG fast.Avoid it if you wanna feel like Rambo and gun down hordes of bad guys.  You won't last very long if you abandon the tactics.  It's like playing Halo with No Shield.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2011"}

Usually, at best they are just an average game (the only exception to this being when a superhero game has a great co-player mode, such as JUSTICE LEAGUE HEROES from a few years ago). That changed with the release of BATMAN: ARKHAM ASYLUM.  I didn't have an opportunity to play the game until earlier this year. However, after having played, it is in my opinion the best superhero game ever made so far.Taking a cue from the graphic novel of the same name, players get to play the game as Batman. The gameplay is great. Just like Batman, you have to use certain weapons to complete certain tasks and defeat different villains. There's a good mix between platform games, puzzle games, and action games. A key to making it through to the next level is using stealth; you can't just jump out of nowhere and beat up everyone in sight. To be successful, you have to stay in the shadows and sometimes wait for the right moment to strike. There's a lot of free range in the game and there are all sorts of collectibles that a person can get as you explore the asylum.As far as the story goes, Batman is at Arkham dropping off a prisoner when the Joker sets forth his greatest plan to date: Batman is trapped in Arkham during a lockdown where all the inmates are set free. Batman battles one foe after another, including Bane, Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, and Poison Ivy. Along the way you save workers who are trapped, solve riddles, and unravel the Joker's master plan. The climactic battle finds Batman facing off against the Joker that is much a battle of brawns as it is brains.BATMAN: ARKHAM ASYLUM is a must-play game for gamers and anyone who is a Batman fan. It's also highly recommended for anyone who likes superhero games or just enjoys a great single player game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0000503MO","description":"The third title of the Gran Turismo series takes full advantage of the new PlayStation2 game engine, which is capable of rendering about 20 million polygons per second--roughly 10 times the number of total polygons of the series' previous installment,Gran Turismo 2. Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course.

There are nearly 200 brand name cars available to race and modify, the graphics contain an astounding amount of detail, and even the soundtrack is great (well, mostly). In the simulation mode, there are enough options to satisfy any gear head, and an arcade mode is included for those who just want to get right into the game without having to deal with all of the technicalities. My only gripe with GT3 is the same problem I've had ever since it's first incarnation...the license tests. While it could be argued that they add to the overall realism factor, they will frustrate many players who want to complete every race in simulation mode.

GOODWIN \"dragon678\"","summary":"Surprised!","reviewText":"After reading many reviews, playing the demo (which I didn't like too much), and looking at bunch of forums, I put off buying this game as it seemed it wasn't as good as the XBOX version and it was about 50 50 that people liked it or hated it.So now, several months after it's initial release and the price was at $20, I have finally played it and much to my surprise, it was pretty damn good.The beginning I didn't care for much and I was having a hard time getting into the game, but after each passing minute, I started to like this more and more.The Master Chief is a very cool character and they have some pretty cool weapons.The graphics and sound were solid (though the levels that had snow on them, the snow looked crappy) as was the story. The atmosphere didn't do much as you didn't hear the wind blow and the trees weren't swaying like other FPS games that came before it. This was a bit of a hardware killer as I have a P4 2.8, 128 NVIDIA GEFORCE FX 5200 graphics card, and 1GIG of RAM, and I coudln't turn the settings up without it getting too choppy. I had to turn them down some and it ran pretty good and the graphics still looked good.The enemies were pretty cool (The Hunters were especially hard to kill and the The Elites had something like a re-energizable shield like you had) and the levels were pretty challenging and very intense (not quite as intense as Call Of Duty but close). The Flood was especially cool. Not hard to kill but wave after wave of them just kept coming at you.You also have many different vehicles and other things you can control in the game.As for on-line, it reminds of Command & Conquer Renegade. Takes a million bullets to kill someone with a machine gun and there weren't any different kinds of game modes that what is already out there, but it was still pretty fun and I didn't have a problem with lag at all.Overall, I think it was a pretty good game and I hope they make a HALO 2 even though the game took a bad rap.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2004"}
{"product_name":"B0009SQF0C","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"The PS2's very own version of \"The Catcher in the Rye\"","reviewText":"Bully may very well be one of the most controversial games of all time simply based on the fact that Rockstar made it.  With only a name to their game, it was turning heads.  People feared the worst.  Mostly that the game would be as violent as Grand Theft Auto, but in a high school setting.Let me set some minds at ease.  There are no guns.  The game doesn't even have any blood.  Also, you can't kill anyone.  Lastly, violence is rather discouraged.You do not play the Bully.  Instead you assume the role of Jimmy Hopkins, a boy trying to survive at Bullworth Academy. He's basically your run of the mill student. Your task inside the school is the same as they are for just about every student in high school. Pass your classes and stay out of trouble. Going to class actually is enforced for a time. Your classes are mini-games that you'll play.  You're allowed to try and ditch class but there are consequences for not going. However, in this game you'll want to go to class just because participating in said class is actually fun, and can improve your skills. The mini games are fun and addictive. After a while it's no longer enforced, which I actually found rather sad. The aspect of going to class doesn't get nearly enough attention, but the mechanic works.Outside of class, however, is where the game really begins to shine. If you're familiar with the gameplay of Grand Theft Auto, then you'll easily adapt to Bully. For starters, each and every student at Bullworth Academy has a unique personality. You'll make friends and you'll make enemies.  The missions are fun and quite an experience. The game is original. Even better, the story sequences are filled to the brim with humor, quite simply it's one of the funniest games I've played.In addition, you can also venture outside of the school. Jimmy can get a job to help him buy food and other things, and he's able to help people around town do some of their errands and chores as well.  You'll also be able to date, go play some arcade games and plenty more.  All the things most high school students do.Jimmy isn't without a mischief. He's got a slingshot, a bat and a few other things he can use. Again, you can't kill anyone with these things, and eventually the objects will break anyway.  Besides, if you beat up a kid, you have to serve detention.  Part of the point of the game really is staying out of trouble.The game also takes on a more realistic feel. There's a clock in the corner that shows you what time it is. If you're caught wandering around the school after hours there are consequences. If you stay out too late, you'll actually get tired and fall asleep.The game looks and sounds brilliant. Fantastic voice acting really brings the story to life. The game also has some great visuals.  The school and environments look astonishing.Bully is a great game to be sure.  It's almost like an interactive teenage drama come to life.  A lot of the game is humorous and fun.  But most importantly, it isn't Grand Theft Auto and it does stand on its own.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2006"}

The game was a launch title for the Nintendo 64 and boy did the game make its mark on the console.  Sure we have games like Banjoe Kazooi, Ocarina of Time but this game was the first to come out and is still an instant class and started many many famous game rippoffs(Like many people say Banjoe Kazooi was a ripoff but I DIDN'T SAY THAT so don't flame me!)but that's beyond the point, this game is still one of the most beloved video game ever.  When Super Mario 64 launched with the N64 it was indeed a very revolutionary game, it was the first game to present 3d platforming, state of the art graphics and some of funnest/best gameplay you'll see in platforming/action games.  The game is HUGE!  In Mario 64 you WILL be going through many, many stages to collect stars so you can unlock more areas for more stars and ultimatley put the evil bowser to an end and once again save Princes Peach.  I was one of many people who first played this game back when it launched with the Nintendo 64 and when you compare it to todays games the game(to many, but not me)looks terrible but you gotta understand, the time this game was released(96')it was INFACT the best looking video game ever.....period...and even today when I play this classic, it still looks amazing!  Call me crazy but I seriously still think this is one of the best looking video games of not only the mid 90's but even today, it is still marvalous!  The music in Mario 64 was just plain perfect, the music blended in with the games levels and star hunting, words cannot explain how well Miyamoto and Nintendo did for the music,it's just plain good!  The controls are also tight and well focused, I especially love the array of moves Mario has and although the controls may feel abit clumsy at times it never bothered me once!  As for camera, yes there were times were I wanted to break the tv but the reward and satisfaction of getting a star after that trouble feels so good!  Audio, controls, graphics are all A+ and as for gameplay?...Well it depends..Do you like platforming/action/exploring/collecting games because you will be collecting pretty much for the whole game(Stars, duuhhh)and if the answer is yes then this may be the best game you've ever played!  Now for me the gameplay was truly fun and innovative, I never got bored once in this game.  It's so fun, hunting for stars never gets annoying or frustraiting!  Speaking of difficulty the game is perfect, it's not hard nor is it easy like pie(acctually I take that back, for many people this game will be easy if you wanna just beat the plot)but it just gets it right on difficulty, I don't remember ever being frusraited or angry with the game(then again I never did try to get all 120 stars)and just having a great time with the game...it seriously is one of the funnest experiences I've ever had with a game and as I said before....this game is revolutionary!  Now that I'm done ranting and talking about this game I'll just get to it quickly...The Good-One of the best and most revolutionary game ever..period-Back then and even today it is still one of the best looking video games ever made-Loads of things to do-Not hard, but not too easy, it's juuuust about right-The game is just plain fun, the moves, the platforming, collecting, ect-Collecting stars is really fun!-The music in this game is just plain fun to listen to!!-Though the bosses are easy I still think they're just classics!-Will take a very long time to get all 120 stars, and collecting 120 stars means spending lots of time with this amazing title-The worlds and places you visit are all so different and an amazment to look atThe Bad-Some may feel that game is feeling abit dated now(the game is pretty old now!!)-Some will find the graphics to be \"terrible\" or just \"bad\" which I find hard to believe-People who just want to beat the games plot and nothing els shouldn't even touch the game(because the game doesn't take too long to beat for plot and if you're planning on not having a fun time with the game and just wanting to beat the game and getting it over with, what's the point of that?)-Some will be angry with the camera-Alot of people today or in the future may get this game and probably nag about how easy the bosses are well cry me a river, if you want a hardboss go play something els....other then that get ready to play one of the best games ever...Overall Super Mario 64 stands up on its own.  The game was indeed revolutionary and braught us amazing visuals, superb gameplay and great controlls aswell as a fun adventure/like plot with lots of collecting to do.  The games music was just great to listen to, the places the game takes you are just so fun and innovative and the moves/mechanics that are enabled for Mario(though limited)are great!  The game is just plain great!  As I stated before, it is one of the best video games ever made and it indeed gets a perfect5 out of 5 stars.....","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00000DMAQ","reviewerName":"brutusmuktuk","summary":"A bird in a backpack is worth more than two in a bush","reviewText":"Developer Rare is a master at infusing originality into their imitations. This isn't a knock against them. William Shakespeare pulled stories and plots from other writers and crafted masterpieces. Rare is gamedom's Shakespeare, in that regard. Banjo-Kazooie is obviously influenced by Super Mario 64, although it's always unfortunate for a game to be compared to that masterpiece. While Banjo-Kazooie lacks Super Mario 64's magic and ingenuity, it has its own magic that sets it apart from Nintendo's behemoth.The Good:+ A fun story+ An imaginative use of its characters+ Creative worlds to exploreThe Bad:-- Too easy and short-- The few parts that are too hardThe Ugly? Why is Kazooie so insulting?Story--9/10The first thing that stands out is the dialogue, especially of the evil witch, Gruntilda, or Grunty, who speaks in clever rhymes. It's refreshing all the more that what she says is often funny. The game begins with her asking her mirror, \"Who is the most beautiful of them all?\" Of course, it couldn't be Gruntilda. There's nothing even remotely pretty about a fat, green hag. The most beautiful of them all is Banjo's younger sister, Tooty (who looks similar to Tiny Kong of Donkey Kong fame). So Grunty sets off to kidnap Tooty and succeeds, leaving only the mole, Bottles, as a witness. Bottles must survive a downpour of Kazooie's insults and witticisms to explain the kidnapping to Banjo and Kazooie. The question becomes, can Banjo and Kazooie save Tooty before Grunty robs her of her beauty and transfers it to herself?Gameplay--8/10Here is the game's bane and boon. Everything else sets it up wonderfully. The soundtrack is great, the visuals are very nice, and the opening story sequence is funny. The game controls smoothly and you have plenty of moves to learn and use throughout. The levels are varied, with plenty of collectibles and other goodies to discover. But these levels are so small, so short, so easy. I never spent an hour and a half on any one level, and most of them took less than an hour to complete. In that time, I could collect ten jigsaw puzzle pieces, one hundred musical notes, and numerous other items such as the Mumbo Jumbo skulls, extra lives, and Jinjos. Compared to Super Mario 64, I can't help but say, is that all?There are a total of nine worlds, as well as a main hub world, which is too labyrinthine for its purpose. Rare goes a little overboard as to the amount of collectibles they expect gamers to gather. Unless you use cheats, it takes 94 out of the 100 Jigsaw pieces total to unlock every single world, including the final fight with Grunty. That's not too difficult, as I'd say about 97 of those Jigsaw pieces are a piece of cake. More than 880 of the 900 music notes are needed in order to give you somewhat of a chance against the unfairly difficult fight with Grunty (you just can't count on Rare to make a strictly children's game: see Diddy Kong Racing).These are mostly criticisms, but they comprise a small percent of the game. You will spend most of it enjoyably. Despite the very easy difficulty, it isn't boring. There's plenty to explore in the levels, and as they go on, they become larger and more complex, especially the sprawling final level. Rare flexes all of its creative muscles in that level, revolving around the four seasons, and even includes a few semi-stories with some new characters. Not that the other levels are clunkers, but if only they could provide the same sort of entertainment, the rest of the game would have been that much more enjoyable.Longevity--5/10A game should only be as long as it needs to be, but I think Banjo-Kazooie needed to be a little longer. Considering what Nintendo did years earlier in Super Mario 64, it's no excuse that Rare couldn't match that level of magnitude. But it's unfair to compare any game to Super Mario 64. Most gamers will complete this, all 100 Jigsaw pieces, almost all 900 music notes, in less than twelve hours. After finishing it, there's no reason to go back. The cheats only give you infinite resources, but what's the point when you've already finished the game? The only way a game like this can extend its life is for the single player adventure to be a little longer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2013"}

The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife.

For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar.

{"product_name":"B00006I02Z","reviewerName":"David Smith","summary":"lots of potential but ultimately disappointing.","reviewText":"oh dear, half-life 2 ... what an amazing game, right?  not really, but it sure could have been.  the graphics, the story, the guns and shooting action are all amazing.  so what's wrong?  3 things.1.  helicopters.  these things suck big time.  i wish they weren't even in the game.  you have to shoot them down with rockets, which seems cool except it's quite hard to hit them.  i'm not making excuses for being a bad gamer.  it's just that it's literally hard to know how to aim.. or even whether to aim at all, since the rocket twirls around and seeks out the chopper, but then the chopper turns around and shoots down your rocket.  i have shot down helicopters, but it would be hard for me to explain to you how exactly i did it.  do you aim straight on?  aim off to the side? try to shoot closer, farther away, higher up?  i don't know if anyone knows.  that's why i quit playing this freakin' game.  it was frustrating enough to get through 2 lengthy helicopter battles, but then when there was YET ANOTHER ONE, i just couldn't believe it.  what a waste.  not to mention, for a game that's supposed to be so creative, it's just doing the same thing over and over again with the choppers.2.  puzzles.  now if you like puzzles and can figure them out, good for you, you'll like the puzzles.  but if you're more of an FPS fan like me and don't like puzzles, you're not gonna like this stuff.  i figured out the simple ones, but hey when i come across a wall of wood in the middle of a road with a wire overhead, i really don't know what's goin' on.  i end up looking on the internet for the walkthrough for this stuff, and i don't like having to consult walkthroughs.  to me it's just a waste of time trying to figure out some puzzle for a long time.3.  pacing/lack of action.  IMO, half-life 2 drops the ball here.  now i can understand wanting a breather after action sequences.  also i know gordon freeman is trying to escape so he has to travel..  but it's just travel on a vehicle, then get into a fight over and over again.  why even bother with all these travelling parts?  it just doesn't seem right to me.  also when you get into a gunfight against enemies, it doesn't last long and the threat doesn't seem large.  there are many games where you feel more like you're taking on a group of enemies.  hl2 is lacking in action and a sense of urgency and threat that gets your pulse high.i think half-life 2 is just pretty unfulfilling and a waste of time.  it's \"supposed\" to be a FPS, but it's really not because of the pacing, puzzles and lack of action.  i'd rather play something like doom 3 or quake 4.  they have stories too, but not the wastes of time.as for the multiplayer, it's fun but the rockets are probably too overpowering.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2006"}

{"product_name":"B001NIP3EG","reviewerName":"Nishi","summary":"Return back to the crazy world of Bioshock","reviewText":"To me this game didn't live up to the hype and the greatness the first game had. I felt that the single player was way too short and felt liked it was second to multiplayer, which is idiotic since the first game did great with only single player. Oh and backtracking is taken out, so if you missed something, than you have to start over if you want it.The story is decent, but doesn't compare to the first game. I mean this game took me half the time to beat on hard compared to the first game (Bio 1 took me two days on survivor, and this only took me one day on hard, so it literally was half the time). After spending all this time on the game it ends with a huge cliffhanger.The little sister's thing is still as creepy, especially the effect it has on the story, but you can adopt them now. They take you around to two different Adam influenced bodies that you protect the little sister from the plasmid junkies while she takes Adam (The bottle part on the Adam needle is just so creepy seeing the little girl using it).After doing that you have the choice of harvesting them or saving them, and you feel terrible after harvesting them after walking around with them while they say things like \"Look daddy Adam\" or using electricity on an enemy her piping up saying \" Look daddy they're dancing\" in that innocent voice. This is about the only thing the game improved on the first game.The gameplay is the same, but now you can use weapons and plasmids at the same time. This makes action a lot faster, and is another fun change to the game. The Adam minigames are nice change to pace, but the rest of the game is the same as the first. I usually don't mind if a lot is the same as a previous game in the series, but if that said game is shorter than the previous one it's kind of annoying.Being without internet at the time of writing this review I won't comment on the multiplayer since I'm obviously not able to play it. My friends that have played it said it was fun though, and the premise of getting Adam form kills in its own type of Modern Warfare's prestige system.If you really liked the first game, this may come as a disappointment, but also fun with the minor changes it introduced. If you really want to play it I recommend renting it, and not buying it (I bought the special edition of this game and I still regret it).Length: The game played real quick for me, and I think it was like 6-10 hours it took me to beat it, maybe longer.Trophies / Achievements: To get the platinum trophy will be pretty hard for this game since its part single player (Which is easy) with multiplayer (which is time consuming). So this is yet another game that it's not one to play for an easy plat.- Written: August, 2010Positives:* Dual welding plasmids and weapons* Addition of adopting little sisters* Still allows you to save anywhere* Choices with the little sisters influenced the storyNegatives:* Being able to go back to old areas is gone* Story not as good as the first* Seems as though multiplayer was more of the focus* Huge cliffhanger","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2012"}

He's a husband and father, with a nice home and great carer. Suddenly tragedy befalls the family, and all this changed. This event then completely changes the scenery of the game. You start out in a bright, colorful, happy environment, only to end up in a dark, grey, non-stop raining city, with sadness all around you.There is a serial killer kidnapping children in your city, and suddenly you find your son missing and yourself racing to find him. Along the way, you meet people who play pivotal rolls in tracking down the killer and finding your son. No ones knows who the killer is, but time is limited and you go to extreme lengths to find him in time. Tested every step of the way, every outcome can change how this story unfolds, and whether or not you find your happy ending.Characters:You play 4 main characters in this game, not just a single person. You play a father, a \"mysterious woman\", a private detective and an FBI Criminal Profiler. Each of these people are all working towards the same goal, to find the Origami Killer. The choices these 4 people make determines the outcome of all future events. A character can die in the game, and if they do, the rest of the game and story unfolds differently.Mature content:When they say this game has mature content, they mean it. Nudity, murders, sex scenes, swearing, small amount of drug use and very intense scenes involving deaths/killings are all included. What makes this game also so intense is you're not just watching it, you have to play through the scenes. There are many scenarios where you have to fight hard to get away from some one who is trying to kill you. If you don't push the buttons fast enough, you watch your character die painfully. It gives the player a much more personal involvement during game play. It's right at the level where it's a great game for adults who can separate themselves from the game, but too intense for kids.Controls/difficulty:There are 3 settings for difficulty. What makes the game more or less difficult is how fast you are at pressing buttons on the controller in different required sequences. There are some scenes that are quite challenging to get past, fortunately even in the middle of game play you can lower the difficulty rating. You still have to accomplish the same button sequences, however you are given just a bit more time to complete each command. In addition to playing the game with the regular PS3 controller, it can also be played using the PS3 Move controllers.Graphics:Astounding! The best I have ever seen. Close up shots of people's faces show just how unbelievably detailed they were in designing each and every person. You can see every speck of dirt in their clothing, the rain as it soaks their hair, deep textures in all of the objects and the scenery is so real you can completely envision yourself in the setting.Conclusion:One of the most powerful PS3 games I have ever played. Heavy Rain pulls you in and it's stunning graphics make you feel as though you are right there in the story. Emotional highs and lows run throughout the whole story, giving players even more incentive to try their best to find the killer in time. Plots twists you'll never see coming keep this game a shocker to the very end. You won't want to miss out on Heavy Rain, it is definitely a must buy game for your PS3 library. After completing the game once, I went back several chapters to replay other scenarios a few times, to see what the new game outcome would be. Heavy Rain is a game that even after you complete it, it pulls you back in to see what more is hidden that you missed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2012"}

I had been waiting in rage forever and the controls seemed tough on this one early in the game so I put it aside and played Rage. After that I was hesitant to start this up again because of the controls but I liked the other aspects of the game early on so I eventually decided to get back to this. SO GLAD I did!For those of you having trouble with the controls at first, please...stick to it! Once you get used to it and it clicks in with your hand/eye coordination  the controls actually work very well and feel much better. I'd say it took me about 4 hours of play to truely get used to them and another hour after that to be able to use them freely without thought, but after that it's so good you will have trouble believing you ever had issues with the controls.As for the game itself, it is so much fun I almost can't stand it. You can get VERY creative with kills and limb dismemberment and some of the areas are suffucating and claustrophibic which is GOOD in a zombie game. The tension is unreal. I played single player mostly but want to find a few people to go through this again in co-op with because the co-op I DID play was infinitely better than this already tight, fun game.The things that bring this down to a 4 aren't TOO bad but I can't give it a perfect score. I'll preface it with this though, the game is GREAT, it's worth playing so don't let the following deter you. There are way too many \"fortify the area\" type parts for my liking. This isn't necessarily bad, some may love this aspect of the game, but I myself liked it for the first few times I needed to do it but staled on it after a while. Another thing is that it DOES take so much time to get used to the control scheme. Like I said above though, it IS worth the effort. There were also quite a few bugs. Not any game breakers that I ran into, but plenty of minor ones that forced reloads and a few that had me resorting to looking up a solution on the internet. The good thing is that there WERE solutions to be found with a simple search, so no game breakers but it was a hassle when I needed to do this.Overall great game though and a breath of fresh air even in the crowded zombie genre.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000QY9C90","reviewerName":"B. Rose","summary":"Challenging, tense, and FUN!","reviewText":"I've played quite a few first-person shooters over the years and have experienced few games that revitalize the genre as 'Left 4 Dead' has.I'll try to be concise: L4D is fun. It's entertaining to play alone, but to get the full experience, you really need to play with friends.This isn't a game like Gears of War or Halo -- as good as you get, you still won't make it without your comrades backing you up, as you can easily be overhwhelmed by zombies at any moment... especially the 'special' zombie varieties (of which there are 6) capable of incapacitating your character (pinning or constricting you and draining your health) until a teammate comes to revive you.The best feature of the game is definitely the 'Versus' mode, where up to 8 players can face off in two teams of four, alternating between Survivors and Zombies. As survivors, you find yourself beset not only by the zombie hordes, but the players on the enemy team who constantly spawn as 'special' zombies.The tension of playing through each round in Versus as the survivors is offset by the opportunity for your team to play the zombies and work strategically to distract / disorient / disable your opponents.As survivors, you work your way through the map, aiming for the safe house that marks the end of each round (there are 4 safe houses in each campaign) -- you're constantly blasting away zombies and using the landscape to your defensive advantage.As zombies, you're suddenly given new abilities to lasso and strangle the survivors, mark them as targets for hordes of normal zombies, or tackle them and claw their faces to shreds -- but as a lone zombie, you'll be easy prey for the survivors' team. You'll be challenged to work with your zombie teammates to break down the survivors' formation and mutual support, leaving them vulnerable to an ambush that'll hopefully incapacitate or kill all the survivors.While there are only 4 campaigns -- only two of which are playable in 'Versus', though that's going to be remedied in a forthcoming free-of-charge content download -- the gameplay is dynamic and the challenge is never the same, as each play-through boasts randomly generated encounters and power-ups / weapon locations. While it's not the same as having a dozen different maps to explore, the random enemies and items, combined with the thrill of working with your friends as either survivors or zombies will keep you entertained for a long time.If you're a fan of Horror or FPS games and have friends to play with, get this game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2009"}

Squires \"theDrizzle\"","summary":"What I wished MW2 was","reviewText":"This review is not for single player as I have not played it yet, but I think we all know what MW is all about...multiplayer. It's a relief to see the Infinity Ward bright textures and great audio back in the series. Don't get me wrong, I liked Blackops, but to be honest, IW does a better job in the look and feel of the game IMO. The mechanics seems very good in this game; my connection dropped to 3 bars some of the time, but it didn't seem to have a huge impact on my gameplay. Even when I went to yellow, I was still playing well, so they seem to have got the connection issues as resolved as possible.Weapons handle very well and killstreaks are great. It's nice to go back to killstreaks that build other killstreaks. It takes a long time to level up and it's a little annoying to level up weapons, but it keeps the game more balanced as people wait to level up their weapons. I found myself missing the ability to purchase weapons and perks at first, but I think that the level system works nicely. I did use my prestige tokens to purchase double XP and double weapons Xp, so that helped me out a lot.Here's my ratings:Graphics: 10/10 (best you can do for this gen IMO)Audio: 10/10 (Amazing audio; I almost forgot how good my headphones could sound while playing BOs for a year)Maps: 9/10 (still some camping spots, but I don't see how they could have done a better job to help eliminate them...lots of action all the time)Overall rating: 10/10 (So far this is the best COD title I've played. They obviously listened to the fans and they've made an amazing product/)*Only negative IMO is that they don't give the third killstreak package until level 20. I hoped this package would slow the crazy killstreaks a little and just give people extra perks, but so far, most people don't have itFor those of you who say it's MW 2.5, you've lost your minds. The graphics are similar, but keep in mind that they've pretty much maxed what this gen consoles can do. FYI: MW 2.5 isn't really an insult. That game was amazing; the only issue was the hacking and glitches. It's too early to tell if they've fixed that, but I haven't encountered any issues thus far. If they support the game the way Treyarch did, then we're in for a great year.If you liked MW2, but you're on the fence with this game, I highly recommend getting it. It has the same MW2 charm, with a lot of the issues fixed and great new guns, maps and killstreaks.Could defiantly be a contender for game of the year.Good luck and good gaming to you all.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2011"}

In desperation, the Soviets created a time-travel device that they've used to assassinate Albert Einstein before he is able to develop the weapon technology the Allies later use to defeat the Soviets. Upon returning, they notice a new world, and there is a world war taking place between three groups for control of the world.Play As Three Different Factions for Varied game playIn Red Alert 3, you have the choice to play as the Allies, the Soviets, or the Empire of the Rising Sun. Each faction has its own story-line and distinct units with advantages and disadvantages that you have to master in order to win. The new faction to the series is the Empire of the Rising Sun, derived from Imperial Japan, with an all-new cast of units and characters.The three factions have many differences, exemplified by their wildly different types of units. The Soviets, for example, have armored attack bears, Allies have the Dolphin ship which can high jump and use a sonic attack, and the Empire of the Rising Sun features such quirky units as a giant transforming mecha and ninjas. As they've done with the series, EA injects humor into the game when possible, keeping a smile on your face as you wage war.Fight on Land, in the Air, and on SeaRed Alert 3 has land units, air units, and naval units, all integral parts of the game. Unlike most strategy games that don't bother with naval warfare, Red Alert 3 makes controlling the seas an essential part of the game. Controlling resources in the seas and mounting attacks from all directions are strategies that must be employed to achieve victory.Cooperative Mode Lets You Team Up with Your FriendsRed Alert 3 has a fully co-operative campaign mode where you and a friend can play together to achieve victory. This means that you have to develop a strategy together, as well as execute it in synch in order to win. If your friends aren't online, you can also choose one of several AI commanders as your teammate.Play Against Your Friends in MultiplayerWith the different units and play mechanics of each faction, you and your friends will have a great time playing against each other, perfecting different strategies to best suit the units you have and the maps you play on. And thanks to the balanced game play, no one will have an unfair advantage.For previous fans of Command and Conquer, Red Alert 3 will provide the same light-hearted game play, but with more units, more strategies, and more fun.

Suffice to say, EA is quickly eroding their customer base. On one hand, they complain about piracy, then wonder why they have more piracy when they impose draconian steps to curtail it.Red Alert 3 replays the original Red Alert storyline. In place of Einstein, to have the Russian Commandant, played by Tim Curry, who has been involved in more games than Gary Gygax. Using a Russian time machine, they kill Albert Einstein, presumably after he kills Adolf Hitler, setting the stage for a three way war between the Allies, the Soviets, and the Japanese, represented by the Empire of the Rising Sun.Following the mantra of the previous C&C; games, you run through a progressively harder series of missions, sometimes with a combat squad, but often with the familiar base system we all know and love. The storylines are entertaining, though as the title implies, the uniforms have shrunk by five or six sizes. This is strange and disturbing for two reasons. You're so busy staring at breasts that're barely contained by jet black latex suits that you miss your entire briefing, and when you replay the briefing with a strategically placed piece of duct tape, the briefings are really pretty good. Emotions and accents are a tad over the top, but the production values and immersion levels of the Command and Conquer series has steadily improved. Why they felt the need to try and improve sales by making the cutscenes strike of soft-core porn is beyond me.They've also introduced the deputy commander, a second officer played by either a friend or the computer that maintains its own base and forces. While you can't control the other forces directly, you can give strategic orders to the other commander. This is a great improvement, as you can defend and send them on attack, though more likely vice versa, ensuring there is always a defense force without having to split your focus.Aside from the neat co-op option that I just mentioned, theres nothing here that hasn't been seen before, but if you're a fan of the series, you definitely won't feel let down. The difficulty curve is a little step later in the game, but not so difficult to make you give up. Cutscenes continue to improve, and in-game mini briefs a more frequent, and make it feel more like a progressing battle than an attrition slugfest. Personally, I'm going to wait for the battle chest with the expansions that's a few months away, but I'm trying to think of my wallet as much as possible. And by that point, hopefully EA will get the sand out of its ears and be able to hear their falling market share, and realize they need a better solution than securom.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2008"}
{"product_name":"B003PHLTDC","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"Anyone got a virtual cigarette? This game does.","reviewText":"I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with Vanquish. Perhaps very foolishly, I started my first go through of the game on hard difficulty, and it really kicked my @$$ more than once over the very short campaign. Still, as I reflect on the experience days after beating it, I have to say that Vanquish was a very positive experience for me.Vanquish has a lot of striking strengths that will immediately win you over.  This is not your run-of-the-mill third person shooter. In fact, it is one of the most unique shooters I've played. Made by the talented Platinum games (Bayonetta), and directed by Shinji Mikami (contributed heavily toViewtiful Joe,Devil May Cryseries,Ace Attorneyseries,Shadows of the Damned, and created theResident Evilseries. Yeah, he's had an amazing career)  This is a massive, kinetic assault on the senses. You are Sam Gideon, a former college football star turned suit-tester adrenaline junkie for DARPA, equipped with the totally awesome ARS suit. The story is nearly non-existent, most of the characters are bare bones skeleton caricatures, the villains are predictable, and it's all so very cheesy. The main characters have a very cheesy charm. It's a very testosterone driven game, with your fellow npcs screaming profanities and commenting on the nature between peace & war (I'm kidding about the last part). Seriously, you don't play Vanquish for the story. You play it for the totally rad style, the feeling of being a bad@$$ in an awesome suit, and for the gameplay. The story elements in this game would be a lot worse if it weren't for the clearly purposeful cheesiness of the whole thing. It doesn't take itself so seriously, and that's a great thing. Fans of cheesy, epic sci-fi rejoice!The music can range from pretty good to decent techno. It's nothing special, but it drives the action along and that's all that really matters. The art direction in Vanquish is very cool. It's full of sterile whites and futuristic space station motifs. I was amazed how much detail was packed into the environments and character models, all of which combine to remind me very strongly ofHalo,Gears Of War, andMass Effect(all of which are clearly and purposefully saluted or nodded to in one form or another in this game). Again, everything about this game screams action, and that includes the graphics. Bosses explode in a massive shower of sparks and cinders, an astounding number of tracer fire fills the screen, and the set pieces are spectacular. I don't want to give anything away, but more than one set piece had me picking my jaw up off the floor. It's all very cool. The motion and model animations are all exceptionally smooth too, from the far off environments to the close up vents and power structures on Sam's suit. The ARS suit should win an award for coolest suit ever.The gameplay itself, in all aspects is so razor sharp, it's hard to find any problems. The controls are insanely close to perfection. They're tight, responsive, and absolutely refined. Any death in this game, even the numerous \"cheap\" kamayamaya FU instaskills, really can't be blamed on the game because the controls are so refined, each death could have been avoided. The game features a bar for your suit's coolness levels and severely limits you and your abilities if you overheat it. This bar is used for a bullet time effect, which is very well done, melee attacks (the only thing not very well done in the game), and a very responsive, maneuverable sliding boost power. The cover mechanics are amazingly well done and even more so when combining the bullet time or sliding abilities with it. It's all extremely well done. It's hard to really go that much into detail about Vanquish's gameplay. All I can say is that it is a totally unique take on 3rd person shooting and is so chaotic, you'll love it. It really is exceptional. Oh, and Sam has a button where he takes a drag from a cig and flicks it to distract enemy attention. It's awesome. Sam smokes a lot, and has an extremely gravely voice. He's a bad@$$. He gives himself cancer so you don't have to.So what are the problems with Vanquish? For one thing, it is extremely short: a paltry five hours on normal or less difficulty. It's a single-player only game, which is fine, but it really should be longer since single player is the only focus of the game. You can play on hard and maybe it will last you 10-15, but only because the many deaths artificially extend the gameplay. There's also six tactical challenges that are like firefight in Halo. They're ridiculously difficult. Another \"problem\" people might have with Vanquish is that it has a very steep learning curve. I died many instadeaths, and at times became so frustrated I needed to take a break. Again, I played on hard, but still, frustration will pop up. I was able to look past that, but many probably would not.So there you have it. Vanquish is a super fun game that boasts fantastic art direction/execution, exceptional gameplay that nails its intended purpose, and will leave you an adrenaline-depleted husk by the time its over. Normally, I play games for story first and gameplay second. This one is so good, I don't mind the barely there story because the gameplay is so fresh and awesome. If you are in any way a fan of chaos, transforming, robot anime, sci-fi epicness, Japanese-centric , exploding things, give Vanquish a try. Again, this is not typically my cup-o-tea, and while Vanquish is not a perfect game by any means, it is awesome. Buy it, slide n'slode thru it, smoke a cig after it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2011"}

If I recall, this game was kind of a sleeper release, but I could be wrong.  The game play mechanics are solid as far as I can tell. The beauty in this game lies in the fact that this is a melee style game.  Most zombie games I've played involves shooting tons of bullets into an animated corpse as it shuffles/runs towards you.This game has those same elements, but it's up close and personal - hand to hand mayhem.  Also, the game provides an excellent sense of survival - scrounging for cash to upgrade/repair/build weapons, random startling encounters with enemies, some battles that actually force you to flee for your life.  All of this really draws you into the game and makes it personal.  I'm not too far in with the storyline, so I can't say whether the story seems to make sense, but so far I haven't thought, &#34;did they really just say that?&#34; or &#34;oh, so they're using THAT plot device that has probably never been used before, but wait! It has!&#34;My only complaint with this game so far is pretty simple, and could be due to my place in the games progression, and can be easily remedied in game.  It is this: the weapons seem to deteriorate very quickly.  So if you upgrade a weapon, you may only be able to use it a couple times before it loses its effectiveness.  I think the concept of having degrading weapons is great, but I just wish they degradation didn't take such a short time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2013"}

So far this has worked just as planned.  We're probably half way through, and we're having a lot of fun, and having some great family interaction.My son is 8 and my daughter is 5.  He loves it and has figured out some tricky parts all by himself, which is a great confidence builder.  Most of the puzzles are beyond my daughter, but she loves to put in her two cents when we're discussing possible solutions.I've not played many of the older PC games which are referenced in the description and reviews, but I'm familiar with the genre enough to know what to expect.  Essentially this is an action puzzle game.  Each level is an environment, limited in size, in which you are trying to recover a treasure chest.  You interact with objects and overcome obstacles in your efforts to ultimately get to the chest.  Some of the puzzles are tricky and take a lot of trial and error, so patience is required, however I don't find this aspect frustrating.  It's all part of the game, and learning from your mistakes is a key to solving the puzzles.And the solutions or actions you take along the way are generally very logical, so there's none of the \"combine the lemon with the boat anchor\" arbitrary nonsense which I've encountered with similar puzzle games on the PC in the past.And one more point - the wii is ideal for this sort of game.

Newberry \"agent_47\"","summary":"Best New IP of 2009","reviewText":"After 200 or so hours and probably 1,000's of weapons later , I now need to apply for a Borderlands addiction therapy program.Borderlands at heart is a grinder game, it has that diablo-ish vibe about it that has a never ending quest of finding chest after chest of different gun types.Yes the story is all in text form and really barely there , but Borderlands is all about looting , farming, shooting stuff and exploration.It's in no way a talking heads RPG, all of the NPC are little more than statues, but who cares, there's so many things to kill so many things to see and do it online with 4 people at any time drop in drop out , this game is just short of a masterpiece.Borderlands is a different enough game to really be in its own category.Remember those times in Fallout3 when you got tired of talking heads and just wanted to shoot stuff? Well Borderlands is that 100% of the time.The game does start off a bit on the slow side , while you get settled and level up a bit and the quests and missions are locked in at a difficulty , so if you attempt a mission that says \"impossible\"  you may wanna level up a bit so it will say 'tough' 'normal' or where your a demon killing god 'trivial' difficulty.  You have that freedom.Not strong enough yet?  well go level up killing random enemies looting chests and come back when you level is higher, its not like Oblivion or Fallout3 AT ALL , the difficulty is locked in .Also you can keep everything you have after the credits roll and start a new game again, then enemies are even harder this time around.Really the best play through is the 2nd play through.Borderlands should be on the shelf of anyone familiar with hardcore grinders type diablo-ish game with the shooter mechanics of halo and COD in a blender.The guns are tiered in rarity by the color of the text describing the weapon and you'll forever be on the lookout for the legendary Orange text weapons, which I now have 100% of , by way of farming.Yes farming and duping is in the game, but its still fun , you don't need to do it , but with 17 million plus guns , its a never ending addiction long after the credits roll.Of course all the weapons have a rock,paper,scissors like effect , with no real one weapon beast of all. One weapon is better than another against certain enemies and so on so forth.Liquid fast fun online co-op .The only downside are there are the rather mundane 'fetch' missions and sometimes you can get into co-op games where the kids in the room want nothing more than to smack you for a duel challenge, luckily you can turn off duels in your options so you don't end up in games with nothing but kids who wanna pown you with their latest duped weapon by way of chest farming.But if that happened either stay or find another room in about 5 seconds .Easy cheesy on line co-op flawed just short of perfection , yet perfect in every way if that makes sense?Borderlands a definite buy for the hardcore grinder fan.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001PKHRVE","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Surprisingly great","reviewText":"When it comes to licensed video games, whether they be licensed from movies, comics, or both; the case usually ends up being that the game is a rushed and buggy mess that has little to do with what it is licensed from in the first place.  Well, we should all rejoice because what we get with X-Men Origins: Wolverine is something that is quite the contrary.  Wolverine is a bloody and oh so fun blast that delivers the action goods, and a good amount of surprisingly violent gameplay.  The game is a simple beat 'em up at its core, but it is designed pretty well considering this is a licensed tie-in type of game, and utilizes Wolverine's claws and abilities to great effect.  The enemies are actually pretty varied as well, which is a change of pace considering the genre, and there are some great boss fights to be had with familiar foes like Sabretooth, Gambit, Blob, and the Sentinels.  Film stars Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber even lend their voices to the game as Wolverine and Sabretooth, and provide some good work as well.  The only drawbacks to X-Men Origins: Wolverine lie in the fact that at its heart the game is fairly easy to get through, and isn't all that long either.  Still, you won't find many licensed tie-in games that are better than X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and if you're a Wolverine/X-Men fan in the least, you should definitely check this game out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2009"}

I looked forward to this for over a year.First the good.  Graphics are very good even with the low to medium settings I was required to use because of my system.  Audio, for the most part, was excellent.  AI was a slight step up from other games in the genre, but not as much as I had expected.  The game-play was engaging - at least for most of the game.The only negative aspect in the graphics and sound department was the tremendous amount of computer power that must be needed to run higher settings.  Although I have a mid to high computer system, I was required to run the game at a low resolution with advanced settings set to either low or medium.  I couldn't come anywhere close to my monitor's native resolution of 1920 x 1200, even with all settings on the lowest setting.What was odd is that if I let the game detect and set \"optimal\" settings, it would select a a medium resolution and high advanced settings.  But playing at that, I could only get maybe 12-15 fps.  So, the detection system was useless.  I had to tweak manually to get the framerate to acceptable levels.I finally was able to get the framerate at an average of 35-40 fps - which is very acceptable, however, every few minutes, I would hit a \"bump\" and my framerate would briefly drop to 0 and then bounce back up to the 35-40.  Because this was happening so often, I had to take another step back in the graphics department and play on DX9 mode instead of DX10.It was disappointing to have upgraded my computer to a duel core, 2gb or RAM and a 640mb Nvidia 8800 GTS DX10 graphics card only to run a game on DX9 with low settings and a low resolution.  And this was after reading tweak guides, turning off background programs, downloading the latest drivers from Nvidia, etc.  Very odd, and I suspect Crysis was rushed out and not optimized correctly.The story and the characterization were weak in my opinion - characterization more so than the story.  This is a fairly straightforward FPS with not a lot happening with character development.Levels early in the game were much more interesting with more openness and options.  As the game progressed, it became more and more linear - to the point of being very limiting.There were a lot of glitches in the game - items floating around, things spinning.  There was a lot of clipping.  Some problems became quite a nuisance.  For example, getting an objective to clear an area and after doing so just standing there for additional directions.  None came and I spent the next ten minutes searching around until I found a hostile in a boxcar just spinning around.  He wouldn't die by gunshot, so I had to grab him and throw him to the side.  Once he died, it triggered the next script and I got an updated objective.The last few levels were excruciatingly glitchy.  On the ship, I kept falling through the floor to the point that it was extremely hard to complete the objectives.  The boss battles were lame.  It appeared to me that the game was rushed toward the end and they just threw some things together.  The ending was a let down.  And the thing is, the game itself was very short - maybe 9 hours or so, I would guess.  You'd think they could develop something a little better in a few year's time.I enjoyed the game, but it just wasn't as good as I had expected.  High expectation can do that.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give Crysis a solid 8.  If it were optimized to run better and without the glitches (which could be possible with some patches in the future) I would up that score to 8.5.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2007"}

Catherine's core themes-those of free will, of the delicate nature of relationships and the choices we make within them, marry perfectly with the intense, terror-filled gameplay that serves to accurately reflect Vincent's growing sense of anxiety. It is an experience wholly unlike any to come before it, and is certain to leave gamers talking and thinking about Vincent's tribulations long after the credits have rolled.","reviewerName":"D. A. Theisen","summary":"A game for the Masochist in all of us","reviewText":"Catherine is unique. Unlike anything before it, and likely nothing after it (unless others want to develop on the \"puzzle horror\" genre this has invented). It's cunning and cruel, yet mysteriously enlightening and lighthearted at the same time.Let's say hello to Vincent, a normal guy living a pretty normal life. He has a long-term girlfriend and is quickly headed toward a Facebook \"it's complicated\" status. For unknown reasons, nightmares are putting some strain on his day-to-day sanity. Every day his actions weight upon his character; sliding a bar from side-to-side which is Catherine (the game's) way of keeping track of your feelings and desires. It's really up to you how that ends up. All your social interactions and inner thoughts add up to your eventual fate. At no point do your actions have no meaning. Brutal. The game narrator suggests you go with your \"inner-most\" feelings when making choices, and your result will probably be more authentic that way.Where hopelessness and shock settles in is at the realization that Vincent is an average schmuck. He has no special powers or abilities (besides extreme mobility while holding a pillow). He's not mythical or born of fantasy. He has no plans of world domination or a personal vendetta to follow. Really, he just wants a good night of sleep. It may be the lowest bar a protagonist in a video game has ever sought, and yet even this is a very difficult task.The apparent route to some good Zs? Puzzles-- an escape up a collapsing wall of movable blocks to avoid surrendering to \"fate\" if it catches up to you. You would be right to question how a game from the generally-serious people at Atlus would be seemingly so simplistic, but the instant you question their motives, you've fallen into their trap. Catherine absolutely punishes the player with progressively more difficult puzzles, and things are rarely as simple or straightforward as they might seem. Some puzzle variations are quite silly with things like bouncing boards, and other rather terrifying with things like spike traps. The difficulty level for many is a turn-off, but on \"Easy\" most players should be able to retain some sanity thanks to a handy \"undo\" button.One special thing I can't get over-- between levels you'll be left to socialize with those mysterious sheep that inhabit the nightmare world, and each time you'll have to answer a generic yes/no question on your personal feelings of a subject. For example, \"Does life begin or end at marriage?\" ... Answer, and if online you'll see a chart of all responding players. Delightfully devious.Your decent into madness as a player trying to rush through psychotic tower climbing every night is merely compounded the next day of real-life events as Vincent finds himself in a more and more hopeless position. 'Why is she in my bed?' -- 'Oh, that call was just someone from work!' -- 'Yes, dear, I'll try not to drink too much'. Another night at the corner bar behind you, your reward is another night of controller-cracking challenge in the dream world. This is the sadistic cycle... the harder you push and farther you go, your misery revs up in both worlds, and it's very easy to sink a lot of play time in here without realizing it. It's a truly satanic spiral into madness for those willing to indulge, with an ending that completely blindsides. The ending alone is entirely worth finishing a full play-through.Difficulty is the single worst thing holding Catherine back, but as mentioned, \"easy\" is fairly kind. Mental discipline is needed to play through the puzzles, but in comparison to those, Vincent's social interactions that you have control over bring out little enthusiasm if you're just casually and randomly choosing your actions. It's great to watch the common banter between Vincent and friends, and not getting into the social aspects will really detract from the overall experience. Ignoring it all would be cheating yourself out of much of what you paid for.Because of its complete deviation from the norm, the overall presentation is arguably a little too esoteric. That's the thing... each \"half\" of the game does not compliment the other. If you want to really simplify, you have a fancy puzzle game you might find on your smart phone combined with a Japanese dating sim and they could be pulled apart separately. The two very slowly come together in some obvious and other not-so-obvious ways, but some fantastic graphic style and A-rate soundtrack do help with the immersion level. The voice acting is believable (past some minor dubbing issues), and expressions captured rather well.This is an Adult game-- as in, for adults. When you load it up, it's never really something you would feel comfortable taking lightly. It's made for mature minds, so don't let that \"M\"-rating on the case trick you into assuming it's there for the meaningless sex and violence it usually accompanies. It's there, but as practically an art form compared to shock-value exposure from so, so many other games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2011"}

I had a pretty good time playing it other than the few problems that I encountered, which is why in my opinion, it isn't 5-star worthy.Overall, the game is mildly enjoyable.  It reminded me quite a bit of Fallout, which I did enjoy but found some aspects overwhelming.  The controls are fine, the cell-shaded graphics look great, and everything sounds up to par.What I didn't care for is the back-tracking, the constant respawning enemies, and the multitude of mutant dogs (or variations of) that I encountered in the first 4 hours of the game.  There are millions of these stupid mutts, and all of the back-tracking to and from mission start points force you to either navigate around or kill them.  If you do shoot one, typically three more come flying out of their den to attack you.  They're not difficult to kill, but not fun either.  They're irritating and they're everywhere.  The mission objectives are fine.  But so far, all of the missions either involve killing mutant dogs or making it to some object which is on the other side of 30 dog dens.  The only variety comes in the form of hordes of large flying creatures, who just like the dogs, attack in packs.The online multiplayer seems alright, although every match I joined, the host was way ahead of the rest of the party, leaving us to kill mutant dogs while he/she completed the objective.  Its my bet that this is the more enjoyable way to play if you all stay in the same vicinity.  The single-player mode got just too repetitive.I don't regret buying this game and will continue to play it, but most likely only in the online mode.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00005TNI6","description":"Final Fantasy Xis the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"ATHF Fan","summary":"Not the best ever but still very good","reviewText":"Im not a very big fan of the FF series, I have played numbers 4,7, and 9, and for the most part enjoyed them. But I didn't find them groundbreaking lake most people claim them to be. Im not really an RPG fan also, but I love the Chrono series. So I didnt really excpect much from this game. But when I started to play I found the game to be incredble, as the game went on, it turned out to be a game like every other Final Fantasy with a very generic plot. But still the game is very well done, its the first in the series to feature voice overs,and the Graphics are very good, but the only thing different frolm the others is the new battle system which I find very well done (it lets you swch characters during battle and includes an overkill). If you love the FF series Im sure youll love this, but if your not a big fan of them you might want to rent this first.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2002"}

WOW they freaking sound amazing.. YOU HEAR EVERYTHING PERFECTLY!!  I am a hardcore gamer and after using this on GHost and Battlefield 4 my kill/death ration improved extremely..  The only problem is that all the fancy stuff this set offers are on the amplifier so by removing it from amplifier I cant mute or use the other awesome things this set suppose to offer..  Late Janurary PS4 is releasing a patch that should make all problems with the headsets be fixed..

The single player gets old fast, but that is the case with all games of this type.  The use of vehicles and AA guns in addition to the standard air-to-air combat helps out.The GOOD- Fun.- Cheaper than other games.- Wide selection of aircraft, weapons and guns.- Not any real noticeable glitches or lagging.- Some levels are very large and detailed.- The controls feel odd at first, but work well once you get the hang of them.- A game you can just drop into.The BAD- The single player tends to get boring.- Some of the mission objectives are down-right annoying, especially escort missions.- The \"Tesla\" weapons encountered later tend to \"lock\" onto you, which is really annoying.- You can only upgrade certain planes and then only once - I would have liked to apply more upgrades to my favorite planes.The UGLY- Ok, the below surface levels are a real pain in the rear.  The close quarters are bad enough, but trying to navigate the narrow corridors is really frustrating, especially when you just can't seem to find the exit.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000WS97QI","reviewerName":"B. McBeth \"PSN/XLive/Steam: DirkPittSpawn\"","summary":"Why open a door when you can create one?","reviewText":"I've been having a lot of fun with this game. The single player is a good experience, with wide-open areas and different options of going around doing things. So far the story is pretty good and I have to say the voice acting is great. In fact the sounds of this game are just amazing. Bullets overhead, mortars impacting near you, and the individual sound of your own gun all have that realistic feel to them.Everything has that Battlefield gritty feel to it, and there's nothing more satisfying than blasting a wall down to attack a sniper that was hiding behind it. The Frostbite engine is definitely something considering how much of the battlefield is destructible.And while you go around, be on the look out for gold and \"collectibles,\" which are basically weapons that you can find and equip as you go along in the game. The uncommon/rare weapons are difficult to find and you can only carry one main. (so your loadout includes: Main gun with either grenade/grenade launcher, health injector, and one other item that you can switch out-- RPG, Mortar Strike Radio, C4, Repair tool).The multiplayer is quite the experience too. Very wide-open maps with tons of breathing room. Working with teammates and getting a feel for each of the classes and the different weapons for each is a welcome experience.Currently I'm trying to unlock the weapons/items in the game to give each class a boost. I'd definitely recommend unlocking the health injector for Assault and the laser designator for the Recon class. After that, it's up to your own preferences. The Support class is an interesting one, you have your Light Machine Gun (SAW, M60, etc.), health pack (can throw to allies), Repair tool, and the unlockable mortar strike.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2008"}
