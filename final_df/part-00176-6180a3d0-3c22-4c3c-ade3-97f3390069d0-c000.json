Back then, things were not developmental like now. Games such as XCOM and Fallouts were turn based game, and they were accepted in gamers society. The bottom line is, you need to have patience to play this game. It's not an easy game and turn based makes the game play slow. I thought I would have fun playing this game. If you don't finish this turn, the game just waits for you until you make a move. I'd rather play &#34;The Sims&#34; or other game that moves in real time. Just wait until they sell this game for less than $40.00","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00CQ7CIMS","description":"","reviewerName":"Bradley Corwin","summary":"An Okay Game for Luigi","reviewText":"This game is not a drastic change from the original Super Mario Bros U game. You get the same map with all the levels reworked. They are shorter and you are supposed to complete them in a faster amount of time. To me it seems a little easier. The physics (jumping and running) are different too. I personally don't like it as much. Also when playing with 4 player, whoever uses Nabbit gets bored since he can't die and it's cheating on all the boss fights. I wouldn't say this is a must have, but if you like Luigi and have the spare money you might as well.  It is cool to see him get the spotlight for a change and there are hidden Luigi elements throughout the levels.  I look forward a \"Year of Luigi\" game designed from the ground up for him.The New Super Luigi U allows you to use the pro controller as an option to the Wii remote.  I still prefer the Wii remote but it's largely a preference with what feels the most comfortable to you.It's also worth noting that if you own the original Super Mario Bros U, you can buy this game as DLC for $10 cheaper.Update Sept 2013: I just beat this game with two friends and I did enjoy it.  To me the first few worlds were boring but the water world was really fun.  It's just a much faster paced game and largely a lot of what you've already seen.  Some levels will be almost exactly the same while others will be completely different.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2013"}

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"Not \"Star Wars,\" But Still a Lot of Fun!","reviewText":"I starting playing with Legos over 25 years ago.  I only started playing Xbox 1 year ago!  I played both LEGO Star Wars II: the Original Trilogy and LEGO Star Wars the Complete Saga - both to 100%.These games are a lot of fun, and if you enjoyed playing Lego Star Wars you WILL enjoy playing LEGO Indiana Jones.  I am not an Indiana Jones fan - I can't remember seeing a SINGLE I.J. movie.  But I STILL enjoy these games because the play style is familiar and even at 29 years of ago, I LOVE LEGOS!The game divides its story into three movies - Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom, and Last Crusade.  Each movie is broken into 6 sub-sections which after completing players can continue to the next section or return to Barnett College which serves as a playable \"menu,\" allowing players to switch to a different movie, purchase characters or \"extras\" such as invincibility, etc.  Purchases use ingame currency, called \"Studs,\" represented by small, round lego blocks.LEGO Characters in the game use various skills to proceed through the levels - piles of legs must be assembled into vehicles doorways, or bridges.  Characters can use shovels to dig up treasure chests or other blocks for a multitude of uses.  Indiana Jones can use his trusty whip to grab unreachable items, or swing from platform to platform.  The game is usually pretty clear about what needs to be done next - buried items \"sparkle,\" platforms that Indy can swing from are highlighted, and even crawlspaces and hieroglyphic boards are highlighted to stand out, easing the puzzle solving process.The game does seem to be a bit more \"buggy\" than the Lego versions.  Characters swinging items or picking items up sometimes causes a weird \"blip\" on the screen where the game engine seems to forget the shape of the item, causing a very weird stretching glitch on the screen.  It's very brief, but weird nonetheless.  In the Star Wars versions, some sections would require on-screen characters to work in tandem to access rooms/platforms.  In these situations, the artificial intelligence would kick in, causing the non-player-controller character to perform the required duties.  In Indiana Jones, however, the game forces the player to set the first character in position, then press a button to assume control of the second character, performing its required duties.  What often seems to happen is, when control is switched from one character to the next, the AI takes over the first character, moving him/her out of position and requring the player to start all over again.  This isn't often, but happens just frequent enough to cause frustration and in some cases, required the same sequence to be performed several times before being succesful.The new parcel retrieval puzzles, which allow the unlocking of things like invulnerability, multiplication of collected studs, etc, is a fun addition which requires new methods of problem solving not present in the Star Wars games.  More challenging still is the ability to move various structures that then make reaching artifacts or parcels impossible, causing you to replay the level more strategically.  This isn't a bad thing - it forces you to think a little harder.Lastly, the bang for your buck is tremendous, as it was in all of the Star Wars games.  Reaching 100% completion in the game can require replaying each subsection of each movie 3 or more times to reach every artifact or parcel, or unlock every character.  Completing all three movies might only require 10 hours or so.  I've played for approximately 25 hours and am only 75% complete with the game.  Players unfamiliar with the LEGO game strategy may need more time to learn the tricks of the game designers.The only downside is, once the game is completed to 100%, it's virtually worthless.  It'll take you a long time to get there, but there's little fun value after playing unless you're a die-hard Indiana Jones fan.  I chose to rent the game because I know I could reach 100% (and earn all the achievements) before the return date.LEGO Indiana Jones does a few things worse than it's predecessors but has a few new tricks up it's sleeve.  It's a fun game that never gets too challenging or too frustrating and provides hours of clean, fun entertainment for all age ranges.  What more can you really ask for in a video game?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00004SVXG","description":"NES Game","reviewerName":"M. B. Link \"wildfirelink\"","summary":"The one that started it all","reviewText":"Mega Man(1987). Part one of a nine game series.For the most part, NES action platform games were very entertaining, but often they lacked variety and ways to reward the player. Most games (with the exception of RPG and Adventure games) had you play as a character who is more or less the same at the end as they were when you started. In 1987, Capcom stepped in and came up with an interesting idea: \"What if you could defeat a boss and steal their weapon to use for the rest of the game?\" Thus, the Mega Man series was born. Here's the lowdown on the first legendary game:PROS:-While the story isn't exactly incredible, this being the first game, it is actually pulled off well. Two scientists, Dr. Light and Dr. Wily, created six mining robots which specialized in specific environments. However, Dr. Wily became jealous of Dr. Light's praise and so he reprogrammed these six robots to do his own evil bidding. Secretly, Dr. Light had created two household robots, Rock and Roll. Rock decides to have Dr. Light fit him with armor and a plasma gun in order to stop Dr. Wily and the six corrupted Mining bots, thus turning Rock into Mega Man.-Even though there are only six bosses, they are each very unique and offer a variety of weapons. For instance, Cutman throws his scissors out in a boomerang-like fashion, while Gutsman picks up boulders and hurls them. Also, THE BOSSES ARE NICE AND TOUGH. Elecman is particularly nasty.-Mega Man's controls are nice and simple. He may not have a lot of abilities in this game, but the \"jump/run/shoot\" set of controls are all he really needs here.-POSSIBLY THE MOST DIFFICULT ENTRY IN THE SERIES. Yes, this game will really test your gaming abilities to the limit, as there are no E-tanks and passwords to be found here. I seem to notice that a lot of people complain about the lack of passwords. Please. Mega Man games are generally pretty short, so IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE PATIENCE TO SIT THROUGH AN ENTIRE MEGA MAN GAME, THEN YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN BOTHER PLAYING THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. I never use passwords.-GREAT VARIETY OF LEVEL DESIGNS AND ENEMIES TO FIGHT. The levels aren't too terribly long, but not brief either. Likewise, the enemies will definitely keep the player busy enough to make it challenging, but not too frustrating (except for maybe the final levels).-The graphics are nice for the era, and there is very little if any slowdown present. The sprites of Mega Man and the bosses are all equal size, not like later entries in which the bosses dwarf the poor blue guy.-This might be cheating, but I LIKE THE PAUSE CHEAT THAT YOU CAN USE TO HELP YOU WITH SOME BOSSES. I won't tell you how to use it. Find out yourselves.-Though the sound effects are good, IT'S THE MUSIC THAT WILL REALLY CATCH YOUR ATTENTION. Most of the tunes are done well, my favorites being Iceman and Elecman's themes in particular.There are no bad tunes to be found here.CONS:-Even though this is the first game, I THOUGHT THAT THE MAGNET BEAM GENERATOR ABILITY WAS LACKING. Whenever you're standing on one and it disappears, you not only fall, but you DIVE STRAIGHT DOWN AS FAST AS A BULLET! It's the only extra ability besides the boss weapons, and it seemed like a good idea, but not quite there in its execution.-THERE ARE NO E-TANKS YET. This isn't that big of a deal because this makes the game more challenging, but there a few areas (the later levels in particular) in which you'll really wish you had them.-SPIKES ARE THE DEVIL IN THIS GAME!! Not because they can kill you in one hit, but because they can kill you while you're recovering from an attack. It might make traversing levels harder, but I find this to be annoying. Thankfully, Capcom fixed this in the next game.-Though the main character is in fact Mega Man, by looking at the box cover, you'd think otherwise.-What's up with the point system? You go around collecting little orange and red balls throughout the levels which are supposed to increase your score at the end of each level, but THE POINTS NEVER EARN YOU LIVES OR ANYTHING. Thankfully, this is the only game to include points.Overall, this is a great game even though there are a few rough spots here and there. Besides, it laid the official groundwork for the rest of the series, and EVERYONE HAS TO AT LEAST APPRECIATE THAT. It's not my favorite MM game, but it is certainly not bad at all. In fact, this was the last of the NES MM games I played. 4 stars overall. If you want a game which has a great old-school feel, but will not let you down on the challenge factor, then the first MM game is the right place to come to. Get equipped with bubble lead and go find a copy!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2003"}

As you bought it, it came with a launch title. That launch title is...Super Mario 64 for the DS? Yeah, one of the launch titles is really a remake of an old Nintendo 64 game. But you know what's so great about it? That old Nintendo 64 game was one of the best games ever created, and having to experience it on a portable machine was a big thrill.This time, you start out playing as Yoshi. The other playable characters have to be unlocked. Fortunately, Yoshi isn't all that bad. Sure, he can't wall jump like Mario can or even punch, but he can eat up enemies and throw them as eggs! This can upset those with nostalgia, but at least it isn't long before you unlock Mario.Speaking of which, there are lots of new areas to play in. As you enter a new level to unlock a character, you'd end up discovering that there's more to it. You can find red coins, get a Star before it disappears, etc. Even though these levels are new, you'd still have that classic Mario 64 feel. Heck, there are also new missions. Do you remember collecting 5 Silver Stars, or, as already mentioned, race against time to snatch a star, or use Wario to break black bricks? I'm sure you don't. All of this results (Extra levels and missions) in 30 more Stars to collect in this already-big game.Another thing to enjoy is a nice selection of minigames. These can be unlocked by snatching rabbits with keys (instead of Stars), although there already are some minigames to choose from. These minigames play like arcade games: They go on and on, but they are very addicting, or at least, for some, they can go on if you let them.One problem that I find with the game is that there's no analog. For the most part, it plays fine without it, but when it comes to stuff like swinging Bowser's tail, it's just one of those instances where you think that the game should be played with analog and not a stylus or a D-Pad to make things a little easier. Another problem is the multiplayer. It's only a Vs mode, with you and your friend searching for Stars, or beating yourselves up to steal each others'. In early screenshots of the game, I see co-op multiplayer. It disappoints me to realize that you can't team up to fight Bowser in this final product.But overall, it was a fabulous start for the Nintendo DS. It's one of the best games I know, and having the game on the go only increases the fun I'd have with it.

{"product_name":"B00006LEMX","description":"Looking for a new obsession to keep you up nights? Let me introduce you to Hotsuma, the main character inShinobi, the much anticipated new action-adventure game from Sega. Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics. The anime-style cutscenes woven around the slice-and-dice sequences provide an interesting story, but one that doesn't relate very directly with your job on the streets of postapocalyptic Tokyo. Your moves are cool though--spinning in midair to collect coins that will unlock secret levels, killing three ninjas with a flash of Akujiki, zipping around so fast that a shadow of your ghost remains. It's easy to get caught up in the exhilarating energy of the game. Serious gamers will enjoy confronting bosses, who may take several frustrating tries to kill. But when you finally defeat them, you will feel the power of centuries of samurai.--Maile BohlmannPros:Fantastic graphicsExcellent scripting and voicingFairly easy controls and maneuvers at outsetExciting fighting sequences with intense gameplayCons:Killing early bosses can be unusually difficultLong sequences with no save pointsStoryline frames fighting sequences, rather than interacting with them","reviewerName":"Josh Perkins \"antisugarcoated\"","summary":"The hardest freakin' game ever created","reviewText":"I've never played the original Shinobi games, but I heard they were cool.  Then I bought a magazine that came with a demo disc featuring the highly anticipated rebirth of the Shinobi game.  After getting home, I put the disc in and began the demo level (I think it was the second level in the final version), anyway, the first thing I noticed was his scarf, which is like a big wisp of blood running from his face and following him everywhere.  Which was pretty cool, then I started fighting.Now the game isn't bad.  But it's certainly not stellar.  And one of it's downfalls is the fighting.  Not so much the button configuration or anything, but the delay of action after you do something.  For example, if you swing to slice somebody in half, and you know there is an enemy ready to strike from behind, after you attack the first guy, there is a bit of a pause and you get hit.  There is no avoiding this, even when you scoot across the screen like in all the magazine ads.  Somehow, enemies always seem to hit you if they want.  I just wish it were that easy for the player.While not incredibly long, the game certainly isn't short.  And the extras it provides are a real challenge to unlock.  Mainly the ones that require you to first beat the game.  Which, in itself, is one of the most difficult tasks no gamer should have to suffer.  My friend and I would stay up all night trying to beat some of the later levels, and still not win.  In the beginning though, it is fairly easy.  Until you get to the platforming levels that is.This game's camera acts like an alcoholic behind the wheel Jaguar.  If it's not directly on you, it's nowhere.  You might be on your 100th attempt at a frickin' hole you're supposed to jump from panel to panel to get across, and you'll be doing fine, until an ungrateful bastard of an enemy pops up and canstantly attacks you until you kill him.  But wait, he has friends, so you have to kill all of them too.  And of course they are flying, so you find yourself over a bottomless pit, cutting up enemies when all of a sudden you trigger this \"tate\" cutscene, which is supposed to make you look like a badass as all of your enemies fall to pieces at the same time in the background, but guess what, you can't see those aforementioned foes because the camera is directly on top of you.  So all you see is your character sliding his sword back in it's sheath, making some \"badass\" remark under his breath, and the blackness of the pit you find yourself hovering over.  So as soon as you regain control, you must frantically try to find somewhere to land, which you will find only happens ten percent of the time.  Which, in turn, will give you the urge to slice up your television and everything else in your room.  And that's just the first couple platforming levels, you haven't even begun to feel pain yet kids.The later levels are vast and sprawling, in the most linear terms possible.  They are quite large, and you'll actually see alot of them in great detail as you find yourself searching for enemies to kill before your soul-sucking sword kills you.  Enemies are few and far between, and the ones you do find, will either kick your ass, or find some friends to help kick your ass.  Sure, you could try and use some skill and dash all over the area, slicing and dicing, but you WILL get hit.  And as far as skill goes, there is none involved in this game.  The only way you can beat this monster of a title is to get pissed off, yell at it, then hope for some incredible luck.  Which, by the way, only works about half the time.On the graphics side, they're decent.  Nothing special, kind of bland (the environments especially).  The only thing that really sticks out is that cool looking scarf, which is more distracting that the monsters, but in a good way, I suppose.  Well, you can probably find the game for around 15 to 20 dollars, so it's not too bad a deal.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a challenge, but be careful, you might break it before you beat it.Oh yeah, that difficulty I was talking about, that didn't even skim the surface of the insanely hard bosses, which thankfully, don't come until atleast halfway through the game.  Well, that's all I have to say.  Buy it if you are massochistic, pass it if you like your sanity.Graphics-3 (the scarf gets a 4)Sound-3Control-3Overall-3.5","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2004"}

It makes a bit of noise but not nearly as much.Second, gotta love that black finish! I was always worried with my older systems about leaving smudges on the white control pad. No problem there now!Third, the 120GB hard drive that comes with it is pretty sweet. I was thinking about waiting until next week to get the 250GB drive, but I think 120 is more than enough, considering that I don't download tons of things onto there.Fourth, the HDMI port! I connected up a cable to my brand new HDTV and, oh, my goodness, does it look great!Last, the included games. Previously they bundled \"Lego Indiana Jones\" and \"Kung Fu Panda\". In this case you get \"Lego Batman\", which is a better game, and \"Pure\", which is much better than \"Kung Fu Panda\". I don't care for racing games, so I probably won't play it much, but at least I might play it more than once, which wasn't the case with KFP.Overall this is quite a good buy!

{"product_name":"B007FMSDU0","description":"","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Easily one of the best games this year","reviewText":"You wake up in a small room, with a young woman sitting in the corner.  You don't know where you are or how you got here.  The woman calls herself Phi and seems to know you.  But she either can't--or won't--tell you how.  Once you figure out how to exit the room, you meet seven other individuals, most of whom seem to have a connection to at least one other person in the room.  None of them know why they are there, where they are or what lies in store.  Before you can really gather your bearings, a rabbit puppet of sorts appears on a screen in the warehouse room you are standing in and, much like the Saw movies, the rabbit wants to play a game.  And, also much like Saw, it doesn't seem like the game is stacked in your favor.Welcome to the rabbit hole that is Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward, a visual novel of a game that combines the novel and puzzle/logic puzzles.  A sequel to 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors, it builds on the universe created in the original game and fans of that will run into some surprising revelations.  However, if you're like me, then this is your first introduction to the games and let me tell you, you're in for a doozy.  The game is split between copious amounts of reading that's voice acted (unlike 999) and puzzle solving, where you are in a room and you have to figure out a way to escape it, usually by solving logic problems and puzzle solving.  Once in a while, you have to participate in yet a different type of game called The Ambidex Room.  At this point you (and your partner, if you are paired that way) must decide whether to ally or betray a person in a different Ambidex Room.  It's the standard prisoner dilemma: if you both ally, you gain two points; if one side betrays and the other allies, the betrayer gets three points and the ally-er loses two points; if both sides betray, nothing happens.  The goal is to gain nine points.  If you hit 0 points, you get \"penalized,\" which isn't pleasant.So what do you do?  Trust that the person(s) in the next room are going to ally with you (the most logical choice since you both gain two points)?  Or do you fear that, regardless of what they say, they will choose betray?  The exit only opens once...do you really believe the other person has your interest at heart?It's this question that's at the heart of Virtue's Last Reward.  Surrounding that central theme is a myriad of questions involving science, human nature and other spoilerific questions that open up about as many questions.  To say that Virtue's Last Reward is surprisingly heady for a video game is an understatement.  Plot twists abound that make you question what's happening.  Each time you make a decision on whether to ally or betray and at other times in the story, you split off into a different story strand that will lead you to a different ending.  Ultimately there's 24 different endings; however, unlike most games you will probably see every single one.  A new feature in this game is the ability to swap between the different timelines at will and the way the game is structured, in order to solve the mysteries and understand everything that's happening, you will see every possible ending.  It's spectacular, especially the way this game mechanic ties into the story.As the game gets rolling, I found myself unable to quit playing.  I'm not usually a fan of portable game machines unless I'm out and about.  Chances are, if I'm home and playing games it'd be on my console or PC.  Zero Escape has changed this.  I have spent more time than I can count, perched on my couch or bed, playing this silly game.  It's a clich&eacute;, but I truly do lose track of time when I'm in this world.  It is so involving and the puzzles are so tied into the story that I don't realize I've been playing for an hour or two.  To get through the game, you will probably spend upwards of 30 hours.  And that's \"X\"ing through the dialogue and not listening to the voice actors talk the entire time.  A nice addition, given the fact that you will see story portions again in order to choose a different path, you can hit \"skip\" and it will fast=-forward through the scenes you've seen before and stop when new dialogue is introduced.  It's an awesome addition and makes replaying areas drag less.Ultimately, Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward is easily one of my favorite games this year.  It's intelligent, the translation is top-notch and the English voice acting is pretty decent (purists can select the original Japanese track--a nice surprise).  The story kept me enthralled and the logic puzzles--while sometimes forcing me to resort to walkthroughs--never feel obtrusive.  If you own a PS Vita or a 3DS, this is truly a must own game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0047THYWC","description":"","reviewerName":"Kristin","summary":"Decent, but a Let Down Compared to DA Origins","reviewText":"I truly loved Dragon Age Origins, I thought was a great game with terrific music, great story and fairly easy game play.  I would have rated that game a 9 of 10 easily.  Unfortunately, I can't give the same kudos to Dragon Age II, which I would rate a 7 of 10.  Still good, still worth playing, but definately a bit of a let down after my Origins experience.  So here's what goes into that rating:1. The controls are quite clunky.  It feels like this wasn't really meant for PC so clicking on enemies and even walking feels a bit awkward.  That having been said, a lot of the interfaces are the same as Origins so at least it feels a bit familiar if nothing else.2. This game is out 2 years after Origins, yet I don't see a significant evolution of the graphics, the kind you would have seen between GTA: San Andreas and GTA 4 for example.  The graphics were fairly similar to those of Origins.  Maybe slightly better, but not enough difference to really be able to tell.3. I didn't feel that the story was all that compelling.  It was actually a little convoluted and a little contrived.  There really wasn't a lot of depth in the character development or in the relationships.  In Origins, I really felt something for the various characters and was quite concerned about how the relationships played out.  In this one, it doesn't really seem to matter much to me.4. It feels a bit too linear and a bit too controlled.  I don't like the fact that you can't go \"off path\", even to the extent that you can take a shortcut off the side of the stairs for example.  Maybe I'm just too used to open world games like Fallout 3 and GTA 4.  Still, it would have been nice.5. I liked the dialogue options in Origins, you really got a sense of whether or not what you were going to say was going to piss someone off.  In DA II, you have no clue.  You get an icon that indicates if its a peaceful, aggressive or funny comment, but thats it and I find sometimes the funny comment isn't very funny and pisses people off while the aggressive comment gets their respect, but since you have little idea what you're actually going to say, there's no way to RP this one and know how your character should respond so you just kind of go with it blindly, which isn't very compelling at all.  It doesn't immerse you in the experience.6. I liked the fact that in Origins, you had lots of options about backstory, race, etc.  In DA II.  You're a human, deal with it.  No choice at all on that one.  Seems to really limit things.7. The music just doesn't compell me like in Origins.  Its there and its similar in many ways to Origins, but we just don't get those really great scores like when you have your love scene in Origins, etc.  I'm not hitting any great music.  Its just ho hum8. A game is meant to be played, not watched.  A few cut scenes are fine for moving the story along but I feel like I'm watching a movie here, not playing a game.  There's a lot of opportunities for game play where it seems they just lazily made a cut scene and called it a day.  The entire opening of this thing with the concept of working for a year to pay off a debt, etc, goes by not by doing various jobs and working your way out of servitude but rather with a 2 minute cutscene that sums everything up with a nice ribbon on it.  The cutscenes are out of hand on this one.  I'm pretty sure I've spent half my game time watching stupid cutscenes as opposed to exploring, fighting, etc.  Granted, Origins had a lot of cutscenes too, but it wasn't overdone.  There was plenty of great game play on that one.  This one isn't so balanced I feel.9. I keep running into quest items before I've actually accepted the quest, so I end up picking stuff up and then going back to whoever owned it and saying hey i found this and they give me money.  It seems a little silly that I can fulfill quests that were never given.  This could have been done much better.  Either you find the item but then you get to have the conversation with the person, which is especially good if you're doing a more open world concept (which this clearly is not), or you don't enable the quest item to show up until the quest is given.  Either way, I feel like a quest machine, just running around filling quests instead of exploring, fighting and getting to know my fellow characters on a deeper level.  Of course my character is so poorly developed, what do you expect?So that's the bad, generally the game is uninspired and not particularly compelling.  That having been said, there's some good too.  If you liked Origins, you'll still enjoy this game.  The fighting is kind of fun even if it does get repetative sometimes and there is good humor in it, some of which works nicely on an adult level.There's no question that its worthwhile to buy it if you can get a decent deal on it, but if you played Origins and loved it, be prepared for a less satisfying experience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2011"}

Slide in and out Kinect Sensor platform for easy mounting and storage. The Mounting Clip is officially licensed by Microsoft for the Xbox 360.","reviewerName":"Patrick H. Nguyen","summary":"Great way to install your Kinect on a TV","reviewText":"This is a great way to install your Kinect above your television.  It works across a very wide range of TV widths that other devices cannot handle.  It's very stable and is specifically designed to hook directly into the Kinect so that you don't worry about the Kinect detaching from the mount.Note that the rotating arm does not move freely.  It has a hard click at regular intervals like a ratchet.  It's very firm so you'll have to apply pressure.  At least this ensures that the arm won't get loose easily over time.Do not confuse the officially Microsoft-licensed PDP product with other imitation TV mounts floating around Amazon.  Trust me, they look similar in the Amazon pics but they are not.  You will not have latching problems with the official PDP version like with the fake products.  Sure, the PDP costs a lot more.  I paid $19.99 for mine.  But considering that you invested $100+ on a Kinect sensor and more on Kinect games, it's worth it to have a device that gives you peace of mind that it works as intended.The only negative is the mount should not cost so much but considering what else is out there and how much they cost, this mount is as good as it gets.The other question you may ask is, do I need a TV mount?  Yes, you'll want the Kinect placed high because the gaming performance will be better.Because what happens is the Kinect needs to see the floor and it needs to see the farthest part of you (seeing your fingertips when you raise your arms above your head). So when the kinect is placed high, it's looking downward so it's easier to see the floor and you. But if you put the Kinect below the TV (and the kinect's view is like a cone), to see both the floor and your whole body, you basically have to step further back. So you can probably trim a foot or so off your distance from the Kinect and get better scoring performance.In addition, the kinect mics are underneath the body of the Kinect so if you have the Kinect at eye level or higher, results with voice recognition tend to be better. When I set it low (like below the TV), I had to bark more often. But more often than not, I speak at a normal voice level and can even approach soft, near-whisper level with the Kinect above my TV (Kinect is about 6.5' above the floor in the family room, 5 feet high in the master bedroom).Lastly, this TV mount allows you to easily move the Kinect from one TV to another.  Very handy if you have to bring Kinect to a party or move from a bedroom to a family-type room.  Just adjust the arm and you're good to go.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00004TC6E","reviewerName":"Feelah the tigress","summary":"I had alot of fun with this game...","reviewText":"Like my title says, I had alot of fun playing this game.  If you really enjoyed Chrono Trigger and are expecting a sequel, you may be dissapointed with Chrono Cross.  I have a really hard time envisioning this as a sequel-it just seems so far removed from the original Chrono Trigger (the original cast of Chrono Trigger's appearance is rather cameo).  However, if you don't think of this game as a sequel, then you may enjoy it just as much as I did.  Well, here's a more in-depth look at this game:Graphics (9/10): Obviously, this is a Playstation 1 game, it's going to have PS1 graphics.  I thought the graphics were very nice looking.  There really wasn't anywhere in the game that made me exclaim \"those lazy graphical designers! How dare they!\".  Although not as good as other PS1 games in terms of graphics (especially later games, for obvious reasons), most everything was pleasing to the eye and I have no complaints.Music (9/10): Music was pretty good.  Songs fit the emotional content of scenes pretty well, and many are pleasant enough to listen to outside of the game (\"Time's Scar\" comes to mind).  The music may not be that memorable, but it's still pretty nice to listen to.Characters (7/10): They really go for quantity over quality here.  There are at least 30 characters available.  Obviously, this high character volume means that no one particularly gets well-developed (except Serge of course).  Normally this would bother me, but the characters were all so unique and colorful in appearance and attitude that I didn't mind as much.  I sort of fell into the collector's mindset, in that I had alot of fun just trying to get people to join the party.  Gotta catch 'em all!Story (7/10):  The story is very enjoyable until the last 1/8 of the game.  Then it just sort of degenerates into an incomprehensible convoluted mess.  I felt like the last part of the plot had been sucked into some kind of demensional void and distorted beyond reason.  However, as I said earlier, the story is very enjoyable and understandable before that point; definitely enough to make the game worthy of playing.Battle System (8/10): Nothing really wrong with the battle system.  It is basically turn-based.  Each character has a certain number of slots (which increase as you get stronger) that magic (called Elements) is assigned to.  The system is fairly easy to get used to.  My only complaint here is that switching elements from one character to another can be rather tedious.Gameplay (9/10): This is my catch-all category.  Some people (like me) will enjoy the ability to travel between dimensions to the two worlds (although it can be confusing at times). Others will find this constant back-and-forth travel to be rather annoying.  I have no complaints with other gameplay elements like the controls or menus.  Overall, everything's pretty good.Overall (8/10): NOTE this score is not an average, it's my subjective overall score. Despite the lack of any real character depth, and the somewhat convoluted story towards the end, I really enjoyed this game.  Considering it's current price (it's rather cheap, at least for now), I recommend picking it up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00004TC6E","reviewerName":"Nona","summary":"A Good game, but not as good as its predecessor","reviewText":"It seems like many people loved Chrono Cross.  I must be in the minority when I say that this game isn't nearly as good as Chrono Trigger.  In any case, CC was still a well-made game, but it doesn't have the staying power than CT had, and still has.CC is, simply put, a beautiful game.  The graphical and artistic craftsmanship is incredible, and the music is some of Square's best.  The diversity of places you visit is incredible.  However, the story was somewhat lacking, and the gameplay, while novel, ultimately is worse than that used in CT.  And, perhaps the most obvious flaw as a successor to CT was the character design.The story was incredible halfway through the game - I really wanted to know how everything would end up.  But what happened at the end was terrible, because everything before it was so good.  In addition, the characters from CT weren't really tied into the story - only Lucca had a significant role, and even her role was not used as well as it could have been.  And, if you played CT, you know that Magus goes looking for his sister - well, they don't talk about that at all in the game!  That was by far the most disappointing part of CC.The character design also suffered greatly.  Some people felt that 40 characters was a great idea, but I felt it was superficial.  True, they all have unique graphical designs, and each one has his or her own miniquest, but almost all of them give nothing to the story or the world of CC.  The story centers around Serge and Kid, which is a good thing, so it may have been wise to eliminate maybe 30 of the 40 characters as playable people.  It would have been better to focus on a few characters, like in CT, where every character was fully developed and relevant to the story.The gameplay was also new.  There are no random battles in this game, although at points you don't really have a choice to fight - instead of being random, the battles are forced upon you.  In any case, there are no levels, and instead you get slightly stronger with each fight.  But this system basically degenerates into you getting a lot stronger after beating a boss, and then staying at the same strength after fighting normal people.  Many people thought that the three levels of attack (weak, medium, strong) and the power bar were novel developments, but they're not - look at Xenogears (the same team designed Xenogears and CC).  The battle system was pulled off better in Xenogears than CC, in my opinion.So most of my review has been a slam of this game.  I don't want to leave you with the impression that this was a bad game - by all means, it was good.  I recommend that you buy it, especially if you like RPGs.  But don't necessarily expect this game to have the instant feeling of a classic, much like its predecessor, Chrono Trigger.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2001"}

Just the response time alone. It works for what it is. But, it really could have been done a lot better.Environment: 10. I really loved the world of Albion, where ever you went, it never looked the same. The caves were very well done. (Looked great) Everything as far as the \"World\" had it's unique place. (Of course this is just my opinion)Over all, I liked the game, and it was well worth the money. I expected more, but was still satisfied OVER ALL with what I got.I know one person commented on here, that he had problems with money. The trick is, work your tail off, buy rental property. Then you have money constantly coming in, then buy more rental property, and it is a ball of compound interest in your favor.I have a $1,376,290.00 gold pieces in the game now.. so that is the trick. Oh.. and raising rent to max also helps. XD","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2008"}

When you start the game, you choose either to play the role of a boy or girl, and depending on your choices, the hero will grow up to be tall or short, good or evil. Players can get married and have children; female player characters will become pregnant, which will then be reflected by their physical appearance.Early in the game, players are presented with a stray dog for a best friend, who will need to be fed and loved, and will accompany the player throughout his or her life. Depending on the player, the dog will change appearance and assist him or her in various ways, such as alerting of impending dangers and attacking enemies.Players inhabit the world of Albion and are free to roam the land to as they please. Players can use different expressions to communicate with others, such as taunting and laughing, and even belching or farting.As the players grow, so does Albion, reflecting the choices that were made earlier in the game.

Paslay","summary":"Amazing game if you put in the time.","reviewText":"I see a lot of mixed reviews for this game. The problem is that this is a new era of games. Open environments, optional paths, side quests are becoming the norm in gaming. What this means is, you can finish a game in 10 hours if you want, or you can opt to explore all of the \"optional\" content and put in as many hours as you can spare. Fallout 3 is very similar to Fable 2 in this regard. If all you're trying to do is beat the game and move onto the next big title then you're probably not getting a lot out of the game. You can beat Fable 2 in about 10 hours if you just follow the main quest and do just enough to get passed you enemies. Or you can do the side quests, build your characters abilities, seek out treasures and secrets, gargoyles, silver keys, demon doors, buy out towns, max out side jobs, play the evil hero or the good hero. There's seriously SO much to do in this game and the best part is, it doesn't seem like a chore. Well, Blacksmithing does... but most of it doesn't seem like a chore.You start off with VERY limited abilities. You can swing a weapon, cast one low level spell, and auto shoot your gun. This is where most people seem to get hung up and give up because they think the whole game is going to be like that. The problem is I don't think a lot of people understand that this isn't just an action game, it's an action RPG. You start off as a young man/woman who has barely ever been in a fist fight. You're not going to be an expert swordsperson, sharpshooter, or archmage from the begining. The more you fight the more you gain experience, allowing you to build your abilities. Like the original Fable, you can achieve all the abilites from all the categories.-Your spell library can be expanded and improved by putting experience points into it. Spells are aoe by default but pushing your analog stick towards a target will focus the damage. Spells range from fire balls to slowing time to raising the dead and many more. Each spell has 5 tiers of potency. The higher the tier you wish to cast, the longer it takes to charge. However, the more tiers you unlock the faster your spells charge. Charging your spell leaves you open to receiving damage from enemies and possibly being interrupted. It's good to get an idea of the range of your spells and whether the damage you can cause with them will outweigh the damage you will take while charging them.-Building your skill points increases your weapons speed, allows you to aim your gun (via crosshairs in nearly first person view), zoom in on your target and eventually target specific areas of your target's body. You can take off your targets head, disarm them or take out their leg as they're charging towards you. You'll find that once you start building these abilities up you can take out the majority of the bandit camps before they even know you're there.-Strength points increase your hitpoints, weapon damage and melee skills. You'll be able to block attacks, string together combos, counterattack and perform devestating unblockable attacks by the time you're done with this tree. This is vital because as the game progresses you're forced to face multiple enemies at a time who will block and flank and fight much more intelligently than at the beginning.Money comes by either stealing or taking jobs. Jobs are basically mini games designed to make cash and keep your morality in tact. Basic jobs are Woodcutter, Bartender and Blacksmith. You start at 1 star and receive promotions after you've made a set amount of money all the way until you reach 5 stars. Every time you receive a promotion you get more base pay and your pay increases exponentially as you chain together strikes of the hammer, swings of the axe without missing and pouring beer without spilling. It's an easy way to make gold fast and take a break from the main quest.There are tons of side quests all with fairly interesting stories some pertaining to events and characters from the original Fable. These are a large part of the meat in the game and are well worth completing. I'd give you examples but I don't want to spoil them.The Demon Doors are back from the original game as are the silver keys. New additions are Gargoyles that insult you until you find and shoot them. Every ten gargoyles you shoot unlock another section of the Gargoyle trove with a chest as a reward and all 50 unlock the final treasure. The other addition are statues whose expressions you have to mimic flawlessly and reward you upon completion. You only get one chance so if you mess up, too bad.Other things to do in the game are buying real estate. Pretty much every building in Albion is up for sale at some point in the game. Buying a house allows you to move in or rent it out. You can upgrade the furniture piece by piece to increase the value and your spouses happiness with the house if you choose to make it your marital home. If you buy shops you collect rent and if you're a good landlord you'll receive discounts. This is a great way to make money. Unlike the original, the money goes straight to you periodically. No going to every home you own to collect your cash. You'll receive a lump sum every time you load your game based on the amount of time you were away too. You can marry in this game, much like the first, the new addition is that you get to have kids should you choose to have uprotected sex with the opposite gender. These children will grow up (to around the age of 10) and will have opinions of you just like your wife. If you, or a friend, happen to kill your spouse your child will be taken away to the orphanage.I'm sure there's more to talk about, but at this point you've probably made up your mind. If you're going to put the time into really exploring all this game has to offer, then it's more than worth it. If you just plan on barreling through the main quest and throwing it back on the shelf then save your money. There were times when certain aspects were frustrating to me. For instance I would think, \"Why can't I do this?\" or \"Why didn't they do that?\" 99% of the time a couple hours of play later I would either have my answer, or have the ability to do whatever it was I couldn't do before either through obtaining new skills or progressing the story. Give it a chance, take your time and enjoy the ride, have a little patience and you will be GREATLY rewarded!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000R0SRNU","description":"LucasArts LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga 33076 PC Games","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Great Game, But Hard to Recommend","reviewText":"The original Lego Star Wars was an unprecedented success.  Who'd have thought that a game where the you played through the prequel episodes entirely made of Legos would've been such a huge success?  Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy soon followed and was overall a better game because they were based off better movies (and some of the gameplay had been refined to be better).  The Complete Saga now sees both games put together in one package.  You can now play through all six episodes without any interruption.  There are new levels to explore, the refined gameplay of the second game is used all throughout and that also means there are more characters.You'll play through the saga's best lived moments, and there's a multiplayer aspect thrown in for good measure.  You and a friend will conquer all six episodes by solving puzzles and using the force.  The game is filled to brim with a great sense of humor and you'll be drowned in nostalgia as you play through episodes IV, V and VI.  There's nothing to difficult about the gameplay either.  You'll take down the bad guys and solve puzzles to open doors.  You'll build things to help you out and pilot vehicles like the Pod Racer from Episode I and the X-Wing.  You'll also collect studs to by many of the games unlockables including characters and vehicles.  Then, of course, there's the customization that'll let you make a custom character.  And with well over 100 characters, there are literally thousands of possibilities.The only real big problem with Lego Star Wars is simply that the game is way too easy.  There's no such thing as a game over.  Should you die, the only bad thing that happens to you is you lose some studs.  At least the game is so much fun that you really don't care.  Also, while cooperating with a friend, you can both battle each other and to the victor go the spoils.  Its great fun even if you can't die permanently.This is great for someone who has never played the Lego Star Wars games before, but what about if you have?  There's really not a whole lot of new content here for those who played the first two games to begin with.  Some levels have been altered, but for the most part, it's all the same stuff.  True there are a bunch of new levels, but if you've already got the first two games... the list price just isn't worth it to play what will virtually be the same two games all over again.  Even if there are some extras, it's just too much of the same thing.This then, brings about the question as to whether or not it would just be better to find used copies of the first two games.  That really depends.  The XBOX360 version has better graphics.  It's smoother and runs better.  If you buy the original games separate and used, you'll have to downgrade to the PS2, Gamecube or XBOX to have both (since the first game didn't come to 360 at all).  The simple solution is this: If you have one, but not the other, it's easier (and cheaper) just to go pick up the game you don't have.  If you have neither of them then by all means pick up The Complete Saga.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2007"}

Executing the special moves were a bit of a challenge for me at first , but I relied on that instruction book 100% of the time and I learned to master the ha-do-kens, dragon punches, sonic booms, whirl wind kicks, and yoga fires in no time.  I've acutally first played Street Fighter II in the arcades, but I had no idea on what I was doing and didn't have too many quarters to be waisting on figuring out the moves.  This was one of the first fighting games ported on a 16 bit (or any) console and the graphics were true to the arcades.  My favorites characters to use were of course Ryu and Ken and both have amazing endings, however you must finish the game on normal or hard in order to achieve an individual ending for each of the eight characters.  The harder the difficulty level, the better the game.  Chung Li, Blanka, and Guile were great choices too (as fast, agile, powerful, and easy to use as Ryu and Ken).  Since there are unlimited continues on Street Fighter II, you have the option to practice on defeating your challengers from around the world, plus take on the bosses Saget, Vega, Balrog, and M. Bison (the main villian/antagonist of the game who happened to murder Chung Li's dad and Guile's best friend, Charlie).  I would only recommend purchasing this game for true old school gamers.  Street Fighter II Turbo and Super Street Fighter II are definitley worth your money and more superior.  The Champion Edition on Sega Genesis has a better soundtrack, but I gave it a bad review due to a missing pause button and limited contol buttons.  Because of that, I consider the Super NES version the better out of the Original Street Fighter II console releases.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2013"}

Advance Wars is a turn based, not real time, strategy war game. Kinda of feels similar to a war campaign version of Vandal Hearts. Definitely fun. There are alot of units that you'll get to use such as copters and planes to subs and cruisers. Each one has their own distinct strengths and weaknesses. You really have to pay attention to this as it does definitely play a part in your strategy as you don't want to end up with a unit next to an enemy air unit but it has no anti air capabilities. Terrain and some weather also play a part in the capabilities of your units in battle. I also found the use of bases and mobile refueling units to stock up on fuel and ammo an interesting addition as you have to pay attention to that factor as well. Or else, you're going to have a useless piece of metal with no ammo or a plane with no fuel that will actually crash. Yeah, this definitely is no kid's game as the Amazon review says.

Better gameplay than the first, but there are so many songs that I pray I get a five star the first time because I don't want to hear that song again. War Pigs? Whoever decided to put that song in the game should have their college degree revoked. The last game already had two Ozzie tracks and this one has no guitar through half the song. And while I love Kansas, half of Carry on My Wayward Son is non-guitar as well.

{"product_name":"B00000I1BR","description":"Let me go on record and say that I was never a fan of the original Crash Bandicoot. Even though Crash was disarmingly cute and fuzzy, and even though the game's graphics were just about as good as they got in those days, the frustrating design of the game made playing it such a painful experience that I still have flashbacks when I see small marsupials on the Discovery Channel. But just one short year after his debut, Crash is back in a sequel that is so far superior to the original that I'm willing to forget the mistakes of the past.The new storyline is simple: A very gullible Crash is corralled into collecting crystals for the evil Dr. Cortex and gems for the terrible N. Brio. There are 25 levels in all; each level contains an easy-to-find crystal and hard-to-earn gems. Instead of being forced to approach the game in a strictly linear fashion, you progress through a series of five warp rooms. Each warp room contains five levels, which you are free to tackle in any order. After you have found the crystals in each level, you can progress to the next warp room. This system of warp rooms is a great innovation; it's clear how to progress in the game, and yet you have the option of moving to a different level if you're hopelessly frustrated with one area. Best of all, you can save your game in the warp room at any time (a big improvement over the original game's horrific save system).A lot of variety is packed inside this game. You'll navigate through simple run-and-jump areas, try to outrun a very mad polar bear, work your way through sewer systems, and even fly around with a jet pack. Within each level, the basic gameplay is similar to the original Crash: Running, jumping, and spinning are still the order of the day. Even though most levels are set in a semi-3D environment, Crash Bandicoot 2 is a platform game, plain and simple. The graphics are in a league of their own among PlayStation games, and the music couldn't be better. Unlike the original, Crash 2 is rarely frustrating enough to make you want to throw your controller at the TV. In fact, some expert gamers might find Crash to be a little on the easy side.There are only two real problems with Crash Bandicoot 2. First, the semi-3D setup is sometimes hard to navigate, and you'll find yourself missing jumps because you're unable to judge distances properly. Secondly, the game is just plain cheap at times; in some areas you must sacrifice many lives until you memorize a level's layout.In any event, these problems are balanced out by the game's excellent gameplay and intelligent design. Crash Bandicoot 2 is a topnotch platform game. If you're a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to check this title out. -- John Broady--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

The game's storyline is intriguing and there are a great amount of side-missions and challenges to accomplish as well.  While the game's missions themselves are pretty varied, the environments aren't, as most of the island's environments starts to look alike after a while.  Still, that's really the only drawback to Prototype, other than not having any multiplayer options, which would have made the game all the sweeter.  All in all though, Prototype is a great game that makes good on having an open-world environment at its disposal, and the game is wholeheartedly worth your time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2009"}

Everything about this game is gold.  Visuals, Music, voice acting, and superb gameplay.  Hideo Kujima is a Genious.  I had my doublts on this after the ever so great yet dissapointing Metal Gear Solid 2 but I was wrong.  Metal Gear Solid 3 proves to be one of the best games around and is one of the biggest titles of the year.  Forget Grand Theft Auto and play this game!  Metal Gear Solid 3 is not only one of the best games ever created but it's quiet simply the best MGS game.  It has everthing you'll love from the first one and times ten mixed with steriods!Another thing that makes the new gameplay of Metal Gear Solid 3 is the CQC and the new survival Menue which lets you eat, cure self and so on which is a great element to the MGS series.  What also makes Metal Gear the best in the series is that the game is suprisingly long taking about 20 to 22 hours(It took me 18 hours)and trust me evertime you're in a new area you'll just stop and stare at the lushis graphics of the beautiful Jungle and its invorments.  Metal Gear Solid 3 is also superb cause of the amazing boss battles.  One of the biggest parts of the game is the Sorrow who is the coolest boss in the game(and the most mysterious).  Overall Metal Gear Solid 3 proves to up the anti.  So let's get to it.Graphics:The visuals are amazingly detailed especially in First Person mode.  The tree's are very detailed some of the visuals on the water a greatly well done and even though you'll find som slow glitches it won't stop you from enjoying this superb game.  The characters are very well modeld especially EVA(huba huba) and this truly deserves a star.Sound:The Sound is great!  The voice acting is once again amazingly done by David Hayter and the rest of the MGS casts.  The sound of the Jungle is great.  The sound is pretty much like all the other MGS games....DETAILED!  The Detailed sound of this Game once again deserves a star rating..Gameplay:Well...Were do I start off.  Well first off it's awesome!  The new CQC(Close Quarters Combat)is a great new gameplay added in the Metal Gear series.  Though it's great it is a bit complicated because there are numerouse CQC's to do.  You can slice there throat, interigate them, or choke them to death but there is abunch that I can't name.  The new Survival Menue is greatly well done..  If you have a cut or you aight something rotten you can always go to the Survival menue and choose one of a few things you can do to solve the problem, for instance this one is for CURE which you use to cure cuts, broken bones ect.  The backpack is great cause it holds alot of Items you can't carry while in the game.  The codec is also new though I must say I miss the old Codec in MGS and MGS2 but oh well.  There are some new weapons added to the MGS series like THE SHOTGUN!  You can also change your Uniform to blend in with the ivorments and it's much easier and you'll have a better chance losing the guards.  Overall the Biggest aspect of Metal Gear Solid 3 is the gameplay and deffinetly earns a star rating.The Music is so amazing in this game that the \"James Bond\" like theme is better then the James Bond theme itself!  I loved the music in this game.  Some people are complaining that the game is too unrealistic cause the animals you kill turn into rations..well I'm not trying to sound harsh but the game isn' trying to be extreamly realistic.  Is San Andreas very realistic?...I thougth so...Overall Metal Gear Solid 3 proves to be a game that can handle and do everything.  The graphics are superb and pushes the Ps2 to the limit, the sound is greatly detailed, the lush invorments of the Jungle make you wanna' drool, the cutting edge Boss Battle is enough to get the action ready, Lengh is suprisingly long and the New Gameplay elements like CQC and the Survival menue shows that Metal Gear Solid is strong enough to be the Best PS2 game ever...and possibly is!..This amazing game obviously gets a5 out of 5 stars!Best Ps2 game ever....Lates","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2004"}

It is very linear except the side missions, but honestly there are too many open world games and it was a nice change.My only real complaint is the story. It starts out great, but then as it progresses the characters literally just say \"OMG its frustrating having magic powers and having to fight stuff.\" over and over and over. Its like someone wrote half a script with a bunch of [Insert dramatic scene showing their frustration] written in it to come back to later then ran out of time and decided they should just say they are frustrated in each one rather than show it. And the ending is really bad.. events just get very random and for the most part unsatisfying.Side quests are also really lame, which is odd considering it is the only open world part. They basically only exist to make you explore. Its all just to go fight some monster, usually its easier and more simplistic than what you fought getting to it as well. They also have really epic fights earlier on in the main story and then those all disappear and the trash becomes harder than bosses. Its hard to take a Fal'Cie as a serious villain when a giant bird is tougher than it.All in all it is a great game, and definitely worth the price now that its an older game. It wouldn't have been worth it when new though.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2011"}

Soul Calibur, Tekken, Virtua Fighter, Dead or Alive, Guilty Gear. I've played them all, and I love them all. But Street Fighter has always been my favorite, ever since Street Fighter II in the arcade. I loved the change-up for the Alpha series, and again with Street Fighter III. When Street Fighter IV came out, I held off because I knew Capcom would (like they always do), make a &#34;Super&#34; version. But when the Super version came out, I heard that they were making the ultimate version with &#34;Arcade Edition&#34;, so I held off a little longer. But now I have it, finally and it was worth the wait.Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition is amazing. Easily one of the top 10 games of this generation, and the #1 fighting game. The graphics are slick, the roster is bursting with tons of characters, and the soundtrack is catchy. But most importantly, the gameplay is perfect. I was worried that playing with an Xbox 360 controller would have some response issues, that I might have difficulty pulling off special moves or something like that. I was wrong. I have not played with the arcade stick for comparison, but I will say this: in the 20+ hours I've spent with the game so far, I've never felt like the game did something I didn't tell it to. The analogue stick responds perfectly to my commands so I can pull off special moves like a pro, and I am very happy. Online play is also smooth (provided you have a good internet connection), and I haven't had any issues playing against people online (other than getting my butt handed to me). The best part of this version is that all the characters are unlocked from the start, so you and your friends can start pummeling each other with your character of choice without the hassle of playing through the story mode (although I do enjoy playing story mode when I'm alone).Overall, I can't think of anything negative to say about this game, and if you've been considering buying it, just go ahead and do it already. You won't regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2012"}

With New Super Mario Bros DS, you get the game fun gameplay - enhanced - in a nice portable system.This isn't just a remake - it is sort of like how the Wizard of Oz starts out in black and white in a gritty, quiet town and then turns into multi-color, sparkling larger than life song-filled splendour. You get the NES versions of the game with similar - but not exactly the same - levels that have been updated from 2D to 3D. You get extra features like ground pounds, and mushrooms that make you SUPER large - you don't have to jump to break blocks any more, you can just walk and crash into them. Other mushrooms make you incredibly tiny, to reach places you could not before.The combination of old style classic gameplay and updated graphic, sounds, and features is really quite good. These games were stellar in the first place, with their addictive levels that were just the right balance of challenging and fun. Add in the easy to carry with you DS gameplay, the new features and hidden things to look for, and I really found this just about perfect for an arcade game.Yes, you could complain that you can zap through the game in a full day of gameplaying. However, this game series wasn't ever meant to be a \"month long role playing complex adventure\". It was always meant to be short, easily playable sessions that you could fit in while you waited for dinner to be ready. You could save and exit when you had to run to school, and then pick up again when you had time the next day without having to review 8 pages of storyline notes.This makes the game PERFECT for carrying around in your DS. If you end up waiting in line for 20 minutes, you get through another section. If your bus gets stuck in traffic, that's another level you can get through.Plus, there is replayability here, while you try to track down the hidden items and coins.I enjoyed the minigames as well. Certainly you wouldn't buy this game FOR the minigames, but heck, if they're going to throw them in for free, you might as well enjoy them! I'm not usually one for DS multiplayer games, but it's nice that they did include that as well for those who want to play with a friend.In general I was quite impressed with this, and recommend it heartily!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00005NZ1G","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play.

Now they got books and Halo 2 is getting more hype then San Andreas ever did. So why do people like this game so much? Because you shoot aliens.This game is so basic, I could of invented it. It is the best shooter on X-Box, but it is nowhere near what GoldenEye was on the N64. Sure, everybody loves Halo because it was the best game on X-Box and some kids still think it is. GoldenEye started shooters, and no game will ever be better. I am not just saying this because you shoot aliens, but a simple alien storyline gets pretty boring after a while. Halo was fun, but now it is out of control. I am not like that other guy, but I would rather shoot real people then shoot aliens. The plotline in GoldenEye was so much better, and the guns were better.The storyline is that you are a magical thing that is a captain of a spaceship and you are sent down to kill aliens. Now, the game is impossible and your health meter refills automatically. This is good but it was invented because they made it hard. The guns are sub-par, and not as good as GoldenEye, which had real guns instead of little play guns that shoot green crap out of them. The game has it's up's because you can drive and has a great multi-player, but it is not as good as driving a tank in GoldenEye, running over somebody. GoldenEye has a better storyline and better levels, sad that GoldenEye came out in the late 90's and Halo came out for X-Box.But, it is fun, thats why it has 5 stars. But the game is not as good as GoldenEye because GoldenEye had better guns, a realistic plot, bad N64 graphixs and it started the shooter genre. So Halo fans, hate me and give me 100 negative votes, but you all know which game is better, and it's not this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2004"}

It seems like it was rushed when the last one took years to make. You go to some of the same enviroments that you did in the last one and you even fly the same ship. Plus instead of looking for Starmaps you have to look for lost jedis instead.I like how there's more villains in this one though when the first one just had Darth Malik. This one has 2 plus a surprise villain you might not expect. I also like how in one part you have to solve a murder. I liked that about the first game as well. That can be as fun as the lightsaber duels.  I want a part 3 but they need to take more time in making it.

The sequel is a rehash of the first at best, and at worst the creator either hadn't the energy to do something creative, and just threw together a standard knock-off. Note such sequels as Alundra 2, Suikoden (what is it now, four or five?), Wild Arms, etc.  Sure the original was great at one time, but unless you find one that broke the mold, or the story is so interesting and developed that it continues through several games (from what I read of Kingdom Hearts in plot spoilers it's not quite that developed), it's not really worth it.The only instances where a sequel outperformed an original is where it managed to be more creative than the first: such as Legend of Mana using nonlinear plot sequences and a learning system of battle (before, the SD3 sort of went in this direction, with its choice of party altering the story), or the Final Fantasy series which despite the reputation for being streamlined, each Final Fantasy is an experiment with a new battle system.No, I haven't bought KH2, but after hearing the other reviews, I can safely say that if I were to buy a Kingdom Hearts it would be Kingdom Hearts 1.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000088KH9","description":"Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis the third in the successful mission-based stealth series that first appeared on the PlayStation in 1998; few changes have been made to the basic format. Players can once again choose to be either Rikimaru, the silent sword-wielding assassin, or Ayama, the acrobatic younger ninja. Both characters pass through the same game world, but each has slightly different goals that take them on different routes. A third character can be unlocked later on.During the first mission, you're required to choose a number of weapons to aid you in your immediate tasks. Throughout the game, more and more weapons--from melee to ranged weapons--are added to your arsenal depending on your performance during each level; your chosen weapons dictate how you approach the mission goals. The silent approach is always encouraged, and there's a variety of graphically satisfying stealth kills that will only work if you remain elusive and strike unexpectedly and silently.Aside from the stealth kills, the game is a mixed bag in terms of its graphics. Light shimmers off your sword menacingly, but the environments are bland and repetitive, and the game fails to maximize on differences between light and dark areas in ways that might have added to the experience. Also, the stealth dynamic is made less challenging by the shortsightedness and slow reactions of the enemy guards and the iffy AI. Since guards give up searching for you within seconds and are unable to follow you through doors, this potentially atmospheric and tactical stealth game is actually just a hack-and-slash arcade romp. Multiplayer options are included, though, so if you feel the need for a more realistic opponent, you may want to call a friend.Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis still an enjoyable experience despite its flaws. It&#x92;s just a shame that, after doing so much to establish and define the stealth-game genre, it fails to raise the bar or introduce any novel elements. The game feels more like an update of the first Tenchu, and while this is no bad thing, fans will probably be expecting more.--Chris Ryan, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Sal Paradise \"ethanallen95\"","summary":"Another Reason to Buy the PS2!","reviewText":"Tenchu 3 is perhaps the best of the Tenchu series in that it takes full advantage of the PS2 hardware capabilities. There's an interesting plot or multiple plots depending on which of the 3 characters you pick. I personally liked picking Tessu the doctor/assasin. Out of the three characters, he seems the most likely person I would identify with, heck I even look like him with that cold a thousand yard stare of his. Ayame is a lot easier to control but unfortunately she's still on the weak side. Rikimaru is more of a well rounded character of the three. The missions are of moderate to high difficulty depending mostly on which character you pick. I found Ayame's missions more difficult. This is a game for which the PS2 was made! There are plenty cheat codes available but try to beat it without cheating. It's a much more fulfilling experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2003"}

Also if you get hit it has a few second stun period, if you continuously click the fire button during this you may end up wasting ammo.Overall 3 starsDefinitely not a horror game, and barely manages to earn the title of \"thriller.\"I bought this game because it was getting really good reviews. While the visuals are amazing and the story is better than most video games nowadays, the game gets dull fast. I am an achievement whore, I won't deny it, and this game was killed by the amount of pointless collectibles. The game itself should only take you 5-10 hours if you are just going through it, but in order to get all the collectibles without a walk-through it will take you 15-20 hours. Not because there is so much to explore, but because the game sidetracks you longer distances in opposite directions to get them then the game takes to play straight through. Another annoyance is that the lips are rarely synced in cut scenes, it really detracts from the realism of the animation.Don't get me wrong, this is a good game.

And you could play Assassin's Creed, or you could play Sly Cooper. Basically the ideas are the same, just one is drenched in blood and the other's drenched in cartoon fun. The choice is up to you. When Sucker Punch created Sly Cooper and the Thievious Racoonus, as when Naughty Dog created Jak and Daxter, it was a great platformer, but then, like Jak II, Sly Cooper and the Band of Thieves became something more. You can argue about which game came first or which did it better, but one thing I know for sure: there are no other games like these that combine stealth action, sandbox overworlds, and fun cartoon gameplay that won't offend the parentals (although if you want a cleaner cartoon crazy action shooter without the violence of one of those \"adult action titles\" you can go with Ratchet and Clank 3).The plot this time around is quite similar to the first: retrieve the pieces and take on the bosses who have them one at a time. Only instead of somewhat frustrating platformer gameplay we have the aforementioned sandbox gameplay, and like Jak and Daxter, way more mini-games the second time around. For the stealth action you have Sly, for some techno-demolition work you have Bentley, and for smashing things to smithereens you have Murray. The switch-ups and mini-games go a long way to increase the variety of the gameplay, and after the extremes of Sly's two companions make you exercise crazy caution and bust loose when played through any of the overworlds (each one a fortress swarming with guards).The cartoon graphics are pretty much perfect, with no draw-in or other noticeable glitches. The cut-scenes are largely in-game engine (and you might wonder why there are any pre-recorded ones at all). The music is typical caper-film type stuff and perfectly appropriate. The controls are about as good as you can get with the Dual Shock controller.If this game has a flaw, it's probably the at-times ridiculous difficulty. If it has a shining star, it's the way that you can often get around that extremely high difficulty by learning all the shortcuts. You will find as you play that very often the key to solving a puzzle is to scope ahead and \"case the joint\" rather than running straight into a situation (unless you're playing as \"The Murray\"). And of course the environments at times make those \"leap from a great height to your seeming death\" moments possible. It may be a cartoon, but it's still fun.My favorite moments include Bentley's quest to save his captured friends (the cinematic made me laugh out loud), and the leap from the top of the second world with Rajaan (Assassin's What?). That and chasing Neela and running from and dancing with Carmelita (why does she remind me of Catherine Zeta Jones?).If you liked the first game you need to give this one a try. If you love cartoon-type games like the Jak series and don't mind some forgiving stealth action (and a generous dose of humor), you need to buy this one pronto.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2008"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

This is a series that features literally dozens of characters with rich backgrounds and deep mythology. But so far all we've had are two trashy movies back in the mid-90s. With so many sequels and spin-offs the video games series has now been rebooted with this current-gen monstrosity.The difficulty of Mortal Kombat is ridiculous. The game simply doesn't give you a chance. The rivals seem to move at twice the speed as you do, leaving you unable to do anything apart from getting pulverized. There's simply no way you have time to punch in the codes for combo moves or specials. And since every character has different codes you'd have to be an idiot savant to memorize all these. The only way I managed to finish the story mode was through trickery and chance. The collision detection is also very inconsistent, which almost caused me to turn green with rage and rip through my clothing on a few occasions. It's a very bloody game too, with brutal fatalities and 'X-ray' moves where we get to see cool shots of bones breaking and guts shredding...oh wait...I'm not an angry 15-year-old boy. Actually, these moments are kinda distasteful and desensitizing. The game certainly earns its adult rating.There are 51 trophies featured in the game but I only managed to unlock 32% of them as the Platinum literally requires THOUSANDS of hours of gameplay.

Raillard","summary":"Comes just short of perfect","reviewText":"I loved this game, it is easily the best FPS since Half Life 2.  Is it better than HL2?  No.  I don't understand how people can say that it is, seeing as it does have a host of flaws, but it does come closer than any other shooter in recent memory.Graphics: Terrific IF you have the hardware.  While it's true that the maxed out graphics of FEAR are potentially better than HL2, the hardware and processing power required means that only people running twin Geforce7800 in SLI mode will be able to get them.  The lighting is gorgeous, and the textures and effects are second to none.  I can't fault FEAR for pushing the envelope, but I have to praise Half Life for giving us graphics that are just as good (for the majority of PC owners) with lower hardware requirements, a year earlier.  Oddly enough, the facial graphics aren't as good as either Doom 3 or HL2.Sound: Awesome.  The sound is really, really well done and is easily the best I've heard in a while.  This game in 5.1 surround will scare you and blow you away!Gameplay: Terrific, although there are only 3 \"real\" levels.  While there are 11 levels in the game, they all take place in either an abandoned warehouse, an office building, or a secret research lab.  That's it.  They are really well done, but this is where the game drops the ball- the repetitive nature of the levels and the enemies will turn off some gamers.  The \"horror\" angle of the game is very well implemented, and there are some genuinely freaky moments.  If you liked The Ring, you'll like FEAR.  Overall, this game takes the best bits of various shooters and combines them: Max Payne's slow-mo bullet time is here, and very well done, as is Half-life 2's \"story unfolds as you go\" brand of storytelling, which is more effective than the boring exposition that accompanies most games.  The controls are intuitive and effective, and the gun battles fun as anything.Overall: A terrific game, though the repetitive nature of the levels and enemies makes for some disappointment.  The ending is also a tad of a letdown, though I didn't mind it.  I recommend this game very heartily, it is an instant classic.  Does it blow away HL2?  No.  The story is somewhat formulaic and easily predictable, the levels a bit dry, and the game a bit soul-less when compared to Valve's masterpiece.  That said, this is a keeper.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2005"}

Everything from high-pitched whines from spaceship engines in Mass Effect 3 to the deep bass of dragons crashing to the ground in Skyrim shine when coming out of the earpieces here. I was also incredibly impressed with the array of features, especially the ability to determine how directionally-oriented sounds are projected through the headset (like having a sound coming from 7-8 o'clock be projected as coming from 9 o'clock so you would clearly know to turn your head to the left).I was also impressed that the headset uses the optical-out port, but anyone with an older-model 360 will be forced to buy an adapter. I would have liked to see that included. I was also a bit peeved that the battery that powers the headset is not user-replacable, especially because my particular unit was giving me low-battery warnings even after I had left it charging for a few hours (these warnings came within the first 10 minutes of play with no chat). I also (rarely) got some beeps and drops *while* it was charging, which leads me to believe that they were getting some interference, possibly from the router in the next room. These problems got less frequent after I re-linked the headset to the transmitter a few times and used it more, so I'm not sure if that was just the system working out the bugs (much like the Kinect's calibration does over time) or just bad luck on my part.I'm still supremely impressed by this headset, and if my problems disappear I'll give this headset the fifth star, but the issues I've had, combined with the lack of an included adaptor, are annoying enough to me to keep this otherwise steallar product in the four-star range.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2012"}

The controls, while customization in many ways, ultimately made the game either too easy or too hard. If you turn on all the assists, you are essentially just pushing one button and the AI is doing all the work for you, which is lame, but if you try to even control the car yourself, it's like driving on ice; the car slides all over the place. Perhaps this was meant to work like this since the tracks are off-road for the most part, but I just couldn't find a way to enjoy the game.If you are a diehard racing fan then give this a shot.

I played the original and many other strategy games in the past. This is a full, long review. It may have minor spoilers. I will cover as much as possible. I give Objective reviews whenever I can, not Subjective. I will state my personal opinions when I can. This review may be more subjective for me as I really like this game. Bear in mind XCOM:EU has immense replayability as long as you like turn-based tactical battles. The strategy base part of the game is awesome as well.PC Special EditionVery nice. The extra goodies (soundtrack, ringtones, screen backgrounds) are on the second disk and easy to get to. The soundtrack is in .wav format, totally useless. This game is Steam activated. I had no problem installing the game. The patch is a little smaller than I would have liked, but I still plan on using it for a camouflage shirt with lots of other game patches. The poster is very neat, and the art book is hardcover, although small. Overall, the SE Edition is quite nice.GraphicsThey look terrific! Only a few minor glitches here or there. The Deco DLC is awesome, not yet available as of this writing (it was a preorder bonus).SoundThe sound is good, with voices for the soldiers. The music is not as eerie as in the original game, but it is still very good. When aliens are being fought the music picks up for the action. Very nice sound.Early thoughtsThe base is very cool, and tactical is as good as ever. Bear in mind, the official Strategy Guide is NOT going to give tactical training! You need to become a good player by playing and figuring out the strategies, that is why it is called a STRATEGY Game. I will give a few tips where I can. I beat this game in two days, took roughly 24 hours, and I missed a lot of sleep.Difficulty - Easy/Normal or Classic/Impossible?If you are new to this type of game, and especially to XCOM in general, I suggest at least Easy mode. On Easy mode there will be less threat to deal with and more special missions to help you. Also, the alien timetable will be a little longer, so you will have an extra monther or so before fighting the toughest monsters. Aliens are not easier to fight though, they have the same health and stats as Normal mode.On Normal mode it took me 8 game months to win. I lost one country early on, Germany, mainly because South Africa asked for a Satellite they really did not need. Normal mode is just that, nothing differrent. This level of difficulty is the most fun in my opinion. (Actually, I prefer Classic mode now!)Classic and Imposiible difficulties really crank up the action. More enemies in missions and all the aliens get upgraded. Most get +10 Aim (they hit you easier), +10 Defense (-10 for you to hit them), and extra health. Even Thin Men will have 4 health, not 3. This means Grenades are no longer 100% to get kills. Less starting funds, Start with only one base facility (Satellite Uplink), More enemies, countries give fewer scientists/engineers.Accessory slotYou get one accessory slot. The Support soldier can eventually have two. What should you bring to the battle? Early on you have no choice - Grenades. Useful especially if you are new to XCOM style tactical battle. To be honest, this is the ONLY time I use grenades.Scope or Grenade or Nano-fiber/Chitin Armor?Scope. Scope. Scope! Once you get the Scope, you should seriously think about all soldiers having one. Nano-fiber armor gives +2 armor, VERY useful early in the campaign when you only have Body armor (+1 armor), as Nano-Fiber's +2 gives a total of +3 armor and -may- keep a soldier out of the infirmary when hit by Sectoid/Thin Man pistol fire, although critical hits may still happen. Chitin armor is rare to acquire, and I use it on Assault soldiers. With the best standard armor and Chitin armor my Assault can have 9 life + 14 armor, which when combined with the Assault's Extra Conditioning skill will give a total of 27 health in combat.Scope or Mind Shield?Mind Shields are hard to get and thus rare, but take them in the Final Mission for your low-Will soldiers as much as possible.Early MovesEarly in the game you need to concentrate on gettng as many satellites up as possible. This will hopefully lower Alert levels in the country the satellite is deployed and will increase your monthly income. Countries covered will also give scientists and/or engineers per month. When deploying satellites, alert levels are Top Priority, not the continent or credit bonus of the country. Save your satellites until near the end of the month to help respond to Alien alert activity. This is very important as it will allow you to have the most flexibility to repond to Alert levels.The Alien Containment facility can wait. In my opinion, this facility is best built much later in the game. It takes up energy and resources better used for satellite facilities.Workshops are neccessary to raise your engineer numbers, but only so you can build more satellite uplinks. Laboratories are nearly useless, unless playing on higher difficulty settings, then they are useful because research speeds are much longer.One power generator + one thermal generator + one elerium generator, placed all in a row, will give enough power for the whole game.All facilities get the +1 bonus if placed next to each other, either horizontally or vertically.SQUADMy squad typically has 1 Support, 1 Assault, 2 Heavy and 2 Sniper. This is what I use but other players favor Assault more. Your squad composition is up to you.SupportThe weakest offensive unit but the most relied on for support. Eventually can have 3 Medikits. NOTE: All soldiers can carry a medikit as an accessory!AssaultTotal offense. I believe making the first enemy reaction shot miss is best, that way you can lead with this offensive tank. Can have up to 27 health, Awesome.HeavyI always go for +100% damage against Robots. VERY useful when facing the tough robot enemies. I also like Shredder Rocket and 2 Rockets. The capability to take 2 shots in a row is also very nice.SniperI like Squad Sight as it allows me to shoot at anything the squad sees. Less useful with Hover armor, but still a good skill. Double Tap is also awesome. I do not prefer the Sniper that can move and shoot, so I take +2 pistol damage.Tactical BattlesStay together but not all grouped up. If you can't Dash from one side of the formation to the other you are too far apart. Use two mini-squads of support/heavy/sniper and assault/heavy/sniper (different depending on your choice of soldiers or if main soldiers are in the infirmary). When getting ready to enter a doorway, have each mini-squad stand to the SIDE of the doors, never IN FRONT. You could try it the other way but there are certain encounters that may end Very Bad. Take high percentage shots. Sometimes the game will make you miss No Matter What, that's just the way it is.Move forward slowly! Use Overwatch as much as possible! Almost never Dash to move forward, and only Dash when near 100% certain the coast is clear. I cannot stress this enough. Tactical battles are long, patient affairs.Use cover as often as you can! Although soldiers in full cover can still be hit, get as much defense as you can. Defensive bonuses make harder to get hit, and you need every advantage you can acquire.InterceptorsEmp or Plasma? Well, there are two ships you will encounter that are Main Story ships. No matter what you do, these ships will still have a good complement of soldiers. You can always get more artefacts from other missions, squad survivability is paramount so go with Plasma or the late tech Interceptor weapon. Use the EMP until you get Plasma or Fusion.Grey MarketAlmost everything you bring back from battle is useful. Only sell useless items on the Grey Market. Do not sell corpses as almost all have a use. Eventually some can be sold. Early in the campaign it is ok to sell some things, but usually unwise. For example, in my current game I have 4 UFO Power sources and 4 Navigations left. I built several key units and have no more real need for these items. However, they would be needed if I lost Firestorms. And these numbers are for most of the game! If I had sold any of these items I would not have been able to build all the stuff I needed. Therefore, Be Carefull selling on the Grey Market!OVERALLXCOM:EU is a great game. I am certain I may not have included everything I wanted, but this review is very long. I hope it all helps.I LOVE THIS GAME!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0009UBR3A","reviewerName":"Carlos Santiago","summary":"Well worth the wait","reviewText":"I told myself I was only going to write a review of this game after having completed it, to be as fair in my judgement as possible.  55 game-hours  (about 2 1/2 weeks) later here I am, very excited to give you my impression of this marathonically exciting quest.I've had experience with all previous Zelda games on the older consoles, including the Gameboy versions.  I expected this one to have more or less the same winning formula of these past classics with the obvious variations and additions that make everyone come back for more, and I wasn't dissapointed.  Most of you will recall that the game was supposed to be released in 2005 for the GameCube, but it was held up due to the imminent release of the Wii (formerly known as the Revolution) and Nintendo's plan to make this game part of it's new console release in November 2006.This adventure is, without question, the longest and deepest of any Zelda series so far.The main game plot follows a more dramatic course than in previous games, you could probably tell that there is a darker/gloomy side to it, however, most of the adventure follows a positive, lighter tone with fun side-quests and mini-games.The Zelda series are not classified as RPGs (role playing games).  You don't have to collect and summon magic spells or fight monsters in a turn-based method using different characters.  You only control a single character (in his two forms), a hero who ultimately carries the burden of saving the entire town.  You will find allies that'll help you in your quest (your horse Epona, Midna, etc.), but ultimately it will be Link who must complete the main tasks.As a player, you will have the chance to control Link's character, and obtain different items and weaponry that will help him defeat the enemies and also open new pathways to progress further into the adventure and ultimately unfold the plot.Link's main weapons are the sword and shield, however, the adventure can not be completed simply by hacking and slashing away.  Most of the enemies require a certain weapon combination/technique to be defeated.  Link will also acquire a number of special sword skills, necessary in later stages for his survival.One of the most rewarding moments during the adventure is obtaining new special weapons or items.  These special weapons/items are either used to defeat the most difficult enemies in battle or to unlock or open up new rooms or areas.  These special items are found well hidden within temples and ultimately require fighting a boss, to grab them.  Once they are in your possession, you'll most probably use them to defeat a stronger boss later on in the same temple.The game's strength, however, are the puzzles.  To get a special weapon, to find a character, to complete a task or to simply continue further in the adventure, you'll have to figure out quite a few well-thought-out puzzles.  A puzzle could be something as simple as eliminating all enemies inside a room or as complex as  having to manipulate items in multiple rooms in a temple to finally unlock a secret.Be prepared to spend many hours trying to complete this adventure, but I assure you that you'll not find a single idle minute.  There is always something interesting to do, even when you find yourself stuck. I didn't use a guide at all to complete the adventure, although I could probably recommend people to get one if you are new to Zelda or to any adventure game.This game is one of the best in the Legend of Zelda series, with beautiful graphics, smooth play mechanics, deep plot, exciting game-play, a fantastic music score and a beautiful ending, all well worth the wait.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2007"}

Leave the NINJA games to NINJA GAIDEN","reviewText":"I really wanted to like this game. I really liked Raiden from the Metal Gear series, but this game lacks in delivery. Ill be brief:The character graphics are cool, but the world layout is bland, dull, and not very creative. Its full of big ugly cars, buildings, boxes and trees. It seems very rushed. It reminds me of the metal gear game for the psp.....The action is very fast paced, but thats not a good thing. If you complained about Ninja Gaidens camera, Metal Gear Rising camera is 100 times worse. Enemies will completely go blind spot on you and attack from imaginary land. Your r contatntly adjusting the angle.Raiden also cant block or dodge attacks!!! Are you serious? All he has for defense is some lowsly parry thats good for some enemies. You can slide when fighting bigger enemies but its almost irrelavant.The fighting is probably the worst this game has to offer. The chopping idea gets old quick. Its very uncomfortable to perform, and its not very fluent at all. He doesnt make real contact with the enemies without a tedious effort.The story is about the only thing that makes me want to finish this game. Im bound with revenge, to mainly kill Sam for what he did to me...other than that, I dont care about whats going on.ILL STICK TO NINJA GAIDEN IN THE FUTURE.

I found it disappointing I beat a game on normal mode the day after I picked it up.  The veteran difficulty modes were ludicrously hard to master, and it was frustrating to spend 30 minutes getting past one area only to immediately get killed in the next part.  It's more about memorization of the spawns and how quickly you can aim for the head before they shoot you.I thought the spec ops portion of the game was great.  I was a bit disappointed I couldn't invite anyone to play with only friends, but when I did get a friend on we had a lot of fun with the missions.I've never liked the mulitplayer on the call of duty series.  It's very twitch gameplay, and by the time I started getting into the multiplayer, all my competition was already maxed out in points and perks, leaving me to play at a disadvantage.  The perks system for upgraded weapons was also a paper-thin RPG-like leveling system, which really only rewards your time played rather than your skill. Like any shooter, if you don't memorize the maps and constantly practice, expect to get very frustrated. The 360 community is also very chatty on the headsets, whistling and talking trash / death threats (Yes, xbox live is full of those unfortunately).  It didn't help the frustration level.With all the hype MW2 drew, this game is way too short to say it was great.  It had great advertising and marketing, but it's still a niche game for FPS gurus at its core.  There's no real immersion throughout the campaign.  The only thing you're paying for are the maps in the multiplayer. And you still can't play with more than one person on the screen in the multiplayer, making the game a very solo affair.  If you're not into shooters that much, this game loses its flavor after you watch the ending.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2009"}

{"product_name":"B007SRM5MO","reviewerName":"Greg","summary":"The Dark Knight Breaks Every Bone In Your Body","reviewText":"It's been a Batman kind of... well, decade, at this point.Arkham City is, in every way, a great follow up and worthy successor to the kick-ass Arkham Asylum.  There are some notable differences but, if you liked the previous installment, I can't for the life of me imagine why you wouldn't like this one.The driving force behind this game, as the last, is the story.  And boy-oh-boy, is it a doozy.  We open with Bruce Wayne protesting the opening and operation of Arkham City: a super-prison that covers several city blocks and holds ALL of the crooks and criminals and crazies in Gotham.  Hugo Strange, a psychiatrist in charge of running Arkham City and our main villain, chucks Bruce Wayne in jail, because courts and due-process are not a thing in Gotham, apparently.  Once inside, Bruce becomes Batman, does some sluething and winds up face to face with the Joker (no surprise there).  But the Joker's quite ill, it turns out!  Poisoned by his overdose of Titan at the close of Arkham Asylum!  And his plan to cure himself is... well, awful, and exactly the type of thing you'd expect the Joker to come up with.  Batman then proceeds to fly among rooftops and punch people in the neck until all the problems are solved... well, mostly... actually, not really at all.  This is a dark game, even by Batman standards: it's not morbid or emo, but the stakes are very high and you could argue that the Dark Knight isn't handling the situation too well.  Too much is stacked against him and we have to wonder if he'll come out all right.  It's a pretty gripping tale that takes some unexpected twists.  It's a sprawling story as well, that covers a lot of ground and introduces an vast array of Batman villains (some obligatory, some really unexpected) but in a smart, clever sort of way.  Nothing feels overly padded or awkwardly shoved in.  It's a clever plot that gets from one point to the next in a really organic way.And, once again, Mark Hamill's Joker steals the show.  Serioulsy, does he get awards for this?  Because he deserves some sort of recognition aside from me saying nice things in Amazon revies no one will ever read.  It's an excellent group of voice-actors and he outshines them all.Of course, all of that wouldn't matter if the gameplay sucked; and I'm happy to say that it doesn't suck in the least.  It's the same blend of battle-royale combat, stealthy hunting and detectiving from the first.  Everything's been smoothed out and the animations have been blended much better, but it's not worlds apart.  I will say that the multi-foe combat moves a lot faster; the animations have been sped up and, if you time it right, the Batman can take down two or three enemies at a time.  As I've said before, it's the ultimate easy-to-learn-hard-to-master experience: you can just mash that punch button and (maybe) come out okay.  But the best will blend gadgets and free-flowing beatdowns to deliver the ultimate ass-kicking to ten, twenty, thirty guys at a time.  Ditto the stealth sections, when it's time to take down a team of lunatics with guns.  Those who take the time to learn all of batmans tools and tricks will be able to clear a room in seconds without breaking a sweat.  It's a super-fun, super-satisfying experience.There's also the addition of open-world exploration.  Batman's cape and grapple hook have been improved and let him, for the most part, fly from one end of the modeslty sized Arkham City to the next.  The design of the city is pretty unique; it's a well laid out area with its own unique feel.  There's a TON of detail, with lots of ledges and corners and alleys to hide in.  I would have prefered a more palatable shift in neighborhood as you travel from one super-criminal's turf to the next: everything is coated in the same grime and it makes Arkham City a touch monotone.  Not that more color is the answer, we all know what happens when you paint pastels on batman.  But... just, something to keep, say, the docks looking different from the area around the courthouse, you know?  It's hard to think of what, because it's all so detailed already but... lighting?  I don't know, I got nothin.Anyway, what makes Arkham City stand out from Arkham Asylum is the shear weight of content:  400+ riddler challenges, a dozen or so side-missions giving storylines to some of the more colorful Batman villains, easter-eggs, hidden secrets, audio tapes, 3d-models, concept art, offline challenges for points.  You could probably spend 40 - 60 hours tracking it all down.  And this is even before the GOTY content...But, yeah, about that... The big additions are the Catwoman DLC and the expansion: Harley Quinn's Revenge.  Neither of which is that robust or all that exciting.  Fun, but not too much fun. The Catwoman subplot weaves in and behind Batman's main story; it's neat to see what she's up to, but it's brief and doesn't really fill in any gaps that need filling in.  It is fun to play as Catwoman, who has a much faster, much more effiecient fighting style.  You get access to her at anytime after the main story and in the additional challenge maps, which is pretty cool.  But it's not a necessary companion; you'd be fine without it.  Ditto Harley's Revenge: it's a pretty brief addition to the end of the story, where Harley Quinn has herself locked up tight in the steel mill with some kidnapped cops.  There's a few good fights, a couple of good stealth moments, and you get to play as both Batman and Robin at different points in the story.  But it's very, very short and mostly forgettable.  It felt mostly like it was there to set up a couple of things to be used in the third game.Oh, and there will be a third game: there are far too many hints and moments of foreshadowing scattered throughout Arkham City.  Google the ScareCrow easter egg, if you don't believe me.All in all, I guess I would have to recommend the GOTY edition over the standard, simply because it's more of a good thing.  There's enough extra stuff to be worth it (different batman skins, the ability to play as Robin/nightwing/catwoman in the extra challenges, a copy ofBatman: Year One[if you're into that]) and it all comes neatly on one disk.  You need a fair amount of memory to hold it  all (1.2 G, I believe) but it's pretty much worth it.  Like I said, it's just more of a good thing.Not a lot more, nothing mindblowing, but a solid addition to one of the finest games of the past few years.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2012"}

Every song in the game is a mash-up of 2 songs, making the soundtrack completely fresh- Good value at $40.00 (Worth every penny)- Great for parties, you can play it with friends or just let the game run by itself so you can just listen to the musicCons:- DLC is EXPENSIVE!- Has a steep learning curve between difficulty levels- Using the DJ turntable to navigate the menus can be tedious- DJ Vs. DJ mode is kinda bland due to the fact you and your opponent do the EXACT same thing- Crossfade bar is hard to get used to- Finding the euphoria button (aka star power) can be hard when you're trying to focus while playing difficult tracksOverall, I love this game!

{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"A Narrative Break for Games.","reviewText":"I am a huge proponent of the idea that games can house plots that rival the greatest in both film and literature.However steadfast my belief of that is, though, it's always been a hard sell to non-gamers. So many are skepticalabout the idea that an element of control in a plot won't throw it off track that they disregard games as an artform altogether. And while many games have come out in my years as a gamer that I use to rebut those claims (\"Alan Wake\"and \"Heavy Rain\" being the most recent examples), none of those have truly surpassed a well-made film, or a masterfully written book, in the eyes of those critics. Leave it to the fine folks at Rockstar, always pushing games to theirvery limit, to provide us with what may be the finest example of a narrative in interactive media to date. Thatexample is the truly superb \"L.A. Noire\".This is a detective story that would make even Raymond Chandler's jaw drop in astonishment. War hero Cole Phelps,after being honorably discharged from the Marines with a Silver Star, comes back home to a burgeoning Los Angeles. As is customary for any city's growth, crimes begin to break out at a more frequent rate. Rapes, drug schemes, murder, and robbery become day-by-day affairs for the LAPD. Seeing this, Phelps decides to join the force and do the best he can to protect the city that he calls home. The plot follows our hero as he works his way through the ranks, starting as a beat cop but quickly progressing into homicide and the like. \"L.A. Noire\"'s overarching narrative may not sound like much, but that's not exactly where it tries to impress. Where it's strengths lie are in the individual cases, divided up into chapters a la \"Ace Attorney.\" At first, these may not seem like anything special, but a chapters in the writing begins to take on a tone both mature and sophisticated. Never before have I seen dialogue as impressive and fluid in a video game, never coming across as canned or cheesy in the least. This game sets a whole new level for narrative gaming.Not that things exactly skimp on the actual gameplay front, either. While the most immediate comparison is to Rockstar's biggest franchise, \"Grand Theft Auto\", \"L.A. Noire\" actually deviates a large amount from the typical open-world mold. Despite what trailers may have you believe, the brunt of gameplay in this game is in the investigation. You can storm through crime scenes, skipping evidence and going straight for suspects' throats, but that's hardly conducive to success. No, the way to get the most out of each case is to take your time at the crime scenes and uncover every little detail before jumping into action. When you're absolutely convinced that you have your guy or girl, it's easier taking them down with evidence than with brute force.Don't think that Rockstar ignored their fanbase's cries for action, though, because that's another area this game does so well. Firefights and car chases are well-placed, never sinking to the perfunctory shoot-outs and chase sequences that many other games often use due to a lack of original ideas. The foot chases have to be the most exhilarating I've ever experienced, always throwing in twists and turns in the later levels. Running along a corridor only to find yourself INCHES from getting smashed by an oncoming train, or running through the workings of an abandoned movie set chasing a perp when you discover that the floor is collapsing beneath your feet... you never know what this game is going to throw at you at any given point, which is possibly the best thing about the whole experience.The graphics, a huge marketing point for the game, are fantastic. Every single detail of Los Angeles is lovingly rendered, as are the faces of the actors who give life to the refreshingly unique characters. Especially impressive are the shadow effects, which give off the tone of 40's noir flicks that the developers were aiming for. Completing that feel are both the excellent acting and superb soundtrack, making for rich soundscapes paralleled by few.\"L.A. Noire\" has a lot of hype surrounding it, and deservedly so. It's hands-down the best game so far this year, and even with massive games coming out later this Summer, I wouldn't be surprised if it's greatness is unrivaled. A new bar for storytelling in video games has been set, and we owe it all the fine publisher and developer that made it possible.Story: A+Graphics: A+Sound: A+Gameplay: A+Overall: A+ (Superb in every way; Pure Perfection)UPDATE (5/25/11): This will be the first of two updates. Nearing the climax of main story mode, I must say, my feelings towards the game haven't changed a bit. While there is a noticeable lull in action when you finish Homicide and begin working in the AD Vice, the plot maintains all of it's intrigue, and that lull ends within a few cases. I stand by my original score insofar.FINAL UPDATE (5/27/11): Finished the game, and have determined that my feelings in fact have changed. I love \"L.A. Noire\" more than I initially did, and that's saying a lot. It takes a special game to tie every seemingly unrelated plot thread into a huge overarching narrative, and do it without a hitch, but Rockstar and Team Bondi have managed to do it in spades. The ending is something that's bold, and required a lot of guts to force on the player. The last few hours you spend with this game will not only be the most poignant and intense within it, but perhaps the most of any game released this year. A fantastic experience unlike any other, this is one game that you must play. Period.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2011"}

The game play is fun, and an interesting start to hopefully improved free roam zombie apocalypse games. The only problem I have found with this is the fact that when playing alone in campaign mode it gets a little boring.

Furthermore, the home console version will deliver additional content including a terrifying new enemy, extra difficulty mode and improvements to Raid Mode such as new weapons, skill sets and the opportunity to play as Hunk and other characters from the series. Raid Mode, which was first introduced to the series in the original version of Resident Evil Revelations, sees gamers play online in co-op mode or alone in single player taking on the hordes of enemies across a variety of missions whilst leveling up characters and earning weapon upgrades. The critically acclaimed survival horror title takes players back to the events that took place between Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, revealing the truth about the T-Abyss virus. Resident Evil Revelations features series favorites Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, plus their respective BSAA partners - Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat.  The action begins on board a supposedly abandoned cruise ship, the 'Queen Zenobia', where horrors lurk around every corner before players head for the mainland and the devastated city of Terragrigia. With limited ammo and weapons available, the race is on to survive the horror of Resident Evil Revelations.","reviewerName":"phoongdan","summary":"Best RE installment since RE5","reviewText":"I am a big fan of RE4 and RE5, but was disappointed with RE6 and quite disappointed with Operation Raccoon City (ORC), so RE Revelations was a very pleasant surprise. What I like better about this game is that the story is much less discombobulated and flows better than did the story in RE6. Plus this is a more familiar RE format, still action-oriented but this game did a much better job of creating spooky atmosphere than RE6 or ORC did. The game play was fun and challenging at times, but not overly so and I never got \"stuck\" anywhere due to bad game mechanics as was the case with ORC nor did I lose interest and stop playing like I did with parts of RE6. I also like how they brought back the journals and notes that you can find and read during game play, this is a fun part of the RE series, serves to move the story along and is always a welcome break in the action.There are some drawbacks to the game however, it isn't a perfect game by any means. The environments were pretty good overall, and it is definitely a neat setting to have most of the game play take place on a ship. But virtually the entire game takes place on a ship, which I thought got a tad boring towards the end. And I grew tired of the sinking ship theme where you have to swim for your life several times. I died more during these parts than I did in the boss battles! Plus the graphics seem a little sub par to me. I suspect this may have something to do with when the game was first made for a platform other than the PS3. They aren't bad, just not as clear and crisp as to what you'd expect from the RE series.At times the dialogue in the game is mind numbingly bad, especially the interactions between Chris and Jessica during their missions together. I know they are trying to create a lovers triangle by introducing Jessica as a rival v. Jill for Chris' affections, but it's done on basically an elementary school level. The same can be said for the introduction of the two soldier characters that play minor rolls in the campaign. Personally, I could have done without their missions, and I think the game play would have been much more solid and less discombobulated without their chapters. Plus their short missions had almost a Call of Duty feel to them, like did much of RE6, which I thought was a weak point for RE6 and a weak point for this game as well. However, it's only a couple of short missions in this game, so it didn't affect the overall game play too much. What I liked better about the older versions of the RE series, and even RE5 is that the story was very linear and easy to follow. Not that I don't like dynamic stories, it's just that I don't think the RE developers are good at it. When they try to weave a dynamic story, it comes off as broken and aloof. They are much better off sticking to a linear storyline.Overall though I enjoyed the game and finished the entire campaign in about 15 hours of playtime. I've enjoyed the Raid mode as well, but miss the old Mercenaries game from RE4 and RE5, though I didn't like the RE6 version of Mercenaries. The Raid mode is pretty cool, but if I have to choose between Mercenaries and Raid, I'll take Mercenaries. Recommended.FINAL GRADE: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2013"}

New courses, strategic new abilities and customizable karts bring the racing excitement to new heights.","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Mario To The Finish Line","reviewText":"There is no question that Mario Kart is soon set to celebrate its 20th anniversary as one of the most acclaimed video game series for the Nintendo games. It has just been a non-stop fast & furious ride for Mario, Bowser and his friends from each angle. It has been on every system since the Super NES, and it hasn't seen the plumber and his friends and foes hit the brakes into the warp pipe even once. Still, there have been so many racing games that have tries to copy it and haven't succedded, or those who have been inspired by Mario and his friends race. Well whatever the case, Mario and his friends kept on evolving in the Mairo Kart games and they have never lost their luster. Now with the high-octane and mushroom speed, it is at it again for the Nintendo 3DS, and truthfully it is worth each and every race.Mario Kart 7 really brings in the big guns for the Nintendo 3DS, where some of the other Nintendo 3DS games, have missed their mark with the launch of the system. Hard to believe it is the 7th racing game for Mario and his friends, and this time around it has continued to evolve well by bringing in a swift mix of the new and the old. Just like Mario Kart DS and MarioKart Wii, gamers will race 32 tracks that are both new and from Mario Kart's past. The game definitely looks amazing with some new wrinkles into the game, as you have new racers and new courses too like racing in the new Music Park, where hopping on each note and insturment will help you cross the finish line, Shy Guy Bazaar, where it is a Middle Eastern flavor available, as you and your fellow racers try and cross the starting gate, while trying to glide from rooftops, and classics as well like Luigi Raceway from Mario Kart 64 and the speed and mall-madness of the Coconut Mall from Mario Kart Wii.Aside from the mix of old and new tracks as well, there are new racers that are here to challenge Mario, Yoshi and friends including Lakitu the cloud-dwelling and spiny tossing foe, Metal Mario (as a celebration to help celebrate the 15th anniversary of Super Mario 64,) Shy Guy and Wiggler to name a few. They bring a lot of new blood into the game, as well as new elements like customizing your karts with tires and gliders which will make you soar your way back to the asphault.You also can race underwater too, which will help you find shortcuts in the game, especially in redesigned courses like Koopa Trooopa Beach and new Cheep Cheep Lagoon. There are also a few new items in the game too including the fireball power-up, the tanooki tail which will help you swat passing racers, and the new Lucky 7 that is a  seven-way mix of weapons like the shells both red and green, a blooper to ink foes, banana peel and and a star for invinciblity.The graphics in the game look amazing, as you score your way to the finish, as well as collect coins while on course to help yopu unveil extras to help customize your karts. The control is strong as well, in the classic mode, but there is one small hiccup with the new first person perspective. While the concept is good, in that mode you can race with others using the gyro sensor from the 3DS and steer your kart by swaying your racer back and forth, like the Wii Wheel was in Mario Kart Wii. That can take a bit to get used to for new racers, but for veterans they can also choose to play in the classic way as well. The sound is strong as well, by bringing in the classic scores and musical elements of the distinctive classic courses like Mushroom Gorge, but overall it is the gameplay that is fun in both single play and especially multiplayer too. The multiplayer adds extras with the Streetpass, and online gameplay like Mario Kart Wii showed, as you and 7 other racers try to race your way to the finish line.Overall, despite one small flaw, Mario Kart 7 is definitely a fast and furious game from start to finish, and it still is just as great for many gamers more than meets the eye. If you have enjoyed the chase that Mario Kart has brought before than you'll definitely love this Nintendo 3DS game. I definitely love this thrilling racer and it shows that some game franchises have never gotten old, they just have gotten better with age. It is definitely a must buy for your Nintendo 3DS that is sure to be a treat that many racers haven't been able to show for over 2 decades across the finish line. I absolutely recommend Mario Kart 7 from start to finish.Graphics: ASound: A-Control: A- for classic gamers; B for Nintendo 3DS gyro sensorFun & Enjoyment: A- for solo play: A for multiplayerOverall: A-","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2011"}

It was well worth the wait. The game is premiering on all three major game systems at once, and although each version is essentially the same, each game has one distinct quality: They feature different lead characters. For the Playstation, it's Heihachi. For the XBox, it's Spawn. But the Gamecube got the best one: Link. He's joined by many of the classic characters from the original game, plus some great new ones. The biggest question, however, is this: What prevents this from just being another run-of-the-mill fighting game, another Kakuto Chojin or another Mortal Kombat clone? One needn't worry.Although similar in style to other combat games, this one rises above them with extraordinary gameplay, first-rate graphics (esp. on the Cube and XBox) and surprisingly easy controls and fighting techniques. The attacks are pretty straightforward: kick, horizontal weapon, and vertical weapon. But there are some good combination moves available, as well. Like all other combat games, this requires button/control combinations and some tricky maneuvering. Unfortunately, the Gamecube's basic controller is not well-suited for these moves; the buttons aren't aligned very well for some of the trickier moves. (Of the 3 systems, only the PS2's basic controller was the most user-friendly). But Gamecube fans have a good alternative: the wireless Wavebird controller works really well with this game. Another advantage for Cube fans: The Cube's excellent graphics engine make this game a real treat visually; the player is surrounded by beautifully detailed scenery and environments. Truthfully, it's not that much different from the first version. (But if it ain't broke...) For those who never played the first version, here's a chance to enjoy one of the best combat games ever devised. For those who loved (and miss) the original, it's just like experiencing this fabulous title all over again.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2003"}

Soul Calibur IV is no different, offering up a plethora of fighters that bear familiar faces to fans of the series, as well as even offering Darth Vader (yes, Darth Vader) as a bonus fighter for the Playstation 3 version of the game (while XBox 360 gamers get Yoda), and stands as the best fighter to hit the PS3 yet.  Like previous installments in the series, the fighting engine is surprisingly deep yet even more surprisingly accessible for those new to the series, and is rewarding as well.  It should also be noted that Soul Calibur IV looks magnificent (especially on the PS3) and fully displays some brilliantly animated graphics that are vibrant and nicely detailed.  Even better is the game's online play which is smooth, lag-free, and tons of fun.  The only real downside to Soul Calibur IV is that the game's single player mode isn't hard to get through at all, and there's no team battle mode either, which is really disappointing.  Despite that though, Soul Calibur IV is a wonderful and incredibly good installment of a great fighting series that deserves your attention, whether or not you're a veteran or newcomer to the Soul Calibur universe.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2008"}

Most games that are available for the PS4 honestly look like PS3 graphics.  I've had this game sitting and collecting dust for awhile, for fear of being disappointed.Damn was I wrong!  This is a game that is truly next-gen and looks BEAUTIFUL on the PS4.  The graphics are simply amazing, and during one cutscene my wife briefly thought I was watching TV instead of playing a game.  I know some don't like the story line but I love it and was immediately sucked in.  Finally a game that I look forward to playing each day!  The controls are very fluid and not clunky at all.  I also think they nailed it with the Seattle weather and environment.  I usually trade in games once I get tired of them or don't like them, but this is a game I will be holding on to.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2014"}

Before she was caught, Zelda managed to shatter the Triforce of Wisdom and scatter its eight pieces throughout Hyrule. Link swore to recover the Triforce pieces and rescue Princess Zelda from Ganon's clutches.","reviewerName":"theboombody","summary":"I actually like Zelda 2 better","reviewText":"You better have a map handy when playing this game.  Its quite complicated.  But the thing is, if you've already played A Link to the Past, this game hasn't much more to offer.  Perhaps the only thing it has that's not in the SNES version is the feature where you're forced to pay for door repairs if you blow up certain cave walls.Zelda 1 is basically the prototype for A Link to the Past.  That's why I like the 2nd Zelda better.  Because it's actually a different game from the 1st and 3rd Zelda.  Zelda 1 and 3 have pretty much the exact same gameplay except 3 is a massive improvement in terms of characters and graphics.Still, its nice to play this game again 20 years later, see the dragon in the first dungeon, and say, \"Hey, I remember that guy.\"I beat the first quest of the game, but I didn't feel like doing another quest all over again.  Especially when the only difference is in difficulty level and where items are placed.The first 2 Zeldas aren't bad for classic games, but I think I'd only classify A Link to the Past as a must-play.  Zelda 1 is so bland in comparison.8/12/07 - Finally I finished the second quest.  Its quite a bit more difficult than the first quest.  I didn't realize that although the map of Hyrule looks the same, the dungeons are completely different in look as well as item placement.  Throughout the second quest I always seemed short on money, and I kept getting my sword stolen by those orange sparkle things.  Let me emphasize that you REALLY need a map for this second quest because darn near all the dungeons are completely hidden in places you would never guess in a million years.This game was long as heck for a game made in 1986.  Contrary to my earlier remarks, I would definitely recommend going through the second quest after you've beaten the first because the dungeons are much more challenging.  Great replay value.  Definitely an adventure.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2007"}

Your team of heroes is one unit that works together.If you love the demo that's on the Eshop you'll love this game.If you dislike it, well you may still yet love this game. Its something you have to try out in full setting. This game is the spirit of the old NES&SNES; games where you had to play over and over again and search things out while the game teaches you to play.Reminds me of Megaman XAs for the mechanics,they work extremely well. Learning them is part of the fun, just like in a fighting game.I personally use the gamepad to do drawing shortcuts and follow up with repeated x combos's and other formats. This may or may not work for you depending on how you play, how you hold the gamepad and how big your hands are( I've got long spidery hands)Make sure you buy all the skills you can at the shop immediately.

{"product_name":"B00006F7S8","description":"It's hard to believe that creator Will Wright had trouble selling his originalSimCityconcept to publishers. That first game went on to fame, notoriety, and great praise--from critics, gamers, and even educators--and spawned countless imitators, not the least of which include Wright's own smaller-scaleThe Sims, which went on to become a phenomenon in its own right. Now on its fourth edition,SimCityreturns to our hard drives, and would-be city planners everywhere will be busy for a long, long time.SimCity 4functions much like its predecessors. You've got the power to zone land as residential (green), commercial (blue), and industrial (yellow). You control the budget. You decide where to place crucial services like police, fire, medical, and even utilities like power and water. You place schools, parks, roads, water towers, and scenery as you accede to the many demands of your Sim citizens. Do a good job and your city will grow and the money will flow into your coffers. Do a bad job and the people will pack up and move away, leaving your city treasury in horrific debt and landing you what the game cheekily considers to be a far easier job: senator. The game requires a balancing act that takes both planning and a persnickety nature. There are charts to read, reports to watch, and, above all, needs to juggle. It's rewarding when it all comes together, and frustrating when you fail, once again, to build anything worthwhile.That's why I wish the game came with a better manual. The included book glosses over most major information and then neglects important aspects, such as the RCI indicator (which explains zoning needs) and parts of the budget. At the very least, the manual should include tips on handling debt. There are two tutorials which cover the basics, but again, they won't help you get out of trouble once you get in too deep. You can find this information in thestrategy guide, which is sold separately, but you really shouldn't have to go that route.The graphics are amazing, showing a vibrant metropolis with scurrying traffic, wandering Sims, smoking chimneys, and sparkling lights when night falls. Fireworks reward each year of service. And wait until you see the cool disasters you can unleash if the mood strikes you--fire, lightning, tornado, volcano, and giant robot. Oddly, there's a significant performance hit even on fast systems. Thankfully, the stuttery scrolling and slow-to-respond zoom don't hurt the game too much since you can pause it at will or fast forward if you need to wait for your cash reserves to build. The most significant flaw is that the game only offers one save slot, which discourages experimentation.Despite minor imperfectionsSimCity 4is an awesome game. You can build several cities next to each other on the map and make them dependant on each other. (You can build the greater L.A. area, in other words.) You can even import your Sims fromThe Simsto live in your city. Such familiar characters can tell you a lot about what your city needs. Put simply, city planning has never been this fun, this challenging, or this deep.--Andrew S. BubPros:Beautiful graphics and animationDeeper and more realistic than ever beforeCons:Runs slowly on most systemsInadequate manual","reviewerName":"Kang","summary":"could have been so much better","reviewText":"In one aspect, there isn't enough micro-management.  You merely zone a plot of land and wait and see.  You put you 'sims' into your city, but I have yet to get any meaningful input from them.  Also, all you can control is where they live...which can change very often.  No control of where they work, the route they take to commute...you are left in the dark in these sort of things.On the flip side, there is too much micromanagement.  If there is a disaster, there isn't an auto-response feature.  You have to click on emergency, click on the appropriate icon and click on the disaster.  And when the pipes start leaking, it's a very hassling game of 'find the leak'.  And speaking of pipes, you have no ability to divert your funds to just the pipes, or just the powerlines.  You have a general water and power fund, and the lack of micromanagement in this part makes the game harder and more frustrating then it should have been.The 2 things that have been vastly improved over the last installment of SimCity is the God Mode and graphics.  A real visual treat of building up a city and calling down a meteor while zoomed in to the closest level.  Shaping the land is a cinch, and you'll be making mountains and valleys in no time.The ability to connect one region to another is also nice.  You can build a massive housing zone in one region and build a highway to another region full of industrial zone.Well, if you like SimCity, there's no reason why you shouldn't like this one.  The feeling of creating a city with tall skyscrapers is a very rewarding feeling (I've only had the pleasure of having around 3 block full of skyscraper, but you know..).  And hey, if you just feel like destroying stuff, load up a premade map, take control of a city and send down meteors, giant robots, lighting, and even sprout a volcano or two.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2003"}

So far I've finished Chapter 1 and have no desire to ruin the game by playing as quickly as I can the entire way through. I'm sure subsequent replays will give a new storyline....a \"What if I had done this, instead of that?\"Heavy Rain is the only other game out there that is close to this.

{"product_name":"B007XVTR5S","description":"","reviewerName":"The Tech Fanatic \"The Tech Fanatic\"","summary":"Needs Some Fixes on Multiplayer But Otherwise Great Game","reviewText":"I am reviewing this game on the multiplayer portion as that is the reason most purchase this game. First of all, I really like the new setup where you can select whatever perks and attachments that you like as long as you have only ten selections. Of course, each weapon has it's own set of rules when it comes to attachments. And if you like to have an additional perk one, now you can. You'll just have to give up on one selection such as a secondary weapon or grenade. You can still carry two primary weapons but that will cost you one selection.What I do not like is the balancing system in the multiplayer game of team deathmatch. Often, the high scoring players are placed on one team while all the lowest scoring player are sent to the other. I don't think that it is because they are playing as a party as most do not show a microphone icon. I can tell when it is a party as they will often chatter amongst themselves or share the same clan tag. I don't know what factors the system uses to balance the teams but it ain't working. I could score high on one match and then I get thrown with the lower scoring players which I don't mind as I see it as a challenge. But when you are the only high scoring player on your team and the other team has all the other high scoring players then that is a bit much. I've found that I would carry my team and then on the next match I would end up carrying the team again and most time we'd lose as the other team's members had an overall higher score.One of the solutions that Treyarch could implement is to have a class level in matchmaking. If you average 15 or less kills for a certain number of matches, then you go to a first tier class and you can only play with those within that class. Those who normally score above 15 kills would only be able to play those who are in that class and they would be in the second tier. Those who normally score 20 or more kills should only play with others in that class in the third tier. Those who score 25 or more kills would be placed in tier 4 and so on. Once you have scored 15 or more kills for maybe three different matches you should only be allowed to play in tier 2. And once you improve to an average of 20 kills or more you would move on to third tier. Once you have moved up the tier chain you cannot move downwards. Beginners would start at tier 1 and can only be promoted to tier 2 when their scores have reached the minimal for that class. By putting players in classes the matches would be a whole lot more fun for all players. This system would certainly level the field. There are manchilds out there who still live with their parents that don't have a life and play the game all day while there are players out there who have a life and can't spend the whole day playing a video game. I have a life and so I cannot spend more than an hour at this game each day during the weekends. I am by no means a pushover as I have scored higher than a 2 kill/death ratio. But would like to play with other players that are on the same skill level. Of course, there will be better players within the skill level but that would help prevent the problem of unbalanced matches that I see so often. Further, it would place the cheaters in a higher tier where their cheats would be matched by more highly skilled players. They would no longer be able to exploit the beginners and the less skilled players with their cheats. Of course, that is not to say that cheaters should be allowed to continue.Another thing that I find about this game is the toxicity, which Vonderhaar of Treyarch has admitted to. From the vulgar trash talking to obscene emblems that the players have concocted to the racist comments to the sexual innuendos it should not be allowed. Yes, there is a reporting system but it does not have a category to report bullying. I have reported this to Treyarch but they don't seem to care about the bullying that goes on. It is sad because this issue has become one of those issues at the forefront of our society. Many of the players are minors and they should not be exposed to this kind of thing. And, yes, I am aware that this game is rated M for adult content. But children will have access to this game. Too many parents do not monitor what their children are doing especially when it comes to media. Treyarch should take this into consideration and add a report button for bullying.Another issue that I have encountered are hacked accounts. You will see numerous players with no ranking next to their tags. This issue was a problem in World at War and it continues to this iteration. Players who cheat should be banned for a year. A second offense should be cause for a permanent ban. There is a feature to report cheating but you would think by now that these players with the hacked accounts would be removed but they are many of them. I could never understand why anyone would cheat much less in a video game. They not only ruin the experience for the rest of the players but they give that game a reputation that is not very good. World at War succumbed as a result of that problem. Although it is not as obvious in this game as you don't see players flying around on the map, the cheaters have chosen to use methods that are more discreet. Cheaters have become more sophisticated when it comes to trying to get an advantage. One thing that Treyarch could do is to build in a program that would monitor the scores and bring to their attention any aberrations so that they can investigate each suspect player. If you do encounter blatant cheating, for example invincibility, you may report the offender directly to Activision. Be sure to have the suspect player's tag, the date and the time when the encounter took place and a brief description of what happened.Despite the problems of the multiplayer this game is actually fun. But it would be a whole lot more fun if the things I have mentioned were to be fixed. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the previous Call of Duty games or enjoy first person shooters.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2013"}

Peavey","summary":"Sonic Adventures greatest sequel","reviewText":"Sonic adventure 2 is a great sequel to Sonic Adventure but lets get down to it and review this gameStory: Following from where Sonic Adventure left off, Sonic defeats Perfect Chaos and saves Earth. After discovering the existence of a secret weapon mentioned in the diary of his grandfather, Gerald Robotnik, Dr. Eggman infiltrates a high-security G.U.N. facility in search of it. This \"weapon,\" a black hedgehog named Shadow who claims that he is the \"Ultimate Life Form,\" offers to help Eggman take over the world, telling the scientist to rendezvous with him at the abandoned Space Colony ARK with more Chaos Emeralds. Shadow proceeds in stealing one of the Emeralds. During the event, Shadow has a flashback to the final moments of a young girl named \"Maria,\" begging him to complete an unspecified task--which he interprets as a request for revenge. Because Shadow makes a hasty retreat and no one is able to get a good look at him, G.U.N. officials mistake Shadow for Sonic. After escaping from the military, Sonic is arrested again shortly after a confrontation with Shadow, who demonstrates to Sonic the Chaos Control technique.Meanwhile, Knuckles confronts both Rouge the Bat and Eggman, who each attempt to steal the Master Emerald. Knuckles shatters the Master Emerald to prevent this, and proceeds to search for the scattered shards and restore the Emerald. While Rouge intends to collect the shards for personal benefit, she must also accomplish a mission for the government to spy on Eggman. This mission causes her to infiltrate Dr. Eggman's base, which also leads her to the ARK, where Shadow relays to Eggman his plan to use the Chaos Emeralds to charge a \"super weapon\" on the ARK called the Eclipse Cannon to take over the world. To accomplish this, Shadow and Eggman recruit Rouge to assist in the search of the Chaos Emeralds.Tails and Amy infiltrate Prison Island and rescue Sonic from G.U.N., while Eggman, Shadow, and Rouge collect three Emeralds on the island, which they then destroy. Eggman then broadcasts his threats across the planet and demonstrates the cannon's level of power by destroying half of the moon. Sonic and company use the final Emerald within their possession to track down the other six, with Knuckles coming along as well. Together, the group infiltrates Eggman's base, narrowly boarding Eggman's shuttle as it launches into space. Along the ride into space, Knuckles' Master Emerald shards are spilled, and he leaves the group to collect them, encountering Rouge again. During the fight, Knuckles saves Rouge from certain death, and Rouge surrenders her collected shards, finally allowing Knuckles to restore the Master Emerald.On board the ARK, Tails reveals that he has created a counterfeit Chaos Emerald designed to reverse the effects of the real Emeralds and destroy the Eclipse Cannon. Sonic goes to place the fake Emerald into the Cannon when Eggman announces he has captured Tails and Amy. Sonic tries to give Eggman the fake Emerald, but at the last second Eggman traps and jettisons Sonic in an escape pod rigged with explosives. Using the fake Emerald, Sonic manages to perform Chaos Control and escape before it explodes, but Tails, thinking Sonic is dead, fights Eggman again. Shadow is sent to intercept Sonic before he destroys the Eclipse Cannon, but Sonic succeeds.Once Eggman collects all seven Chaos Emeralds and attempts to fire the Eclipse Cannon at full power, a failsafe activates, and a recorded message is broadcast by the late Gerald Robotnik. It explains that the ARK will collide with and destroy Earth, as revenge against humanity for condemning him and his research, as well as killing his granddaughter Maria and numerous colleagues on board the ARK. Everyone agrees to work together to neutralize the Chaos Emeralds with the Master Emerald and stop the collision. Shadow initially does not participate, due to his apathy for humankind; however, Amy's pleading reminds him of Maria's true request to serve as a benefit for society. He catches up with Sonic and Knuckles after they make their way to the core.After disabling the various security features guarding the Cannon's core, Sonic and Knuckles encounter the Biolizard, a prototype of the Ultimate Life Form, and Shadow's \"biological\" brother, who had been awoken from stasis to ensure that the Emeralds would not be tampered with. Shadow defeats the Biolizard, allowing Knuckles to deactivate the Chaos Emeralds using his repaired Master Emerald. However, the injured Biolizard uses Chaos Control to fuse with the Eclipse Cannon, becoming the Finalhazard and continuing the ARK's collision course by physically dragging it along. Using the power of the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic and Shadow transform into Super Sonic and Super Shadow and defeat the Biolizard while he is fused to the ARK. They then use Chaos Control to teleport the ARK back into a stable orbit around Earth. The process, however, depletes Shadow's energy, and is rendered unable to remain in orbit. He plummets to Earth, and to his apparent death, content that he has fulfilled his promise to Maria. Humanity celebrates openly as the two teams solemnly express gratitude towards Shadow for his sacrifice and return to Earth, expressing their plans from there.when you complete a level your given a rank a letter between E to A A ranks are highest.Characters: Sonic,Tails,and Knuckles are playable Amy is not unless your playing multiplayer.

Diablo II and its expansion were a blast about a decade and a half ago when I was playing it with my high school friends and now that I'm replaying it is still very good. But......just don't bother playing this on ANY modern age PC. Seriously, don't waste your time.I should admit that I did get this to run on Windows 8 following the \"tips\" on the Blizzard website but it might as well not have worked at all. The frame rate skips caused by the Windows 8's XP compatibility mode (which is a JOKE if there ever was one) made the game borderline unplayable.Thankfully, I still had my old single core Windows XP desktop in my basement. Half an hour I was all set and yeah, the game ran perfectly on that ancient thing. I don't know why I hung onto that computer (probably because it was too old for anyone to be interested in using/buying it) but I'm glad I did!Look, I know this is a near fifteen year old game... but despite being an old game it deserves much more than this. On top of that I had NO problem getting the original Diablo to play once I had the patch from Blizzard's website. You'd think I'd have trouble with the older game, but no.Anyways, a great game but unless you have a spare computer from before the multi-core/Windows Vista days I would just not bother. If you are interested to the point of paying money beyond the price of the game I would suggest finding an older rig.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2014"}

The battle system is the best of any of the Final Fantasy games, even the newer ones. In fact, I think that the battle system of FF7 is the best of any RPG.

{"product_name":"B00000JRSB","reviewerName":"Jewels \"bookgrrl\"","summary":"Sets the Standard For All Games!","reviewText":"At a first glance, Final Fantasy VII appears to have boxy graphics, lack of special effects, and perhaps even a dull story-line with the stoic hero, Cloud Strife.  However, this game offers so much more than what a quick glance can give.  The characters' graphics may not be fully detailed, but their personalities and body language make up for all of that.  Each character was thoughtfully created with unique story, background,and demeanor.  Unlike many of the Final Fantasy games, one does not get to know the villan as well as the mighty Sephiroth on Final Fantasy VII.  I hated him, yet felt sorry for him at the same time. To make it an even more intriguing game along side of the story-line and character development, the battle system was well constructed.  The Materia system allowed the player to equip Materia, (magic) to their weapons.  (Certain weapons had more Materia slots than others)  When some Materia is linked together such as -All- and -Lighting- it can create an overall attack on all the enemies versus just one. Though some may debate that the graphics sucked, one has to understand that this game came out in 1997.  Graphics six years ago were bound to be worse than what they are now.Pros: Characters that were deeply thought out and well woven into the plotA fun and addicting battle systemSeveral mini-games and great incentives for winningChocobo breeding and racingCons: Graphics may bother those that are use to newer gamesOverall, this game has so much to offer.  I am always tempted to replay it because of things I missed, such as getting Cloud's final limit break Omnislash or beating Ruby and Emerald Weapon.  Just twenty minutes into the game, I was hooked.  It was the first RPG I had ever played and ever since I loved the genre.Final Fantasy VII is worth all the Five Stars I give, because I believe it set the standard to the RPGs to follow.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2003"}

I'm not gonna lie and no horror games has ever scared me before. But this one did and that is what I like about it.The graphics in the game are superb. if you have a flat screen with an hdmi cable it will really make the game come alive. The lighting effects are some of the best that i have seen in a game of this type and really brings out the eerie atmosphere of the game.The sound effects, oh man, are really good. IO dont know how they did it but good job developers. This games really makes you feel like you are actually in the game because those sound effects are that good. If you have surround sound then you will really \"jump\" when monster pop out at you.The game play is very good. The character you play dont talk in this game but his movements are pretty good. There is no HUD. Everything you need to know is either on your suit you wear or the guns you use. Walking and running is very smooth and the controls are easy to use.The guns them selves are very different. They are more like mining tools and even when you are playing the hardest difficulty (impossible mode), when upgraded fully, the guns are actually more powerfull than the monsters them selves. They sound very good the weapons and they give you quite a few to choose from and all weapons have a secondary firing mode.The monsters themselves are nothing to laugh at. Early levels, of course, have easier monsters to deal with but later levels they get very strong and very fast. I always play impossible mode which is the hardest difficulty on dead space. The only difference between easy mode and impossible mode that I found was the strength of the monsters. They don't seem to be any more mosters you have to deal with in impossible mode thats in easy. The numbers are the same.The only bad thing about this game that I can see is that after you beat the game there is really nothing else for you to do. There is an online marketplace but only to download more suits which isnt any more protective than the suit the game already gives you. There is no 2 player or online games with friends you can play (although part 2 of this game has that).I do recommend this game however for those who like horror games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2011"}

The immersion-killing moments, the asinine levelling system and gripes with limited voice actors made me look at it as a disappointment. But seeing Fallout 3 in action intrigued me though I was still skeptical (and upon playing, I now look at Oblivion as actually good and ended up growing on me) but since the holidays are almost over and all the big titles are out, I can pretty much say with certainty that Fallout 3 is my favorite game that came out this year. Sure it's got gripes (what game doesn't?) but it's still definately worth a playthrough and I hope you got a lot of free time on your hands.Story: It's 2277, 200 years after a nuclear war ravaged the world with landmarks all but destroyed, mutants found roaming the environment as well as nearly everything being irradiated. The only safety is for inhabitants of Vaults, underground homes that are sealed where no one is aloud in or out. You're part of Vault 101 and everything's fine until your dad suddenly takes off, someone's found dead and security's on your tail. So you escape the safety of the Vault and roam the D.C. countryside and look for your father and anyone else you happen to befriend...or tick off.Graphics: Anyone who's played Bethesda's previous games in the Elder Scrolls series knows that they love big worlds and Fallout 3 is no different. And while it does maintain that gripe of Oblivion of not really offering variety in its locations like in most RPG's, this game is utterly gorgeous in its own right and the atmosphere practically oozes from the screen and the amount of detail found in destroyed cars, bridges that look near collapsable as well as the gore and slow-motion cutscene during kills, the game is stellar. But there's 2 gripes: characters still don't exactly emote body wise and they can be absolutely mad at you or saddened and their body just...stands there. The other is the amount of stuff in the game makes the performance take a hit and so you'll have textures popping in bit by bit, brief pauses and lulls and slowdown during heavy moments but considering Oblivion was the same, gotta blame it on Bethesda's ambitions then any ineptitude design-wise.Sound/Music: Instead of Jeremy Soule who provided the score for Oblivion, we have instead Inon Zur who did the soundtracks for some Warhammer games as well as the recent Prince of Persia and whereas Soule's score in its grandioseness perfectly suited the world of Cyrodiil, Zur concentrates more on an ambience and an atmosphere then melodies and while some might find it \"boring\" or lacking in anything memorable, it helps immerse the player into an eerie, unfamiliar world. Though there's still some old school songs for you to listen to, Liam Neeson and Malcolm McDowell have excellent voices and thankfully, you won't run into anyone's clone frequently (one time in Oblivion, I literally ran into the same voice on 2 guys in the same inn) though there's still the occasional strangeness.Gameplay: There's some games like Rock Band 2 or Little Big Planet where the game is so fun that it might not be necessarily a long experience but the fun factor never seems to wane and while you might try all the songs, you'll still find new modes and instruments to try instead, or even beating your previous score. Bethesda games on the other hand like to put as much as they can without the disc snapping in half due to the strain and essentially says \"go\". From a map filled with locations to uncover, weapons that you can create from scratch, skill books to enhance stats to quests involving locating specific items from various places, it's safe to say if you're somebody who wants to complete a game 100% well...Fallout 3 will be one of the biggest time-sinkers you'll have. But like Fable 2, do you even want to explore every single crevice and secret lair or do you just do what you're interested in? Like that game, you can play however you want and take on the quests whenever you feel like it so it's really up to you how you want to play.Whereas combat and aiming is slightly clunky when you just aim normally, Bethesda has a fun and worthwhile (not to mention near necessary) system of VATS, or Vault-Tech Assisted Targeting System. Basically, pressing RB will pull up the enemy on screen frozen in place with limbs highlighted and a percentage for likelihood attacks will actually hit. Get a good hit on the arm and they might drop their weapon or if you're really ambitious, aim for the head and watch as their skulls explode in gruesomeness. It's gory but it's not disturbing and when you see eyeballs fly out in exaggerated fashion, you know it's meant to be fun and not gross. Only problem I have with combat is that enemies seem to have better aim than you and one enemy literally was 50 or so feet away with a pistol and his shots were more accurate than mine and this makes it worse when you're up against a minigun-toting Mutant.Included in the game is the idea of gaining Karma which makes you evil or saintly depending on given actions so stealing and random killing will net you bad points whereas helping people will get you on their good side. But one thing I appreciated seeing and wished it was in Fable 2 is not only reactions by NPC's but also by the enemies and playing as a good character, I actually found myself the target of a hit because apparently I'm too noble and self-righteous. Imagine that, the world's gone so much to hell that even people who try to be good have to be snuffed out. Going along with Karma is the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system of levelling up which is thankfully level/XP based rather than constant repetition like Oblivion and upon gaining a level you'll be asked to level up certain skills like Medicine, Repair, Explosives and Lockpicking. You're also asked to pick a perk which is like a permanent special ability so for example one might dole out extra damage to men if you're a woman while another perk might add bonuses to certain stats. The level cap might be a bother unless you get the DLC's which'll take it off but it's still kind of a wait.Over the years, my interest in RPG's dropped a little thanks to so many good games out there but also a sense that the game isn't happy with being a fun 20 hour adventure and instead makes it a tedious and unnecessarily long 40 one. Fallout 3 on the other hand is so fun that you'll probably just spend 40 hours or more just doing whatever and enjoying every bit of it. Might not be for everyone since it's slower paced than most action games and especially for a FPS (third person view optional but best to avoid) but this could be a long road you'll walk and just might enjoy every minute of it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2008"}

I do like that now you have city states that act as allies and I do like the hexes instead of the squares as I think they lend more to strategic movement.  There was one reviewer who complained about not being able to take cities with his armies due to city defenses.  Has he ever considered having a strategy in mind? This is what I like about the departure from unit stacking. Now you have to plan ahead before you take a city. If you aren't willing to do some bombarding of your own and work for the kill then your end result will be frustration and disappointment. You have to do work to take a city!!!I am also happy with the fact that this game runs on a boot camped Macbook Pro (late 2009 model) with Windows 7 and even with details on low to medium it's crisp and runs prety well.I also plan on installing it to my desktop PC running a GeForce 9800GT video card, which is hooked up to my HDTV. I am, however not all the crazy about the Steam account, but I guess whatever works.As to the game itself again, I won't reiterate too much more than what other reviewers have said but the interface to me is much cleaner to deal with, however I do wish the mouse controls could be a bit tighter as sometimes I have to fight a bit with my mouse to have it exactly where I want it on the map.Also, I kind of miss the option for changing religions...hmmHowever, I do like how when you unlock State Policies, there are also sub policies that you can add within.Outside of that, save and save often. I didn't realize that this game would crash so much. I was 3hrs in last night when the game crashed and when i went to go load it, I realized that I didn't se the autosave and since it was time to go to bed, I have to wait til later today to get home and try again.So, Firaxis, patch this game as soon as possible!  It's kind of bad that there are 20+ reviews on Amazon already and the complaints are either Steam related or crash related!**UPDATE**  After patching my video drivers it's working a lot better now except you still cannot skip past the intro screen other than that...it's just fine now!!I have also installed it on my desktop computer and it's a beauty to see on an HDTV!! With the updated drivers and settings maxed out, the game is very animated and plays very well. My only wish is that if I save in the cloud, that I can run that save on my laptop and vice versa. As it is, your saves are locked on that PC.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2010"}

SOLDIER is a group of skilled combat operatives within Shinra. The elite within the group &#x2014; those strong enough to be deemed SOLDIER 1st Class &#x2014; are respected and idolized by the citizenry.   Zack is a young SOLDIER 2nd Class who aspires to become a 1st. He spends his days carrying out assignments under the guidance of his 1st Class mentor, Angeal. During an operation in Wutai, a large number of SOLDIER members, led by 1st Class operative Genesis, go missing. The severity of the situation prompts Shinra executives to deploy even more SOLDIER operatives in hopes of bringing an end to the war with Wutai&#x2014;and conducting an investigation into the mass desertion. The ones assigned to the mission are Zack, Angeal, and the 1st Class hero who is known the world over as Sephiroth...   What truths lie behind Genesis's disappearance? What secrets bind the three SOLDIER 1st Class operatives? For Zack, a cruel and fateful struggle awaits...","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"A PSP must-have","reviewText":"Like many gamers, Final Fantasy VII was my first exposure to the world of RPG's. While initially it wasn't my favorite genre, I grew to love it and while I don't consider it the best in the series, there's no doubt just how memorable and nostalgic and even influential the whole game has been. But ever since X got a sequel, Square just loves revisiting their moneymakers and among the \"Compilation of Final Fantasy VII\" titles, Crisis Core is the latest and it easily beats the seriously flawed Dirge of Cerberus. With fun gameplay, great graphics and for once, a good story, Crisis Core is bound to be well loved by RPG fans or of the series and the original.Story: At the beginning, it's 7 years before the events of the original and you play as 2nd class SOLDIER Zack who's sent to Wutai to investigate the disappearance of 1st class soldier Genesis. Along with mentor and friend Angeal and the legendary Sephiroth, Zack finds out about the reason for Genesis' disappearance and I don't want to say anymore because not only is it engrossing but the ties to the original are quite interesting.Graphics: Even though it's tiny, the PSP has managed to create some of the most stellar graphics seen on any handheld and Crisis Core can probably win the prize for the best so far. With cutscenes that are Advent Children quality to the character animations and in-game cutscenes which kind of resemble Kingdom Hearts, these are some of the sharpest and vibrant looking visuals on the PSP. Only complaint is during battle missions where some of the environments look kind of bland but that's okay.Sound/Music: Remixing a couple tracks from VII, these are probably the most successful musically with many themes being quite faithful to the originals but changing them enough to give them a different spin. From the Aeris' theme redo which has more acoustic guitars to the Opening/Bombing Mission which strangely I prefer here though for nostalgia reasons, nothing beat the opening movie back in '97. Voice acting is slightly divided since it's not really lackluster bad and it even works many times though some might not like it if you've ever heard English dubs for animes.Gameplay: Strangely, Crisis Core seems to be a combination of Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy XII and even Crystal Chronicles for the Gamecube. Solely playing as Zack, you traverse the areas and opening chests and eventually you'll enter battle mode where you control who you hit based on where you're looking. Get enemies close enough and one attack can hit everyone and attacks can be blocked and dodged. For your other attacks, pressing L or R scrolls through your available materia which can range from the frequent fire, blizzard and thunder spells to special attacks like steal or jump dragoon-style. Pressing O resets it to Attack which comes quite in handy and is much better implemented than Chronicles was. It's not really repetitive since it wasn't just \"press attack all day\" but button-mashing can help though it's easier to use your brain and spells too.Aiding in your battling is the Digital Mind Wave (DMV) which is basically a slot machine where character portraits have to be lined up 3 in a row which will correspond to a certain attack. For example, getting all 3 Sephiroth's will bring a Omnislash-esque move while getting 3 Tseng's from the Turks will have a Highwind-style air raid. Also, a number will show up and can yield unexpected benefits such as no MP cost or AP cost, prompting some free spell/attack spamming or Invincible, invulnerability to attack or magic and some will even level up your materia and getting 3 7's in a row gets you to level up. It sounds confusing but once you figure out how it works, it's very easy to figure out how to use the benefits to your advantage.Where the game might find some criticisms is in its combat which can be quite repetitive and the bonus missions aren't really that involved and they're usually just \"defeat monsters, get prize\" types. The other thing is most of the music that isn't directly from the original is not really that exceptional and after awhile, it kind of grates. But the story which is way more interesting than the Cerberus game and seeing familiar faces or references throughout is more funner.I'd very much recommend Crisis Core even if you haven't played the original. Though RPG's may not be everyone's cup of tea, you should definately try it out anyway.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0017HPE7E","description":"Transformed and unleashed, Sonic races to save the world...and himself. Sonic the Hedgehog is on an adventure unlike any other. Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience. Merging blistering 2D action with meticulously rendered 3D environments, players race through intriguing locations across the globe as Sonic to save a chaotic world.The other side of SonicSonic and his alter ego Werehog.View larger.Collect rings for Ring Energy.View larger.Swing into action with Werehog.View larger.A NewSonica New StoryOn a quest for world domination Sonic nemesis Dr. Eggman has managed to steal the chaos emeralds once again and this time drained them of their power. As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new proprietary &ldquo;Hedgehog Engine,&rdquo;Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other next-gen technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"Turtle502","summary":"Looks great, but isn't too fun to play; too much going on","reviewText":"I'm somewhat indifferent about this game - there are many things to like, but also many things to dislike.The game has three components - an RPG-style component, a daytime 2D/3D platforming component, and a 3D nighttime combat and platforming component.  There's a \"world map\" that enables you to decide where you want to go next, and within each location there are RPG \"villages\", which contain \"entry stages\" from which you can actually access the \"acts\" and play the daytime/nighttime acts.  Each component actually works well alone, but together, it's really a mess. It's difficult to figure out what you should do next.  The goal is to traverse these villages, entry stages, and acts in order to put the planet's pieces back together - of which there are seven.The daytime levels are brilliantly designed.  The graphics are superb, and the speed at which the levels move is absolutely amazing. In these levels, Sonic is basically \"on rails\" - sometimes Sonic has more freedom and can move in three dimensions, but usually you get pulled into a 2D platform in a 3D environment. These levels involve classic Sonic platforming - moving from left to right. Unfortunately, this doesn't work as well as you would think. Sonic moves really fast, and anytime you start a new daytime act, you don't know what is going to appear to the right of the screen. You'll hit things a lot, you'll miss jumps and dive off things a lot, and you'll fall into water a lot. If you miss a key jump, quite often the platform loops back and you end up replaying areas. There are also \"quicktime\" events - button sequences that you must press in order to reach certain areas.  The camera in these acts is static, and you can't move the camera to get a better perspective on where you need to go next.  For the most part, you need to memorize the board, and execute moves based on your memory. It's trial and error - you may die a couple of times trying to get past a certain spot, but once you do, you'll be faced with a new set of sequences to memorize.The nighttime acts involve combat - you encounter enemies, you throw punches, kick, jump, and execute combos. This component actually works well and is probably the part of the game I enjoy most. The problem is that these levels also involve platforming (like Tomb Raider: jumping from ledges, poles, etc.) that unfortunately isn't well implemented. The controls are somewhat sluggish - especially when double-jumping. You also can't place the camera where you need it most. The most challenging task is walking across balance beams - this requires pinpoint accuracy that just doesn't work well because the camera is often at Sonic's side rather than at his back.  The nighttime acts also suffer from an insane number of enemies - way too many at times. Checkpoints are annoyingly spaced, and when you're killed, you end up replaying multiple battles multiple times to the point that you're ready to twist your controller in rage.It's important to note that the game still utilizes a \"lives\" system. You have a certain number of lives, and as you die while trying to complete a certain act, eventually you'll exhaust your lives and will be sent back to the entry stage containing that act.  You'll have to start that act again, regardless of your checkpoint position. This component is extremely annoying considering that the game sends you back to the entry stage with the same number of lives you had before you started the act.  It is also an outdated idea - instead of stopping the game, let the player play.In addition to rings, Sonic has to collect \"sun\" and \"moon\" medals. Collecting enough of these unlocks other acts within stages, but sometimes you can't proceed in the main story unless you collect a certain number of medals. This ultimately means replaying daytime and nighttime acts over and over until you find more medals. And some of them are creatively hidden - making them really hard to find. Considering the speed at which the daytime levels move, this can become quite a chore.Another odd feature - the player controls day and night. This means that you need to decide which acts appear in which stages. The are multiple ways to change day to night and vice-versa, but this too becomes a chore and is tedious, since the game stops to reload the level. The RPG gameplay changes as well depending upon the time of day, adding another layer of confusion. You can't possibly master this until you've completed at least 50% of the game.The story is OK, but the characters get really annoying. \"Chip\" flutters around Sonic constantly and yells out single words that will annoy you within hours. The RPG elements require reading text - most other games use voice-acting, so reading text seems old. The music for this game seems uninspired, dull, and repetitive. The cinematic CGI sequences are really well-done, however, and the CGI graphics are some of the best I've ever seen.This isn't entirely a bad game. Great graphics, great sound, interesting story. From a technical perspective, it's good, but from a \"fun\" perspective, it's below average. The number of things that you need to control, collect, and do is overwhelming. The developers tried to put entirely too much into this game. If they had removed the RPG element, leaving the daytime and nighttime acts as a linear story (like old Sonic 1 and Sonic 2), it would have been much more fun.  And that's the issue with this game - it isn't particularly fun; it's just frustrating at times.I never once found myself wanting to play this game, and it's the first game I'd ever considered not finishing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2008"}

It is pretty much a multi-player only game, and it doesn't do a whole lot to differentiate itself from other online shooters.  It's a good game don't get me wrong.  Maybe it was just all of the hype that caused my expectations to be high.  This game was hyped up to be revolutionary, but it's more evolutionary in my opinion, and the game itself doesn't have a whole lot of substance or value.With that said, considering it's essentially free (over 16GB download) the overall package is pretty decent.  Just hope you don't get a unit like my launch unit where the disc drive made grinding noises.  Fortunately my replacement unit works fine so far.Another alternative is the PC version if you have a decent system.  It doesn't require much -- a mid-range build will run it with better framerates and better image quality than Xbox One.  I have played both versions and the Xbox One's framerate dips into the 40's a lot of the time, and sometimes even into the 30's (look at Digitalfoundry at eurogamer).  The framerate was much on the PC I was playing on, which was running a Radeon R7 250x ($100) and a FX-6300 CPU ($120); running at 900p with similar settings to the Xbox One.  Framerate is important in a 'twitch' shooter like this.I also found that the PC version was a bit less buggy than the Xbox One version.  There were a few times where the game was briefly a slide show.  Fortunately this didn't happen during any battles and it was quite rare.  Seeing as how a few reviewers mentioned this (ie Giant Bomb), apparently I'm not alone.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2014"}

There are plenty of great games that are actually worth buying, unlike its predecessor, the Sega Saturn. The Saturn is still a good system, but great games on it can cost $70 upwards such as Magic Knight Rayearth, Albert Odyssey, or the infamously priced Panzer Dragoon Saga that goes at a whopping $400! There are excellent titles on this system such as Sonic Adventure 1-2, Evolution 1-2, Grandia II, Skies of Arcadia, and quite a few more. Sure, it was not able to compete with the Gamecube, Xbox and PS2, due to financial trouble on Sega's part from poor sales of its predecessors, but is a plethora of great games worth playing on this system, and they are reasonably priced, since they had good print runs, despite the system itself being short-lived. The VMU was quite innovative for its time, considering that it can tell you many different things, such as the character's status, the amount of time spent on a particular game, and so on so forth. Though its life span was very short, much was accomplished in such a short amount of time, releasing games that were quite ahead of its time as they always had.

The second time I was into the game about an hour and a half and for some reason I got stuck in place and couldnt move around. I could look around , swing my sword , cast spells but just couldnt get out of that spot. I then just turned the game off put it back in its box and put it in the drawer with the rest of my games.Well about a month later and my friends telling me the game had been patched I gave it another go. I sure am glad I did. I would have been missing out on what has turned out to be one of my favorite games. As far as I can tell all of the glitches have been patched because the only thing that happened while I was playing was a little lagg for just a short minute.Once I started playing again and really got into the game I just couldnt stop playing. It is just that good. I absolutely had Skyrim on my brain no matter where I was. just like right now I am at work typing this review. From the two main quest lines to the side quests with the guilds this game is just plain fun. I never got board with this game. If I wasnt on some quest I was collecting materials to build new armor and weapons. My favorite armor build was the Ebony armor with the Nightingale hood and those upgraded to legendary. I posted some pics of my armor on amazon so check those out. I think in my humble opinion that that is the best looking mix of armor you can get. That Nightingale hood just sets it off.This is a late review as I have completed the game and the dlc expansion Dawnguard. I have maxed out my character to level 81 and am waiting for the release of the next dlc. Since I have completed most things in the game I decided to go back in time and bought Oblivion and have been playing that. I must say Oblivion is no slouch because that game even dated as it is is amazing as well. I could keep rambling on an on about Skyrim or even Oblivion but I will put this to an end.If you were on the fence about this game just go ahead and take the plunge because you simply wont regret it. All of the patches have fixed this game completely , you shouldnt run into any glitches. The dlc Dawnguard and Hearth fire are simply amazing. I just cant say enough good things about this and dont have the time right now so just go ahead and get this amazing game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2012"}

I've played 3-4 mech games over the years from pc to xbox. This has got to be the top of the line. The graphic and physics are superb. The single player a bit short, but very educational and it takes you through the entire gambit of all the different general types and roles of mechs as used in the game. Honestly, it really is just a glorified trainer for online play and if you don't have a Gold membership online the game is pretty pointless. I can't imagine having a 360 and not having a gold account though.The real strong suit of the game is online play. While there are an apparently infinite number of pop-up messages and alerts with information I really didn't find useful, once you get through those you're golden. You can be a single player and do match-ups or you can join a squad. That's where the game really shines. Develop and use squad tactics with all the different types of mechs that you can build.The amount of customization you can do is really amazing. It's really a game in itself. It's easy to use and fairly intuitive and supports folks who just want to slap something together quickly or folks who want to watch and compare stats on various pieces of gear.There are currently somewhere over 300 unique parts each with a unique size, weight, attachment option, durability, heat generation, etc. Each of these parts can be placed in a dizzying array of orientations. Weapons often have multiple types of ammunition available with options to carry extra ammo at the expense of weight. Chassey units (wheel, biped, tacks, etc) all have weight limits, top speeds, rotation speed, etc. while cockpits have a set number of devices you can attach, internal power supply, various degrees of armor, etc. Cockpits also support 3 types of modification chips that let you trade off statistics between tying together multiple weapons in a single trigger pull, top speed and acceleration boosts, aim and cockpit stabilization, etc.To really get a feel for the game you have to pay attention to the details on the parts, but for the beginner it's easy enough to just build and shoot. You can even spend your mech $ earned in battles to buy pre-configured mechs. You can also spend your money (which honestly comes flowing in pretty easily and is almost always in abundant supply) on upgraded parts or even enter a lottery for experimental parts that are given away daily.You have control down to the paint jobs, camouflage patters and a nice selection of customizable decals to polish off your masterpiece.Once you have your mech put together you can select from a number of ongoing battles to drop into with your squad and match up either against the computer or human opponents. Eventually you'll learn to pick your map and battlefield situations to best suit your mech's capabilities. Then you work out a battle plan with your squad members.Graphics are superb as you would expect with the 360. Of course it's not perfect, but pretty darn good where it counts. Online play is amazing as far as mech games are concerned. It's not as fast paced and nerve twitching as say Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, but it's 110% cool as far as mech games go. IMHO there's a LOT more strategy involved in Chromehounds as opposed to something like GRAW.Oh, to the DarkDan who commented that he couldn't find the menu options he was looking for in the middle of a mission, he's right, you can't access some options in the middle of a mission but if you hold down the BACK button on the controller for 3 seconds your mech will self-destruct and end the mission so you can exit the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2006"}

Nice Lost Levels throwback too!","reviewText":"For Mario's Wii debut Nintendo decided to take their most famous character and send him where no plumber has gone before . . . into deep space!  The main game play of SUPER MARIO GALAXY features Mario running around small planets, space debris, water levels, and other colourful Mario themed levels.  This is a very long review, so the Intro pretty much tells you what I think and the Overall Information on the Game goes into more detail on the game itself-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------INTRO and Purchase Recommendation:Although the game is great, if you should buy it or not really depends on if you have gotten the superior sequel, SUPER MARIO GALAXY 2.  For the first two and a half years of its existence, SMG was an unequivocal  title which if you wanted to have the best that the Wii offered, this was the title for you.  Like any main entry in the SUPER MARIO series, Nintendo has put all their efforts into making one of the best titles around, and as evidenced by the almost unanimous reviews from professional gaming critics.  That all changed in the summer of 2010, when Nintendo released SUPER MARIO GALAXY 2.SMG, along with a handful of other titles (including Zelda's TWILIGHT PRINCESS) have been released as a series of budget line titles called \"Nintendo Selects\", which exclusively features a physical red box.  These titles are normally priced under twenty dollars and quite frankly a steal.However, if it comes down to purchasing SMG or SMG2, go with SMG2.  Please refer to my SMG2 review for more information on that title, but overall everything SMG does, SMG2 does bigger and better.There are a few design choices that are rather strange to me that I want to note here rather than the general body of the information section.  First, to get all possible stars, you have to beat Bowser FOUR TIMES.  Yes, four.  Not that Bowser is particularly difficult, but really, four times? And it's the same battle and stage.Overall the power stars are not overly challenging with one notable exception: the Dread Nought's Secret Star.  While SMG2 has \"The Perfect Run\" which is intentionally exceptionally intense, the Dread Nought's Secret Star isn't even a major stage.  Instead, you have to blow up six piles of rubble for a Gearmo using bombs, and you only have 30 seconds to do so.  Only problem is there is a several second delay from when you throw the bombs to when they blow up.  It is by far the most frustrating star in the game, so much so that I wanted to punch whoever designed that star in the face.  It's borderline impossible, it's that difficult.  And then the Gearmo gets mad at you that you didn't clear the trash.  I'm like if you gave me more time or this wasn't such a stupid star, you'd be done! [Extremely frustrating and not even remotely fun.]A close second is Boo's Bone Pen Star where you have to collect 100 purple coins in a MINUTE.  While in SMG 2 after you get all 100 purple coins and you are on a time limit, the time limit will stop and you can go collect the star.  Not so in SMG.  After getting all 100 coins, the timer is still going, so you can get the necessary coins and still lose. [Extremely frustrating and not even remotely fun.]  - Another quick purple coin star is when Gusty Garden star \"Purple Coins on the Puzzle Cube\" [on a Cube Box]  -Also, after beating SMG with Mario you are given the option to beat it again with Luigi.  While it's a nice game style change, it's not really much of a difference - just the same with slightly different play control.  And you have to go through that if you want to get all 121 stars with both.  While I'm not detracting for the game for this, it just feels like Nintendo was adding artificial length to the game.  The first time I beat the game I didn't play through it again with Luigi for a few months, because it wasn't that important to me to get all 121 stars, given the fact the 121 star was just a purple coin walk in the park that I saw on Youtube.Although I've read lots of reviews that SMG2 could never have the same impact as the original (due to all the main ideas that make SMG2 so brilliant were first introduced in SMG) , ultimately SMG2 wins out every time.  Yes, SMG is what first introduced us to the Galaxy style gameplay with gravity, physics, planetoids, etc, and all SMG2 just expands the template and builds on the foundation already laid down by SMG (which is very true), SMG2 is just so bloody great it makes you want to cry.  Absolutely amazing.Still, the original SMG is absolutely amazing, even though it is now outshined by its sequel.  Although there are individual stars and galaxies here and there I prefer in the original SMG, over all SMG 2 is the better game.  Fortunately, though, if you have the fundage you can get both of these absolutely classic titles!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall Information:The game has a lot of motion controls built into it, which is quite suitable for the Wii.  By spinning your Wii controller Mario does a spin move.  There are also things called Pull Stars, where you most point your Wii controller at the pull star to activate it, which will make Mario go in that direction.  There are also bubble-blowing, where you use blow Mario around with a blaster while he is encased in a Bubble, a Star Ball where Mario stands on a ball and you have him roll around a course by positioning the Wii remote in certain angles, and Stingray surfing where Mario rides a  stingray on a water course.Mario also collects \"Star Bits\", which can be used as ammo but comes in more useful as food for \"hungry Lumas\", which are stars Mario encounters on the way.  By feeding these Hungry Lumas a predetermined amount of Star Bits, Mario will unlock previously locked levels.SUPER MARIO GALAXY, like its previous predecessor SUPER MARIO 64, is built around collecting Power Stars. The main goal is to collect sixty power stars so that you are able to have the final showdown with Bowser.Like Princess Peach's Castle from SUPER MARIO 64 and Delfino Plaza in SUPER MARIO SUNSHINE, SMG features a hubworld called the Comet Observatory.  There are seven main areas in the Observatory: tThe Gate (one galaxy and one Hungry Luma galaxy), the Terrace, the Fountain, The Kitchen, the Bedroom, the Engine Room, and the Garden.  Each of these areas with the exception of the Gateway feature multiple galaxies and one Hungry Luma galaxy, as well as a Bowser themed level boss level.  As you proceed, through these stages and earn more stars, you will gain Grand Stars (which are in the Bowser levels).  When Mario starts out there is not enough power to bring all the areas online, so each time Mario earns a Grand Star, power is added to the Comet Observatory, unlocking another area that can be explored (much like Peach's Castle was locked).Overall, the Comet Observatory can feel overwhelming and awkward to navigate, which would explain why in SUPER MARIO GALAXY 2 Nintendo completely did away with the hub world and instead did an overworld linear map similar to SUPER MARO BROS. 3 and SUPER MARIO WORLDThere are 42 galaxies in the game (six fewer than its sequel), of which there are ten twelve unlockable galaxies and [thirty two] thirty main galaxies.  There are seven Hungry Luma galaxes, the final boss galaxy where Bowser is at, and the three trial galaxies which are challenging courses involving stingray surfing, star ball rolling, and bubble blasting, and then the Grand Finale Galaxy.The galaxies themselves are highly inventive and feature remarkable gameplay.  There is everything from honey themed galaxies (to tie in Bee Mario) to deep space battle station galaxies to ghostly galaxies to tropical galaxies to desert galaxies and fire/ice galaxies and even a tory galaxy and a sugary candy galaxy.  Each star in the galaxy is clearly defined and the player never feels a loss at what to do next.  Overall the game is very intuitive in leading the player to the next goal without holding the player's hand, which is one of the hardest balances to obtain in game design these days.As far as linear gameplay, both SMG and SMG2 are more linear than SM64 and SMS.  One of the things I loved about SM64 is the ability to obtain pretty much any star at any point that was available in the level (with very, very few exceptions to that rule).  Those days are gone, largely because depending on what star you select there are changes made to the galaxy layout and design.Although there are 120 stars in the main game, in reality there are really 90 main stars, with 30 additional stars being \"comet stars\".The comet stars will begin appearing after you have beaten various galaxies.  There is also a special type of comet (the Purple comet) which, when it appears, means you must collect 100 purple coins spread throughout a level.The other type of comets are all repeats of stars already played, only with some extra criteria included.  There are daredevil runs (Mario only has one hit), speed runs, Cosmic clone runs (where Mario or Luigi races his clone), and double-time runs where everything is sped up to super speeds.Although the comets are largely fun, with the exception of the purple comets, they are all repeats of previously featured content, which doesn't make the game feel as long as it should be had Nintendo come up with new stars to come up with the 120.To get the purple comets to appear you must defeat Bowser. Then, after getting all 120 stars, you must beat Bowser a second time, which will then unlock SUPER LUIGI GALAXY, where you play through the game as Luigi.The Luigi mode of SMG is very much a LOST LEVELS throw back.  In the 1986 game Famicom Disk System SUPER  MARIO BROS 2 (THE LOST LEVELS), you can play as either Mario or Luigi.  If you play Luigi, he jumps higher but does not have nearly as much traction, meaning he slides around a lot.  That is exactly how Luigi plays in SMG as well.  It's nice to see such a nod to one of the more obscure (if there is such a thing) titles in the Mario canon.  Other than how he controls, there is no difference between playing through the levels with Luigi or with Mario, with the exception that Luigi's cosmic clones are MUCH MORE DIFFICULT than Mario's.  The underwater race in BEACH BOWL GALAXY will have you SWEARING, it's that much more difficult.After defeating collecting the 60 stars with Luigi, defeating Bowser, getting the purple comets to appear, then collect the other 60 stars, you then beat Bowser again with Luigi.  After doing so, you then unlock the Grande Finale Galaxy, which is the 121s star for both Mario and Luigi.  Don't expect anything epic though like SMG2's insanely masochistic \"The Perfect Run Level\"; the Grand Finale Galaxy is just a boring purple coin hunt, not even challenging.  Actually you'll have a hard drive even getting hurt in the galaxy it's that easy.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Boss information and  Power Ups [Over all information regarding the game]There are 15 bosses in SUPER MARIO GALAXY, with several being fought more than once.1. Dino Piranha (fought twice)2. King Kaliente (fought twice)3. Bugaboom (fought once)4. Megaleg (fought once)5. Kamella (fought three times)6. Tarantox (fought once)7. Topmaniac (fought four times)8. Bouldergeist (fought twice)9. Major Burrows (fought twice)10. Baron Brrr (fought once)11. Undergrunt Gunner (fought three times)12. Kingfin (fought once)13. Fiery Dino Piranha (fought once)14. Bowser Jr. (fought once)15. Bowser (fought three times)The game features seven power ups.1.  Bee mushroom - turns Mario into a bee for short extended periods of light2. Boo mushroom - make Mario transparently so he can float through solid objects.  He will also attract other ghosts who will fall in love with him while using this power up.3. Fire Flower - the classic power up that allows Mario to shoot fireballs.  Unlike the 2D side scrollers, Fire Mario has  a time limit.  In several stages he might light torches or burn items to proceed4. Ice Flower - first appeared in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time, Ice Flowers appear in three galaxies (Beach Bowl Galaxy, Freezeflame Galaxy, and Deep Dark Galaxy).  Allows him to shoot ice balls at enemies and also turns water surfaces into ice, allowing Mario to skate across bodies of water and access areas otherwise inaccessible.  Like the Fire Flower, it has a timer5. Rainbow Star - the invincibility star from days of yore, and has a time limit6. Red Star - makes Mario fly.  Only appears in the Purple Coin challenge in the Gateway Galaxy and in the hub world of the Comet Observatory.7. Spring Mushroom - turns Mario into a bouncing spring.  This can be challenging to control as Mario is constantly jumping while using this powerup.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2011"}

Nintendo's Wave Bird isn't the first wireless controller ever brought  to market, but it's a whole lot better than what came before. You may remember a  brief fad a few years ago with spotty infrared devices. These units failed  because they were a lot heavier than standard controllers, and also because they  required a direct line of sight between the controller and the infrared  receiver. The Wave Bird is much lighter (it weighs a bit more than a regular  controller) and uses radio frequency signals for reliable game control at  distances of up to 20 feet. Unless your playing on a stadium-size TV screen,  that should be more than enough. The unit will last for about 100 hours of use  on just two AA batteries and has 16 channel frequencies, so you'll easily be  able to hook up four controllers without interference.","reviewerName":"William J.

Excellent competitive multiplayer and some of the best co-op ever.Cons: The gameplay hasn't changed significantly from the original games and can seem overly familiar.

There are 42 games collected here.  Most (if not all) of them you'll be familiar with.  Much like games such as Brain Age, it's addictive, simple and has a long lasting appeal.With all these games it's a question of which one you want to dwell into first.  18 of the games are card games.  All of which are divided into different categories.  Basic, intermediate and advanced.The basic games are as follows:Old MaidSpitI Doubt ItSevensMemoryPigThe Intermediate games are as follows:BlackjackHeartsRummyPresidentSeven BridgeLast CardLast Card PlusThe Advanced games are as follows:PokerTexas Hold 'EmNapSpadesContract BridgeIn addition to that, there are also a set of basic and advanced board games.The basic board games include:CheckersChinese CheckersDots and BoxesHasami ShogiReversiConnect FiveGold AttackThe Advanced board games include:ChessShogiField TacticsLodoFinally there are nine variety games for you.  These games are:Soda ShakeDominoesKoi KoiWord BalloonBalanceBillardsBowlingDartsTakeoverIt's a long list of games to be sure, but they'll certainly keep you busy for a while.  Also, it's very important to keep in mind that these games are given their correct names.  For example, you've probably played \"President\" but it was called \"A-Hole\".  \"I Doubt It\" is basically \"Bull****\" and \"Last Card Plus\" is basically \"Uno\".  So even if the names don't look familiar, you probably do know most of these games.  And the good news is the rules are exactly the same on the Nintendo DS as they are in real life.  If, however, you find a game you're unfamiliar with, you can easily view the rules.  They're explained in a simple and easy to understand way.  Needless to say, you'll be playing all games with the stylus.The variety of games is great.  But what fun is it without some competition?  Or without some friends to play?  There's some AI here, and the computer is fairly competant.  You can adjust the difficulty setting, but on some of the more advanced games such as Chess, even setting the computer to a high level might not be enough for a pro.  So instead of playing some games against the computer you might want to consider playing against some friends.  Only one person has to have the game in order for multiplay to ensue, and it's quite fun.  Perhaps the best part is taking the game online.  Play online with friends or against people worldwide.There are some games that can't be played on multiplayer at all, but it's nothing to get to jumpy about.  Of all the games only five them don't function with multiplayer.  So there's still a nice variety.There are minor problems with this game.  The only things that really annoy me are all focused around gambling.  For starters, you can bet while you're in the negatives.  If you gamble all your money away, you'll find that you can still be in the game.  It's great that you can still play, but it gets annoying when say... the person with the most money makes low bets and folds every time just so that you stay there.  Also, some games don't utilize their full potential.  In Texas Hold 'Em, for example, you can't go \"All In\".  At all.  Also, in Blackjack, you can't split at all.  Minor setbacks, but it does detract fro the game somewhat.Okay, so the game is probably not as fun as sitting down with your buddies and playing some real poker, but this collection is exactly what the Nintendo DS needs.  It doesn't look great, but there's a lot of good quality here.  So place your bet and get this game.The Good+Tons of games to choose from+Easy to learn games, and tons of familiar games+Playing against friends is fun+Nintendo Wi-Fi enabled+Easy touch screen controls+Along with there being tons of games, there's a wide variety of themThe Bad-The negative bankroll.

To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise.

The games are long but interesting, you can replay them countless times, and now it's online too!First, the game is fun for kids and adults. There's a fair amount of humor that will go right over kids' heads, that adults will laugh their heads off of. There are all sorts of references to Aliens, Halo, and other pop culture events. There are also many references to the previous two Ratchet and Clank games, so I highly recommend you get those and play through them.The graphics are really great in a cartooney way. The characters seem quite lifelike - far more than in some pseudo-photorealistic games I've played recently. It's a testament to the talent of the animators of this game. You really do come to be quite fond of the various characters involved.The weapons are simply BRILLIANT and now each one has four levels of upgrade, which makes them change in appearance and improve in functionality. You have lava guns, electric arcing guns, mini-turrets, and my favorites, the little doomie robots. Actually, each weapon is my favorite in certain situations. That's the brilliance here - every weapon can be really a lot of fun.The levels are all plotted out with their own look, feel, music, indigenous monsters, you name it. It is truly amazing how much this affects game enjoyability. Other games I've played recently had music that was lovely, but just didn't fit the mood of the level. It really makes a huge difference to have that done well.Because you can go back to levels and gain more bolts, look for secret bonusses, find the titanium bolts, use your magnetic shoes, etc. etc., there is always room for more fun. This isn't a game that you play through once and put on a shelf. It's just as much time the second or twentieth time through the game, blasting away with your zappy electric gun or setting loose hordes of doomies.And let's not forget the plot, which is full of laugh out loud comments and great, sly comments. This game just has everything you could want.But there's more! The brilliant addition with Up Your Arsenal is the online gameplay. If you become a super player, not only can you kick through the game with ease, but you can take your gameplay online and find out just how good you really are! All of the great weapons and graphics are there for your enjoyment!A must-buy for PS2 fans, 5/5.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2004"}

For example, Mario's archrival, Wario he's looking good on the Game Boy Advance, but he's still the same money-crazed hooligan who starred in some of the greatest handheld platformers of all time. This time around, the story of a golden pyramid is enough to send the big blowhard racing off to the nearest jungle. Sure enough he finds the big brick triangle, but before he can collect the loot he'll have to undergo a brain- and body-bending series of challenges. Four guardians stand jealously over the four sections of the pyramid. Wario will either have to defeat each guardian or activate a switch and escape before time runs out.

The depth is incredible. While on foot, you play as one of five specialized classes (assault, medic, scout, antitank, or engineer) with varying equipment and abilities. The choice of vehicles ranges from a selection of tanks, jeeps, and other fairly standard mechanized land vehicles to exotic craft like battleships, submarines, and dive bombers.

I tend to enjoy single player games so Battlefield 1942 (BF) for me doesn't beat the classic first person shooter (FPS) storyline games likeCall of Duty: Game of the Year Edition,Medal of Honor Allied Assault Deluxe, andBrothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30. The single player campaign basically allows you to play the multiplayer maps in order with the computer AI controlling all the other soldiers. The gameplay is the same for both multiplayer and single player. If you get killed you respan at your selected control point, the objective usually being kill enemy soldiers and capture enemy control points in order to reduce their starting tickets (points) to zero. Even for multiplayer, I prefer more strategy type games likeCompany of Heroes. Some strategy is required for BF because while you have unlimited troops, time is limited especially if you have less control points than the enemy. Also if you do not play as a team you tend to get torn to pieces by your opponents.Some negatives: In single player, on maps with any pinch points, your teammate AI tends to get slowed down with vehicles doing circles (even with support to AI all the way up). The game crashes on me occasionally when loading missions (usually after playing several missions). You can't see if you hit anything with the sniper rifle as zoom in is removed when you reload. Check the reported kills to see if you hit or scan the field after you reload. Similar it is hard to tell if you hit with bazooka due to smoke trail unless you shift your position (kind of annoying if you cover doesn't allow it). There are countless odd glitches during combat especially around vehicles (these don't disrupt game play much though). Environment not destructible and destroyed vehicles and troops disappear (these items would take more memory).So what makes all these people rate the game so high. BF has lots of features that the other FPS don't have. BF allows you to employ vehicles in combat in multiplayer. You can jump into jeeps, tanks, airplanes, ships, artillery turrets, and fixed machine gun nests. This makes gameplay interesting. The other important feature in BF is the ability to specialize your infantry between assault troops, snipers, anti-tank, medics, and engineers. In this way you don't just pick up different weapons on the field of battle, you get to pick your kit to suit your mission or role. Each have their abilities and weaknesses, but as a combination they are stronger.I would also note that even though this is very old title there is still an active multiplayer community. I was able to jump right into a multiplayer game with a large group of other players with no lag. If this game does interest you, you should getBattlefield 1942: The Complete Collectionwhich comes with two Battlefield 1942 expansions,Battlefield 1942 Expansion: The Road to RomeandBattlefield 1942: Secret Weapons of WWII Expansion PackandBattlefield: Vietnam.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2013"}

With the past few installments delivering well on the Playstation 2, many PS3 owners have been anxious for their debut on the great video game. Nevertheless, it hasn't all been smiles. With the spinoff Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks The 80's, it really didn't click definitively with die hard Playstation 2 fans. But, the PS3 has that opportunity to make it its own into the well-dedicated franchise with the latest installment of the Guitar Hero franchise, and it will, it will definitely rock you!Guitar Hero III: Legends Of Rock for the Playstation 3, brings the latest installment of Activision's great music game as it debuts for the PS3. The game brings out a lot when it comes to great rock music. The game includes a special wireless guitar for the PS3 which works well with the game. The graphics and sound really deliver well into the game. The latest installment also includes some new features into the game like boss battles, which fair well, but don't completely shine with just 3 bosses, unlike the rest of the game. The standard features are here like the previous installment with multiplayer action improved, as you can compete with others online, as well as co-op mode. The songlist also shines better here as well with Rock classics like Barracuda from Heart, One by metal gods Metallica, the traditional Rock N' Roll party anthem Rock N' Roll All Night by Kiss, and other interesting surprises here like the Beastie Boys Rap classic Sabatoge. The control works well with Playstation 3, as you strum your way with the specialty PS3 guitar, and the fun works quite well, as you bring out your inner rock god. There are also a few added features here, as you can unlock specialty venues and faceplates that you can customize your guitar with.All in all, Guitar Hero III: Legends Of Rock is a great buy for the Playstation 3 that really is worth the money, and a mostly well-delivered debut for Sony's latest console.

The collector's edition is totally worth it as well.The game itself is a nice homage to Stephen King, and while it borrows heavily from the survival horror genre, it's tense, never horrific or gory. The plot is sort of confusing at times, but I like that it makes you think, as opposed to simply being \"Badass Cop fights evil corporation and saves the day and gets the girl. the end\"The graphics are very good, the voice acting is great, it's only a teeny bit glitchy (mostly camera stuff but for whatever reason I can look past that) and the fighting mechanics are par for the course.I will say that the product placement in the game is totally obnoxious though.

{"product_name":"B000038IFX","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"Retro Review: Xenogears is a Classic","reviewText":"There are games that we play once and never touch again. These games fade into history with little thought or attention. Then there are games like Xenogears which fall into another category: classics. A type of game that people will still be playing for years to come. Legions of fans exist for games like Xenogears that keep interest alive and well in internet forums and chat rooms and even Amazon review pages. So after 10 years I decided to revisit Xenogears, the classic PS1 RPG.The most striking thing about Xenogears is how well the game has withstood the test of time. For being over 10 years old the graphics are still competent and actually quite good. The CG sequences show Squaresoft's flair for jaw-dropping sequences. A chill ran up my spine reading the introduction to the game: \"I am the Alpha and the Omega\", \"The beginning and the end\". Truly epic words that mark the beginning of an epic game. The game itself is a composite of sprite based characters and polygon based backgrounds. Everything is colorful and well rendered considering the age of the source material. The biggest feat in my opinion is that the environments are completely 3D, you can freely rotate the camera for a better perspective. Contrast that with Final Fantasy titles that features mainly static environments and cameras.The storyline is as complex and mature as Square games get. You'll start with the main chracter Fei Wong, who lives in a small village and remembers nothing of his past short of small flashbacks. What unfolds is a world changing storyline that's a cross between A Brave New World and the Christian Bible. A game like Xenogears makes you wonder whether what you know as fact is really just that. I don't want to spoil anything by going too much deeper so I'll stop there but anyone interested in a deep story will absolutely love Xenogears.Gameplay is centered around traditional Japanese RPG turn-based mechanics. Though your characters control more like a fighting game than a RPG. Characters can execute combos that require inputs of button presses. The combos are initially hidden and the more you fight the more combos you can unlock for each character. Magic is of course present in the game and the various characters have their own specialty, whether attack magic or healing. By far one of the coolest features is the extensive use of 'Gears' in the game. Gears are in essence giant walking mechs a la Mechwarrior. Gears are combat multipliers that make absolutely devastating attacks. Throughout the game characters will use gears at an increasing rate and the gears play a central role in the title.The in game musical score is in my opinion one of the best of any Squaresoft game including the heralded Final Fantasy series. The musical tracks can at times be haunting when a particularly poignant scene is taking place or riveting when in the midst of combat.So why then only 4-stars for Xenogears? Well there are a few problems with the game. First, Xenogears features various platforming sections throughout the game. None of these sections control very well and can be frustrating when repeated missing jumps and having to trudge your way back only to miss the jump again - all while constantly battling off enemies. Second, Xenogears is a 2-disc game though the entire contents of the 2nd disc feel rushed. It's almost like Squaresoft rushed the development process along of Xenogears halfway through. You'll go from playing the game and experiencing the set pieces first hand to reading about battles and story elements via in-game dialogue. It's a dramatic turn in the game that isn't wholly welcome. This shift doesn't ruin the game but it's disappointing because of what could have been had the game been fully developed.As of this writing Xenogears has not yet made it to the PlayStation Network Store. Though hopefully that will change soon so more players can have access to this incredible game!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2010"}

Plain and simple. I was done with all the massively multiplayer games. Especially fantasy themed ones.My girlfriend had been playing this one for a while though, so one day she decided to just pick up another copy for me so I could give it a try. Reluctantly, I decided to play it for a few minutes so I could say \"see, it sucks, just like all the other ones!\". But I haven't gotten to that yet, because I am still playing! My character just reached level 20 (after just over a week), and I am hooked!What is so different about this game? Well, I am not really sure to be honest. For one, I like the quests a lot better than in other online games. None of them seem auto-generated, but instead, the game has some 2000 quests that you can do individually, one after the other. It is much more like playing an offline game than the stupid level grinding nonsense the other games make you go through.The game does an excellent job of guiding you through the world. The first quests start out easy and you stay in your starting area. You level up quickly and get stronger. Then, you get your first quests that make you venture out a bit further. It seems that every time you just have seen enough of a certain part of the world, the game takes you by the hand and guides you into the next part of the world that is quite different than the one before.Of course, you are free to go wherever you want and meet whomever you want to talk to. But every time you are about to get lost or do not know what to do, the game guides you into a new fun area. As I said: It is kind of like progressing through an offline game.You also get a good sense of accomplishment. While in other online games you \"are just there\" and the greatest thing you accomplish is leveling up, here, you take care of more meaningful quests and move along in your story line. Where other games feel like glorified chat clients with a gaming element thrown in, this feels more like a game that happens to have other people whom you share the world with.Well done, Blizzard!So what's the catch? Well, there are some things I do not love. While I like the game world, I hate the UI. I challenge everyone to explain to me when you right-click and when to left-click. And I am a programmer myself for crying out loud! I should be able to figure it out. Of course, you can learn the UI and after a while, you won't mind, but still, it is not all that great.There also are a few other problems. Graphics bugs, characters locking up, that sort of stuff. And they had their share of server problems, which strangely, nobody seems to give them much of a hard time about. I guess there is a certain bonus you have, when you are Blizzard.And then there are a few game-play things I am not crazy about. Fighting monsters is a bit mathematical IMO. Sure, you influence a lot based on your spells and abilities and stats, but there are certain points, where you just can not win. If you happen to get into the middle of a few monsters (perhaps because they re-spawn right next to you), then you might as well kill yourself. Especially when you are a low-level character without any special speed-abilities, you don't even have the option to run away, because the monsters will always catch you. Not fun.Overall, these are minor issues. If you like online games: You will love this one! If you hate online games: Give this one a try! You might change your mind...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2005"}

I was kind of leery to get this game because I thought it would be like Splinter Cell. I know, I know, Splinter Cell was a favorite to many but it was too slow for me & it emphasized stealth too much. I'm also going to tell you I'm probably older than allot of you. The last Metal Gear installment I played was on the 8 bit Nintendo Entertainment system back in 1989. Wow, allot has changed since then.. The graphics in this one are AMAZING!! This game is much more fun because you can get in the middle of battle if you choose to which is more action. The weapons store is also a big plus because there is a large array of weapons you can buy. I love the shotgun by the way LOL.. The cut scenes are long, but entertaining. The plot is good & the voiceovers are good, so the lengthy scenes are ok to sit through. It's pretty cool how when a character is introduced in the game how it states their name & the name of the voice actor/actress. Just like a movie. The controls are tight, but to a person picking up the game they might be a little slow accessing the menu & the items if you are in the heat of battle. I fumbled around a bit, but it will get better as I get through the game. The only thing I don't like is there is no jump button, but you have to use the special action button to climb up on things instead. But no biggie, I'll get used to that too. I wish there was a sprint button like in COD4, because Snake moves kind of slow. Maybe it's because of his illness. I must add that was a great addition to the story too. It makes the game more realistic that the hero of the game isn't some super human soldier, but a weakened tough & gritty old war hero that is smart & calculating.. He actually will stop every once in a while & have arthritis attacks & grunt in pain & grab his lower back. How cool is that? To sum it up, I have played allot of games on this console, but this is one that I can't put down. It will get game of the year as far as I am concerned.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"w r e c k l e s s","summary":"A brilliant, bittersweet end to Solid Snake's story","reviewText":"\"Guns of the Patriots\" is over-the-top, ludicrous, with a labyrinthine story that's often hard to penetrate - and it's also some kind of a masterpiece. Taking place in the \"not too distant future\" sometime after the events of \"Sons of Liberty,\" war has now engulfed much of the world. Many sections of the game (Middle East, South America) have you negotiating through warzones where two factions are engaged in battle. A later section has you returning to Shadow Moses, the nuclear weapons facility you infiltrated in the first game. As Old Snake, who is Solid Snake suffering from some kind of accelerated aging, you can either sneak by and avoid conflict or choose to aid the rebels against the PMCs. Playing stealthily is more rewarding than runnin' and gunnin', and it's possible to beat the game without killing anyone, even the bosses, whose stamina bar can be depleted instead. I especially like the boss fights with the \"Beauty and the Beast Unit,\" which includes Laughing Octopus, who attacks with long tentacles while blending in with the environment, and Crying Wolf, who's fought in a snowy blizzard reminiscent of Sniper Wolf. The two best gameplay additions are the OctoCamo, a high tech adaptive camouflage that takes the appearance of whatever it comes in contact with - helpful when sneaking, and a new over-the-shoulder view for aiming. There's also a neat system for collecting equipment on the battlefield, earning points, and then using those points to purchase weapons and ammo. I thought the first \"MGS\" was a singularly perfect experience whose only criticism is that it's limited by older hardware. \"MGS4\" by comparison is not perfect. Its cut-scenes will at times go on and on beyond all reason. There's a style to the storytelling that's definitely an acquired taste. I won't say it's the best in the series, but it is my favorite, and there's really nothing else quite like it.Note: Just to show off, I also earned the Big Boss Emblem with a time of 2:28:51 XD--- 5 STARS ---","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

Those games are still fun to play, but I grew up in an era when Dungeons and Dragons was the standard for role playing.  These types of adventures were more about making decisions, immersing oneself into the character's life, and of course, levelling up.Blue Dragon really does bring me back to those days when the first American role playing games available for the Nintendo were Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy.  Of course, by that time, I was already an RPG veteran, and these first generation RPG video games were exactly what I expected out of the genre.  As time has gone by, I have been very happy with the way that the genre has split off into several different directions, but I miss the true RPG's of yesterday.  Blue Dragon brings me back there.The game is extremely fun to play.  The voice acting is extremely good, and the character development is phenomenal.  The story lacks a little something to be desired, but when I truly feel for and care about the characters, that makes up a lot as far as the story goes.  However, the best part about this game is the artwork and animation.  I don't know if I've ever played a game that has ever looked better than this one.Another thing that the game does really well at is levelling up players.

Why can't I get non-rumble controllers any more?","reviewText":"Far from the fawning, doting, feverish reviews of the Dualshock controller posted elsewhere, it's time for a reality check. Whilst the ergonomics of the Dualshock are identical to the original PS3 Sixaxis controller, it's too heavy now. The original controller was fantastically light and nimble to hold - a real advance in user-friendliness and a delight to play games with. The new Dualshock feels like a housebrick in comparison. Obviously the added weight is in the motors and offset weights for the rumble feature, but it just feels clunky and awkward and a bit 1980's.The plastic is different too - the original Sixaxis had that lovely translucent plastic where you could almost see the inside of it, but not quite. The Dualshock is just plain old cheapo black plastic.On top of that, there's the battery life issue. I've had my Dualshock for two weeks now and it needs charging twice as often as the old Sixaxis controller. The odd thing is that it needs more charging even with the rumble turned off, so I'm not sure what they've done here.All I wanted was a replacement sixaxis for my original one, which because of too much Call Of Duty 4, has given up the ghost. It seems that Sony in their infinite wisdom have decided that no, you can't have that, you must buy the new, heavier, more power-hungry controller.So: gone is the lightness, gone is the next-gen look with the translucent plastic, and gone is the battery life. My advice - if you don't need rumble (and frankly, nobody does - it's a ridiculous addition that I never understood) - look elsewhere or get a secondhand Sixaxis.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2009"}

{"product_name":"B003O6G5TW","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"If You Can't Beat Them Join Them","reviewText":"I just wasn't too impressed by this game, which is the first in the Battlefield series that I've tried. The graphics are probably better than the Call of Duty games, but the difference isn't too large. The gameplay could probably be considered more realistic, where only a few shots result in your death or the death of your enemies. Consequentially I found myself being killed much more often, even when running where I was told to. In other games, when you're being shot at you usually have a chance to get behind cover or return fire, but here if you're shot at you die without being able to do anything. I just found this annoying, especially when other parts of the game stick to the genre competitors in being unrealistic. Multiple times, AI from far away would be shooting at me when they should have had no idea where I was. You still can only kneel or go prone behind a wall, and in most cases you can't shoot over or around the wall yet the AI can shoot you. Also, it still has automatic regenerating health. I really wish that it had either gone more of the fun game route, or closer to a simulation instead of floating in between. I'd love to see bandages or first aid kits come into play after being injured, and perhaps after being killed instead of backtracking to a previous checkpoint your avatar is actually dead but you take control of one of the other soldiers.Similar to the Call of Duty games, in campaign mode the enemy soldiers infinitely respawn until you \"follow\" another soldier to the next objective, which many times has you killing the enemies from a different position, but they now have a limit. The campaign is very similar to COD: Black Ops, where you have one soldier being interrogated resulting in flashbacks that you play, then at the end you break out and do something to end the story. One thing I found annoying about it though, is that for some of the missions you played as characters other than the one being interrogated, which breaks the whole narrative of the campaign. Also, they try to create similar massive set pieces to what COD does, but they fall far short of the marks the other games in the genre have set.For the multiplayer, I'm sure that if you spent a lot of time with it, it could be amazing. However, I just found it annoying and extremely complicated with a very high learning curve. For my first game, I did a quick random match, and I ended up joining a match already in progress. I chose one of the places to spawn and it was in a jet, I was offered no help with how to pilot the jet (which wasn't in the campaign mode) and I promptly crashed into the ocean. I survived though, and was way away from any land. Consequentially, I was forced to commit suicide to respawn somewhere I could actually play the game. This wasn't a good way to start a game mode I wasn't sure about. Later, after I figured out the non-user-friendly server game match system I had a little fun playing Team Death Match. But since I was a newb, just joining a random game means that I was greatly overmatched, with every opponent being vastly more experienced and better equipped. There was a benefit though, as my team almost always won since my being so low leveled the team had the highest level players in that match.One big way that this game is better than Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, is the pacing. By having multiple different vehicle and separate modes it gives a nicer flow to the gameplay, instead of just the constant balls to the wall like COD. So, I enjoyed this game, but there were so many other frustrating aspects of the game that hampered overall enjoyment.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2012"}

I wouldn't say the music was superb, but it does an excellent job by bringing out the appropriate and suitable feeling of the situation.  And not to mention much more sound channels, make sure to play this game with headphone on, you will know the difference.I think the story is pretty typical, using basic elements, fighting against evil, however, what it really pulled me into was the puzzle element.  I mean, I didn't have this much of fun since Link's Awakening for Gameboy Color, trying to figure out the puzzle.  You will be surprised because of not only traditional, well-thought out puzzles, but also some are very fresh in concept (you will know what I mean).I think Golden Sun is better than games like Final Fantasy 10 fun factor wise.  I could easily stop playing FF10 while I had to play Golden Sun again and again.  Golden Sun managed build 4 main characters with their own characteristic/personality till the end, which was very nice like Final Fantasy series, and also was able to add that essence of Dragon Warrior series, which was about finding the way to get certain item or place.  Once again, I would definitely recommend this gem to anyone who's looking for more than decent RPG for GBA.  Oh, by the way, This is the very first chapter of Golden Sun, meaning there will be sequel to it.

{"product_name":"B00002STH5","description":"It's taken a while to get here, but Nintendo's 64-bit update to the old SNES classic, F-Zero, is here. F-Zero X is a stunning achievement in that it's truly the first racing game that runs at a brisk 60 frames per second, even in multiplayer. In fact, more than anything else, it is this feature that is F-Zero X's claim to fame. Does the rest of the game stack up? Well, it depends on what you're looking for.Instead of trying to compare it to its 16-bit counterpart, we'll dissect F-Zero X purely on its own merits. After all, the bar has been raised for racing games in general over the past few years. So what does the game have to offer? Well, first of all, forget any kind of simulation aspects. This is twitch gaming at its best. Although you can tinker with the basics, like acceleration and speed, that's about all you get to do. Everything else is just about driving. Playing like a Wipeout without weapons (which was like playing F-Zero with weapons), F-Zero X's only added enhancements are the inclusion of dash plates located at various points around the track. When you run over one of these plates, you get a severe speed boost that doesn't cost you any energy (after the second lap, you get boost power that you can use at any time, but it takes away some of your energy), enabling you to blast past some of your opponents. However, they too can use these plates.That's not to say that you can't dispose of your opponents though. By using the Z-button or the right shoulder button you can either crash into your opponent making his energy meter drop, causing him to explode if his meter is low enough. Or, you can try to shove him off the track if there is no barrier keeping you in. A number of play modes are available, including practice, death race, time attack, and vs. battle. However, the majority of the racing will be done in the grand prix mode, where the cup levels await. Each cup increases in difficulty, naturally, but with each additional level conquered, more and more racers are made available to you, adding replay incentive. If you make it to the final secret cup, you'll uncover a random track generator that offers you a fresh challenge every time.So what's the problem with F-Zero X? For starters, with up to 30 different racers onscreen at any given point, some sacrifices had to be made in order to keep the insane frame rate so high. Polygon counts on the vehicles are very low, giving them a particularly uninspiring look. The track detail is also very limited, giving the track a spartan feel to it. In its defense, the tracks are cleverly designed, especially the twisty corkscrew tracks that speed by at a blazing pace. One feature that's lacking is a first-person view. If speed was truly supposed to be on display here, a cockpit view would definitely have helped, but alas, there is none to be found. Control is pretty good, although the analog stick can be kind of touchy in places, leading to a few inadvertent fender benders. The sound effects are very good and actually add to the feeling of speed in the game. Unfortunately, the music can be pretty annoying in a cheesy synthesized-metal kind of way and doesn't really add much to the whole experience.As a game, F-Zero X is certainly thorough in its execution; unfortunately, there just seems to be very little in the game to keep you coming back. Sure, Nintendo incorporated all those funky characters to give it... um... character, but the game erases all that good stuff with its overwhelming blandness. Yes, the game can be fun in multiplayer, being supersonic and all that, but the game just lacks those certain intangibles that make a good game great. Practically flawless from a technical standpoint, the biggest thing missing from F-Zero X is that it lacks a soul. It's yet another stunning update to the legendary Nintendo catalog, but it's games like this that make you wonder: Where's Metroid 64 or Donkey Kong 64? Back to the drawing board it seems. --James Mielke--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

All that sacrifice adds up though, and the framerate is AMAZING, with all  the cars zipping around at 700kmph its SOO COOL.  The graphics are meant to  be FUNCTIONAL, it is not a sightseers game, anyway, you'll be too busy  going hyperdrive to stop and look at things. The X-CUP is especially great  because it randomly generates a track every time, so you NEVER get the same  track.  Also the pure selection of cars is great, and the tracks are SO  well laid out, especially big blue (the tubing one) where you race 360* on  a tube!  It RULLLES!

{"product_name":"B0002CHJ8C","reviewerName":"W. Scott Heitman","summary":"Best Fighting Game To Date","reviewText":"OK...so there are differing opinions as to how a fighting game should control.  You have your Soul Calibur addicts, Street Fighter addicts, Tekken addicts, and a couple more.  I'm not going to convince anybody out of their respective school.However, for those who enjoy Tekken-style fighting, Tekken 5 is THE game to get.  First, the game has a roster of atleast 30 fighters- a very respectable number (although I miss Kunimitsu).  Not only that, the new characters are really cool (Raven, anybody?) both in design and play style.  In addition, all of the characters have been rebalanced.  You get the feeling almost immediately that any character can be a true monster if you master their moves.  Each character also has some very nice CG cutscenes when you beat the game with their character.I'd like to be able to say that I don't care about graphics and style, but I do, and Tekken has this in spades.  Both the character models and ESPECIALLY the backgrounds look incredible.  The lighting in several of the stages is just beautiful (reminds me of the lighting in the Prince of Persia games).Something that made a big difference for me was the music.  The music is far more beautiful and varied than it has been in the past.  Each track really brings an atmosphere to each stage, and many definitely put you in the mood to pummel your opponent.  (my favorite track has to be \"moonlit wilderness\")Finally, Tekken 5 has ALL of the modes that you would expect from a modern fighting game- team, survival, arcade, story, as well as Tekken 1, 2, and 3.  Also, Tekken has pulled a Virtua 4 and now allows you to customize the look of your characters with money earned through fighting.  Not bad at all.Overall, Tekken 5 is a winner because of 1) the balance of the characters, 2) the energizing and beautiful aesthetics, and 3) the variety and breadth of gameplay.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2005"}

The Nintendo DS/DS Lite is the most popular game console and it's pretty clear why.First, about the hardware: the DS Lite is, as its name suggests, small, light, and easily portable.  The clamshell design helps protect the two screens from damage when the console isn't being used, although obviously it's a bad idea to throw or intentionally drop it.  The bottom screen is touch-sensitive and is rather accurate; you'll want to use the included stylus (or a Nintendo licensed stylus) to make sure you don't inadvertently damage the screen.  Normal use of the stylus can scratch the bottom screen, so you may want to purchase protective filters to take the abuse instead.  Both screens are well-lit, and you can actually adjust the brightness of the screens, if you want the battery to last longer, or if you find the brightest setting to be too bright.  The built-in speakers are okay, but if you find their quality to be too low you can always plug in your own headphones.  There is also a built-in microphone, as well as a microphone jack.  The system is backwards compatible with Game Boy Advance games, but not Game Boy color or classic Game Boy games.Also, unlike Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo has deliberately decided to keep the focus of its systems on playing games.  Fortunately, the available selection of games for Nintendo DS is high-quality and varied.  You can find games for more \"casual\" players, games for young children, \"games\" for learning languages or vocabulary, and, of course, more traditional video games.  Because the hardware capabilities of the DS are roughly equivalent to the Nintendo 64, a lot of classic games from Super Nintendo and Nintendo 64 are being ported to the DS (often with new functionality), so there already is a large built-in library of excellent games available.  There have also been a number of new games which take advantage of the touch-sensitive screen, some of which do so in truly innovative ways.  The games are also quite affordable, usually costing between twenty and forty dollars.  Some of the games I've played so far on the DS are as good as the best games I've played on the computer or any consoles, period, so game developers are clearly taking DS development seriously.The DS Lite also has built-in Wi-fi and local wireless connectivity with other DS consoles, which really extends the playability of many games on the system.  (For those of us old enough to remember Game Boy, the days of fiddling with link cables are thankfully over!)  You can connect to the Internet if you have a wireless router or access to a Wi-fi hotspot, although the available features vary on a game-by-game basis.  Some games feature true Internet play, while others have more limited Internet/multiplayer features.In summary, if you're looking for a handheld with a variety of fun games, look no further than the DS Lite.  The only competitor is the Sony PSP, which is slightly more expensive, but comes with a larger range of features for general media, such as music and movies.  However the PSP and DS aren't really in direct competition, since they seem to be targeting different audiences.  I would also say that the overall quality of games available on DS is slightly higher than the PSP, and of course the types of available games are much, much more diverse on the DS than the PSP.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2008"}

It tries to improve upon the formula and that certainly isn't the best idea.  A new character is introduced but that can't save Mega Man X7 at all.The 3-D graphics aren't that bad at all in this game. Surprisingly their pretty good.  We get to watch a 3D anime scene at the start and it's pretty cool.  But that's about as far as eye-candy goes. Without a doubt more animations and such could've been put into the graphics.I can't say much for the sound.  A lot of it is pretty bad and while it hits the action notes, it just doesn't work.  The voices (in english anyway) are very horrible.  The sound effects are cool though, but that doesn't mean the sound is all that great.The gameplay almost saves this game and actually gets it the two stars it deserves.  The gameplay is simple, just like always.  When you select to go to a level you now get to choose two of three characters. Either X, Zero or the new character Axl.  You're allowed to switch between the two characters as you like. As you might have guessed, Zero is the strongest of the three and he uses a Z-Saber (Think of a lightsaber from Star Wars if this is your first Mega Man X game).  Axl is a new character who has the ability to float in the air if need be for a short while (like Peach in Super Mario Brothers 2).While the gameplay is good it is quite a difficult game, like many other Mega Man X games it takes time to get used to.The story actually focuses around Zero and Axl.  There really is no real plot in Mega Man X7, it's the same old select between eight bosses until you get to that final encounter.

{"product_name":"B001G8M738","reviewerName":"Derek G","summary":"A challenging twist for Bejeweled fans","reviewText":"I've been a fan of Popcap games for years and own quite a few, including the original Bejeweled, so I jumped at the chance to do an advance review of Bejeweled Twist.  While they are selling a retail product, there's no real difference between it and the online version as all you're getting is a box and a jewel case.  No instructions or hints are included in the retail packaging so you might want to choose a direct download if you're looking for instant gratification.  System requirements are minimal - Windows XP/Vista with a 1.2Ghz+ processor and 256MB RAM so anyone with a computer purchased in the last 4-5 years should be able to run it without a problem.Bejeweled fans will instantly recognize the familiar cosmic backgrounds and mellow electronic music but the game itself is quite different.  Instead of swapping places with two gems, the object is to twist a square block of four gems so that three or more gems of the same color line up.  Once you do so, the gems disappear and you receive points.  Gems rush in to fill the empty space and you receive additional points for multiple gem cascades like the original game.  Once you rack up enough points you move to the next level and the game continues.  Sounds simplistic, maybe a little boring, but as fans of the original know it's not always an easy process.First of all, you can only spin the gems clockwise.  As long as you clear at least 3 gems with each spin, your points multiply in value to 2x, 3x, and higher allowing you to rack up points to complete the level sooner.  You ARE allowed to spin gems without completing a row of three gems but doing so will drop your bonus points multiplier making it tougher for you to complete a level.  In addition, nasty little problem gems drop in like bombs and lumps of coal.  These can't be matched, they can only be destroyed.  Matching up a row of four gems will generate a special flame gem that can be used to destroy nearby nasties and a row of five gems will create a special lightning gem that once matched will take out all the gems both horizontally and vertically.  If that's not enough you they also throw in locked gems (don't twist), doom gems, and other tricks to make things difficult .  The special explosions are vivid and Popcap has even included a nifty instant replay feature so you can see the more spectacular effects again if you wish.  Finally, a bonus meter lists four gems in a certain order.  If you manage to complete rows of gems in the order listed (cascades aren't counted against you) you will win a special bonus.If you like Bejeweled, I think you'll find this game to be a worthy purchase but I wonder if it's crossed the threshold from casual game to something else.  It's definitely more difficult than the original and I have to admit after fifteen minutes of play on the so-called stress free \"Zen\" mode my brain was already starting to hurt.  I don't think I could handle it once all the challenging items are introduced.  Maybe I'm just a wimp but I prefer Popcap's simpler games.  Like all their games, they offer a free trial online to help you decide.  Take advantage of it as you'll be subject to Amazon's return policy (only a 50% refund) if you later decide you want to return it.Hope the review helped.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2008"}

So Dead Island should be a win? Well its not and here is why. First play of the game, get 3 (forced) hours in and dont want to play any longer because its so boring. Here is the breakdown-Open world? Yes, but who cares to search it? Nothing but water and sand. You pick up small iteams and money from the same stupid little bags all over the island.Weapons? Yes, but you feel like your 12 years old with a pencil trying to defend yourself. Its not like CONDEMNED where you almost feel like your there really beating your enemy to death. You pick up the same boat paddle over and over.Feel of the game? Terrible, like first level designers put it together! I picked up the game for 40 bucks and returned it the same day. First time I have ever rushed back to store to return because I was so unhappy with the game.Characters? Boring Boring and Boring, now that is the same with RAGE but! Its way different because the rest of the game rocks! So it makes up for the boring/dull characters.In closing, I read the reviews on here and it seemed half and half. The trailers made it look great so I figured I would give it a run. Big mistake, hated the game! One of the worst games I have ever played. Same yourself time and pick up something else. This game over all feels like first level game designers put it together. After 3 hours of game play Im still beating zombies with a boat paddle and running missons for boring characters? No thanks. Hope this helps.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2011"}

I love how they created all the movies within the games and how you could watch them over and over again if you want. What's really cool is the panel system. you get to customize roxas as in if you want his magic to be boosted if you choose the right gear or if you want to add any special abilities as in glide or haste which makes you run faster. Another thing I like about the game is the graphics. For a DS game the graphics are awesome. It's cool that they finally made a multilayer mode but you can't fight your friends. Instead you have to work with them in various missions only if you have unlocked them. oh and here is a special hint. When you unlock mission mode, be sure to have all the missions and fully complete the mission gauges. If you do, you can unlock Sora and Mickey!  So, if you own a DS then you HAVE to get this.

Raillard","summary":"There goes all my free time...","reviewText":"The first time I popped in Vice-city, I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed.  It felt, well, exactly the same as GTA3.  About 12 hours later, I must say that this is definitely an improvement over the previous version.  This game is like crack, it's so addictive!Graphics:  Slightly improved.  They aren't terrible, as some reviewers are saying, but they are as good as the last version.  It's not so much the game that is limited, it's that the hardware (PS2) is limiting, especially with a game so full of constant movement.  There are areas of notable improvement, though: the water is now transparent, and you can see the bottom, as opposed to the gray mush that was Vice City's harbor.  The sunsets and lens flares add a nice touch.Sound: Great.  The soundtrack is huge, and while I didn't love all of the 80's songs they put on, it's solid.  The game sounds are good also, especially the different engine sounds.Control:  This is my least favorite part of the game.  While the targeting system is better, the control of the main character is still jerky.  It's not smooth, and the guy feels like he can only go in straight lines and do 90 degree turns. Why can't this guy handle like characters on sports games do?Content/Replay: Fantastic.  This is the meat of the game, and it doesn't disappoint.  The game is huge, the story is good and really involving (hint: real estate!), and the voice overs are good also.  The addition of motorcycles and helicopters alone would have warranted the purchase of this game, but all the extras (indoor areas, more boats, etc) are icing on the cake.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2002"}

It brings video gaming to the next level. I will admit, this game was creative, the concept is pretty good, and at times it can be fun. But the overall gameplay is just a bit too gory for my taste. Here's what I thought after a few hours of GTA: Vice City1. The graphics: pretty good. I disagree with anyone who said this game lacked graphics. I own an XBOX and hate PS2's graphics, but I was impressed by the many things this game supports. There are dozens of cars, bridges, people, shops, trees, guns, helicopters, boats, and just about everything else you'd expect to find in a city. The world looks real and comes alive! The weather changes, and the worlds are HUGE! As much as I hated all the gore, this game definantly looked pretty awsome in every other way. 4.5 stars!2. The gameplay: ok...if u like going around shooting people to death. There's way to much blood, and the way u can just keep hitting people again and again with the bat or the gun just gets sickening. The blood is everywhere, and it really takes the quote \"Fun\" out of the game. The whole concept of hejacking various vehicles (boats, cars, helicopters, motorbiles) is cool, and swithcing vehicles again and again or running on foot was pretty cool (while trying to escape the police). You can hejack anything from regular old jeeps to Taxi's, Police Cars, Ambulances, Fire Trucks, Vipers, Tanks, and anything else out there. Once again, all this would have been fun, even shooting people...without the gore. This game could have been so much more, but instead, it's just sickening. Gangs are everywhere, FREEDOM is everything. But overall, I just didn't find it fun, in fact quite the opposite. 2 stars...3. Replay value: I can see how an extreme person might like this game, and if u can handle shooting people's head off to see a fountain of blood, go ahead. But overall, the game made me feel like a criminal, nothing else. But if u do like this kind of game, there are dozens of missions, freedom beyond your largest dreams, and cash to earn. Rival gangs and show the cops who's boss... The concept was awsome...it just didn't click for me.  And while the game really shines when your being chased by cops in a Viper, hop out and get into a helicopter, take off and watch them look up in hate, is pretty cool (while then heading off to caues more havoc), it just didn't really click with me. 3 stars...****As for parents, here are some facts if you plan on buying this for your kid: there are hookers, gore, sex, cussing, blood, gangs, etc...  This game is everyting you DONT want younger kids seeing.  Its your call, but I would think twice before buying this for a kid.  But if your older, I think they can handle it.  Just depends on what kind of games they like****Well, I hope this helped, and if your sickened by gore like me, you probably won't like this game. A sour feeling left in my mouth, I will never be a GTA fan, and will not be picking it up when the package heads to the XBOX. My friend likes it, he can like it. It justn't didn't click with me.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Shook","summary":"love the game","reviewText":"if you collect games this is a must have seriouusly this game is a must have  buy this game right now","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2012"}

Besides that I became annoyed with my old Xbox 360 as it was making too much fan noise and vibration on my table and I used pretty much all of the 120gb that it provided. Xbox 360 Slim should have helped me with that storage issue.I was not disappointed when I received the system and set it up. It indeed does make much less fan noise, even when some graphically intense games were running in a room where temperature was about 27 degrees Celsius. Transferring about 40gb of data (aside from the game installs) from the older Xbox to the new one was very fast and simple. I used the Xbox transfer cable, even though the manuals says you could use usb flash drives for that.New xbox 360 slim also has another new feature, which is optical digital audio output. I recently bought surround headphones that needed exactly that. The sound is supposed to be clearer and not have any loss. The built in WiFi can be useful too, but I use direct wired connection as the downloads are faster that way.There are few features on the Xbox 360 Slim that I don't like. The plastic used is glossy which causes fingerprints instantly. Another design feature I don't like are super sensitive buttons on the console. The on off button works by touch not by pressing the button. Same thing with disk eject button. It is too easy to accidentally open or close the box.Yea, basically buy one now.

{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","reviewerName":"D. K. Malone","summary":"Valid hype","reviewText":"No intention to do an in-depth review. I just want to say that I finished The Last Of Us last night, took me 21 hours, and I thought it was every bit as good as 'they' say. I've never been a huge Naughty Dog fan, frankly I thought the Uncharted games were mildly enjoyable and the gross fanboy hyperbole about them made me roll my eyes pretty hard. But from the first time I saw TLOU over a year ago, it had my attention. I never really pored over the previews, so it was all very fresh to me. Somehow it never really occurred to me that this was going to be survival horror. In recent years I've thought of Dead Space as the last bastion of something even remotely approaching classic survival horror (though it gives you way too much ammo and health items to truly qualify) but now I must hand the championship belt to TLOU. Resident Evil = George Romero style. Silent Hill = Stephen King style. Dead Space = Ridley Scott style. And The Last of Us would be... I guess a cross between Michael Crichton and Cormac McCarthy. It never allows you to amass enough resources to think you can handle absolutely anything that comes your way, yet it's never overly frustrating. It maintains the perfect level of tension. The crafting system forces you to choose between making more first aid kits or molotov cocktails (which are pretty damn handy.) The stealth game play, crouching and sneaking and taking down foes unawares is every bit as fun and satisfying as I thought it would be when I saw the E3 demo last year. The story and characters shine. Troy Baker has surpassed Nolan North in the Is There Any Game This Guy Is *Not* In? category, but he does a terrific job as Joel. One of the few things that I didn't like in the early trailers was that the voice actress who plays Ellie just sounds too B-level, too cartoony (sure enough when I looked her up on IMDB I quickly confirmed she does a lot of cartoon kids shows) but in the finished product she does an excellent job.The only criticism I can think of is that the load and save functions are kinda broken. When you turn on the PS3 and boot up the game to start a play session, you might want to have something to read or otherwise keep you occupied, because it takes forever. I'm not talking about the first time you play i.e. one-time system file install, I'm talking about any time. And if you dare to so much as open the save/load menu, you have to sit and wait while it spends an eternity auto-saving, just in case. That's my one and only complaint. At first I thought maybe it was just me, even though I have a PS3 Slim 500GB that's less than two months old and have had no loading issues with any other games... but I've since confirmed with friends that it's the same for them.Personally I'm not interested in a sequel to this game, but I'll keep a closer and less jaundiced eye on Naughty Dog from now on.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2013"}

I am able to run the game on max settings, my high/low fps are 77/42. You should be able to compare my system to yours and get an idea on what to expect.The graphics are comparable with WoW on max settings and the interface is similar. If you have played WoW, Rift or Warhammer you should not have any difficulty adjusting. The graphical detail of the Star Wars universe is impressive and I have enjoyed walking around to check things out.The gameplay can be summed up as WoW with lightsabers with some interesting twist. First, all NPC characters are dialog rather than text and you can choose what you say during the dialog. This is an interesting because you are rewarded with light or dark side points depending on your options. Not sure how this will play out in the long run, but the dialog is a step forward for MMORPG. The other thing that stands out is you can have a crew of NPCs. You can choose to use them as companions or they can farm/sell items while you do something else. The feature I like the most are the in-game maps,questing is much easier to follow.In the end, I am enjoying the game. I think this game has the potential to make a huge splash in the market. However, at this point it is 75% the same MMORPG format and about 25% innovation. The game is in its infancy and I hope future patches and expansions will up the innovation. If you are a Star Wars fan like I am and have the system to support the game, purchasing is a no brainer. It really does add to the expanded universe.I will update my review in the near future with more details but I wanted to get some basic information out to everyone before launch.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2011"}

So you can buy the 80 GB version or the 160 GB version and by a 500 GB plus our drive off the Internet for less than $100 and pop it in your PlayStation and you're good to go, so easy it should be illegal!2. Included Blu-ray player that you can upgrade the firmware on: When I got my PlayStation many of the blue Ray players on the market wouldn't allow you to flash the firmware so as they revised the Blu-Ray standard those players became obsolete. And my thinking is that if you spend $100 plus on a Blu-Ray player why not drop another $150 plus and get a full-fledged PlayStation that can be upgraded.3. Free PlayStation network: now it is true that the PlayStation network is free the basic network at least. Then they have the PlayStation plus network that cost 50+ a year. Now with the basic free networking of the PlayStation network unlike Xbox live with PS3 you can have a buddy list and play with your friends.

It can be a media server with simple software you can buy online: I have a Mac and use media link software (Google media link) it cost 20 bucks and now I can stream/copy movies and music and pictures from my Mac to my PlayStation 3 it's very cool.5. Offers folding@home: now this is a huge selling point but I think it's cool! Folding@home is a distributed computing project by Stanford University that deals with protein folding and uses your PlayStation to help the scientists work on understanding how these work. So when you're not using your PlayStation for gaming you can turn on folding in the life with PlayStation application and you'll contribute to helping science! (My PS3 has contributed almost 2000 work units at six hours a pop it's been working hard)PROs of the xBox3601. Xbox live is just better: while the PlayStation network is free while the basic version anyway. And allow you to do things that Xbox live won't for free the Xbox live network is just better. Simply for the fact that you can send voice messages, you can follow people who are your friends into games (great for if you want to follow a booster in modern warfare 2 and keep on hunting). The only drawback is that it will cost you $40-$60 a year (depending on where you buy your card).2. Most of the game industry and big time YouTube commentators use Xbox 360: now this is a huge factor if you want to play with the big boys. If you follow Machinima respawn and have directors on there you want a game with most of the time they're playing on Xbox 360. This to me is a large reason to get the Xbox 360 over the PS3.3. It can be a media center for free: now this is not something that I know or have done but I do believe and please correct me if I'm wrong but the Xbox 360 can stream media from your Windows PC with no extra software required (whereas with the Mac you need to buy $20-$30 software).4.The Xbox 360 slim as built in WiFi: before this slim was for sale you need to spend $70-$90 to get WiFi for the Xbox 360 and that would have been a pro for the PS3 as it has always had WiFi built in. But now with the slim with its lower price and built in WiFi this becomes a pro of the Xbox 360.5. MODz: When it comes to modding I believe Xbox has done more options available and a much larger community. From just being able to modd your controller to full on system modification the Xbox is way easier to get into (now remember mobbing your Xbox could get you booted from Xbox live and a permanent ban hammer!)So these are my five bullet points of proz for both systems. My preference is PS3 but that's because I can hold the controller best and still play with my face. And my father and brother and many friends play PS3 and don't have an Xbox. Now if I could get a PS3 shaped Xbox controller I would spend more time playing Xbox so that I can play with the many YouTube commentators that I know and love.That is my $.69 I hope you have enjoyed reading this if you haven't you must be illiterate. check out my YouTube videos and please support the custom button remapping petition that will help disabled gamers and non-disabled gamers alike.I am Chuck the Capper And I approve this message LOL!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2010"}

You decide the combat role you want to assume in the world of Brink as you fight to save yourself and mankind&rsquo;s last refuge. Brink offers a compelling mix of dynamic battlefields, extensive customization options, and an innovative control system that will keep you coming back for more.PUBLISHER: Bethesda SoftworksDEVELOPER: Splash DamageANTICIPATED RELEASE DATE: Q1 2011PLATFORMS: Xbox 360&trade; / PLAYSTATION&reg;3 /Games for WindowsGENRE: First-Person ShooterSTORY:Brink takes place on the Ark, a man-made floating city that is on the brink of all-out civil war. Originally built as an experimental, self-sufficient and 100% &ldquo;green&rdquo; habitat, the reported rapid rise of the Earth&rsquo;s oceans has forced the Ark to become home to not only the original founders and their descendants but also to thousands of refugees. With tensions between the two groups growing, Security and Resistance forces are locked in a heated battle for control of the Ark. Which side will you choose?KEY FEATURES:Not Just Another Hero&ndash; Brink&rsquo;s advanced player customization offers a near-endless combination of looks for your character &ndash; allowing for the appearance of your character to be truly unique.

Intense \"Online-Like\" Gameplay. Frustrating, yet Fun.","reviewText":"Pros:+ Huge, intense, fast-paced game with lots to do.+ Interesting story and cool over-all style to the game.+ fun, well thought out maps.+ Plenty of Options and gameplay modes. Challenge Missions are fun.+ Fun customizable characters. Outfits and character qualities are unlocked the further you progress through the game.+ Plenty of different weapons to choose from.Cons:- Very slow \"run\", sluggish movement. Control just seems lethargic.- \"Online-like\" style gameplay, even while in single-player campaign mode you still have that \"online\" feel, which I do not like.- Everything seems to have a time limit on it, which makes things a little more frustrating than necessary. However this just adds to the challenge of Brink.- Frustration and Receptiveness become a factor after hours of play.- Somewhat dated graphics. I did expect more.- AI is not great. Very easy to die. Teammates are useless.Over-all Brink has great potential. It is a huge game with many options and gameplay modes which will keep me busy for a while. This is not your basic \"shoot'em up\" game. There are many objectives and challenges which make this fast-paced game quite complicated. You have many mission objectives and secondary mission objectives which must be completed within the time limit. If you fail the mission you can still complete the level, however it will be considered as unsuccessful. You will still earn your XP points which you achieved during that level.When first starting the game you can customize your character and choose your side. You are part of a team and there is always someone else around. I somewhat dislike this as I'm a one-man wolf pack and work best when big heads don't get in my way whilst I'm trying to shoot the enemy. You earn XP points for healing fellow teammates or completing mission objectives, just as you do with many online games, and you are rated against your \"teammates\" based on the XP you earn. The good thing about teammates is they can give you a syringe to heal yourself if they are a medic. Each character has a specialty that can be changed at Command Posts throughout the level. So lets say you start the level as a soldier but the mission requires an engineer to do something at a point in that level. You can go to a Command Post and change your specialty. This is fun and keeps the game interesting, however there is usually a pretty good balance of specialties throughout your teammates and constantly changing your personal specialty is not always necessary. You can be a Soldier, Medic, Engineer or Operative. If the mission requires an engineer to do something, you'll guard that engineer teammate until they complete the objective, and visa versa if you're the engineer.The game has a lot to it and you can tell much thought went into many aspects of the game. I just hope I can get over the sluggish gameplay and dated graphics. The more you play this game the better it gets. Due to the online-feel it is quite addicting. Control may be frustrating at first, but it just takes a little while to warm up to. Brink does have something new to offer, however this is limited by the sluggish control and online looking graphics. If you are not a fan of \"online\" games then Brink may not be your cup of tea.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-10-2011"}

Uncharted seemed like a fun, graphically nice game to lose myself in. After the first five minutes of Uncharted, I was hooked. It quickly became one of my all time favorite games. Given that, know how much it means when I say that Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is better.U2 is everything the first was, and more. It's a perfect sequel. Just like it's predecessor, U2 feels like you're playing the main character in a movie. Sometimes you can't tell the difference. I agree with another reviewer when he said that U2 has wonderful character, a great story, incredible graphics, and some of the best acting (both voice and motion capture) that I've ever seen.Not only does U2 have a great single player storyline, but this time around, we get multiplayer added in. The multiplayer aspect is really good too, not just thrown together at the last minute (like I had expected it to be). It works the same as most FPSs, but from at third-person, over the shoulder perspective (like the single player game). I honestly can't find anything negative to say about Uncharted 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2010"}

From the same engine as Oblivion, another great game, this game only makes it better. On a grand scale, this is an apocalypic future where the nukes fell. The remnants of earth now scrounge through the remains of the ruins trying to eek out an existence among mutants, killers, and radiation poisoning.And it pulls this off well. The characters are stiff, the graphics are \"okay,\" the monsters are varied, and the leveling system with perks is excellent.The flaws vary. It has bad bugs. Sometimes the game will just freeze in the middle of an important event, just locking your whole system up. Sometimes the floor will simply not be there, making instant death if you try to go across.

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization.

After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists.

It's an FPS with RPG elements that emphasizes co-op play.  It's also probably the only game that can boast more weapons than you'll ever be able to use.  But more on that in a minute.  We'll start with the visuals and go from there.GRAPHICSBorderlands has an unusual art style for its genre.  The game is cell shaded, and forgoes the realistic approach that many games take for a more over-the-top cartoony style.  At first, I didn't think I would like this aspect of the game.  But it really works.  Borderlands can be a brutal, bloody affair, but it's counterbalanced by the silly visuals.  Along with the quirky humor (the game is hilarious if you pay attention) this allows it to never take itself too seriously.  It's hard to not to laugh when you get a headshot only to see the word \"CRITICAL\" in big red letters right where the enemy's head used to be.  And the level of detail is surprising, given the more unrealistic art style.  The ground of Pandora's (the planet the game takes place on) desert is littered with cracks and bumps, and the enemies and vehicles are surprisingly well crafted.  The guns often glow with power, and the elemental effects are great.  This game looks great, and the art style really pulls everything together.SOUNDThe guns sound great, explosions are satisfyingly big, and the voices are well acted and sometimes amusing.  The music doesn't stand out that much, but the opening cut-scene is, quite honestly, brilliant in its use of music.  Not much else to say here, and I wasn't listening to the music as much as playing the game...GAMEPLAYThis is where the game really shines.  There's nothing like the feeling of shooting a skag right in the mouth, or taking down a swarm of rakks, or shooting a rocket right into the middle of a group of bandits.  The controls are a bit touchy at first, but you get used to them quickly.  As you level, your power goes up pretty fast.  The game lets you know this by making lower level enemies drop to one or two bullets.  And by drop I mean destroys their entire torso.  The same is true for higher level enemies, though.  If you move to fast without leveling up enough, you'll quickly be destroyed by the much more powerful baddies.  I never had much of a problem with this though, although I occasionally went to the wrong place and ended up running for my life.The core of Borderlands is the loot.  As I played, my main motivation was to level up, and to find better guns.  The story is fairly forgettable, although it did make me laugh several times.  But the guns...the guns are awesome.  There are literally thousands of guns, although a lot of the variety is just slight variations between similar guns.  There are several different categories of guns available to use: sniper rifle, shotgun, revolver, repeater pistol, smg, combat rifle, and rocket launcher.  Although within these categories there can be oddballs.  For instance, I found a shotgun that shot rockets.  (It also set people on fire, but that's neither here nor there.)  I also found a sniper rifle that did above average damage but had no scope.  (It was appropriately named the Elephant Gun)  Some guns have elemental modifications so that they can deal fire, lightning, corrosive, or explosive damage.  You can also use grenades, but even these have several variations.  My personal favorite was the grenade that leapt up and rained fire down on my enemies when thrown.Besides the guns, the most lethal weapon on Borderlands is your character.  You can choose between four classes: Hunter (the sniper), Siren (the stealthy one), Soldier (self-explanatory), and Brick (the brawler).  Each character has their unique action skill.  These include a bird of prey that attacks enemies, a turret that shoots at foes but can also heal and grant extra ammo, the ability to enter another dimension to escape danger, and a berserker rage that has you dealing damage with your fists.  In addition to each of these skills, each character has three skill trees that emphasize one aspect of that character.  For instance, the Hunter can focus on either sniping, pistol combat, or enhancing his pet Bloodwing.The best part about Borderlands is the co-op play.  You can play splitscreen, with friends over Xbox Live, or with random people in matchmaking.  And all the fun of single-player is increased exponentially when the number of players goes up.  Each time another person joins the game, the difficulty scales up, but the loot gets better.  And co-op allows a little more trial and error, as players can heal any teammate who goes down.  In addition, since the individual characters are so varied, playing with multiple people allows you to cover the weaknesses of your particular character with the strengths of another.  One problem I had with the random matchmaking is that of loot sharing.  Strategically, keeping everyone well equipped with appropriate loot helps your chances of survival.  Realistically, MINE, MINE, MINE!  There is no in-game system for distributing loot, so it becomes an honor system.  Which turns into the fastest player getting the best guns, and the team players getting shafted.  When playing with friends this problem disappears, unless your friends are jerks.REPLAY VALUEPlaying through the game the first time, you can realistically expect to get to around level 35.  However, at time of writing, the level cap for the main game is 50, and the third piece of downloadable content increases this to 61.  To attain these higher levels, you are allowed to replay the game with the same character, except this time the enemies are all much higher level, and the bosses are even harder.  While the story is the same, you're not playing Borderlands for the story, you're playing for epic guns.  And as the enemy level goes up, so does the quality of guns.  Also, leveling up further lets you max out more of your skills.  Achieving level 61 allows you to max out two of the three branches on your skill tree, making your character that much more well-rounded and awesome.In addition to the second playthrough option, Borderlands currently has four dlc packs.  While I haven't played through all the dlc yet, it's worth noting that they add many extra hours of play time, and the third dlc increases the level cap.  In addition, they provide even higher enemy levels, which results in even better loot.PROBLEMSBorderlands is by no means perfect.  There are probably between twenty and thirty different types of enemies that are repeated throughout the course of the game.  Some more variety would have been nice.  In addition, most guns are very average and boring, and will just take up room in your inventory until you sell them at one of the conveniently placed vending machines.  Good loot is included often enough to keep the game from getting boring, but it can get repetitive sometimes.  The ending is also somewhat of a letdown, but again, the story is not why you play Borderlands.  And if you play singleplayer, the game can get a bit lonely.  Borderlands was designed to be played with several people, and it shows.  But most of these complaints are minor, and don't take away too much from this game.BOTTOM LINEBorderlands is a great blend of first person shooter and roleplaying game components.  The variety of guns and modifications, along with the ability to completely customize the skills and powers of your character, let each player find a role that they enjoy.  But the best part of Borderlands is the ability to play through the game with friends, so much so that I hesitate to recommend this game if you don't have at least one friend that will play with you (although my first playthrough was entirely singleplayer, and I still had fun).  And that is why I have to give the game four stars.  In short, if you're a fan of other first person shooters, but have wondered why you can't shoot acid rockets at mutated dogs, then this game is for you.  But if you're a lonely misanthrope with no friends (and no Xbox Live connection) then you may want to look elsewhere.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2010"}

{"product_name":"B001COV1CY","reviewerName":"Matt","summary":"Love it!","reviewText":"*****UPDATE***** I am edited my post as a the result of 10 or so hours into this game. Although my following comments are true in regards to graphics and such I give this game HIGH remarks in terms of concept and game play. If you're looking for a little more from your FPS, check this game out.I actually got so excited for this game that I went and bought a PS3 to get back into the gaming world. (I was a decent PS2 user about 5+ years ago and really wanted to get a BD player so this was an easy choice with the recent slim pricing model.)Pros - Different than other first person shooters in that it's much more tactical. Great concept game with 256 player maps. A fair amount of player customization with different voices and faces, could be more, but that's something new that Call of Duty doesn't have. You can actually progress to leadership positions in the game and set various objectives for the team (not that anyone listens or cares.) Also seems to have more a mature following unlike MW2. This is major win in my opinion. The idea of any more 12 year old kids yelling at their Mom to bring them dinner in the mic or saying \"Did you see Did you see..., I got him in the face...haha..did you see\" makes me feel ill. It's refreshing to play with adults (I'm 30 and yes I'm still playing video games.) It's also a PS3 exclusive, which I guess means it has Sony's backing?Cons - Seems to still have a fair amount network and server issues. During the first day of this they took the servers down for \"maintenance\" which is TERRIBLE timing on their big day. There was also a lot of \"hopping around\" during the larger battles when the screen seemed very laggy and jumped around a lot. The next point is a bit of a touchy subject because I know most will refute this as \"not important\" but this is a review so I'm going to be honest. The graphics are poor..., I mean original XBOX/PS2'ish. Honestly, I'm sure they had to make some trade offs to have a 256 player battle, but it just looks a little rough in my opinion. Also, PMC's seem a little unbalanced and weapons seem a bit off. e.g. firing a rocket launcher into a room rarely kills everyone in the room, you pretty much need a direct hit as if it was a sniper rifle. Raven is supposed to be \"advanced\" with their weapons, but seems to have equipment that is much like sling shots. SVER is supposed to have less money but more \"heart\" and their weapons seem MUCH easier to kill with. (By the way, I've play ALL PMC's for an hour or so.)Overall thoughts - I have only played two shooters on the PS3; COD - Modern Warfare 2 and MAG. Both games are different in their objectives. MW2 is fast paced and seems to have move smoother cleaner graphics. It's 1080p and pumps out 60 frames per second. MAG is only 720p and the standard 30fps and honestly \"feels\" a little loose. Lots of jagged edges and I actually have to get up stand in front on of my Sony 40XBR TV that's wall mounted if I have any desire in actually sniping. I'm not sure if it's the choice of colors in the maps or the sub-par graphics. The controls also feel slow and loose which you can fix in the settings but still doesn't have that crisp FPS feel I had found in MW2. I did actually have the chance to play a 256 game and yes, there was lag. The game itself is comprised of 3 distinct \"PMC's\" or Private Military Corporations all competing for work. SVER-the punk, bad boy team, Valor-the traditional American soldier with some twangy country music and Raven-the hi-tech (or so they say) team with the latest weapons that don't seem to do much in the way of actual damage. In the 256 game I played, my squad got absolutely pounded by SVER which has a clear weapon advantage with the strength of their weapons. They're weapons are MUCH easier to use and seem a lot more powerful. If you get the game and are used to high kill/death ratios in MW2, do yourself a favor and stick with SVER. Getting kills is a heck of a lot easier. I've played all three PMC's and finally settled on Raven because I kind of like being the under-dog, and yes Raven is the underdog in this world. As for lag and server issues, well the first night the servers mysterious went down for \"routine maintenance\" in the middle of the game and kept giving me a message saying they always go down between 4am-7am EST, yet it was 9pm EST?? !??!??? Sometimes in gameplay it will randomly say \"unable to respawn\" for minutes at a time. I spent nearly 10minutes trying to join a game earlier today.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2010"}

All the critics claim that the Force is weak in this game and common enemies are too hard to kill. I really think that could be further from the truth. Some enemies are hard to take down, but you can walk into a room of ten stormtroopers and throw them all against the wall with one action! I think it's very well balanced.The camera does occasionally pick a bad vantage point, but it's pretty minimal. The controls respond great. This was another negative point the critics made, but I've yet to see it. Maybe I'm just not a great enough gamer to be aware of the subtleties of gameplay, but I know a good game when I play one and this is one of them.The physics and graphics are among the best I've seen. Throw a heavy object at a tree and watch the bark tear off. Throw a REALLY heavy object at a tree and watch the tree smash to the ground.

{"product_name":"B002Z7BE24","reviewerName":"R.A. McKenzie","summary":"Solo Players Should Get The Standard; Multiplayer Is Golden","reviewText":"I'll review the \"Resident Evil 5\" game at the end of the review.  I want to address this Gold Edition for new buyers.Simply put, I think getting the original standard release is the better buy, especially if you're not going to play this game online.  If you're only going to use the single-player options, the bonuses that you're getting from this Gold Edition are:* Extra Costumes - who cares?* Online Versus Mode - you're not going to use it* Updated Mercenaries Mode - it's not that big of an upgrade* Two Bonus Episodes - these are solid 1-hour add-ons, but not worth the extra moneyLet's address the two bonus episodes.  \"Lost In Nightmares\" and \"Desperate Escape\" were originally downloads that are now being included on this disc.  They're fun extras, but they're not worth 20 dollars if you're playing offline and/or alone.  Similar to the bonus content in \"Resident Evil 4\", these are fun diversions, but not must-play experiences.If you're a multiplayer gamer, jump right into this Gold Edition.  There is a ton of content for you to enjoy.  But offline users would be better served to get the original version of \"Resident Evil 5\", which (as of this writing) is only 20 bucks.  Everyone should play this game, but this Gold Edition was meant for co-op or versus play.The Gold Edition is also compatible with the PlayStation Move.  I haven't tested the Move with anything, but if it plays as well as I've heard from a few others, then that's really the only catch for single-player gamers.  Personally, I'm willing to bet that most gamers prefer a controller in their hands.GAME REVIEWAs for \"Resident Evil 5\" itself, there's really not a whole lot to say.  It's basically \"RE 4\" in Africa with co-op elements.  That's not to dismiss the hard work that went into this game, but it's a very similar experience.  The over-the-shoulder gun combat hasn't changed, and the animations aren't that different either.  Enemies will stumble, attack, and fall very much like they used to.  You will upgrade your weapons, manage your inventory, find treasures to trade in for cash, solve simple puzzles, and try to survive a truly intense experience from start to finish.Where \"Resident Evil 5\" takes a strong step forward is in its co-op gameplay.  Franchise hero Chris Redfield is joined by Sheva, an African agent who tries to solve the mystery of how her homeland has been taken over by a virus.  Whether you're playing alone or with a friend, the two characters will have to work together to solve puzzles and strategically take down enemy attackers.  While the AI for 1-player could be a little better --- Sheva always uses the handgun first, and doesn't condense inventory well enough --- it's still a great experience no matter how you play it.  The inventory management isn't done through a pause menu; you'll have to exchange ammo and health herbs in real-time, while you're fighting to survive.  Sheva does a good job of keeping herself (and you) alive, only faltering in a few forgiveable instances.The only areas where \"RE 5\" failed to surpass \"RE 4\" are in its plot and atmosphere.  I'm not gonna call \"Resident Evil 4\" a brilliant story or anything, but it was remarkably well-told, and you were mostly aware of where you were trying to go.  In \"RE 5\", Chris & Sheva pretty much have the same goal from start to finish, making any detours in the plot feel like excuses for more action.  As for the African setting in \"RE 5\", not only is it less interesting, but about halfway through the game, it didn't even feel like I was in Africa anymore.  Crypts, laboratories, and fortresses don't exactly look African.  In \"RE 4\", the Spanish flavor was constant, from the small villages to the religious cult architecture.\"Resident Evil 5\" establishes its own identity through the African backdrop and through constant action.  If you're looking for the chilling scares and horror of \"RE 4\", there's not a lot here.  Quite frankly, \"RE 4\" was a terrifying experience with a great blend of action & horror.  \"RE 5\" skips the horror factor, and goes for balls-to-the-wall action.  But make no mistakes - These two games are very different in style & tone, and they deserve to remembered for their own merits.  To compare this game to its predecessors is nitpicking.  Fans of action gaming must play \"Resident Evil 5\", pure and simple.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2010"}
