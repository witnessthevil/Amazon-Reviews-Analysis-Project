{"product_name":"B006WQR3GA","description":"","reviewerName":"M. DiSpirito \"mentored1\"","summary":"Niche Masterpiece!","reviewText":"Greetings folks.  First off, XCOM will not appeal to everyone and I'll wager it will turn off way more than half of the console gaming audience.  Do not think it is an action-oriented game, because it's not; do not assume it is real-time or run-and-gun gameplay, because it's not; and never, ever assume you can walk a pre-determined path and just shoot everything in the way, because you'll end up burying all your soldiers.XCOM is turn-based strategy game.  If you had the pleasure of playing the original, you'll notice some familiar elements here.  Other games that bear a resemblance are Heroes of Might & Magic (building the base, sending out forces, upgrading capabilities), Operation Darkness (not so well-known but an excellent turn-based game), or a PC game such as Age of Wonders, Disciples, or Fallout Tactics.  If you unfamiliar with any of these, I'd liken XCOM to a science fiction-themed tabletop wargame.  In any traditional boardgame, you take turns doing something; XCOM's tactical battles play out in this fashion, with the player moving their units one at a time across a battlefield.  This tactical element is only half the game, however, and the other element (also turn-based, or paused while you make decisions) is a strategic setup.  You'll need to build a base, research technology, outfit and train troops, and protect the nations of the world from alien threats.Sounds like a lot, huh?  No worries, because XCOM has a fantastic tutorial that introduces you to each part of the game step by step while you play.  It's not a boring spectator tutorial; you get to jump right in the action and make decisions while the game tells you the implications and consequences.  Some people find turn-based games boring, but I don't see how this game would work if you were rushed; some of the decisions you have to make in this game could literally cost you victory or defeat.  Think things through and be sure before you hit the button to confirm.PRESENTATION: the graphics remind me of a tabletop wargame played with toy soldiers; the environments can be destroyed, burned, etc making for a great experience; the sound is excellent.  Overall, it's enough to enjoy the experience without slowing anything down.  There are some graphical glitches, such as soldiers shooting through walls instead of around them, but I haven't encountered anything that I'd call a 'bug' as far as game-breaking or otherwise (just some visual anomalies).GAMEPLAY: though it will vary for all players, I found Normal difficulty to be quite challenging later in the game (when more powerful aliens start to appear in larger numbers).  I played a 16-hour marathon (hey, I waited almost 2 decades for this game) and I failed to defeat the aliens--don't take this game lightly!  Every small decision counts, even if it seems trivial.  The controls are easy to learn and very intuitive.  The marriage between the global strategy and field tactics is well-done and keeps you wanting to play turn after turn.>>>> One of the most powerful gameplay elements I experienced revolved around the soldiers.  They come from many different countries; they look different and talk different; they have names and nicknames; and when they die, they are gone forever, remembered in a memorial shrine in the XCOM base.  It is heart-breaking to have a veteran soldier die because of a bad decision or overwhelming enemy forces and realize he's been with you through 20 missions and survived where others have died.>>>> One such soldier I'll share: Moses \"Preacher\" Adeju, a support troop from Nigeria.  He fought through 18 missions, pulling other soldiers from the jaws of death (he was a highly trained medic), and died under a hail of alien guns while trying to save one of his mates.  I guarantee you'll have many stories of soldiers you've hand-picked, named, trained, and equipped as you play through XCOM.STORY: the story reminds me of an X-Files themed Battle for Los Angeles; there are plenty of tense moments when you don't know what's coming and the action sequences feel just chaotic enough to make you hold your breath when you fire off a shot or move your squad member out of cover (exposing him to fire).  The developing alien invasion doesn't take over the game, which I think is smart; the star of the game is you, the player, as you manage your base and forces.  The story elements are interesting but not overboard and just enough to keep you engaged and wanting to play.CONCLUSION: If you have any interest in cult sci-fi / alien-inspired games, this one is a gem; if you enjoy turn-based games or tabletop games, this one is worth a look.  There is no possible way you will only play this through once, so the replay-ability is high.  XCOM is challenging, engaging, and has enough depth to draw in beginners and satisfy veterans.  Most importantly, it has that \"just one more turn\" feeling that keeps up you way past when you should have gone to bed--and that makes it worth every penny.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2012"}

While the Lego video games don't necessarily have the greatest level design, I can't deny the fact I find these games incredibly fun.  The fact that you can co-op through these games makes it all the more fun.Indiana Jones was an excellent trilogy to bring in Lego format.  Though since they've progressed with this stuff... I kind of want to see a Lego Aliens/Predator series; I think that would be amazing!  Anyway, experiencing Indy in Lego format was great fun.  Basically if you've gone through the Lego Star Wars stuff then you already know the name of the game.  Playing the game in Story Mode can actually be pretty difficult, even for two people.  Once you're done that you get the chance to go through the game in Free Play, and for me, this is where the game really shines.  You get to use an array of different characters and you get to explore the maps for lost treasures and other hidden items.  I don't know what it is about doing this, but I find it incredibly fun.  I think the Lego games are a nice break from the usual fairly serious games I play like Half Life 2 or Mass Effect for example.Some of the levels are a bit frustrating, but I've come to expect that when dealing with Lego developed games.  They also hide some of these items very well, so they are quite a challenge to find.  The hours of game play you get out of this makes it rather worthwhile in my opinion.I really don't have much to say on this game other than if you've already got experience with Lego Star Wars, you know what to expect.  If this is your first Lego game, don't get too frustrated, they don't make the puzzles completely obvious.  In the end I had a lot of fun; however, I still wouldn't rank these types of games as the top games ever made.  They're just a lot of fun while trying to get through them.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2009"}

The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword shakes up the tried-and-true adventure game formula and marks a turning point for the series. Link embarks on a sprawling adventure through the skies and across the continent when his childhood friend Zelda falls from their floating home in the sky beneath the clouds to the mysterious continent below.

The puzzles are just challenging enough to be rewarding, but not so much as to disrupt the fun factor. The characters are beautiful and the environments are even more beautiful. The whole game looks like an impressionist painting, albeit one painted by pretty near-sighted artist.Of course it's a great game, most of the games in the Zelda franchise are but this one is padded like crazy, to the point that it interferes with the flow of the game. What do I mean by padding? I'm talking about things that cause the player to wait and, in very small increments, extend the total number of hours played in order to make the game feel like a longer, more epic adventure than the content alone would allow. In controlled doses padding is an integral part of the game and is quite necessary. In Skyward Sword I fear they've cut decency to the quick, however. For example:You can't skip cut scenes. Fortunately it takes quite a bit to kill you so you won't necessarily get stuck watching the same cut-scene 50 times, but still... not being able to skip it is annoying.You can't skip text boxes, and can just barely speed up text: all characters communicate via speech bubble and the text is animated to appear on screen as if written by a typewriter. You'll frequently read faster than it types. You can't skip this even though you may have seen the same text a number of times, which is a common problem.repetitive text boxes: no matter who you're interacting with, there seems to be a standard flow of 2 blocks of repetitive, inane stuff that the character says every time, the menu(s to choose what you want to do or buy etc, 2 more blocks of inane repetitive text, then finally you can get back to adventuring.repetitive item descriptions and instructions: every time you turn the system off it will reset which descriptions and instructions you get when you happen across collectibles and bugs. You may have 99 hornets, 57 amber relics and 89 butterflies in your inventory, but if you've reset the system the game will stop everything and give you another text box telling you what you just picked up if you run over another one.Poor \"quick\" navigation system. You can't just pick a spot on the map and teleport there as in other Zelda titles and pretty much any open-world game worth its salt, instead you have  to return to a bird statue, return to the sky, turn around and fly back into the area, then pick which spot you want to land in.All in all it's a great game. I highly recommend it. It's beautiful and the motion controls are integrated superbly. The feel of the game, though is not unlike that of wading through deep snow or a swamp of some kind.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SZD18","reviewerName":"Just Trying to Help","summary":"Not the best value, not the best games, but a noble effort...","reviewText":"The OUYA console is a nice little console, but, hard to take very seriously.  As you read through the reviews of the console and the controller you will find some interesting details.Unlike other consoles, a lot of the buyers for this console aren't actually using it to play OUYA games.  They are using it for XBMC (media center) or as an emulator to play older games.  There are other solutions on the market to do this as well.  Its interesting that the first impulse for many OUYA owners is \"not\" about OUYA games.  And those people are really enthusiastic about that, but, they aren't talking about buying an OUYA for the OUYA gaming experience.I've tried 6 or 8 OUYA games and From that perspective, this console is just ok.  Most of the games in the store have pretty weak graphics.  Its a bit like playing iPhone games on my TV, except, the graphics aren't really as good.Value: Consider this: an OUYA controller costs $50, half the price of the console, and if you wanted 4 you would have to spend $250, which does not make the OUYA a bargain compared to other systems. ($99+$50+$50+$50).  At the time of this writing an Xbox with 3 wired controllers (not an option on the OUYA) would cost $200+$25+$25+$25 and thats $275.  For $30 more you can have an Xbox with 4 wireless controllers.  Personally, I only have 2 wireless controllers for my Xbox plus 2 wired ones, as I don't often have 4 people around.  And a wii Mini is only $129 and comes with 2 controllers,Nintendo Wii Mini Console (LIMITED EDITION) + Bonus Wii Remotemaking it actually, you know, cheaper than a OUYA plus 1 remote.  But don't tell anyone that dirty little secret.So I can't put the OUYA into the \"bargain\" category at this price.  Yes, it costs less than a Wii Mini by $30.  Yes, an OUYA with 4 controllers costs less than an Xbox with 4 controllers by about $30.  But its not earth-shatteringly cheaper because the game quality is lower.In addition, when you set up the OUYA you must have:1) A wireless internet connection2) An email address3) A credit cardThis is the first console where these are requirements, and it in OUYA's defense, it couldn't be any other way.  But that doesn't mean its a great thing to have to pony up all that on startup.  In fact, I feel it limits its mass market appeal significantly, making it more of a niche console than before.  I can't just give one to my 10 year old nephew, but he did get an Xbox as a gift.When it comes to the OUYA, you are just getting what you pay for.  And that shouldn't be confused with a \"bargain\" or \"value\".The Controller itself also has a touch panel at the top which is similar to the panel on the playstation vita, which I also own.  Its also like a touchpad on a laptop.  But I found it to be overly sensitive and it hasn't added to my enjoyment when gaming, while it has certainly has added to the price.  Its a new console, so, I guess some risks have to be taken.I like how the controller has one AA battery in each side, it weights the controller nicely.  But the OUYA controllers are very expensive for what they do.  I don't find that the controller plays particularly well.If we assume that you aren't going to hack your OUYA, then, the only question left is: \"Do you want to spend $100 to play app-store quality games that you could play on your (name a device here) anyway?\"  Thats really the question, and the most common answer I saw before i bought an OUYA was, \"Yes, I want to play app store quality games on a big screen TV\".  If that answer stirs up a rousing cheer from you, then by all means buy an OUYA.  But that won't do it for everyone.We live in a world where media just doesn't die - whether its NES games being played on emulators, Spy VS. Spy being played on iOS, or World of Goo proliferating to every platform once it was successful.Games are ubiquitous as air these days, whether you play on your iPod, your 3DS, your computer, your Xbox or your OUYA.  The video gaming market is becoming more complex, not less.  One thing you can be sure about, is that you certainly won't miss anything by passing up the OUYA today.  I hope it grows into a cool console, but its really not there yet.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2013"}

Well, by played, I mean she kicked ass and I flailed around like I had something wrong with me. Regardless, it was a fun time. My biggest complaint was that we had to take turns during the multiplayer and it would really screw me up if I was actually getting into the groove of a song (if that makes sense).Thankfully, Dance Central 2 solves that niggling problem for me. The character models/graphics/gameplay are all roughly the same, just some very slight improvements. The menu system is a little more intuitive which is a really nice touch as well. Another plus is that you don't have to buy the same songs over again, for a small fee you can simply import all of the previous DLC you bought (for a small fee, of course).If you don't have the original Dance Central or you love to play the multiplayer, I'd say to absolutely pick this up. If you're having fun with the original and are pretty good at it, I don't think it's really worth the incremental upgrade at full price. Harmonix is notorious for incremental upgrades to their games (Rock Band, Guitar Hero), so, that's something to keep in mind when you're weighing this decision.Also, for those achievement hunters out there, be sure you can shake it before you buy this, I've really had to come to terms with not 1king this and the original :p","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2011"}

Now I want to the guy who wrote that deceitful review and find out how much he was paid for it.I returned it the very next morning. I'd put maybe fifteen minutes into it the night before, and ejected it in disgust.This game pretends to have character customization. It'll let you shorten or lengthen your character's arms and legs, and give him muscles. That's about it. Oh, you can change hair color. There are a couple styles, but they all pretty much look alike. And that's it.I thought maybe it would redeem itself--after all, Fable could be rather linear but it was great--but when I watched the first cutscene I groaned. It was terrible. I could tell someone spent all of five minutes on it before shoving the product on the shelves in the hope of making a few bucks before gamers caught on. The characters looked wooden and the voice acting was the worst I've heard in years. The writing was almost as bad. Imagine characters who sound like they're reading words off a medical chart while going out of their way to sound medieval.Example:\"Hail, my lord! Art thou the bounty hunter that wast summoned by mine village elder?\"\"Aye, that be I. Where be thy village elder that I mighte speakethe with himeth?\"And so on and so forth. It's friggin' painful. And the subject matter is so incredibly generic I can't...actually, that about does it: incredibly generic.In the first dungeon--which I think is supposed to be a tutorial--I encountered two enemies. The first in the game! Ask any gamer--the first enem(ies) a game throws at you are always set up to be impossible to lose to. The game just wants you to get your feet wet, test the controls.Not here. I died seven times trying to kill the first enemies in the game. Two hits from them was enough to kill me. It was like the game accidentally dropped me in the final dungeon instead of the first.Finally I managed to kill them. I don't know how, because the controls are so loose it's nigh impossible to keep your crosshairs on the target. Pure luck, and lots of respawning nearby. Oh, I forgot to mention that--that's six or seven deaths with my cumulative damage still on those two baddies. If this was a foreshadow of the kind of ridiculous imbalance I'd see later on, it was a bad, bad sign.My next challenge was opening a locked gate. I found my lockpicks on the menu (the horrible, horrible menu) but couldn't figure out how to use them on the gate.The menu graphics look like they were imported directly from a Sega Genesis. It's half impossible to tell what things are in your inventory, and all of the menu commands are counterintuitive--except looting. I figured out how to use potions. That was a major victory.This game pretends to be like Oblivion--hence that schmuck's comparison I mentioned--in that there's an overworld with several locations you can find and explore. Also, you can buy a horse. And that about does it for those similarities--but I had to mention them, because the game throws them in your face.I'm very glad I only rented this and didn't purchase it.

During the course of Ryu's quest, various characters join your party, each with their own personal demons and diversions that involve the entire team.

Even the turn-based battles lack flair, except for the boss battles. Be prepared to spend a lot of time with this one, but a new Dash feature speeds you through the game and saves batteries. BoF delivers a tight visual and audio package. Colorful sprites fill the screen with arresting colors and special effects, while the soundtrack provides decent music accompanied by muted sound effects.

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Chip L \"chip1978\"","summary":"Amazingly complex","reviewText":"First off - I don't usually play role playing games (RPGs).

Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Solid gameplay, but the story and characters are poor compared to the original","reviewText":"February 1945. Vito Scaletta returns from the war to his home city of Empire Bay. Almost immediately he finds himself drawn into a world of criminals and the mafia, as his best friend uses shady connections to get him released from the service early. As time passes Vito finds himself reaping the rewards from a life of crime...as well as the dangers.Mafia II is the sequel to the 2002 game Mafia. Mafia is one of my favourite games of all time, with superb writing, tremendous characterisation and some fun shooting mechanics making up for occasionally questionable gameplay (such as that infamously hardcore racing mission). Mafia II is not a direct follow-up, set as it is in a different city with different characters. There are a couple of references to the events of the original Mafia, though these are obtuse enough that only hardcore fans are likely to spot them. Instead, the game's narrative is completely self-contained.In terms of gameplay, the Mafia series resembles the Grand Theft Auto franchise with driving sections and on-foot combat, with the important difference that the Mafia games are not open-world titles. Instead you proceed directly from one mission directly to the next. This means that the cities do not need to be as exhaustively detailed and brimming with stuff to do as in the GTA titles, since they are merely backdrops to the action (though they are still well-realised). This gives the Mafia games a much greater focus and puts both their stories and characters under much more pressure, as they need to be good for the games to succeed. The GTA games, which a lot of people play purely to cause havoc in the cities without ever looking at the main storylines, don't quite have the same pressure.This requirement paid off handsomely in the original Mafia. The story of Tommy Angelo's rise from taxi driver to criminal fixer, becoming a made man and gaining a family and respectability before realising how brutal and violent his world had become, was extremely compelling. It featured musings on the corrosive effects of violence on the psyche and on the morality of killing. It was a stronger story than anything to appear in a GTA title (and, interestingly, GTA4 seemed to take more than a few ideas from it).Unfortunately, it does not pay off in Mafia II. Illusion Softworks - now 2K Czech - were obviously keen not to repeat themselves in this game, so Vito Scaletta's story is rather different to Tommy's. It unfolds over a much shorter span of time (limited to two periods of several months in 1945 and 1951) and is less of the traditional rags-to-riches tale. Vito is a small-time hood who pretty much stays a small-time hood (albeit one who eventually gets a rather nice house) throughout. He doesn't have a relationship or get married, and in fact seems to be rather more sexist than Tommy (the lack of any healthy female relationships in his life and his obsession with collecting Playboy magazines indicates such). He's also a lot dumber, frequently agreeing to shady deals that have, \"THIS IS GOING TO GO BADLY WRONG,\" written all over them.This in itself is a problem, with Vito's misadventures being less compelling than either Tommy's in the earlier game, or the protagonists of most of the GTA games. A bigger problem is the lack of decent other characters. Aside from Vito's best buddy Joe, none of the other characters in the game gets much of a personality, or motivation. Even keeping track of which criminal is working for which gang is hard work. There is little to no emotional investment in Vito, his story, or in the other characters, which does interfere with caring about the game.Fortunately, the gameplay is still pretty good. It's similar to Mafia's and the gunplay is even better, helped by that rarest of beasts, a cover system which actually works and adds to the combat experience. There's one oddity in that Mafia limited you to one of each class of weapon whilst Mafia II allows you to carry every weapon at once, making it a rare example of a game that actually gives the player more choice rather than taking it away through limited arsenals. This is a welcome move. Driving is also similar, with the game still being rather less forgiving about things like running red lights, speeding or hit-and-runs than the GTA series. The cops are harder to shake this time around, but you also have more options for losing them, including running into clothes shops to change clothes or offering bribes. The missions are also quite long, with mid-mission checkpoints and a number of plot twists that, whilst usually predictable, keep things ticking over. The graphics are very impressive (especially the lighting; Mafia II may have the best sunrises and sunsets of any game to date, and the way car headlights diffuse in the fog is extremely atmospheric) and the soundtrack is first-rate, with some great (if occasionally anachronistic) tracks from the birth of the rock 'n' roll era.Ultimately, Mafia II is a far less compelling game than its forebear due to the weaker writing, story and characters. This is annoying as the gameplay is often better, but you have much less reason to care about what's going on. The game is also stingier, with combat sections often being extremely brief and easy. Mafia II has most of the same ingredients as its excellent forebear, but this time around they do not combine into as compelling a game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2013"}

I suppose some might see it as the companies just trying to squeeze more money from old games, but I love being able to play these games on new systems, and the addition of new features is always fun to experience.As far as collections go, this is a very good one. Final Fantasy 6, originally 3, is a classic game, and considered by some to be the best FF ever. I can't say I think it's the best, but it is definitely an exceptional game that was even more remarkable when it was first released. It does already seem dated in many ways. At the same time, this is the final game in the series where you can experience the classic, 2D FF that many fans of the series have grown up with.This game does have an excellent cast of characters, and one of the better storylines in the series. The espers, the first real summon monsters, are really cool, and theres somewhere around 30 of them, much more than any other game, which I like. Each character has unique abilities and weapons, which makes for great variety. A very fun old school RPG.The graphics were amazing at the time, but already seem pretty dated. The sound as well. The music that was written for the game is some of Uematso's best, but the sound capabilities of the SNES are just too dated. If they improved anything, I wish they would have improved sound quality a bit. Also, the CG scenes they added were disappointing to me. They weren't that badly done, but I thought that they would be peppered throughout the game at the appropriate spots, which they weren't. They were only at the beginning and end, which I find disappointing. I guess they wanted the actual experience of playing the game to be identical to how it was on the SNES. I wouldn't have minded some small improvements, personally. Overall, they did a good job.FF 5 was a real surprise, and it was great to play a brand new old style FF, never before released in the US. Lots of the reviews on Amazon say that it is really a sub-par game. I have to say I strongly disagree...I think its a great FF game. If you enjoyed FF 4 and 6, I think you'll definitely like 5. The graphics and sound are similar to FF 4. The gameplay is what makes the game so good though. You can switch your characters between the variety of job classes like in FF Tactics or FF X-2, and learn a large variety of different skills, then mix and match them. It's a very primitive form of the job class system, sure, but it's still really cool, considering the age of the game. I also really enjoyed the story of the game...it was about as good as FF 4. Theres a part where you're navigating through a graveyard of pirate ships infested with ghosts and zombies that is totally classic. I would definitely recommend giving FF 5 a chance. It is old and outdated, but definitely lives up to the quality of the FF series.Now, a quick word about the music disc...it's pathetic. An absolute waste of time. If anyone could actually listen to that disc and get into the music on it, I'd say you have serious issues. It's tinny SNES sound, taken directly from the games. I can't imagine it would have been too much work to throw some real orchestrated versions (they are available in Japan) of the songs on here...that would have been great. Furthermore, they chose a bunch of the worst songs to include on the disc and left out many of the best. Terrible.But, you won't be buying this collection for the music disc. The games are what matters, and they are quality, faithful ports of the originals. Highly recommended for people who want to walk down memory lane with some great old games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2005"}

Now a lot of reviews do a great job of summing up the flaws of this game, bad running system, very short game, super linear, etc. Here's my ultimate beef with Parasite Eve. It fails to be a worthy RPG and lacks cunning elements to be a decent horror game. I ordered French Toast with hot maple syrup and sausage on the side and what do I get? A dry lukewarm bowl of oatmeal and no milk. BleH!My Other Beefs With Parasite Eve's:-Cut scenes before boss battles. Anyone who likes RPG's knows how utterly frustrating it can be having to watch the same cinematic before a hard boss fight.-Bad weapon system. Why use a rocket launcher when you can upgrade a pistol to do just as much damage as well as make you act faster in battle? Whoever was assigned to work on this part of the game was in my opinion lazy.-Two discs only 14 hours of gameplay. What?? Already mentioned in other posts too.-Linear, Linear, LinEAR!!! Ok not Final Fantasy 13 Linear, but close to it.-Boring story. Think of a corny Scifi movie and there you have it. Nothing new or exciting. If anything the story borrows on Resident Evil and tries to mix in it's own thing. Whatever that is because I totally missed it. Same old, same old.-Adding techno music to a game isn't a great idea if you're going for horror. It's catchy, but destroys the mood when you're in a dark hall and there's creepy ambient noise. Then all of a sudden Pu-ch Pu-ch Pu-ch, *surrounded my monster.-Sad last boss battle. It's a fairly easy win, but here's the catch. After the battle you have to run from the creature through a ship. Think Resident Evil 6 Ada story, but if you take a wrong turn and it catches you guess what? Game over start over from last save point. Only your last save point was before the 10 minute cut scene before the boss and the 10 minute boss fight. So after all the failed attempts just to run from the boss you're looking at a 3 hour last boss battle due to failing to run away from it.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now Parasite Eve does have good graphics for its time and a very nice soundtrack with some catchy tunes. Is this enough to make it a great game? In this case no...Ahem... check please. It's just lacking way too much to be worth while as many others have already mentioned here on Amazon and doesn't really pull out anything unique.Also on a side note if you're a Christian I highly recommend skipping this one as it manages to drop the name \"Jesus\" twice in the first five minutes of game play. Then four minutes later you find a journal that mentions the bad guy wanting to \" sell their soul to the devil.\" Mix that in with a bunch of \"Hells\" and \"God\" throughout the whole game.I bring this up because I've played a lot of RPG's in my time. I mean A LOT. And it's very uncommon for stuff like this to be said in a Fantasy game, especially on this level. Poor choice of dialogue, the guy who translated this to English should have been fired. I'm sure you wont find this type of dialogue in the original Japanese translation.It's games like Parasite Eve that make me ask \"Why.\" Why don't I have millions of dollars to make a game to show them how it's done. That would be great, but I don't. So I'm stuck just throwing in my two cents on how and how not to make a game. *sighAnywho, all is not lost. If you're looking for a classic RPG that's worth while why not check out -Vagrant Story- or -Threads Of Fate-. A few months back I played -Vagrant Story- and it was actually pretty decent. Solid story and gameplay. Very similar to Parasite Eve minus all the bad stuff.Thanks for reading, hope this helps.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2013"}

Working in the proximity of the palace, Leonard stumbles on a plot to kidnap the enigmatic Princess Cisna. As he helps her escape he also becomes aware of his connection to a transformative power which allows him to take on the ancient shape, and harness the devastating power of the White Knight. Yet there are other elements at work here as well, including the forces of an evil wizard with powers that stretch back to the same ancient times which produced the White Knight. With the help of his friends and the power of the White Knight, these are the forces that Leonard will have to face in his quests.GameplayWhite Knight Chroniclesis a Japanese RPG (JRPG) centered around a turn-based battle system in a local single player story-driven campaign that is supported by online multiplayer functionality. Gameplay questing occurs from a third-person perspective and follows Leonard and up to three other AI companions, which can include the customizable character that players assume in multiplayer mode. Once quest members are assembled, players utilize the strengths of the overall group as a whole, and are able to switch between characters at will. Combat being turn-based, players must be able to cue up and control the actions of each character in quick sequence for each combat scenario faced. The game facilitates this via the Function Palette, located in its Battle Preparation menu, allowing players to prepare in advance a series of commands for each character to carry out. These can involve magic or weapons use and can be merged into combos. Multiple palettes can be saved, making it possible to optimize actions for specific types of enemies, and making for quick changing of commands. As with any RPG, throughout quests players accumulate experience which allows their character to level up, purchase items and abilities and generally grow stronger with an eye towards besting the increasingly challenging creatures, bosses and situations faced.Online MultiplayerAlong with a compelling single player campaign,White Knight Chroniclesalso contains an exciting online multiplayer component. Within this, up to four players can engage in more than 50 multiplayer quests, with each player creating their own unique customizable character which can be leveled up in a combined group effort, and take advantage of created items and new skills. Although unique to the online game mode, which is designed for multiplayer action, these quests can also be played alone if players wish. In addition to this functionality available in the online multiplayer mode also includes a variety of ways to interact with the widerWhite Knight Chroniclescommunity on the PlayStation 3 platform. Included in this is town building through the Georama functionality, which allows players to construct a town to their own specifications that can be populated offline with characters from throughout the single player campaign and then taken online where it serves as a base for quests hosted by players, as well as a persistent online location that other players can visit and buy items your town's population has for sale. The game also offers an online interface known as GeoNet that allows players to communicate with others via blogs, forums, quest logs and voice chat functionality, as well as post snapshots from their journeys using the Crystal Camera in-game tool.Key Game FeaturesWhite Knight Transformation- During single player combat players can transform into the giant White Knight, gaining the ability to challenge large enemies as well as troops of soldiers throughout the adventure.The Customizable Avatar Character- Using a wide array of sliders and customization options, players are able to create a unique character that can join the adventure in single player mode as well as online.Combo Battle System- Engage in an accessible, active turn-based battle system that caters to players of all levels allowing both default attack settings and a system for for maximum damage.JRPG (Japanese RPG) Action for PS3- Experience true JRPG action on PS3 that incorporates a variety of online gameplay elements.Beautiful Environments- Players traverse through 13 stages, as well as visit up to six towns/villages to visit and purchase items at shops or interact with NPCs.

I bought this game immediately upon release, and was so thoroughly disgusted with it after 4 hours that I pronounced it DOA. Yet, in a strange twist of fate, I find myself playing this one again. In the end, it's hard to rate this game as a single entity. You really need to break it down into two components: the single-player campaign, and the multi-player pseudo-MMORPG that follows. So, that's exactly what I will do.SINGLE-PLAYER CAMPAIGNMan, this is terrible. This might rank as one of the worst single-player RPGs I've ever encountered. \"Rank\" is appropriate as a verb and adjective here. This game stinks.GOOD:-Graphics. A lot of people complained about the graphics. I'm not one of them. In fact, I prefer the colorful in-game graphics to the washed-out cutscenes. I wish more games would take a cue from this; not everything is about realism. I love the color, and the cute character designs.BAD:-Ummm, everything else? I mean, it's really easy to pick apart this game. Let's start with story. What a monumental bore. I couldn't care less about the chronicle of this White Knight. I'm even more disgusted with the stupidity of both the protagonists and the antagonists. Whose incompetence will ultimately win out? Well, you pretty much know the answer, but it's amazing to watch the cliches pile up. The only thing good is that the story mode takes around 15 hours, and that's assuming you're screwing around. Yes - it's a sad world when you are thankful for the end of a JRPG.I mean, it's hard to describe how stupid this is. One moment, your party saves a princess from imminent death at the hands of a fat, moustachioed, idiotic villain. The next? Your party leaves said princess by herself, where she is subsequently kidnapped. I kid thee not. Characters are tired from the outset, and only get worse, as they chime in regarding your situation every five seconds. That's right - the single most annoying aspect of \"Rogue Galaxy\" rears its head again here. Expect to hear the same tired comments over and over as you press forward.The environments are laughable. Repetition is everywhere in dungeon design. The cities might have been more interesting; after all, they are huge. However, of the hundred people with whom you can talk in each city, there might be three that actually tell you something related to the story. Mind you - I don't mean three people to push the story forward. Most conversation is of the variety, \"I want a horse, mommy!\" \"No, sorry.\" It's cute when it appears once. When it is the norm, it's unbearable.The game has a remarkably complex system in place for battle, requiring you to form combos, build character types, etc. None of it is necessary in the single-player mode. Battle is blindingly easy. I used the most basic ability (\"slash\") on every one of my characters, and never lost a single battle. This is with NO GRINDING, mind you. I will confess that this system plays a crucial role in the multi-player madness that follows. it's a shame that the single-player mode doesn't even try to teach you its worth.Speaking of gameplay, it is a monument to boredom. Battles are lame. Bosses are lame. you pretty much do nothing throughout the game, other than move from point A to point B(that's right - this is a really linear game). If this was all the disc offered, I would give this one star without thinking twice.Multiplayer:I don't know if the game \"shines\" here, but it is significantly better. You see, WKC was clearly not meant to be an SP experience. The MP mode is where the money's at, and it is really good. If you've played an MMO before, you'll know what to expect here. Lots of quests. Lots of customization. Lots of farming for items to build better weapons. You can join guilds, which improve over time. All in all, it's a fun experience. I would give it 4 stars, although unfortunately, the online community can put a damper on the experience. Getting some idiot kid to send you 100 messages calling you a \"noob\" can be frustrating, but at the same time, there are people out there who just like to play, and will help you along (and you'll need help to make sense of how to develop your character). If you like this sort of thing, you can get another 500-1000 hours of free play out of this one. That's great value. All in all, I would give the MP mode 4 stars.The problem is, it's not the experience that was initially sold by the game. I have no doubt that a fan of MMOs will get a huge return for his investment here. However, plenty of people went into this thinking that there would be a rewarding single-player mode. It is not here. Seriously - the SP mode is so bad that this game isn't even worth twenty bucks if that's what you want. But if you are looking for a long MP experience, you won't do much better, and you could do a LOT worse. Buyer beware, but fans will get a lot out of this one.Happy gaming!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2011"}

With its unique control layout and ergonomic design, the Pro Elite Wireless will keep you comfortable for hours of gaming. And with its responsive buttons and precise analog sticks, the controller gives PS3 gamers a competitive edge. The Pro Elite Wireless also features dual rumble motors for truly immersive gaming and is compatible with SIXAXIS games.POWER A Pro Elite Wireless ControllerAt a Glance:Wireless PS3 controller with unique control layoutIntuitive, responsive controlsSIXAXIS motion-sensing technologyDual-rumble motors for immersive gamingContoured shape with ergonomic gripsWireless controller features a unique control layout and is compatible with SIXAXIS games.View larger.Backlit buttons are easy to see in the dark.View larger.Intuitive, Inspired Control LayoutIn designing the Pro Elite Wireless Controller, POWER A has taken what's best about other controllers--like the Xbox 360 controller--and recombined these features to give a competitive edge to PS3 users. The Pro Elite Wireless positions its analog sticks asymmetrically, with left analog stick up and the right analog stick down. This design helps prevent cramping during extended gaming sessions and is especially ideal for first-person shooters. The R2 buttons have also been repositioned for greater accessibility while gaming. Additionally, all of the buttons are backlit, so you'll still be able to game in the dark.Ergonomic, Natural DesignErgonomically designed, the Pro Elite Wireless provides optimal comfort for all hand sizes. Its textured rubber grips are soft and breathable, so your gaming won't be ruined by sweaty palms. The palm handles have been expanded to provide a more generous area for gripping the controller. And with its gently contoured edges, the Pro Elite Wireless helps alleviate pressure on your hands to ensure comfort.Precise SIXAXIS Motion ControlNot only is the Pro Elite Wireless comfortable and intuitive, it's also compatible with SIXAXIS games. Using a fine-tuned accelerometer and gyroscope, the Pro Elite Wireless can sense your movements and translate them into the game. This gives you more direct, lifelike control over the events in your game. To get the most out of SIXAXIS-heavy games like Warhawk and Heavenly Sword, you'll need the Pro Elite Wireless Controller.Rumble Feedback for Immersive GameplayFully supporting rumble feedback, the Pro Elite Wireless uses two vibrating motors on either side of the controller to create a rumbling sensation at certain moments during the game. This makes yaour gaming experience even more immersive, as you're able to feel every gunshot and explosion in visceral detail.The Pro Elite Wireless Controller is backed by a two-year warranty.

They're usually not as good as the first party controllers and they often have bugs which screw up the game play. I usually just use them for friends who visit, but online play has switched that dynamic.I jumped at the opportunity to try this Pro Elite Wireless Controller. It looks and feels great. Xbox 360 fans will like that the controller feels a lot like one of those and not really like a PS3 controller. PS3 fans might be a little miffed at that though...All in all, I don't really like the controller enough to stop using my regular PS3 one. The PS3 controller has a really nice feel to it and I don't think the nice grip on this controller is enough to compensate. If you're looking to save a little money, you can't go wrong with this controller. But it's just not as good as the original.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00B15EXJC","reviewerName":"Jonathan","summary":"A decent option for those that prefer the 360-style controller","reviewText":"I'm a longtime 360 owner with large hands that picked up a PS3 last year. While I like my PS3, the stock controller always bothered me - it felt like it was being swallowed by my hands, and the placement of the sticks meant that either my thumbs would bump into each other consistently or I'd have to hold the controller in an unnatural position.The SC-1 is what would happen if the stock controllers from the PS3 and the 360 had a baby. Its shape and size are basically smack in the middle of both, which means that in my bear paws the SC-1 feels better than the DualShock (yay for offset sticks!) but not as good as the 360 controller (while thicker, the sides of the controller are not longer, meaning my pinkie finger isn't touching the controller at all when I hold it).As far as the controller itself, I can't quite figure out what the designers were trying to do. The sticks are well-designed and responsive to a light touch (not as light as the DualShock's, which for me is a plus, and a hair lighter than the 360's), the shoulder buttons feel cheap but still are responsive, and then the triggers are a mess, with a non-rounded tip that makes pulling them uncomfortable, especially considering how heavy they feel.The controller utilizes a d-pad platter in lieu of four discrete buttons, but unlike the 360's platter you don't get a good sense of the in-between inputs (e.g. down-right). The weird dip at the top of the controller means the face buttons are crammed together, including a home key so recessed (it's between the protruding d-pad and right stick) it's nearly inaccessible and the select, turbo, and start buttons so crammed together that if I press my thumb on any button it's also hitting at least one of the others. The F1 and F2 buttons are thankfully separate, and surprisingly accessible at the bottom of the controller.On a positive note, though, I like the rubber coating on the controller - makes it a lot more comfortable to hold for extended periods, even if it does show the grime a bit more. As seems to be the trend with this controller though, I was a bit annoyed that the home button didn't have the same functionality the DualShock did (for example, I couldn't check the battery life).I went into this controller with high hopes, and came out squarely in the &#34;meh&#34; category. For those of use who prefer Microsoft's controller, this is a step in the right direction, but for everything I liked about the controller, there was something that rubbed me the wrong way.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2013"}

Footprints will be left in mud, for example, but only until it rains and then they will wash away. Lara's shirt will also get wet, and she's more likely to lose her grip if she is standing on a slippery, rain-soaked ledge. When the sun comes out, her shirt will dry and the slippery surfaces regain their friction.In Underworld, Lara also has a lot more flexibility in how she makes her way through a level, as there is often more than one way to get from here to there. She can now climb walls with texture and rocky outcroppings to reach areas she previously wouldn't have been able to access.All of these additions have been made to give the game a non-linear, open feel. Players can interactive with the environment by doing things they find to be intuitive, and the game will respond in an appropriate way. When Lara interacts with trees, for example, she will push aside leaves using either one or two hands depending on whether or not she's holding something. These details give a lifelike, immersive sensation to the game.New Melee Combat SystemUnderworld introduces a new melee combat system that requires players to strategically strike with offensive, defensive, and evasive maneuvers. Lara can now attack enemies with different punches, kicks, knees, and other acrobatic onslaughts. Items lying on the ground, such as poles that were previously walked on, can be picked up and swung at enemies. Players can also perform a greater variety of actions with weapons; for example, Lara can now hold onto a ledge with one hand and fire a gun with the other.Realistic Enemy and Animal AIThe AI in Tomb Raider: Underworld has also taken a big step forward--both enemies and animals now make independent decisions based on their surroundings, employ ambush and squad tactics when fighting, and will retreat if deemed necessary.With updated graphics and a more immersive and realistic gameplay, Tomb Raider: Underworld will have both fans and newcomers excited about the newest installment in this popular video game-pinup franchise.Tomb Raider: Underworld is loaded with a new melee combat system, various weapons, and smarter AI for both enemies and animals.","reviewerName":"Supreme Warrior","summary":"Amazing exploration","reviewText":"The best thing about this game has to be the amount of exotic locales and exploration that you do throughout. You have to explore the dense jungles of central Mexico, the tropical and beautiful scenery of coastal Thailand, frozen arctic wastelands, Lara own home(or underneath it), and tombs hidden deep within the Mediterrean Sea. There are almost no boss fights so that is one missing element that should have been added to the game since we have seen it in past Tomb Raider games. As a matter of fact, I think that this is probably the easiest but still most exciting Tomb Raider games that I have ever played. I enjoyed all of the exploring of the different locales and tombs. I almost felt like I was going on my own Indiana Jones expedition. Lara field gear in her PDA, really makes the game easier because she actually tells you what you need to do to progress further in the game, which was lacking from other TR games. Lots of enemies to shoot(people and animals) and the power of Thor's hammer adds a whole new level of excitement for the game. Any fan of action adventure games and exploration should check this game out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"D. Blizzard","summary":"The Next Step in the Evolution of Final Fantasy","reviewText":"Final Fantasy XIII (FFXIII) is the long-awaited next chapter in the Final Fantasy franchise.  This game took over five years to make and actually started its life on the old PlayStation 2 platform, before going to the PlayStation 3 and then being ported over to the Xbox 360.  This game has not only diverged from many Final Fantasy traditions, but created a whole new gaming engine and pushed the limits of what modern consoles can do.Story:  The Final Fantasy franchise is known for stories that draw in the gamer and make them feel empathy or otherwise emotionally invested in an outcome.  FFXIII does just that.  It is not on the same scale as FFVII with Aeris or FFX with Tidus and Yuna, but there are some moments where you cannot help but feel something for what the characters are going through.  Without spoiling too much, the basic story centers around a group of characters, Lightning, Snow, Vanille, Sazh, Fang, and Hope.  In their efforts to save people they love, or exact revenge, they are drawn together and are given a mission to carry out.  Their fates, from this moment forward, are forever altered and bleak.  They either complete their mission and turn to crystal, or they refuse and turn into mindless monsters.  FFXIII's story revolves around this and is split into thirteen chapters.  Completing every chapter and finishing the game will take about 60 hours.  This story is very linear and cannot be altered by the player, you either go forward with the narrative or you stop and not finish the game.  This is like many of the previous Final Fantasies only they used various techniques to make the gamer believe they had much more control over the story than they actually did.  For instance, in previous Final Fantasies, you had the option to explore the world map.  Although you had this freedom, going to any town or village not immediately connected to the main story or side quest was pointless since they were static and rarely changed.  You were being gently pushed towards a location on the world map.  FFXIII is unabashedly linear.  In fact, most of the maps for the game are lines with minor areas open for treasure hunting.  There is no world map or towns to explore.  The developers have created two main areas of the game, Cocoon (An area you will spend the majority of the game in, story-wise.) and Pulse (A sprawling open-ended area with plenty to see and do where you will spend most of the time hunting in.) These two areas were designed to be polar-opposites of each other, Cocoon has advanced technology and is closed in, Pulse is wilderness and open.  The story takes a while to ramp up and become exciting.  The initial portions of the game introduce you to the characters by having you view their lives before the group came together.  This allows you to better understand what is going on.  Once you complete the game, you are encouraged to continue playing as many areas, and enemies, of the game can only be tackled by an advanced party.Battle System:  Before going too much into this, I will explain the level-up mechanic.  In FFXIII, you do not obtain levels in the traditional sense.  Instead, you earn Crystarium points (CP) to spend in the Crystarium.  Tougher enemies yield higher CP.  The Crystarium functions very much like the sphere grid from FFX with new areas unlocking after major game events.  The Crystarium is split into several levels and they are dotted with skills, techniques, and stat enhancements.  CP are used to move between the points with higher-level skills requiring more CP to unlock.  Each character has a class, or specialization, that you can level up.  For the majority of the game, there are only three primary specializations that you can use and level up.  As the game progresses, you will have access to three more secondary specializations, though you shouldn't bother with them until after the end game since the CP to unlock the secondary skills is very high.  The classes you play as are:  Commando (Physical attacker who can slow the chain gauge), ravager (A magical attacker who can drastically increase the chain gauge), saboteur (Causes status ailments to the enemy and can slow the chain gauge), sentinel (Acts as a beacon to draw enemy attacks and has high physical damage resistance but does not attack directly), synergist (Does not attack but applies status enhancements to the party), and medic (Does not attack either, but focuses on healing.) A character can only perform actions of a given class and cannot use others unless you paradigm shift.  During battle, you can switch classes with the paradigm shift.  For instance, if you have an enemy with loads of hit points (HP) you can attack with a commando to slow down the chain gauge then shift to a ravager to drive it up quickly.  These work like a streamlined version of the gambit system from FFXII and are user defined.  When you shift paradigms, you shift them for the entire battle party and you are limited to a set number of paradigms you can create, though, you can shift as many times as you need during a battle and alter them outside of battle at any time.  This means you have to plan ahead and choose paradigms that will fit situations you think you may face.  You also have tactical points (TP) that regenerate slowly following battle.  These TP are used to perform various techniques like summon a creature or performing an emergency revival of characters.  The battle system for FFXIII is very different from previous installments, it draws on the ATB (Active Time Battle) system from previous Final Fantasies but it makes several significant alterations.  Only one character is under direct user-control and if they are taken out, it is game over.  All of the other characters are AI controlled and can easily be revived.  The AI is usually good, but there are times where they fumble.  For instance, normally your characters will perform actions against an enemy they know will work, such as using fire to attack someone who is vulnerable to it.  Unfortunately, the game lacks a move button and the AI has a tendency to keep all characters close together.  This can be a problem at later levels where almost all enemies cause area-of-effect damage and everyone gets hit.  When you make contact with enemies battle begins.  Instead of an ATB that, when filled, allows you to perform a single action, you have a bar that is split into segments.  A standard attack will take only one segment whereas a special skill will take more.  Segments are added to the bar either from the Crystarium or from major game events.  The bar fills at a set rate, unless you have haste or slow cast upon you, and you can either let the bar fill completely and perform all actions queued up at once, or you can interrupt filling the bar and take action based on the number of segments filled, you can also cancel your actions entirely.  This allows you to adapt to changing conditions.  As the user-controlled character, you can select what you want to do manually, or you let the game choose for you in an auto-battle system.  The battles can flow very quickly and it is usually a good idea just to let the game make the decisions.  Normally, attacks don't cause too much damage.  Your best option is to drive up the chain gauge.  As you attack, the gauge goes higher, if you don't attack, it lowers.  The whole point of the gauge is drive it up to the point of staggering the enemy.  Every enemy has a breaking point where they are staggered.  While staggered, your enemy will be vulnerable to certain kinds of damage, may not attack at all, and the damage you cause can be multiplied up to nine-times the amount of damage you would normally inflict.  When the enemy is in a staggered state, the chain gauge slowly lowers and then resets.  This means you have to cause as much damage as possible during the window in which your opponent is staggered.  At the end of battle, you are rated zero to five stars, though, the star system is a little pointless.  The battle ranking does not determine how much CP you get but does influence your chances at obtaining spoils and increasing your TP.  People who are playing for trophies will want to pay close attention to the rankings they get during hunts.  It all works well and reminds me of the battle system from the Grandia series.Audio:  The music in FFXIII reminds me of a mix between FFX and FFXII and is very well done.  Uematsu is not involved with the soundtrack to this game.  His involvement has been waning over the years with FFIX being the last he was fully involved in, with FFX he only did half the songs, and with FFXII he did a single piece.  Because of this, many staples of the Final Fantasy franchise are gone, such as the battle music, victory fanfare, the Final Fantasy theme, and the harps that usually play at the beginning of most Final Fantasy games.  You can still hear vestiges of those themes, but for the most part, they are gone though the game still retains the leitmotif music the series is known for.  It won't take the gamer long to realize what the theme of the game is.  There are a number of standout tracks that are some of the best in the franchise, such as \"Ragnarok\", \"Determination\", \"Born Anew\", \"Fabula Nova Crystalis\", and \"Miracles.\" Like many fans of the franchise, I was a little confused at the choice of using Leona Lewis' \"My Hands,\" but after finishing the game and seeing when the song played, it made sense in context.  As for the voiceovers, most are well done, with Lightning and Fang being personal favorites, though Vanille's voice can be grating at times.  I do wish anime and video game makers would hire children to perform voices for children in the game instead of having high-pitched adults perform those characters.  This is just a personal preference.Graphics:  This is the first Final Fantasy to be released on a high definition console, and it arrived with a bang.  FFXIII is absolutely stunning to look at in either 720p or 1080p.  There are many moments where content rendered in-game on-the-fly looks as good as pre-rendered CGI.  The developers knew how to use the system and work within its limitations.  For example, close-ups of characters cause the frame rate to drop, I assume this is for texture rendering and lighting, as such, those scenes are slow paced and you cannot tell that there is a drop.  Square Enix have used every last gigabyte they have on the Blu-Ray disc.  With all that space, they have crammed as much graphical information as they possibly can to make it look amazing.  Anyone with a high definition screen, large or small, should play it on that to get the full experience.Misc.:  I was conflicted about Final Fantasy XIII, I loved FFVII and FFX so I wasn't entirely sure if I would like it.  Since Final Fantasy X is my personal favorite in the franchise, this game ranks third in my list just between Final Fantasy VII and VIII.  It is not as tactical as FFX nor does it draw me in as much as that title, but the battle system is much more enjoyable than that in VII and ranks as my favorite in the entire franchise.  The story is compelling, though a tad melodramatic, but it doesn't have the luster of FFX or VII.  Frankly, as the game drew on, I had only a vague idea of the overall story and it took me hours just to figure out who, exactly the fal'Cie are and what a l'Cie actually is.  I had my \"This is Final Fantasy\" moment in the last cinematic.  It was there that everything clicked into place and I understood just what the characters were doing and their motivations, I even, finally, understood what the game's logo was supposed to be since it is obvious at the end.  Fans of the franchise may not like this incarnation very much, as it is, in many ways, vastly different than previous installments.  Players who lack patience may become bored very quickly as the story is doled out in bite-sized pieces and the battle system takes well into the middle of the game to fully unlock.  In fact, the first eight chapters are, very much, tutorials with the eleventh chapter opening up game immensely.  The beginning portions of the game are quite easy, but in the last few chapters, the point where the training wheels come off, the difficulty ramps up.  Instead of a difficulty curve, FFXIII has a difficulty wall where every battle, unless you know exactly what you're doing and how to win, could be a grueling fight.  Overall, I enjoyed FFXIII and recommend it to anyone looking for something a little different in the RPG genre.  For the PlayStation 3, this is my second favorite game just behind Assassin's Creed 2 and ahead of inFamous.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S.

{"product_name":"B000FKBCX4","description":"Create universal wonder in Spore, an exciting new simulation game that lets you develop your own personal universe. Work your way through five evolutionary phases, including Cell, Creature, Tribe, Civilization and Space, that offer unique challenges, thrills and goals. For example, you can start in Cell and nurture one species from a simple aquatic organism all the way until it becomes a sentient life form. Or you can jump right in and begin building tribes and civilizations on multiple planets. What you do with your universe is totally up to you.The powerful creation tools of Spore are easy to use, allowing you to effortlessly design every aspect of your universe. Creatures, vehicles, building and even starships are all within your grasp. While Spore is a single-player game, your creations and other players' creations are automatically shared between your galaxy and theirs, offering a nearly limitless number of worlds to visit and enjoy. You can also go online to view the incredible things other players have made and can even pull those items into your universe. Spore gives you the chance to make worlds and beings that evolve, grow and delight you every step of the way.","reviewerName":"Timothy Lovett","summary":"Spore - Gameplay Review (Good Concepts Bad Execution)","reviewText":"Spore 1/5 stars.Firstly, I'm not going to even mention the DRM stuff; the game just isn't all that great by itself so the DRM is nasty but it's just icing on the cake (and it's a rotten worm infested cake at that). The game just takes a great concept (user designed content that can interact within the game environment) and places it in a horribly executed game world. It's almost as if Will Wright worked on the creature creator and then had some intern to develop the rest of the game (an intern who had a love for spinning out clones of older games).The first mode is an arcade cell stage. As a small cell you go through finding new evolution pieces for your cell (9 can be found) and use these to make your cell as powerful as you can. In order to advance out of this stage you must eat your way to evolutionary development... to do this you can choose three different paths, herbivore, carnivore, or omnivore. To be honest, as simple as this mode was, it was the most fun out of all the modes of game play available. The reason for this is that the choices you made in regards to where you placed evolution pieces (like spikes) affect game play because each of the pieces can make your creature more powerful; the evolution pieces are not just cosmetic but affect the game world. However, the game play quickly becomes boring given the lack of choices for what you can use to enhance your creature leave you waiting to eat enough to get out of the level.The second mode gives you the ability to control your creature on land as opposed to in the water. You start off with a very minimalistic selection of body parts to use to help design your creature. The thing is they price the evolutionary pieces by DNA cost and different skill levels are granted for the higher costing pieces. So if you buy a pair of wings from the lowest category it only gives you 'Glide 1' while if you spend more and buy the more expensive piece you get 'Glide 4.' The thing is no matter how you design your creature you're limited to a system that's just about throwing expensive appendages on your critter to get the skills at high levels and not about designing a creature that is best fit in terms of design for the environment. Given two creatures of different sizes isn't it safe to assume the big creature would be harder to get lift from a tiny pair of wings (if you don't scale them)? In Spore it doesn't matter since it's just a skills game the creature creator is just a fancy way of displaying skill pieces not about crafting a well optimized creature.This is only worsened by the repetitiveness of the second mode: in the second mode you either kill species or make friends with species to get more DNA points to evolve. So you'll be going from camp to camp doing this over and over again with no alterations in the game play besides this to get out of this stage. As you get more DNA and reach checkpoints you're also given the ability to add others of your species into your party but besides that not much else changes. One thing to note about evolving your creature in order to find new pieces to evolve your creature you have to either socialize with other species, kill alpha members of species, or find pieces on the ground. This is actually one of the few good ideas I think was implemented in this game mode; every time you play through you have access to different evolutionary benefits. However, when you're just throwing the best pieces together finding some low ranked jaw (unless cosmetics are your thing) isn't going to help you much so you'll have to kill quite a few tribes in order to get decently ranked ones.The third mode places you at the level of a tribe. All the evolutionary work you just did up until now no longer comes into play at all. Your tribe is a generic tribe just dressed the way you design in the creature creator and no longer does it matter if you put on the best pieces because they no longer affect anything. The instant I played this I felt as if I were playing a really nerfed version of Starcraft mixed with Age of Empires. You create baby units which grow into adults but are unusable until such (Zerg Eggs from StarCraft) and gather resources by hunting beasts, farming, or fishing (Age of Empires). You can place a set number of buildings (which cost food money) which have technologies such as Stone Axes or Throwing Spears to help you build your army. So you build a baby, it becomes an adult, you have it click on the house and boom you have an axe man. Problem is its so simplified and there are only a few types of units that it becomes a thoughtless process which is tedious at best. The maximum units allowed grows with each tribe killed (or befriended) but it also makes the other tribes grow by exactly the same amount as you did. So instead of a 5v5 war you have a 7v7 war -- it feels exactly the same with a little more fighting. It just feels like a Fisherprice Real Time Strategy game for the mode.I was planning on reviewing the other pieces of the game but I seriously haven't found the game to be all that great so far so I don't think I'll be spending any more time on it for the foreseeable future. the game definitely delivered something entirely different than people came to expect was being released -- it's just not all that much fun. If you like watered down games with a cosmetic user created addition then you may like this game but so far I find it to be trivial at best. The creature creator, mind you, is really cool and the game could definitely been something much greater through the use of species... If everything didn't feel so cookie cutter the same (all the tribes and species and how they are setup) and the evolutionary designs would affect game play besides stat ratings and skills than this would have lived up at least to some of the hype.Hopefully the ideas behind the creature creator and on the fly design will be implemented in other games to come which perhaps will use the ideas to create a better user experience. If you're going to create a game you have to understand one fundamental thing... you have to make it fun. No amount of advertising will help you sell more when word of mouth advertising is butchering you on review sites left and right.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2008"}

Honestly speaking, the game is decent and a great way to kill some time, but at the same time, I would not pay more than $20 for it. As good as it migh be, it does not justify a higher price.You pilot a submarine through different stages. You have 3 types of subs, which differ by size. The bigger the size the more complicated it is to steer, but the more power you have. Each sub can be decorated with decals that you earn by finishing missions.There are 3 types of gameplay:Missions, which take you and your choice of one of 3 subs, through different stages/maps where you must get from point A to point B while you encounter enemies and obstacles, the maps differ in size, each time you finish a level, you enter a bonus periscope level which ony lasts about minute. Each mission can be played as many times as you like with whatever sub  you want (out of the 3), for better times, etc.Periscope Strike, turns the upper screen on your 3DS into the lens of your sub's periscope, you can ony dive, zoom and shoot torpedoes, the point of this game is too look for both enemy's ships and subs; you are given three sub-choices, to hunt enemy ships, enemy ships in a storm and enemy subs. You must aim by moving the 3DS around, so sitting on your couch won't do it, you must rotate constantly.The last gameplay mode is called Steel Commander, which is a mix of the old school battleship game and this game's own twist; you can play this online against human players or offline against AI.Graphics:Not terrible, but not great. They're average. You get to see fish and some nice backgrounds, but the overall quality is just average. Some textures are blocky and the subs themselves have a lot of jagged lines, but don't let that keep you from buying the game, it is very entertaining.3D Effect:Spot-on through out, except for periscope mode. When the 3D is engaged and you are playing any periscope mission/level, it can be pretty distracting and flat out confusing, because you must move with the 3DS to be able to rotate the periscope, and as you all know, to get the perfect 3D view, the 3DS must be held at a certain angle and so while playing periscope, you must not only move the 3DS and your body, but also use the stylus or your finger to shoot torpedoes, zoom and dive.With the exception of Periscope mode, I definitely recommend playing it on 3D through out. The additional layers that the 3D gives you, makes the game and the overall experience that much better.Sound:You get sonar sounds, torpedoes and background music. They all fit and do a great job at creating the right atmosphere for this game. You also hear voices, which are from the crew and commander, but they're only indicating things like, full speed, dive, etc. I'm glad to report that they do not get old or annoying and are well placed at the right moments and only when necessary.The only con about the volume, the lack of it. I felt that the volume was extremely low. I'm using a 3DS XL, so I'm not sure how this sounds on a regular 3DS.At its current price, this game should not be passed, you will get a good amount of playtime out of this tittle, even after you are done with all the missions, you can always play the Steel Commander mode for added time and value. Of course, like I said before, I wouldn't pay more than $20, but that's just my opinion. I gave this game a 5 star rank, because quite honestly, it is fun and there isn't much to complaint about for the price and the amount of content it has.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world.

Is Now Even Better!","reviewText":"I loved the first Halo, and I'm sure most of you also did. While I was playing the first one, I never thought any FPS could be any better - and that was, obviously, before I put my hands on Halo 2.Halo 2 was hyped as hell, if it wasn't the best game ever it would disappoint gamers, so Bungie worked on it really hard for nearly three years. I was kind of let down at first when I saw that the most complex textures and details in the CG-like movies appeared moments after the basic ones. It's not a big thing, but it's still something. But when the intro was over, I got shocked... Could those be the graphics? Oh my God! The most incredible graphics I've ever seen in my entire life... It began a little bit like Half-Life, and when I found out I could shoot with two weapons at once, I said to myself: this is going to be the best game ever. Soundtrack and sound effects are far superior than usual even in a normal TV. I wasn't able to plug my Xbox into my home theater, but as far as I know, the result can't be compared to any other games avaliable. One thing I liked about the soundtrack is that the classical soundtrack from the first one has been changed and now there's a lot of rock'n'roll tunes - I like both classical and rock music, but guitars fit the world of Halo way more than pianos and violins, and you've got to agree. Voice acting is also top notch.Now there are new enemies in the game. The variety of enemies still isn't the best thing ever, but it never gets repetitive. New weapons (I love the energy sword, it's the most powerful weapon), new vehicles... Halo 2 has improved the first one in every way possible. I loved the controls in the first one, and this time they're even better. AI is great... Enemies and allies are really smart - not smarter than me, though (hahaha) - in 99% of the gameplay. I have witnessed some parts of the game where the AI kind of failed - allies stopped shooting due to nothing while in a vehicle, allies refused to get into the Warthlog for no reason... Other interesting thing in this game is that you play with two characters: Master Chief and an alien, so it's two different views of the story.Let's talk about the Xbox Live gameplay... Holy Spartans! I don't have much experience in online gameplay (it was the second time I've played anything online), but I must warn you: it's highly addictive. If you're tired about the single player game, ok, it's possible, but you can't get tired of this. It's different every time you play. There are many game modes, scenarios and there's still more to come - Bungie is always planning some new download contents. And Halo 2 includes a special code so you can play the game online with absolutely no charge for two full months. C'mon, play Halo 2 free, online for two months, you can't miss it. All you need is a high-speed internet connection and a credit card, nothing else. If you want to continue playing, no problem: pay a US$50 tax to play for another year or buy a Xbox Live Starter Kit so you get new games to play online and you don't pay anything else for a year. If you want to cancel, you can also do so and you won't be charged. Such things like playing Halo 2 online can't be written, you must play it, simple as that.Overall, we're talking about the best game of 2004. I'm not a big fan of first person shooters, but this one absolutely rocks. Since it has no bosses and no puzzles - two things I don't like in games -, it's extra fun. If you think a game with no bosses and no puzzles is basically a very easy game, try to beat it on Legendary mode, dear gamer... Buy it right now! If you don't own an Xbox, it's worthy to buy one only to play this single game, which is, by the way... The best game ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2005"}

Granted, I too thought it was horribly repetitive but I enjoyed the technical aspects of the game...the climbing, the fighting, etc.  Still, it wasn't good enough to warrant buying the sequel unless I knew they'd made it more interesting.  I heard it was better so I gave it a spin, a good move for sure.Lets start out by addressing a few of the issues that the first Assassin's Creed has and how the sequel fixed them.-Character Development: In the first game there is literally no backstory for Altair.  You start off on a mission gone awry and work from there.  With Ezio in the second game you start the story BEFORE you're an assassin.  You learn the overall behavior of your character, his motivation, etc.  Then it eases you into the position of assassin.-Emotion: In the first game Altair has roughly the emotional level of a rock.  He gets a mission, he follows his orders, he never really questions or feels anything.  Ezio on the other hand has a bit of a bad boy mentality.  He fancies himself a ladies man (and acts upon it), he makes mistakes when he gets angry, he woos more ladies, etc.  He seems more human than Altair the robot did.-Economy: In the first game you go through the game and you get a new item what, once every mission (for a grand total of 8)?  In the second game there is an economy.  Instead of relying on missions to buy new year you can buy it whenever you have the cash to do so (although better tiers of gear aren't unlocked until you progress through the story).  And there are plenty of ways to earn money.  Pickpocket people, loot corpses, carry mail, assassinate targets, help wives get even with their cheating husbands, all of which are relatively fun to play.  Also, you can spend your money on hired help such as courtesans (who use their wiles to distract guards) or thieves (who start brawls to distract guards).  It again gives a much more realistic feeling to the game.-Repetitive missions: The biggest issue in the first game is nowhere to be found here, although maybe that's just me.  In the first game you have 3 types of missions...pickpocket, interrogate, or eavesdrop.  That's it.  Rinse, repeat.  In this game it follows more of a story where no two missions are identical.  Whether it be releasing prisoners to killing certain guards to allow your allies to set themselves up in certain positions or even defensive escort.  Lots of variation and lots of fun.-Ridiculous collection of items: Flags...the first game had lots of flags.  If I recall it was something along the line of 440 flags.  I think I collected a grand total of maybe 60 in the first game.  In this game there are only 100 feathers to collect and each area tells you how many of said feathers for each area you've collected.  I didn't get all the feathers but I didn't find it nearly as distracting as the flags.The game isn't without it's faults.  Countering is still the most effective way to kill someone.  The hidden blade counters are overpowered, but overall combat is a little more balanced.The controls still aren't perfect.  There were a few times when I'd try to jump a certain direction and Ezio would jump a different direction (usually off the top of a building thus killing me).Also, there are some graphical/textural errors.  I glitched through the floor at one point and got stuck.But the few bugs can't detract from the fun of the game.  Overall it's a great game and rather lengthy, I want to say that my playthrough (I didn't find all of the feathers or glyphs) took maybe 18 hours?  I did alot of exploring though and it's a good bit of fun to explore in this game, unlike the previous.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2010"}

Harmonix have crafted gorgeous soundscapes and truly do the legacy and music of the original Beatles history justice. If you're a fan you'll reminisce right along, if you're new to their world it'll be a crash course of some of their most important career moments; a highlight in music history.  It's a little challenging at times, but it's not too tough if you've made it through all ofRock Band 2on a Hard or Expert level. I'd recommend it if you happen to have a Beatles interest and have ever enjoyed their music at least somewhat. With a good high-def television plugged in through HDMI, a reciever, some surround speakers and a digital toslink cable, it will stand as (one of) the most beautiful and best sounding Beatles experiences possible. And yes, I literally mean the best sound quality the Beatles has ever had to this point in history, due to Harmonix' meticulous 5.1-remixing and separation of the original master tapes - which just shows how much they care in doing the music justice.There are some downsides to it though. Completing the game alone doesn't take much time, a true fan is very likely to get through the career in one or two days, with another day for a repeat performance in challenge mode. You could always play encores with friends and family, collect achievements or rank up the leaderboards though, and there are also three full length albums and one more song available for DLC (sadly it seems doubtful if we'll ever see more than that - but adding them to the game is a meticulous, expensive and time-consuming process, which is tough whenRock Band 3is just around the corner, and more people haven't already done their outmost to buy ALL the DLC). Hopefully Harmonix will see a boost of sales withRock Band 3, and surprise us by adding more DLC albums, or even a patch or completely new disc in the form of The Beatles: Rock Band - Pro Mode, by which time the circle would be complete.The Beatles: Rock Band is all about having an almost hypnotic Fab Four-experience; taking in the music, the dreamscapes, the mustaches and the witty studio chatter. If the idea of The Beatles is alluring, check it out, and get the most out of it by supporting and buying ALL the albums.

Any person can sit down and enjoy this game. Simple and easy to play on 50 CC and great Nintendo mascots.Graphics: 8.5/10. Most game sites did not like the graphics so much in this game. They thought they were good but nothing special. True, but they didn't appreciate them enough. The cartoony and bright graphics fit well in this game, and the character models look great. The only real flaw is that they are a wee bit dated.Sound: 9/10. It's all here. DK's trademark grunts, as well as Bowser's, Daisy says \"I'm Daisy\" so much it makes you want to shoot her with a red shell... it just sounds good. The tracks have their own little track too so there is a little music as well.Control: 9.5/10. A lot of people hate the controls for this game. Why? I have no idea; but they are very realistic. Very, very realistic. For example, when you are going down a straight away and do a sharp turn, you will not turn much unless you use R to drift. Drifting well is essential to win races on 150 CC, so you have to get used to it if you want to win those karts and 2 extra characters.Fun: 9/10. There is a lot of fun to be had here. Especially on multiplayer. You and a buddy can team up on one kart or go head-to-head; your decision. There are quite a few characters to race with from obviously Mario, Luigi, Peach, Bowser, Yoshi, and so on, to less popular mascots such as Birdo, Diddy Kong, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, and many, many more. Each set of characters have their own \"special\", too. Baby Mario, Mario, Luigi, and Baby Luigi all shoot a set of five fireballs, Diddy Kong and Donkey Kong throw a large banana, and so on. You can also unlock the special cup after you beat the star cup, which adds to the games 15 levels to make it 20. This game will be hard for kids, and maybe for some adults, but with practice you will succeed. Even after you have beaten the game on single player, you can still have your way with up to 3 other friends, or you can play on LAN.

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

BAD for VISTA!!!!","reviewText":"Read some of the other bad reviews on the web and here. I WISH I HAD!!!!!I played this game all the way through on XP and VISTA. For now, if you are running VISTA, without a patch specifically to fix the VISTA issues, you had best skip this game. Even on XP, it is a rough ride. At times, it did good and other times it drives you nuts!It is buggy as hell. I tried running this on 3 different gaming computers that I have. All are top of the line, screaming machines. One runs twin 7950's in SLI mode. Another has just a simple 7600 GT. It runs ok if you turn the settings way down. YUCK!!! The graphics are not that good turned all the way up! lolThe latest patch has made a huge difference. Before that, this game ran like garbage. It crashed for no reason, saves got corrupted. Those problems still happen, not as much though.The game play? Well, you only have one way to play the game....up close and personal until you get half of the way through. Then you get some decent weapons. If you don't shoot the head and if you don't do it close your enemy most likely will not die!!! Very ANNOYING after the first 10 times you do that!The graphics are completely outdated. You can tell they have been working on this game for 5 years.If anyone thinks this game is better than HL2, FEAR or Far Cry...you have got to stop doing drugs!!!!Now, I will say that the concept is great and some of the ideas and obstacles in this game are great. STALKER will be seen as what could have been but didn't quite get there. Hopefully, this group will get to make a sequel and get it right.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2007"}

Also most of them tend to want a membership fee and all that Visa/Mastercard stuff hasn't applied to me in years so in the end I have to rely on console ports and more specifically, ports to the Playstation 3. A game like Half-Life 2 got massive praise, Gordon Freeman is practically a household name in a gamer's home and the Orange Box contains count em 5 games for you to get through. However, I wouldn't say I was absolutely blown away by Half-Life 2 and its 2 episodes but I can say I did enjoy it to a certain extent. Now, Portal on the other hand...Half-Life 2 (Episodes One and Two): 3 games that deal with the adventures of Gordon Freeman after his mishaps at the Black Mesa Research Facility from the first Half-Life. City 17 is a dystopian environment, the Combine forces have taken control and places can get overrun by strange creatures. Gordon Freeman helps the human resistance and takes the fight to the Combine through the episodes.Now when I first rented this game, I got a couple chapters in after dealing with an atrociously-controlled motorboat and thought the game isn't worth this much aggravation. Wanting to at least give it another chance, I got it again and made it past there and while I still think there's nothing really here that makes me think \"amazing!\", I have to say I had more fun later on, mainly thanks to the Gravity Gun. It reminds me of the Kinesis gun from the recent Dead Space where getting a faraway object allows you to drop it to create stepping stones or shoot it away from you. This comes in 2 uses: use it against debris such as abandoned cars and my favorite, launching explosive barrels at enemies as bombs or finding saw blades and launching them at their bodies and well, \"torsos\" is the word there. Later on, you get an item that allows you to command a previously dangerous-to-you enemy and now you can unleash them on enemies and it's a blast seeing them beat enemies to death.My problem is that for all the technical achievements and fun aspects Valve put into the game, they also suffer one problem I don't notice a lot, that of delays. Not in terms of the game itself (since as I said, I don't follow the PC game scene) but within the game. Many times, I'll be playing and it'll be fun but then it gets derailed as I have to spend an inordinate amount of time to go do something in order to progress. For example, halfway in the game I get a buggy. Many, many times I have to get out of the thing, go somewhere and turn off a shield or clear away abandoned cars in order to leave and in one strange case, carefully traverse I-beams of a bridge and turn off a shield so my buggy can go on train tracks. Why can't it just be a nearby tower and not go through 20 minutes of careful walking? Or for that matter, shorten the time needed for use of the buggy?Now, then we have Portal. And yes Portal is unbelievably short as I finished it literally in one 2 and a half hour sitting. However, the game is fun, brain-challenging and incredibly cute and funny. You play as a test subject for the Aperture Science. Given a gun which fires dual portals, you must clear a set number of room puzzles and make it to the next one. Fire one portal on the wall, one on a nearby ceiling and walk through and you'll find yourself tumbling from the ceiling. Another favorite tactic is putting one on a high up wall and one on the floor. Falling from high up, if you time it right, you'll go through the floor/high wall but more quicker than before, allowing access to previously inaccesible areas. Or in gLaDos terms, the AI running the tests, \"speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out\". This AI is arguably the star of the show as she's got a deadpan humor and has frequently hilarious bits of advice and comments. We also have the droids you have to work your way past which also is voiced by the same VA as the AI and have cute sing-songy type voices and if it wasn't for the fact that they're trying to kill me, their \"there you are\" thing would be adorable.I didn't bother checking out Team Fortress 2 so can't really comment about that but as for the games itself, if you're an FPS fan than obviously you've heard of Half-Life and most likely played them already and want them all on one package. For the rest of us, it's a good thing to check out and see what's all the fuss apart but it still won't unseat Bioshock, Shadow of the Colossus or Metroid Prime as one of my favorite games...and that's with all 5 games too.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2008"}

Of course the Sega fans weren't saying that- they could care less about the game or anything to do with Nintendo and all of Nintendo's fans!Let's move forward to the year 2004.  Is it still a good game?  Yes, but in my opinion, ONLY on 2-player mode.  I think the 2-player battle mode (where you defeat your opponent by hitting them with turtle shells) is quite fun and the main reason to own the game.The thing is, I don't see ANY of my high school friends anymore.  I'm all alone now, so none of those friends come over anymore to play the battle mode with me.  I'm forced to play the game by myself, and as a 1-player game, Super Mario Kart just isn't very good.  Too many awesome racing games have come along since Super Mario Kart, including the newer Super Mario Kart on the Gamecube (which I haven't played, but I can only assume is MUCH better on 1-player mode).  What I'm trying to say is that the 1-player options don't really have anything interesting about them.However, Super Mario Kart was pretty fun when I was younger.

Game can take around 15-20 hours if you want to)You remember Looking Glass Studios, right?  The famous company who revolutionized PC games in the 90's?  In general, LGS was one of the best studios ever, spawning some of the most innnovative game play ideas, which in turn has a lasting impact on games today.  They are one of the most important video game studios to ever exist, a truly maverick studio that gave way to game innovation that still has a lasting impact.  Why, do you ask, does this concern Dishonored?  Well, I'm happy to state that Dishonored is the latest game to truly take inspiration from the Looking Glass legacy.  Dishonored is easily one of the best games of the year, and it's one of those games that truly doesn't fall into any neat genre.  An Immersive simulation* is the best genre Dishonored falls into, and it's the best game in this all-too-small genre since Deus Ex: Human Revolution.There is much to talk about concerning Dishonored.  Let's start with it's fiction.  Dishonored's fiction, for the most part, succeeds.  It's a brand new IP that truly feels fresh, and it's both distinct and memorable.  You are Corvo Attano, a former legendary body guard, now a rogue assassin as the result of being framed by the corrupt leadership of Dunwall.  Straightforward enough, right?  Well, the somewhat straightforward story doesn't at all reflect the fact that Dishonored's insane world is anything but straightforward.  Its personal revenge driven story isn't all that exciting by itself, but it truly falls upon a unique setting that manages to transcend its general plot, and makes for something extremely memorable.  Dishonored's characters are interesting, its art style is an oasis in the horrendously vapid desert of \"realistic\" visual styles, and Dunwall is a stunning, engrossing location.  It all adds up to make one of the most unique gaming experiences of the year.Dishonored has quite possibly one of the best settings in a video game since Fallout 3's Capital Wasteland.  Dunwall serves as a backdrop for the plot, and it's an extremely imaginative location with tons of absolutely enticing political and social over tones.  Whale oil, political corruption (always a staple!), class division, population purification, rats, assassins, giant machinated monstrosities, and industrialization are all embedded within Dishonored's awesome world.  Oh, and disease.  Lot's and lot's of disease.  It's all set in a stunning amalgam of late 18th century/early 19th century Europe and the futuristic tendencies of Half-Life 2 (particularity the Combine structures). It is a killer set up in a vibrant environment, and it's simulation game play model falls upon some memorable locales, interesting characters, and all end up making Dishonored a great experience.  Along the way, a unique cast of characters rounds out the story, from assassins to natural philosophers, corrupt political leaders and horrifying zombies who weep blood.  Dishonored as a new IP shines, and it's truly excellent.Unfortunately, the story of Dishonored isn't perfect.  Dishonored is well written, features interesting characters, and has a beautifully realized world but it's narrative structure is somewhat inconsistent.  Its ending is a tad abrupt, and it sags with its narrative thrust at times.  Most importantly, the game really didn't capitalize on the Outsider, which was a shame given how interesting the character was.  You feel it doesn't dig as deep into the character as you wanted it to, and since the character is so intriguing it ultimately feels like a lost opportunity.  HOWEVER, it's not a deal breaker, though.  Even though the story doesn't reach its full narrative potential the whole way, its amazing art design, interesting characters, amazing setting, and player driven story telling don't let some story shortcomings suck up the whole experience.  You shouldn't be worried about the plot overall, because Dishonored is ultimately a memorable experience.The technical side came out unscathed, and while they probably aren't the most technically impressive around, Dishonored proves art direction wipes the floor with blistering tech.  Having said that, it was the sound that almost even more impressive.  The Sound design is outstanding.  It's carefully crafted to the point of a sound scape.  At the risk of sounding pretentious, it really does work for the game like prose does for a novel.  The voice acting is just as good, with some huge names on the roster.  Susan Sarandon (Dead Man Walking), Michael Madsen (Reservoir Dogs), Carrie Fisher (Star Wars), Brad Douriff (One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest), John Slattery (Mad Men), and Chloe Grace-Moertz all lend their voice talents to Dishonored.  We all know that having big talent on board makes sure the characters get the voices they deserve, and Dishonored succeeds with its characters.Oh, and as a side note, no asinine morality systems! I won't spoil anything, but for those who are sick of game developer's obvious failures to implement interesting moral choice will be pleased at Dishonored's Chaos System. Basically, your actions and how many enemies you kill affect the rest of the game in permutations and numerous incremental changes within the world, not through binary, A-B-C type changes.  It's refreshing to see developers finally understanding how to really tackle \"morality\": leave it all up the player and let them decide for themselves, and instead stress consequence for their actions.As nice as this all is, Dishonored's game play is easily the shining star.  Dishonored is the newest game in the \"immersive simulation\" genre, where numerous genres and storytelling collide into one experience.  Dishonored is a true spiritual successor to the Looking Glass pedigree, and those who long for the days of Thief and Deus Ex (two of the game's main influence) will be excited once they get their hands on this one.  Don't fret though.  This isn't a \"lite\" version of anything that came before it.  You are going to get a new game experience; this is not a carbon copy of either game series. Instead, Dishonored keeps LGS's spirit deep within their design philosophies, and they created something unique and fresh.  It's a game that refuses to be lassoed by genre conventions and spits in the face of the focus-group and play testers, offering a truly amazing mix of stealth, first person action, sword play, complemented with a sick arsenal of (mixable!) magic and gadgets.As expected, the best part is how Dishonored focuses on emergent game play.  As a result of the terrific game design, the game truly rewards replay and gives you the amazing thing we call player freedom. The levels themselves only make this even better. Dishonored is not open-world, as each level is a mission, with a hub level in between each mission (think something like Monster Hunter). However, like Crysis, each level is essentially a sandbox; and how!  Aside from the baffling amount of combat freedom, the levels themselves are extremely sprawling and open ended, carefully suited to match and reward every play style any gamer chooses to do so.  The combat here is extremely deep, and you can take your own approach in any way you seem fit, from sneaky stealth to all out action (and yes, you can play through the whole game without killing a SINGLE person!), as well as mix between the two.  Basically, if you think you can do it, you probably can.  In fact, players have done things the game makers themselves didn't know was previous possible!  That's just awesome. Just wait and see what happens when the creative players get their hands on this one and experiment with the game play.Each of the nine missions constantly reward exploration like no other game I've seen.  There are so many ways to accomplish your objective, and in addition to the huge, extremely well made levels, the numerous side missions alongside the regular mission will provide even more playtime.  The huge levels surely provide for some truly open ended game play, and you will want to do just that.  Plus, no other game will want you to explore everything the levels have to offer, and doing so yields plenty of great rewards.  It's the only way to get ruins and find the bone charms in order to alter your play style as you see fit.To accomplish this, Dishonored's power and weapon system had to be extremely varied and flexible.  Dishonored doesn't let you down.  By collecting runes, bone charms, and money throughout the game, your play style is truly customizable in a vast amount of ways.  Want to upgrade your crossbow so it sets your enemies on fire?  You can do that.  Want to choke an enemy out at the speed of light and be a general stealth machine? You can do that too!  What's more, you can upgrade the numerous powers in order to help you specialize the play style you want to go for.  Stealth players will be able to upgrade their level of vision, while those who prefer summoning rats will be able to do that to.  Plus, being able to equip numerous powers in order to, say, improve your swimming speed, or being able to improve the effects of your elixirs.  Dishonored's RPG level customization ensures you that, even with a game that will take you around twenty hours (and you should take that long), you will want to play it again and again, just to see what else you can do.  It's a big layer of player freedom of an already player driven game, and that is all the more refreshing in a world of hand-holding, linearity, and restrictive game play.  Dishonored's game play really has the joy of discovery within it, and it's up to you to discover all that can be done with the game play system.With the various NPC's around, you'll need all the tools you can get.  Their AI, when they become your potential enemy, is some of the best I've ever come across.  The game's ability really does hinge on the NPC AI, and thankfully, Dishonored's AI is intelligent enough to support this (although you should play on the highest difficulty level to support this).  Dishonored's advanced AI system allows for some truly unique AI, a dynamic system that controls the enemies through numerous factors.  Sight, sound, perception, state of alertness, and every change to the world around you effects what happens in the mission.  Playing carefully and being aware of everything you do is crucial to surviving the story, and it ensures that the encounters you come across in the game will make you think.Dishonored is really one of those games that we don't see too often.  Enjoy it.  For me, this is easily the best game of 2012.  Unless something ends up surprising me this year, I don't see Dishonored losing out the GOTY crown.  It is games like this that make me believe that video games still have a pulse.  The legacy of Looking Glass Studios still radiates through the game industry, and games like Dishonored prove it.  So get off the fence and get it.  You won't regret it!PS: If you're interested in what I mean be immersive simulation, check out the comment box for an article describing the genre, by Steve Gaynor of Indie Game fame.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2012"}

I bought it recently thinking it would be a big hit with my kids.  Well, I practically have to beg them to even play it at all, just to make me feel like I didn't waste $40 totally.Where to start?  The games are not intuitive to play like many Wii games.  It's frustrating to try to toss a ball or dart in a carnival game and not be able to do it without hitting the right buttons.  The games are very limited in scope---most have nothing beyond the one simple action to do---shoot a duck, throw a basketball, pop a balloon.  Once you master that, you're pretty bored.  There is little incentive to get better.  The \"prizes\" are basically small pictures of a prize.  The biggest prices make some sort of noise and can be turned around---major thrill!  I think of things like the trophies in Smash Brothers which really seem almost like toys you can touch.  The games are not tied together with the feel of a real carnival---they are just reached by signposts of their category, and the categories don't make a lot of scene.  I thought you would be able to wander around a virtual carnival, but no such luck.  Many of the game's features are confusing.  For example, when we tried to play a two player game, it took us forever to figure out how to use two controllers and not just pass one back and forth---you have to turn around a sign to do that, and it's not well explained.  Two player mode is pretty much just playing the same game with alternating turns, and you get no prizes or tickets in two player.The main game my kids wanted most to try was the Skeeball type one.  It was hard to control and not very fun---in keeping with the rest of the game.I give the game 2 stars as it's an interesting concept, and a few games were mildly fun for a while---balloon pop and duck shooting to name them!  Overall, I felt cheated and bored by the game, as did my kids.  I really wonder why all the reviews are so good.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2007"}

Berntsen","summary":"Poor guy never got a chance. :(","reviewText":"While I can't stand the way Sega killed off their console marketshare with shoddy peripherals like the Sega 32x, I can't really berate the Sega CD. In all fairness, CD attachments were expected to be quite fashionable at the time-- The Turbo GrafX 16 and Atari Jaguar had them, and Nintendo was working with Sony to develop one for Super NES (which would later be released alone as the Playstation after Nintendo pulled out of the partnership). Then of course you had the Phillips CDI and a few other random CD-related doo-dads that never caught on. The CD age was coming, and everyone wanted to get their foot in the door early.Unfortunately, customers didn't want to pay extra to access games on a system they already owned. The CD technology wasn't quite ready, offering slow loading periods and poor video quality. 64 colors on an image 1/4 the size of the screen didn't exactly feel \"high tech\" when even a crappy VHS cassette would have looked better. The massive storage, superior audio, and cool mode 7 effects were great additions to the Genesis's power, but unfortunately most American developers only used the Sega CD to unleash upgraded ports of games already found on the Genesis, because Sega sadly did not have enough dev kits to go around.The system does have it's fare share of gems. Sonic CD, Snatcher, and Popful Mail are some of the system's brightest highlights, and then you've got a bunch of decent ports of old PC games. Sonic CD is probably the most notable though, because it's considered by many to be the best Sonic game ever made (it is also availible in the Sonic Gems collection for Gamecube and Japanese / PAL PS2, but the harcore player will always choose the original). If you find a Sega CD for a decent price, there's really not much excuse not to pick one up. How much you're willing to spend, is up to you. Considering this thing cost $300 when it came out, $25 at a yard sale is a steal.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2008"}

Get the Playstation 3 or if you must have a XBOX GET THE EXTENDED WARRANTY it came with a 90 day warranty for a reason.There are over 3 and one half million posts on XBOX 360 CRASH on the Internet.Microsoft obviously knew they were selling a totally inadequate product from the start and that is why they cut the warranty to only 90 days.None of us really expect much from Microsoft, but they have intentionally cheated me and many thousands of other XBOX 360 purchasers and casually deny any culpability.One star is not nearly low enough I would give them minus 360 stars if I could.Also, really good games that take good advantageof the 360's capabilities have been really slow in comming out.At least with the Playstation 3 you will have out of the Box true 1080 P BluRay DVD capability, some decent games and a real warranty.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2006"}
{"product_name":"B000TG72OW","reviewerName":"AeroEngineer","summary":"Rockstar Listen Up!!","reviewText":"Since everyone copies GTA, I think RS could look around and take some of the better ideas other games have, not just sandboxes. I think Scarface and Saints Row are the standout clones of the past. Here's a couple I can think of:1. After you finish the story allow a separate \"mission select\" game save where you can pick and choose any mission in the game, not unlike Rainbow Six Vegas' \"scene selection\" premise. Just minus out the before and after cut scenes to basically make it like the assassin missions.2. Allow direct saving via the cell phone at any time. It's lame to have to go to the apartment and watch the little sleeping scene to just save. I know that it auto saves but I've had it lose some of my save before to have to redo 2 or more missions after it supposedly auto saved. I don't think this would make the missions too easy as most of the time you cant really use the phone during missions anyways, someone will show up and shoot you before you get to it.3. Come out with a simple easy to use custom mission creator pack for modders that is cross platform after the PC version comes out. With XBoxLive and whatever PS3 uses for online, people could buy/sell/give away created missions/scenarios. It would be a great value and XBL/PS3/Rockstar could charge a small commission for the transaction to get their piece. I wish they would have done expansion packs for San Andreas in the long years between games or had an easy to use modders pack. Obviously this would have to have some sort of disclaimer as to the \"hot coffee\" stuff, but come on this is GTA. Most people would agree that murder is a LOT worse than sex anyways, but the authorities in the country have it grossly backwards.4. Have some more sophisticated missions that don't just involve go here/kill everyone/run from police scenario we all know is basically the GTA MO. Look at Assassin's Creed or Thief and get some idea. I wish there was more sniping missions/side missions. Don't get me wrong, the combat in this game is much more satisfying than previous games with the cover system. Not sure exactly because I don't have specific examples but I think you can just look around at other games and get ideas.5. Make a simple all or nothing decision about the customization. None of this half way stuff like in 4, more like the all the way like in SA. I suppose the big thing is by about half way you have way more money than you can use to buy anything, why can't I scrimp to buy an Infernus any time I want? Or advanced weapons(M4 scope/rocket launcher, laser pointer)? I'd like to trick out my Comet/Porsche with better rims/acceleration/brakes and a custom uploaded paint job. I want a phone that has more options like a keyboard so I can see the internet anywhere or watch the TV anywhere. What about a 500000 store only non-spawning race car that handles like an F1 car?This is a must have game and is awesome but needs to be developed more like the post GTA3 versions.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2008"}

Discover the true origins of Dracula and the Belmont family in this exciting first episode of the saga.","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"Castle May Cry","reviewText":"Its ironic that this game is called Lament of Innocence, or Crying over Innocence, when it resembles another game that involves Crying in the title so closely. I suppose that it could be used as a way of telling Castlevania fans &quot;This still isn't the game you've been waiting for, in fact it's a rip off of Devil May Cry.&quot; And sadly that's exactly what it feels like.I've come to the conclusion that every so often Castlevania must undergo a tremendous change in order to survive. It keeps the series alive, and keeps it from getting stagnant, which is very easy for this series to do, often times because sequels take as many steps backward as they do forward. The exceptions would be Symphony of the Night, and Aria of Sorrow. The vast majority of the series is still stellar, with very few installments being bad games, or flat out unenjoyable (All three original GameBoy titles come to mind, as well as the 2 N64 titles. The rest of the games all range from being great to superb). This game is great, and very enjoyable, however it is not what I was hoping for. The camera is an annoyance, and tracks Leon Belmont like Devil May Cry, the controls are set up like Devil May Cry, everything about this game screams Devil May Cry, which is sad because I have always wanted Castlevania in 3D, (only not so clumsily as it was on the N64) and now I have a much better version of the game in 3D but its lost so much in the translation, this time, where as the last one lost its game play, we loose a lot of variety of levels... long corridor leads to a room, which leads to another long corridor, ala Devil May Cry... except DMC had more variety to its scenery. Where are the forests? The Catacombs? And while I haven't beaten the game yet there's no sign of the classic clock tower either! Where are the deep plat-forming elements? As terrible as Legacy of Darkness was I loved the clock tower in that game, although I felt it was too short... And I have to confess that I have cheated a bit and I have glimpsed through the guidebook, there really doesn't seem to be a clock tower stage. Maybe it would have been to hard to do with the camera system... maybe Konami should have done something else with the camera? Maybe Konami should have put a little more thought into this game. While it is very polished, it does not FEEL like a Castlevania game to me, aside from the art style of Ayami Kojima, which thankfully saves this game's style from falling flat on its face.If Konami wants to make me happy by copying another game's engine that engine should be a Zelda game. Give us the RPG elements, give us a castle that will take 48 hours of real time to explore, give us a forest, a swamp, a clock tower to explore not just six levels of endless corridors. More variety please!And don't get me started on the music. For a game that has advertised itself as having fully orchestrated music I must say I am disappointed as I have only found a couple of tunes that have been noteworthy, nothing on the level of Symphony of the Night, or the Recent Soul Calibur 2, both of which featured phenomenal and epic soundtracks. Lament of Innocence simply lacks any music that really screams &quot;Castlevania&quot; at this point in the game (Level 4) which means the game doesn't have much longer to amend this flaw. Simply put this game is lacking in length, in variety, in depth, in originality, and most disappointing of all (since music is generally a huge part of Castlevania) it lacks in a truly noteworthy score. I hate having to rip apart the latest entry in my all time favorite game series, but sadly that's how let down I feel by this game, when I was expecting much more than just another Devil May Cry Clone.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2003"}
{"product_name":"B008CP6RUW","description":"","reviewerName":"The Duck of Indeed","summary":"Amazing","reviewText":"I have not played the other \"Uncharted\" games, so I can't say how this one compares to those.  This is actually not the usual type of game I buy, but I got it because it was part of the least expensive PS3 bundle at the store.  I ended up being glad I got it, though, because it is a very good game.  This game has an interesting story (and I like how it relates in some ways to real people and events in history) and follows Nathan Drake's adventure to find the \"Atlantis of the Sands\".This game is a lot of fun, and I think there is good variety in the gameplay.  There is exploring and lots of climbing around.  (Drake has nearly superhuman climbing abilities.)  There are 100 or so treasures to find (though, I don't know if you get anything from finding them all).  There is gun fighting, with a good variety of different guns you can use.  You can also attack your enemies in hand-to-hand combat, too, if you wish.  There are also some great puzzles to solve.  These are my favorite parts of the game.  Some of these puzzles can be quite difficult and really get me thinking.  This game has some of the better puzzles I've seen in video games (and I wish there were more).  This game also has some really good action sometimes, but I won't say more because I don't want to spoil anything....  (The stuff on the ship I thought was pretty cool, though....)The locations are also pretty interesting in this game.  The graphics are very good, and the locations are very detailed.  These locations take place in various countries like Colombia and Yemen, and I kind of feel like I'm really there.  To be more specific, there are some interesting old castles to explore.  Old tunnels.  A few towns.  A ship.  (The location at the end of the game is simply amazing.)  The game is a decent length and is broken down into 22 chapters and so is pretty linear, but there is a little room to do some exploring.  (As a side note, the music and the voice acting are good, too.)My biggest problem with the game is I think the gun fighting gets boring sometimes.  It just goes on for too long, and after spending all this time shooting a bunch of enemies, a lot more show up.  And I wouldn't mind so much if I was actually making some progress, at least.  But, instead I spend all this time hiding behind walls, then peeking out and shooting, then hiding again.  I can't just make a run for it because I'll get shot by a sniper or several machine guns and die before getting very far.  It just gets very tedious and boring sometimes.Other than that, this is a great game.  The story is good.  The graphics are great.  There is a good amount of variety, with fighting and exploring and puzzles and interesting locations, to keep you having fun.  I just wish that darn gun fighting didn't go on so long.  (By the way, I didn't check out the extras that came with this version, so I can't comment on that.)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2012"}

Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access.

This game is good enough to buy, but only if the price is around $30 to $40. The fun justifies everysingle penny if the price does not exceeds $40.I was not impressed with the graphics at all, in fact it feels like I am playing COD2. So far, the game with the best graphics is KILLZONE 2 for the PS3, but that's another story. Te multiplayer is nothing out of the ordinary, and I am still waiting for a multipleyer that is as fun as Rainbow Shix Las Vegas which was a great game for an amazing multiplayer experience.If you are a big fun of COD then you should buy it and replay it to justify the price. I do not regret bying this game because it is very fun and has reply value. One thing, I am really wishing for future CODs is to make it more personal, where you are brief on missions and you can select the weapons you feel more comfortable with. Probably it wont happen since it is not the scope of the game.Anyway, I belive 3 stars should be a fair rating for this game.

Lindquist","summary":"A Good Spirited RPG","reviewText":"So I know there has already been reviews from user like Michelle that point out a lot of the flaws in the game, but they also compare it directly to other Tales games. What I wanted to do was point out how great the game is as stand alone title instead of focusing on the fact it has \"Tales\" in it's title.I honestly must say that some gameplay in the game is shallow, like the cooking which I never actually used. The game though has a lot to offer which I want to sum up in my short review.The graphics are extremely inviting and colorful. I love this in Role Playing Games. Exploring towns was a real treat especially with an outstanding soundtrack to follow it. The composer really created the perfect combination of techno and orchestra music together to make a vibrant and excellent soundtrack. The composer even threw in a good deal of Jazz which really compliments the situations it's used in. I personally have a large interest in Anime and get really relaxed when I get to sit down and watch a great one like Trigun, CowBoy Bebop, etc, so exploring the towns, environments and the great humor of this game was a real treat.I don't have a lot of time in my day. I am married and I have a 3-month-old son. Sitting down and demanding an RPG that requires me to invest hours and hours into it with a slow evolving story just doesn't work for me anymore. This game moved fast and kept my interest for the 5 minutes to the 2 hours I could afford to play it during my weekdays. My Wife even loves to sit down and play it. I think the fact that it is has a bit shallower gameplay than the average or above average RPG fanatic enjoys makes this game really appeal to people with a full schedule. I enjoyed the perfect mix of gameplay, customization and story development and would recommend it for ANYONE that is looking for a great way to pass the time and put a smile on their face.With the great graphics and graphic style, the excellent soundtrack (btw the customer submitted picture that mentions that the music is cool in that area; that song is called \"The Bird Chirps, I Sing\" by an artist named: Kanon) and fun and funny (despite being a bit generic, which is sometimes half the fun) story I cant really say that these reviews that point out the bad are doing the good any justice.Go pick it up, it's cheap and you can't go wrong with quality.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2008"}

There is a defender hitting you sometimes before you even fake the handoff.  Not only is the playaction the worst play you can call, but you just don't feel like you have control over any players.  The moves are slow and robotic and you just don't feel good about it if you juke somone.  It's like being on ice skates the whole game.  I have also found that 2006 hasn't addressed the problem of QBs with speed being able to dominate.  Michael Vick can still roll out on every play and out run the entire defense.  He can pass or run and get the 1st down 9 out of 10 times.  I just don't think they play test these games long enough before they're released.  The makers of Madden need to have 50 12-year-olds in the studio playing this game for a week straight trying to find cheap plays and glitches.

The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive. Japanese  actor Takeshi Kaneshiro lent his voice to the main character, and a  200-piece orchestra delivers a dramatic score.Call over any PS2 skeptics in your neighborhood, then load upOnimusha: Warlords. A few minutes with this game may turn any  zombie gamer into a next-generation gaming system fan.--Eric  Twelker","reviewerName":"R.A. McKenzie","summary":"Good Start, But Way Too Short","reviewText":"\"Onimusha: Warlords\" must've blown people away back in 2001, but time has reared its ugly face on this first entry in a series that has spawned 3 sequels and 1 spinoff fighting game.  In many ways, this action title reminds me of \"ICO\" --- throughly engaging and never dull, but it's over before you know it.The gameplay is actually very easy to describe if you've played any of the \"Resident Evil\" games (besides \"RE 4\").  The player will use the D-Pad to navigate, while using 2 attack buttons to combat enemies.  There are even some \"RE\"-type puzzles and presentation (fixed camera, each room has its own loadtime, documents, etc.).  However, unlike Capcom's survival horror franchise, the controls ARE NOT clunky at all.  This game is faster-paced, and instantly grabs your attention.  There are very few stupid puzzles, and the weapons upgrades & item management is very simple.  Even when the game switches characters, or if you're lost...you know that you're supposed to be stuck.  \"Onimusha\" is a very user-friendly title.\"Onimusha\" offers the choice of Japanese or Engligh language AND subtitles (a terrific feature).  The story is either too simple or too vague, but what I gather is this: As Samanosuke, you once fought along with General Nobunaga until he is killed in combat.  Then Nobunaga is soon resurrected by demons to take over the world, and it's up to you to kill him while rescuing a princess.  Sadly, the story doesn't get much more detailed than that.  This is almost like a Mario story with bloody hack-and-slash in Middle Age Japan.The story is ultimately what brings \"Onimusha: Warlords\" down a notch, even though there's a lot to like about it.  The combat is easy to master and never gets too complicated.  The graphics still hold up well.  The music is excellent, and the voice acting is equally strong.  But gamers don't get a chance understand the world they're playing in.  For a game involving civil war and the supernatural, \"Onimusha\" is very simple and feels very isolated.In first paragraph, I compared this game to \"ICO\".  It was deliberately vague about the story, and depended entirely on its gameplay.  It featured a massive world and 2 characters you wanted to spend time with, even if you had no idea who they were.  \"ICO\" remains an art-house indie title, and can be forgiven for its 6-hour length.But \"Onimusha\" feels like a sucker-punch.  We meet several characters who seem important, but are never fully explained.  We're thrust into a story we learn only by reading journals.  We battle supernatural forces who seem only to exist within the confines of a castle keep.  We have much to excited about, but experience very little after only 5 hours.  I don't mind games ending with loose ends.  \"God of War II\", \"Metal Gear Solid\", and \"Halo 2\" are masterpieces.  We didn't mind the ambiguous ending because we knew that an individual entry was a part of a larger universe.I have yet to play the sequels to this game, and I do intend on purchasing them.  But I urge gamers to be careful with this first installment.  I paid $4 & Tax at a GameStop store, and I still felt a little jipped.  \"Onimusha: Warlords\" is a solid action game with outstanding presentation.  It's never boring and always fun.  Just don't expect much after a few hours.Back in 2001, I would've given \"Onimusha: Warlords\" (8.75 / 10)But now it's 2008, and games have evolved.  I say (8.25 / 10)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2008"}

{"product_name":"B002I0IVC4","description":"","reviewerName":"ChrisInCali","summary":"The Best 3DS launch game","reviewText":"The 3DS launch has been lacking at best in terms of software, especially if you are a \"hardcore\" gamer. While games like Pilotwings and Nintendogs may appeal to you if you haven't played any other versions of Nintendogs on the original DS, the vast majority of the launch titles have been rushed and aren't worth the time to play. However, one \"rehash\" that the 3DS has is actually better in some ways than the console versions I played.I didn't like Street Fighter IV on the Xbox 360. I thought the Xbox 360 controller was horribly tailored for a fighting game(though, the PS3 controller is MUCH better).  That's one reason why I like Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition so much better than its console counterparts.  Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition is a port of Super Street Fighter IV, with a few new additions and changes here and there. Super Street Fighter IV was a version of Street Fighter IV that included new characters and modes, but the core gameplay remained the same.There are still issues here. Spamming attacks is an easy way to win matches online. In fact, it's incredibly easy to spam attacks and pull off victory after victory; those that actually try to play the game by pulling off combos and timing attacks will get annoyed. In the regular side-scrolling mode, any projectile attack can be spammed nonstop thanks to a new feature using the 3DS's touch-screen that I will get into a bit later. In the new 3D mode, which is characterized by the fact that it uses an over-the-shoulder camera, simply crouching and using heavy kicks makes it almost impossible to lose.  Which ends up for a very annoying experience.However, when an opponent is found online that doesn't go for cheap victories, the fights are immensely satisfying. While the 3DS's design makes the controls a tad frustrating, at the same time, the unique capabilities of the 3DS also makes the game less frustrating and more entertaining. The touchscreen is used to hold four different and powerful combo attacks. While pulling off combos on the Xbox 360 requires a lot of patience and practice, hitting an opponent with an ultra combo is just a tap away. Because of this, there are a lot more ultra and super combo attacks in matches, but they never make the game feel cheap. It's easy to block these attacks, and pulling them off successfully requires precise timing and skill, even when using the touchscreen.Personally, I love the touchscreen implementation. I'm sure many fighting game enthusiasts will still insist on learning all the combos and such, and thankfully online battles can be filtered to not include those using the touchscreen to help them in battles. However, the touchscreen is a double-edged sword.Unfortunately, going from the touchscreen to the face buttons can be a bit of a clumsy process.  What is really annoying, though, is when people abuse the touchscreen in online matches to spam attacks and make the experience so frustrating.There are a ton of characters available to play as in this game, as is expected, as it includes the entire roster from Street Fighter IV as well as the new fighters added in Super Street Fighter IV. Each character has their own storyline in the arcade mode, which I found to be a lot more enjoyable this time around thanks to the easier controls that the 3DS provides, and a lot more balanced than the online modes. On top of that, the characters also have their own trial modes that challenge players to pull off specific combos and such, just like the console versions of the game. And if that wasn't enough, each character has multiple variations of statues that can be won through a mini-game called figure roulette, with a total of 500 figures waiting to be collected in the game.Now, what about the 3D in this 3DS game?  Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition doesn't do anything all that spectacular with the 3D, but it's the most polished 3D experience on the portable that I've played yet. There was never a \"ghosting\" problem (where objects and characters in the game break out into doubles) that I experienced, and the game never bothered my eyes as many other 3DS games have. I play this game with the 3D on max the entire time. Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition has a sort of layering effect going on with the menus, and the words that flash on the screen before and after fights seem to pop out. The fighters seem to stick out of the screen slightly as well, especially when they are facing the screen. At one point, Ken pointed at the screen, and his hand and arm were clearly extended farther out of the screen than his body. The 3D also makes the fights look rather cool. It looks like a couple of action figures are battling it out inside of a diorama or something. Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition doesn't use the 3D in the most creative ways, but it does manage to do the 3D better than any other game I have played on the system to date.The overall visuals are rather nice. The cel-shaded character models look nice, the framerate is mostly good(gets worse with 3D enabled), and the cut-scenes during the arcade mode are nice. On the downside, the background people and objects during battles are static and never move. At all.  It's not a big deal, but it seems like the 3DS may already be getting pushed to it's graphical limitations.I've spent quite a few hours with Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition, but I decided to write this review when I realized I no longer had any ambition to regularly play it. That's what SSFIV3D's biggest problem is going to be: the staying power. Yeah, there's a nice amount of modes, and the multiplayer modes certainly bolster the replayability, as does the achievement-like medal system--but the game is bound to get extremely repetitive. After playing through the arcade mode with a few characters, playing through it a bunch of other times with all the different characters just for cut-scenes gets extremely boring. The same goes for the trial modes, and any other single-player modes. The online multiplayer will keep people coming back, but I imagine that many will use SSFIV3D for short bursts over a period of time.Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition is one of the more solid launch titles for the Nintendo 3DS. The multiplayer is the best part about the game, easily, and while the other modes will be fun for a while, they do grow old quicker than they should. The balance in the game is still broken in my estimation, but overall, the improvements here are mainly positive ones. Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition is a lot of fun, and I imagine those who haven't played Street Fighter IV or Super Street Fighter IV on consoles will be able to enjoy it even more.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2011"}

I have read a lot about the fun, but also the bad graphics and dissapearing cars issue and other graphical hiccups.I am only a few hours into but it is a game I have played 2x in one day.  Not since Mercs 2 did I do this.  It is a very fun open world crime/gang game.Also the graphics to me look good, just like mercs 2 and the sabotuer did.  The character customization is what sold me on the game.  I love being the female main character.  That's why I bought Wet, Mercs 2, and Mass Effect 2.  You can tell the company put a lot of time into this the world is alive with so much people, cars, business, and the missions/side mission I have played were in different and very cool locations.Also the gameplay is pretty tight.  I am not fully used to the driving yet but like the cruise control and hand brake style of driving where you can accelerate and decelerate and use the hand brake all while staying in cruise control.I like how fluid the character moves and the shooting seems to have some weight and it's bloody without be overly gory like borderlands.  Another game I loved.There are tons of missions and side missions and you can enter a lot of buildings which is cool for a sand box game.Now I am not into the gang stuff in real life, but I like the gangstar movies.  I am still enjoying it anyway.  Also the music is pretty good they got rock, metal, 80's, jazz, classical, regaee, and some others.  Really not sure about the jazz.  Oh yah probably hip hop too.Anyway about the cars dissapearing and graphic hiccups being stuck etc.  Maybe I've been lucky or something but not noticed any of that.  I know when I put the disc in it installed the latest update so maybe the update was to fix those issues.Anyway, I will update this review later just wanted to emphasize that the grapics are good and the gameplay is fun and tight.Kevinadded next day 4/9/11Played a few more hrs and so much fun.

The atmosphere, music, facial expressions, and story are amazing.  I want to advance through the game as quickly as possible to find out how things progress.  However, the completely hit-or-miss interrogation sessions and rooting through garbage can crime scene investigation have me sick enough to quit.The facial expressions and voice acting are just as incredible as advertised.  I knew going into this that picking up on facial ticks and eye darting were key to detecting inconsistencies in testimony.  Still, no matter how you play it, there's no way to tell whether you should believe, doubt, or catch the witness in a lie.  Some of the lying is completely obvious, yet you still lose for not selecting the correct choice between \"doubt\" or \"lie\".  I don't mind doing more investigation to solve the case, but I hate feeling like a failure when the game gives me no other options or assistance.I also tired of the same old crime scene investigations.  You move from area to area, waiting for the controller to rumble so that you can investigate.  Sometimes its evidence worthwhile, but more often its just a bottle or an ashtray worth nothing.  Often times you find yourself re-examining an area after all other evidence has been found, as if you'd missed something the first time.It pains me to write this review.  I had this preordered, and had been counting down the months to its release.  I still find it an amazing piece of entertainment, pushing the boundaries of what a video game can be.  Yet some of the elements are just not implemented in a way that can be considered fun, or an attainable challenge.  When you don't know why you're getting things wrong or misinterpreting information, there's no reason to hone your technique or continue.  I'll probably just finish this up with a strategy guide so I know how to answer the interrogations.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2011"}

I prefer more simplistic mice where as my other half wants more buttons than you can shake a stick at.  So when I saw this mouse I thought it would be the perfect item for me to test out and review.  Here are my thoughts on the Logitech G700s Rechargeable Gaming Mouse;Pros+ Usable both wired and wirelessly.+ Quick and easy installation.+ 13 programmable buttons.+ Patterned textures on the side of the mouse makes gripping easier.+ Left flange allows your thumb to guide the mouse movement easily.+ Internal memory allows you to store 5 different profiles.+ Middle mouse button can be used to click left and right.  Scroll wheel can also be switched to silent (no clicking while scrolling).+ Removable rechargeable battery included.+ Wireless adapter stores in the battery case beneath the mouse.+ Instantly adjust your DPI.+ Great ergonomic design.+ Smooth glide movement.+ Lengthy USB cable.+ Sleek and simple look.Cons- Not really designed for ambidextrous use.  Sorry lefties!- May be a bit too heavy for some users.- Wireless battery life could be a little longer.- No charging dock.- A bit spendy.The \"Logitech G700s Rechargeable Gaming Mouse\" is a solid and well thought out gaming mouse aimed toward MMO and FPS players but usable by all.  This mouse has quickly become my new favorite gaming mouse.  Its sturdy construction, excellent ergonomic shape, numerous button layouts and incredible accuracy make this mouse easy to recommend.  The option of wired/wireless use is a fantastic feature and switching between the two is seamless.  The lack of a charging stand is a bit of a miss on Logitech's part, especially at the price point.  But, overall this is an outstanding multi-functional gaming mouse sure to please even the most hardcore players while being equally functional for everyday use.

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Ben-Oni \"Darkness\"","summary":"I DEMAND THAT YOU PURCHASE THIS GAME.","reviewText":"I can actually play this game!!!! my parents are extremely religious as am I and I got this  game and here's the kicker WE'RE ALL OK WITH IT!!!!. no blood no other gods (outside of greek mythology the disney movie hercules) parents can let their children play this game  without very much worry at all!!! and it isn't all cotton candy and rainbows either its got an actual plot! the kid will like it too!.

Just so you know...)While there are many options out there, this one has always stood out to me in both atmosphere and gameplay.  I'll come back to this one again and again over the much more powerful Modern Warfare series just as sure as you might return to the original mario over his 3D options, and for the same reasons: increased power and hardware doesn't necessarily make it more playable.One thing Call of Duty used to do which set the games apart from Medal of Honor (and which they've recently lost touch with in Black Ops and World at War) was give the feeling of being one small part of a much larger conflict.  One man in an army as opposed to a one-man army, if you get my drift.  For years, FPS had relied on the old standard of making you into a super soldier and god of the battle field before whom the enemy crumbles like the Berlin Wall (too soon?).  And that's all well and good, but I've been doing that since Doom for crying out loud and a change once a decade or so can be a good thing.  Call of Duty switched things up and did an excellent job of dropping you into a CHAOTIC battlefield with often vague orders (\"Soldier... go take that hill, don't ask how, just do it!\") that made you feel almost insignificant.  You were never alone on the battlefied (if you were, you were about to die) and the feel was as close to being in live battle as part of an army as I would ever want to come.Call of Duty 3 took some serious steps backward in gameplay; quick-time events and loading animations frequently reminded you that, yes, you are playing a video-game.  Call of Duty 4 (otherwise known as the game that change the face of the FPS) took great strides in many, many directions and recaptured that sense of being as small, fragile portion of a larger conflict; but for me it came with this hard-to-describe uneasy feeling.  The murder has become too real for my taste, it's official.  Fantasy has slipped to far away and takes away from my overall enjoyment and desire to ever play the damn thing again.  The Modern Warfare games are undeniably marvles of the format... I just never need to play them twice.Call of Duty 2 has kept me entertained for more hours than I care to admit.  The level designs are memorable and engaging, the AI is just fine, the game physics are satysfying without being disturbing, and the sound design is as top-notch as anything you'll find (tell me you weren't pumped when your Russian Comrades lead an all out charge against the retreating Nazis in the second level; tell me that battle cry after some frantic sniping didn't make ya tingle!).  It's easy, guilt-free (moslty), and exciting warfare that can be picked up and put down or explored in depth as you wish.  It's an extremely playable and effective game that stands up to it's overpowered younger brothers and a definite needed addition to any game library.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2011"}

The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

The story is very suspenceful, it constantly keeps you wondering what's gonna happen next, how is Squall and Laguna connected and what evil plan is the sorceress Edea going to come up with.Magic points used for casting magic is null and void in this game.  Instead, you have a draw system.  You draw magic from your enemies which you can either stock away for later use or you can actually use the magic right then.  Leveling up in this game doesn't mean a thing, really, seeing how when you level up, your enemies level up as well.  I kinda like that, makes the game more challenging.  Also, you don't earn money after every battle, but instead, get a steady \"paycheck\" at set times throughout the game.  The amount depends on what skill level you are on, the higher the level, the more money.You also have what are called Guardian Forces(GF) which you junction to your characters to make them stronger and to learn new abilites.  But, understanding this at first is a little frustrating, also, you are constantly switching the junctions around with other characters, which that also is irritating.Overall, this game so far has been awesome.

{"product_name":"B00009WAUH","description":"As renowned as theFinal Fantasyseries has become over the years, the release ofCrystal Chroniclesbrings with it an air of unfamiliarity. Although many of its elements tie into the greaterFinal Fantasyuniverse, this is but a faint echo of what you have come to know and love.While it can be argued that this is a new direction for the series, and therefore shouldn't be put on the same level as the other games, fans have come to expect the best fromFinal Fantasy, and with each passing release, Square has delivered.Crystal Chroniclesmay break new ground, but it lacks the creativity and passion of its role-playing brethren.As stylish as the character designs may be, they are completely void of personality. The story is just as ambiguous. Never once did I feel attached to my character, nor did I care what twists or turns the plot would make. TheFinal Fantasygames are renowned for storytelling, but it seems like an afterthought inCrystal Chronicles. Cinematic flair is also noticeably&nbsp;absent.The gameplay is just as careless and jagged. While the quest can be played single-player, it's meant to be tackled by a group of people (preferably four). Since each player utilizes menu screens often, Square and Game Designer's Studio decided that you could only play multiplayer with a Game Boy Advance attached to the GameCube. Hence, all menu management is done on the GBA screen, and the action on the TV is unaffected. In theory, this is a just solution. As it turns out, though, I found it to be more detrimental to the quest than anything.When a player accesses the GBA, their character on the TV cannot be controlled. Not only does this leave them open to attack, it more or less halts any progress that the group can make. So basically, you still find yourself sitting around waiting for your buddy to make preparations, but instead, you're doing it with a controller that has fewer buttons and dying batteries.To make matters worse, players must also keep an eye on a bucket. To prevent characters from scattering and trying to run in different directions, the bucket emits a field of energy that covers roughly 80 percent of the screen. If you go outside of this barrier, you'll take damage. So you basically must stay huddled together as one person carries the bucket throughout a stage. Without question, this is one of the stupidest ideas in the history of video games.When it comes to the basics of gameplay, the combat is respectable, but by no means great. I really like the timing-based combo system that accompanies both magic and general hack n' slash, yet I absolutely despise losing all of my magic with each new area that I enter. Hence, classes are not defined, and you never really get the impression that your character is growing in power.There's little here that truly excites.Crystal Chroniclesplays like an experiment gone awry, and is unfit to bear the sacrosanctFinal Fantasyname.Concept:A hack n' slash with inventive, yet highly aggravating GBA-based multiplayer connectivity, and a worthless bucketGraphics:Stylish character designs, gorgeous particle effects, and awesome boss designsSound:Not the familiarFinal Fantasymelodies, but memorable nonethelessPlayability:Steers away from button mashing with timing-based chains, manual spell aiming, and multi-person combosEntertainment:A cookie cutter adventure with a lackluster story, poor character growth, and frustrating playReplay:Moderately HighRated:7 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Crystal Chroniclesis here to remind us that every so often, Square Enix actually puts out an average game. It seems like for every thingFF: CCdoes right, it does two things wrong. Combining spells with your teammates is awesome, but half the time it's less effective than two individual castings, and you lose all of your magic between areas. The effects and character models are cool, but downtimes really drag and many cutscenes look awfully similar. The worst part, though, is that character advancement is the slowest I've ever seen. Beat a boss and get your choice of +1 to one of your stats! Thrilling. There is certainly some enjoyment to be had here, but it's sprinkled somewhat thinly among all of the lame and boring parts. On a console with a lot of great four-player titles,Crystal Chroniclesdoes very little to distinguish itself.Rated:7 out of 10Editor:Adam BiessenerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Marie","summary":"Ummm.","reviewText":"The game...is too boring for me.

After a weekend of play and testing out its different features, I am satisfied with with the games, still waiting for some anticipated titles, and have mixed feelings about the Wii U features. The Mii Verse app is cool, makes the entire system and every game interactive online in a way similar to Sony's Demon Soul where you can leave messages for future players. The home community is interesting, it is a giant forum where Miis interact with comments, questions and some amazing art. The online community makes the the overall experience more enjoyable but there is a lack of online interaction during the games themselves. The Online store is improved but still needs some work. The much hyped about Mii-TV is underwhelming, Nintendo said it wants MiiTV to replace your cable box, not yet; some of the features on the Mii TV are still not available. The available games are stellar but there are too few, some of the launch window games won't be coming out for a few more months, there is more third party support than in the past but it is not as robust as other systems, The system was rushed to the market and because of that some of the keys apps are still rolling out and are being tweaked. The few games available are fun and unique but the Wii U has some ways to go before becoming the the media center/hub Nintendo said it would be.First Wii U - Horn of Death:Pre-ordered the Wii U after a great experience with the Wii, got the Wii on day one and this past year I spend more time playing it than any other system with great games like Xenoblade Chronicles and a back log of classics.I got the Wii U on day one and unfortunately I encountered issues like many early adopters of technology in general but rare for a company like Nintendo. It is no secret that the Wii U has had a rough launch with huge/slow system updates and multiple key features like the Wii TV missing, I was willing to look past that because I was more interested in the games and I already use my xbox 360 as a media hub for Netflix, etc. The first system update took about an hour and was able to play around with the Wii U for a few hours after that, I was amazed how comfortable the controller felt and all it's features are amazing. Had a lot of fun playing Nintendo Land by myself and with my family while I was able to.Unfortunately the fun did not last. On the second day of owning the system after about 30 minutes of play the system crashed, freezing the screen and making a loud horn like sound. Researching for answers and a possible solution I saw several others experience the same problem and some referring to the issue as the horn of death (in reference to a similar issue the Xbox had back in the day with red ring of death). The only way around the problem was to unplug the system from it's power source, after replugging it in after a few minutes and a couple of minutes of play time, it would freeze up again shortly after. The system froze up three times in a row within minutes of each other on the second day of owning (and recently while testing it for a Nintendo rep on the phone). I read rumors that Nintendo was aware of the issue and a patch was coming to fix the problem in about a week. My system sat their for a week collecting dust waiting for a patch from Nintendo. Yesterday I called Nintendo to report the problem for a third time and asked if there was a patch on the way to fix the issue. The last person I spoke to from Nintendo said he has heard of the issue from others and they did not know what was causing the problems. I asked about a possible patch, he said there are non that he was aware of and that they would not have access to information about future patches that would fix this specific problem. The only patch that is planned is the one that should activate the Wii TV. The only suggestion the rep could make was to send the Wii U for repair but reading other reviews on Amazon, that does not look guaranteed, I am also not happy that Nintendo only provides shipping labels and no other shipping supplies like Microsoft did at the height of their RROD problem.I plan on returning the system from where I purchased it and eventually buying it again when all the bugs have been worked out. I really hope that I can update this review to a more favorable one when Nintendo works out the kinks, the system has a lot of potential.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001QXNBJM","reviewerName":"Libertarian!","summary":"Phenomenal Game","reviewText":"DICE's console-centric Bad Company makes its return in the aptly titled Bad Company 2.EA has quietly built the best collection of FPS developers in the business. They have DICE, Criterion (who are still, allegedly, going to make a Black sequel), Respawn (the former Infinity Ward guys), and the upcoming Epic/People Can Fly gem Bulletstorm all under their banner at present. It's a Murderer's Row of gaming that has not been matched, possibly, ever (and I'm still hoping...admittedly, it isn't likely to happen...for a Mirror's Edge sequel as well). Activision's dominance in this arena is now possibly killed permanently.Bravo Squad returns and they are still a ragtag --- yet exceedingly qualified --- collection of soldiers with a bit of an issue with authority. One thing that comes through loud and clear is that your teammates and you are exceptionally tight...and that you happen to enjoy engaging in some weird-ass dialogue. From discussion of Harrison Ford roles to discussions of the proper way to pronounce 50 Cent's name, they will discuss any absurd topic that they can think of. Whomever wrote the dialogue deserves an award because it is genuinely amusing, but it doesn't seem forced and simply serves to really make the characters seem more real.The plot has some odd twists and turns...but none of it seems far-fetched. They manage to make the plot perfectly logical, if not a little weird.You get a really intriguing opening level where you are shown all the basics while being stuck in Japan during World War II at, arguably, the worst possible time somebody can be stuck in Japan. You are then thrown into the modern day setting where your overriding goal is to prevent a Russian general from gaining control of a superweapon. Of course, the plot does not remotely move in a straight line, but the ride you are taken on is one you really need to sit back and enjoy.One thing the game does exceedingly well is ambient sound. Your guns sound truly powerful. Sniper rifles provide a nerve-wracking crackle that you hear far away right before either you or your target cease breathing. Your other guns all sound powerful and have the impact a weapon such as these should have, Unlike a lot of shooters, enemies aren't bullet sponges (and, in the higher difficulties, you aren't one, either). Your AI teammates will do enough to help you along, but it is impossible to rely on them alone to drag you through a level.The developers even manage to cram in several different mechanics. In one area, you have to find fire to prevent from freezing to death while traversing the level. You get the pilot tanks, control UAV's, fire remote controlled rockets at helicopters, etc. The game doesn't really get boring, nor does the relentless pace ever seem to let up.Everything feels properly visceral...chaotic in a way that only war can truly feel chaotic. The vehicle sequences all seem to feel like you're holding on by the skin of your teeth, but in those sequences, that is precisely what you are doing. The vehicles control pretty well, although they do seem awfully fragile. It doesn't take a lot to explode your vehicle.DICE showed that they can actually do single player gaming. Before this, in Battlefield games, they were quite content to simply slap bots into multi-player maps and call it a single player affair. The prior game had some solid signs, but the storyline was pretty disjointed and it didn't really feel like they put any thought into the sole affair. This time out, though, they have produced a phenomenal single player campaign that is well worth your time and energy to play.Multiplayer has the same problem all MP games have (namely, there are always a selection of pathetic losers who spend all day playing this one game, so most people will simply get into a match and get slaughtered in seconds...repeatedly). I am not sure how this issue can be fixed (a lot of these trolls would play in a set-aside noob area if they could). This is a growing problem and could end up severely hurting MP gaming online, much as the assorted freaks who became insanely good at fighting games helped kill the appeal of fighting games in arcades.The single player game alone makes this one a must-buy. If you like the online, it is only that much better.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00DC7G0GG","description":"","reviewerName":"Ryan Sil. (Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...","summary":"Mario's BACK, baby!!!","reviewText":"Lately, the Mario series has been met with a couplecreativelybankrupttitles, leaving me to worry about the series's future a bit. However, those were just New Super Mario Bros. installments. Games like Super Mario 3D World show that THIS is where the effort is REALLY poured into! Super Mario 3D World is supposed to be the sequel to 2011'sSuper Mario 3D Landfor, well, the Nintendo 3DS.That's one thing that had me concerned during the first time the game was revealed. It's no doubt people were unimpressed at first, because it initially looked like a 3D Land rehash, and was not the super-rad 3D Mario platformer continuing in the structures ofMario 64,Sunshine, andGalaxy 1& 2.Honestly, though? I'm perfectly fine with this game.What Super Mario 3D World lacks in feeling like a successor to Galaxy, it makes up for in literally EVERYTHING ELSE! Nearly every single level in the game offers something new to the table, whether it be a new enemy, toy to play around with, or interesting and completely interactive scenery. One world in the game features more creativity and imagination than the New Super Mario series as a whole!!I mean, seriously. There's a level where you're on a speeding train, a level where you watch your shadows, a level taking place in an ancient city, a maze-like level with switch-like pads on the ground, a level where you use a Piranha Plant to eat other enemies, a level or few where you ride on a cute sea creature's back.....I could go on and on here. It's just absolutely fantastic.Oh yeah, get this - Peach isn't kidnapped here! Instead, you're saving fairies that are a lot like that of the ones inSuper Mario Bros. 2. And like that game, you get to choose from four different characters, each with their own abilities. Mario's average, Luigi jumps higher, Toad is quicker, and Peach glides (There's also a \"secret\" fifth character reappearing from Mario Galaxy). I love seeing Peach finally getting in on the action after so many years of saving her, and seeing her and Toad shoot fireballs and using the Cat Suit makes me smile.The game also lets you play with 2 to 4 other players. I'm pretty sure it was already chaotic enough to have to try and fight through the New Super Mario Bros. console games with your friends! But you know what? The chaos the multiplayer brings has always been great fun, regardless of whether or not you actually make progress. Plus, it's about time a 3D Mario game incorporated a legitimate multiplayer mode. I played through a majority of the main game with my two brothers, and things got crazy in the best way possible!If you're actually progressing through the game (Obviously best done in single-player), you may come across the fact that you will need to collect Green Stars to be able to enter various levels in the game. If you're familiar with collecting Yoshi Coins inSuper Mario World, or the Star Medals in 3D Land, then this is familiar territory. The Green Stars are hidden around every level,  and you can earn more by playing unique puzzle levels where you navigate Captain Toad to collect all of them, or by entering a series of challenges via the Mystery Boxes found on the map.I rememberSonic Lost Worldhad a feature like this, where you had to rescue amounts of animals to move on certain areas, but the problem in that game was that the amounts required were usually excessive, which meant you had to backtrack at least a little bit. Here, in Mario's case, it's not anywhere as annoying because there's so many alternative paths to take or unexplored levels still waiting to be played. You won't have to play a single level you already played. That is, unless you really want to dig deeper and deeper into the game to unlock even more levels, but I'll leave that up to you to decide.If there's anything I have to remotely complain about in Super Mario 3D World, it's...not really in the game itself, but rather Luigi Bros. Luigi Bros. is a version of theNES port of the Mario Bros. arcade gamethat serves as unlockable content (or if you have New Super Luigi U, you could already unlock it). Thing is - Luigi Bros. is literally just Mario Bros. except with two Luigis. Nothing else is different, which is rather disappointing.Super Mario 3D World is not exactly what I'd consider to be better than the 3D Mario games that preceded it (except for 3D Land), but those games have set the bar tremendously high, and this game is still one of the best Wii U games around, as well as the best Mario game since Galaxy. If you're a video game fan at all, you need to experience this game at..at least some point in your life. It can't go without saying that it's loads of fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2014"}

There were always some magnificent exceptions like Darklands, System Shock, Wasteland (and it's direct descendants; the Fallouts) but all in all by the late nineties I had begun to drift more toward Console RPGs; their design was pretty formulaic but at least they took some chances with their setting and stories.But then I played Planescape TormentSome of the usually criticisms towards CRPGs is how they are all combatcentric and how they lack of real \"choice\" in how the game unfolds, you had to go to Darklands to find the last game that really offered you alternatives between fighting a monster, tricking him and sneaking away or talking him out of bashing your skull.Planescape Torment had this and much more.Not since the days of the Quest for Glory series had a game like this tailored the experience more to your character, plus you could be as kind hearted or ruthless as you wanted, this game had no restrictions on what kind of choices you could make, and literaly having a \"blank slate\" hero that had an actual history before begining the game was such a powerful experience that even today its unmatched. I mentioned Quest for Glory because you could amost play Torment as an adventure game where you don't have to worry so much about the next big fight, but how the next development of the story was going to affect you. The rich and thought provoking dialogues (imagine that in kiddie friendly modern games!) of the Nameless One and the denizens of the Planes you visited during the journey were so powerful that even today they are unmatched in their creativity and ingenuity (can anyone forget the Brothel of Slating Intellectual Lusts, or the confrontation with Ravel?) In the end, how many games can you honestly name that actually made you sad to finish because that meant that the experience was over?The unfolding story of The Nameless One and his quest to find himself is still one of my favorite games of all time in ANY genre.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2011"}

{"product_name":"B007BJNR6C","description":"Introducing Assassin's Creed III Liberation, the stunning new chapter in the Assassin's Creed saga, designed exclusively for PlayStation Vita handheld entertainment system.  The year is 1765. As the events leading up to the American Revolution heat up in the north, Spanish forces plan to take control of Louisiana in the south - but they have yet to reckon with Aveline, a deadly Assassin who will use every weapon and ability in her arsenal to win freedom for her land and her people. Whether silently eliminating her enemies with slow-motion chain kills or luring them into deadly traps, Aveline strikes mortal fear into the hearts of those who stand in her way.  As an Assassin, Aveline soon finds herself on an unforgettable journey that will take her from the crowded streets of New Orleans to voodoo-haunted swamps and ancient Mayan ruins. She will play a pivotal role in the turbulent birth of a new nation as she fights for freedom, not only for herself, but for her fellow citizens.","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Liberation falls a bit flat and feels messy","reviewText":"The Good: Fantastic graphics, combat from AC3 is intact, Aveline is a great character, exploring New Orleans is funThe Bad: Boring multiplayer, sloppy story, uninteresting characters, the Bayou is a pain to navigate, very short, uninteresting side quests, personas aren't fleshed out well, Vita features fall flatLiberation is probably one of the most anticipated games for Vita right next to Uncharted and Mortal Kombat. Like both of those games it doesn't live up to their console counterparts or everyone's expectations. Liberation is probably the most disappointing of the three, but it is still a solid game. The problem with Liberation is that it is sloppy and felt slightly rushed to meet the Assassin's Creed III console release. Aveline is an excellent protagonist and is a very interesting character, but the narrative is very confusing and just feels slapped together. It only makes sense, or gets interesting, towards the last two sequences of the game.Like all the other portable AC games Desmond Miles doesn't make an appearance in this game. You just start out as Aveline in New Orleans before the American Revolution starts. New Orleans is occupied by the French and the Spanish are busy selling slaves from Africa, and trying to take control of New Orleans. Aveline, being a slave herself, is now freed by her stepmother, but joins the Assassin Brotherhood by a leader who lives in the Bayou to free these slaves. This sounds very interesting, and it is, but it lacks the expansiveness of AC3. The story is very short, and it doesn't allow enough time to tell a rich story. The side characters are forgettable, and Aveline barely gets enough time to really show her personality. I was highly disappointed with this, but the disappointments don't end there.The game is mostly like AC3 such as combat, animations, and the control scheme and whatnot. There are some Vita specific features, but they fall flat. You pickpocket by zooming in on the character and running your finger down the rear touchpad, this makes it very cumbersome. You can open letters by pinching the top of the screen and sliding, but the it doesn't work like it should. There's even a weird puzzle thing that uses the Vita's camera by holding it up to the light at a certain angle and turning a dial on the touchscreen. This also doesn't work like it should and is confusing.Combat is the same as AC3 and thankfully that hasn't been broken. The combat system is very fluid and just feels so good. However, your assassin recruit abilities are now gone. You have to use them in the world by interacting with an NPC and starting that ability. I really didn't like this. Aveline has a couple new weapons like the sugar cane machete and whip she can use to swing around some ledges. She has a pistol, as well as a blowpipe and parasol gun! The weapons are really neat and work well within the setting. Aveline also can use three different personas which are assassin, lady, and slave. The lady can't climb around anywhere, but it is good for bribing certain soldiers to get into areas you need and blending in with certain crowds. The slave persona can blend in with slave workers, but the assassin has all weapons available, but always has a minimum notoriety of level 1. The problem is that these personas are only useful during the main missions, but each one has a certain collectible only that persona can get. Other than that, these personas feel useless. A great idea, but not fully fleshed out.Another issue is the world you're exploring. The Bayou isn't a fun place to be because you wind up swimming 70% of the area, or being forced to climb around trees up top. Hunting was completely ripped from the game, and the only animal that attacks you are alligators. The game just feels very small in comparison to AC3. Let's talk multiplayer. Don't expect the addictive and excellent multiplayer from AC3. Instead we get a cop-out of a strategy board game that is extremely boring. It requires all of 5% user input and the game does the rest. You choose a faction (Abstergo or Assassin), pick your closest location on the map, then tap the opposite factions icons. You send off NPCs to fight a roll of the dice. Very boring and will keep you interested for all of 5 minutes. This is just like the assassin recruit missions in AC3, but used for multiplayer. There is nearly zero interaction with other players.As it stands, Liberation is disappointing with sloppy design. The story is confusing and not very interesting until the very end. The story is very short, the side missions aren't very interesting, and the multiplayer is an absolute bore. The game is a fun weekend rental, but nothing more. I hope to see Aveline again, but the developers need to take more time. At least the game looks fantastic and is a huge technical feat for all portable games. It looks very close to the console games in terms of quality, but I know the Vita can do better still.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2012"}

I figured why not try it out for the sale price. I wanted to like this game because at the moment it is the only PS4 game I have. It's fun for a young child in my opinion. The reason I say this is because it is very repetitive. It's one of those games where you defeat all your enemies using the same moves over and over and over again. For kids this may be fun, but for teens and adults it can get boring quite fast. I usually play for only 15 minutes before I set the controller down and call it a night.I'm a bit disappointed because, as I said, I wanted to like this game. I just have to be honest with myself. Repetition is not fun for long periods of time. You'll get bored quite quickly. Great for a child though.EDIT: Just a quick update, I sold this game for $40 because I could just never get into it.

The game is lots of fun and is similar to the other game but with different levels and lots more options.  Also their are giants that you can play with in the game.  The giants are bigger than the other characters on the screen and make this a little more interesting to play.  I know that the game is a money maker and you have to keep buying lots of different figures to play as the other characters and that is why it loses a star.

The reason being that the only fun part of this miserable game is the multiplayer and when you have friends over. On your own, it is just a discrase with horrible A.I, graphics, gameplay and audio, all this added together equals a very bad game.I will now split my review into sections of graphics, gameplay and audio. Of course this game doesn't have online capabilites because it came out before Xbox Live was even released. To be honest, if Xbox Live had come out at the very beginning and this game supported online play, i would probobly give it a 3/5 because of its extremely fun gameplay when you are playing against one another offline.Graphics- The graphics in Fuzion Frenzy are definetely ones to be embarassed about. With horrible character models, background design and retarded looking features on each \"map\", the graphics portion of the game is definetely lacking in deatail. It reminds me of something that you would find out of a gameboy advance now a days, actually, come to think about it, this games graphics are probobly worse then even that. Thus if the graphics were better in Fuzion Frenzy, i would give the game a much higher score, but please, graphics like these just aren't acceptable!Gameplay- The gameplay in Fuzion Frenzy is extremely simplistic as well. Basically, when you are accessed to the menu of Fuzion Frenzy, you are given the choice to enter a tournament or you can choose mini games that you can play on your own or with friends. The game is made up of at least 45 minigames, each one of the at least 45 minigames requires a maximum of three buttons out of all of them on the Xbox controller to be used. Sad! If you enter a tournament, you can choose between two, four, or six stages, each stage consisting of four random minigames that fit that stage and then a final game which they call \"Fuzion Frenzy\" where you can basically gamble the points that have earned for the other games and depending on whether you lose or win, will get processed to the final rank of that stage putting you in a certain position from characters doing the best to the ones doing the worst.Like i said before, the gameplay is extremely simplistic which makes it really boring at times and it forces you to just shut off your Xbox console.However, if you are playing multiplayer, it is a much different story considering that there is actually a challenge (most of the time) and the players actually know what they are doing instead of the incredibly dull and stupid A.I running all over the place.Audio- Oh god, the worst part of this miserable discraceful game is yet to come. The audio! Every time you play a minigame there is this annoying voice counting you down until the game starts. As the game progresses the annoyvoice does as well providing you with \"helpful\" commentary. Also did i not mention that the music in Fuzion Frenzy are produced by wannabe techno DJ's? Well now i have, and yet another reason not to buy Fuzion Frenzy.In conclusion, this game would get a lot higher rating if they had made it \"multiplayer only\" but enhanced the features a lot more and provided us with a little more complicated minigames. But for now, its just a wannabe game that didn't get anywhere in terms of money made, and in my opinion, never will.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2005"}

Take all the best battles of the Star Wars movies, and drop players right in the middle where they can team up against each other in squads feel like they're a part of the movies. That game was good. This one is better. Pushing the Xbox about as far as it can go graphically (and even farther on the awesome 360 where resolution is greatly increased), this time around not only do you get to be in the battles from Star Wars, you get space battles and play-time as heroes and villains like Luke Skywalker, General Grievous, Han Solo and Princess Leia. And don't forget Darth Vader and Boba Fett.You can play this game online, but for me the real reason I bought it (and bought it again after foolishly selling my copy) is that when you play split-screen on a big screen, there's just nothing like it. With up to four people playing at the same time split-screen, you get the instant reactions of your team-mates and the kind of fun that only comes from being in the same room. When I first bought the game a friend and me started playing one night, and ended up staying up until 5 a.m., despite his having to catch an early flight that day! Just one more, just one more. And then at about 3 or 4 a.m. we happened upon the campaign mission of the blockade runner from the beginning of A New Hope. We looked at each other and said \"It's probably going to just be a few guys in the corridor, not like in the movie\". Then the mission started, as Imperial Storm Troopers we both ran around the corner...and we were both killed immediately in a gigantic hail of blast-fire and thermal detonators. We re-spawned and again ran around the corner guns ablazing... and we both died immediately again. Some would call it cheap. We thought it was awesome. We kept up our insane assualt, finally making it past that corridor and taking on the rebels throughout the ship. And then my friend had the option of playing as Vader. I watched as he cut through Rebels with his light-saber like a hot knife through warm butter. Yeah, that mission was awesome.As I've played the game, I've found that many of the missions are almost as great. There's the swamps of Degobah, the rainy exterior of Kamino, and the boiling lava of Mustafa. There's space battles that let you fly a Tie Advanced or hop into a Clone Transport. There's all kinds of awesome units like Dark Troopers (who have a shock gun and a jet pack), Clone Troopers with gattling guns, Bothan Spies, and Droidekas. A lot of units are from the previous game, but they're all great. There's lots of modes to play, from the turn-based conquest to the Several Campaigns, to the great multiplayer modes.Naturally the controls are perfect, making aiming easy and precise. Of course if you're a PC gamer you'll argue till everyone is asleep from boredom about how lame a console controller is compared to a mouse and keyboard, but if you're a hardcore gamer of every system you may reach the opinion of myself and my comrades that it's better to play with a wireless controller on a couch than a mouse and keyboard on a desk. I actually have my PC and game systems rigged to a 22 inch screen I use for everything from watching movies to 360 games, and still prefer playing with the 360 controller because it's so comfortable and easy for me (and I care more about having fun than about getting the high score in a shooter).Battlefront II might just be the most fun multiplayer game in existance for the Xbox with the widest audience. I mean, everyone loves Star Wars. Right?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2008"}

I felt like I was living in the Wild West, where life was tough: resources were scarce, you had to really pull your weight in the world (there was no such things such as welfare or social security), and there's a whole lotta distance from the next town you come across.The atmosphere is great, and gives a truly unique experience that no other game has, but there were some things that really took away from the overall experience.  One is framerate: it only 15 - 20 fps at all times.  While that's okay considering an open world type of experience, it probably lead to my next problem with the game that probably got added in as a result of the laggy frame rates.  Gripe #2: auto-aim.  I know you can turn it on and off, but in multiplayer, everyone uses it, and just playing without it on is hard because of the skippy frame rates.And that finally leads into last real gripe, which is the multiplayer section as a whole.  While the invasion co-op missions are quite fun, the PvP matches are a little too small scale, and the matches are only fun and exciting when the auto-aim mode is turned off in them.  And finally, I really like the premise and concept of anything goes while walking around the map in online mode, the fact that only 16 players can be in any one multiplayer server (which is the entire game map) at a time still makes the experience feel a little too much like a single player one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2012"}

I had been a long time fan of the series from the very first game on the NES and even through the crappy Snake's Revenge.  I didn't know if that next generation of gamers would know anything about the series, but I was hoping for a good game.  My expectations were surpassed beyond anything I could have hoped for.  Not only was Metal Gear Solid a good game, it was a great game.  Metal Gear Solid is one of the best games (if not the best game) on the Playstation and it should take its place as one of the top games of all time.While previous Metal Gear games had suggested that stealth was the way to go, and other games had used the concept, I had never seen stealth developed as well as it was in Metal Gear Solid.  It was not only a good idea, it was the only way to go.  You needed to avoid enemies (as best you could) to be able to make it through the game.  When you killed an enemy, you had to do it in a way that nobody saw you or heard you.  Metal Gear Solid is called a Tactical Espionage game, and it means just that.  You are a spy and spies should not be seen or heard.Like the other Metal Gear games, you play as Solid Snake (now the legendary Solid Snake).  It is your mission to infiltrate the Shadow Moses Island in Alaska, rescue a hostage and see what is going on.  From the moment that you begin the game, what you know is being tested and your place in the story is being escalated quickly.  You are handed a lot of information about the plot and the reasons behind everything.  This game has some very memorable scenes and memorable enemies.

Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis.

The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons).

Ranzoni \"Da Killa B\"","summary":"Return to Classic Wolfenstein","reviewText":"It doesn't take long for humans to become nostalgic about the good times in their lives. Likewise, it doesn't take long for a PC game to be considered a classic. Id Software and Apogee's *Wolfenstein 3D* became one of the most revered PC games in the last decade.For the two or three readers who don't know, *Wolf* launched the first-person shooter game from a gimmick to a genre back in 1992. It offered what every person on Earth wanted to do: run around a maze with a Gatling gun and mow down hordes of Nazis. Nine years later, Gray Matter took this title off the mantle and carried it into the 21st Century. With id Software's blessing, *Return to Castle Wolfenstein* is a sports car of a game, and a complete remake of a classic.Obviously, then, *RtCW* was hyped. For example, the December 2000 issue of Computer Gaming World offered an \"Exclusive first-look at the hottest shooter since Half-Life\". It continued with \"two years and counting after Half-Life, and the single-player shooter bar is about to get raised again\". The overall impression was that of a story-driven WWII adventure.Within the WallsBut *RTCW* isn't what it's cracked up to be. Computer Gaming World scooped a considerably more epic and intricate game than what actually shipped. CGW described, in step by step detail, a *Medal of Honor* style amphibious assault as the opening of the game. The player character was reported as taking an epic journey across Europe. CGW reported that friendly A.I. would fight alongside the player character, that bosses and enemies were vulnerable only at certain times with certain weapons, and that enemies would not spawn and would fight most intelligently, such as recognizing that your gun is bigger than their gun. Since CGW strongly implied these points to be expected in the final release, I foolishly lowered my guard and accepted the hype.This was, after all, before anybody knew that id software would delay *RtCW's* release by a full year and have it redesigned. None of the attributes I cited above appeared in the released version of *Wolf*. Instead, *Medal of Honor: Allied Assault* would adopt the epic WWII mantle, while RtCW turned out to be another weekend shooter.This should be no surprise, considering id software has always been about speed and violence. But I have to admit I'm getting tired of the current deluge of ten-hour titles, and id software's formula offers no respite. RtCW's story is pretty incidental for all of its cinematic air, as little more than shooting and explosions occur during play. Between levels, an orders update shuttles the player from one killing ground to the next. Most of the levels are your standard maze full o' monsters, only much simpler and easier than those found in previous id titles such as *Quake* and *Doom*. All enemies are vulnerable to guns and rocket launchers, and with no hit location, most levels are solved with your standard circle-strafe-and-a-machine-gun trick. Rarely will the player need more than a suppressed Sten gun and a Mauser K98, and rarely will the player need to do more than kill people and find the exit. Expository cut scenes stitch it all together.Don't mistake me-all of this stuff is fun. I just don't like it when a game hyped as a *Half-Life* competitor turns out to be another run-and-gunner beat in two days. I especially don't like it when said game is an A-list title from A-list developers.Return to Quake IIIBut let's give credit where credit is due. *Wolf* certainly competes with big-time shooters on the media front: this game looks and sounds great. The Quake III engine gets a work out with photo-realistic textures and lighting, while the snarls of zombies and undead warriors echo down stone corridors and into the marrow of the player's bones. And while circle-strafing is often the solution to beating enemies, their A.I is smart enough to take cover while reloading and to strafe-fire back at the player. I have to admit, from the flamethrower to the smoke to the late afternoon shadows, I find RtCW's effects gorgeous. Best of all, it runs smoothly even on my antiquated AMD 900 processor.Finally, RtCW has a few nice features to liven up the play:1.Ladders have cages to reduce those annoying \"ladder deaths\".2.Helpful icons pop up to tell the player what to do, so he or she isn't banging away at every wall looking for secrets.3.Venom soldiers are invulnerable to the weapons they carry, so don't get into a flamethrower fight with one.4.The leaping Lopers charge no matter what players throw at them, though a Venom gun or a rocket launcher will make short work if the player is quick on the draw.5.Humorous messages and orders litter the Wehrmacht bases and labs.6.And, of course, plenty of Hitler portraits hang about for the players to vandalize.In for the KillBut make no mistake, this is an id software game; big on style and short on substance. If players want to kill a weekend chasing Nazis in a maze with a Gatling gun, *RtCW* is a good-looking, scary-sounding, smooth-running choice. If players want a little more meat on their first-person Nazi shooters, they need to boot up the *Medal of Honor* series.Nope, in all the hype I was hoping for a game much more involved than it turned out, particularly since id and Gray Matter were remaking the granddaddy of first-person shooters. Still, Return to Castle Wolfenstein satisfies on other levels, and it will probably be as fondly remembered as its progenitor. It's no *Half-Life* killer, but it can kill some time while waiting for *Half-Life 2*.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00064MUIA","reviewerName":"Dharma \"Dharma Wild\"","summary":"Nintendo are truely geniuses","reviewText":"I wasn't really a huge Nintendo fan before the DS.  Yeah, I had one of the first game boys, I played Tetris on it, and a couple other RPG like games.  Nothing exciting, I had it to entertain me in the car when I was little.  I got an N64 when I got older because they where cool, I played Zelda on it but it ultimately frustrated me because I couldn't beat it hehe.  I owned all the Game Boy updates for the same purpose, and because there was no other portable game system.After getting my DS, my thoughts on Nintendo however, have changed.I now love Nintendo, why? Because they love us.  A PSP costs $250, what do you get? a bunch of regurgitated games from the PS2 so far, a couple new ones, they seem iffy, pretty much its the same thing, \"bigger, better, prettier!\" ooooh, so fluid, so shiny... if those things appeal to you more then interactivity and fun, then get a PSP.  However, if you want something involving, entertaining, and completely new every time, read on.The DS is pure genius.  Following along the lines of Nintendo's pioneering into gaming through interactivity rather then \"coolness\", the DS is completely immersive.  The microphone can be used as a pickup, and often is, the touch screen reacts to many kinds of movement, poking, swishes, and it's rather sensitive and accurate.  I disagree that Amazon thinks it's hard to see while using the touch screen; I haven't had that problem at all.  There are paddle buttons on the back, and the regular AB and XY buttons on the face, the usual analog direction buttons that can also be used in most cases to move your character if your not comfortable with the touch screen.  What's the big deal you say?  Sounds gimmicky? That's what I said too.  I saw the commercial and said \"2 screens? Please how stupid do they think we are.\"I was so wrong.  I bought this originally for Animal Crossing.  I thought it would be worth it as a GBA replacement at least because of the better picture quality, and some of the new releases appealed to me, it was inexpensive enough for me to justify it even though I thought it was a gimmick.  I can honestly say I was disproved rather quickly!  The first game I played on it was Wario Touched, now I'm a shy person when it comes to feeling like I look silly, but I'll tell you, 10 minute and I was clicking and poking and making kissy noises at my DS to win the mini games! And it was so much fun!  I didn't even notice that I might have looked odd, it didn't matter.Every game I've gotten for the DS has a different way to use the Wifi, and a different way to use the features.  On Animal crossing, I'm aiming at fish, and digging holes with the touch screen, in Wario Ware, I'm using the paddle buttons on the back to play ping pong with a friend, on Nintendogs, I'm vocally training my pet to do a trick, and the petting him when he gets it right.  Every game makes the DS feel like a totally new experience, thanks to the genius of Nintendo and their higher level of interactivity.The games for the DS are largely new and unique, varying in styles, where as the PSP, as of now, is mainly action based.  There is even a lawyer sim coming out for the DS, a Surgery Sim, even a RPG about being stranded on a desert island.  I know they don't sound very enthralling when said so simply, but I've watched reviews for all of them and none of them have gotten a negative review that I've heard.The DS is just more varied.  It's more open, there are more options, more ways to play with it, and more games for many different kinds of people!  The WiFi is free! (How can you beat that?) And many old favorite classic games are coming out for it too, old favorites like Mario and Luigi (of course) and Sonic the Hedgehog!  Even Kirby makes his way to the DS for a game I hear to be quite good.Nintendo even went the extra mile to make sure it still plays GBA games.  They look STUNNING on the DS, so much so I never use my SP at all anymore.  The screen is just so much better.  You never knew your GBA games could look so good.  Given, after saving on the DS, I HEAR that there are some crossover problems with the save if you try to run it on an SP, however I don't know that that's true.  You cannot play wifi with GBA games on the DS, if that's a problem for you, I recommend you keep your GBA games on your GBA.Its a little big, compared to the SP, it will still fit into your pocket unless you wear the tightest pants ever I think, but honestly, I have a case for it that makes it about twice as thick and holds 6 DS game and 2 GBA games and I throw it in my purse all the time without any real loss of space problem.I strongly recommend the DS.  I think it will keep you entertained longer then a PSP, half the money.  It won't play movies, it won't play music, but I say if you want an MP3 player, get an Ipod, its much better then a PSP anyway it can hold more space and it's easier to use.  If you want a portable DVD player, get one, why would you buy a PSP that uses a totally different kind of discs anyway? You couldn't play any of your movies on it, you would need to buy new ones.  The DS doesn't try to be something its not.  Its fun, its pure fun, and that's what Nintendo is all about.  Fun, fun for the consumer, that's all.  Not big money, not price gouging the price is very reasonable I think, it's all about fun, and the games and the quality reflect that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2005"}

Well, the console version of Civilization is essentially the same concept.  While the pc version can take weeks to conquer the world or send that spaceship to another world, this version can take merely hours.That is great to an extent.  I love being able to sit down and play a quick game that still offers some strategic challenge.  Not having to micro manage everything really has its advantages.  The graphics are very well done, and its a blast getting into wars with your fellow neighbors and barbarian tribes.Having said that,  I do wish they would do away with the whole cutoff date of 2100.  At that year, whatever civ is in the lead is assumed the winner.  I have found the only reliable way to win the game before that cutoff date is to conquer other lands with your military.  Its difficult to win by sending your spaceship to Alpha Centauri.  Towards the end of the game you feel entirely rushed and that is unfortunate.I remember playing Civ 2 on the original playstation and it was much more in depth than this game.  So obviously it can be done.  Perhaps in the future they will give us a more in depth console version.  Until then I will enjoy Speed Civ.  Or I suppose I could spend a fortune on a good gaming pc.Despite the negatives, I still recommend this game.  You will have fun with it despite its flaws.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2008"}

Essentially, it's what Fable should have been.  The combat is solid and intense, and the fact that you can build your character along three main paths (or any combination of the three):  Strength (warrior), Magic (mage), and Finesse (think assassin or rogue), and you have a recipe for deep combat.  The game's lore is in depth as well, and is chock full of quests to complete.  Character customization is easy, perhaps a bit shallow for players coming from the MMORPG genre, but good nonetheless.  Menu navigation is simple and organized, and the availablility of tools for your character to use runs like a typical RPG (which is a good thing).It's no Skyrim, but it's a fun 3rd-Person RPG that Fable fans will find very gun.

I didn't like it quite as much as the sequel arkham city...but there are definitely things about this game that are greatStory: 7.5/10The story was great. The depth of the story and the thought that went behind it is amazing. However, to me it was a very linear story line. I felt as if I didn't have much choice in most of the things I was doing. I fealt like I was being sent on a task after task. Nonetheless, it was amazing. Of course I'm comparing this game and it's sequel together. I gave AC story a 9/10 and this one an 7.5/10. Either way you can't go wrong.Gameplay: 8/10You pretty much have the same gameplay as AC. I gave the gameplay in AC a 9.5. In AA you don't have as much variety in enemies you will be fighting. A lot of the bosses have the same fight style (big guys run at you) and you get really only three types of enemies...regular/regular+pipe, regular+gun, regular+shock stick. However, the fighting in this is still superb. The one thing that I did like better about this game than AC is the riddler secrets. There are 400 flippin secrets in AC...waaayy too much IMO. Plus when you add in the Amadeus Arkham sidestory and such...to me the riddler challenges were just better in AA. That is why this game gets an equal grade as the sequel.Characters: 8.5/10Once again, it's Batman. I mean he's my favorite super hero. And he is portrayed perfectly. The enemies that are in this one are also portrayed wonderfully. The only reason that it doesn't get a perfect score is simply because there weren't enough bosses to fight. Some of the really popular enemies were left out and I thought that some of them could have easily been incorporated. Don't get me wrong, I thought with the freedom that AC provided, it could have had some more in there as well but one or two more in AA would have been nice.Overall 7.5/10This game is great. Simply great. I personally like the sequel better but I can easily see where this one is much more story driven that many gamers will prefer this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0001VGFK2","reviewerName":"Rex Marksmanson \"HEYO!\"","summary":"A fun game with some minor flaws.","reviewText":"For those of you who have been following the Grand Theft Auto series since it's humble beginnings, you'll know how amazing GTA 3 was when it was first released.  Being able to interact in a 3D world where all the mayhem you so desired was possible was simply jaw dropping.  After that came Vice City, an expanded version of GTA 3 set in the 80s with a more cohesive plot, new vehicles and the ability to actually go inside buildings.So here we are, 2004, with the recent release of San Andreas, the third installment in the GTA 3 series.  When stacking the three up against eachother San Andreas easily comes out on top for so many reasons.  First and foremost is the size of the game which, to say the least, is enormous.  Three different and unique cities to lead your character through make it incredibly fun.  Another great twist added to the game is the semi-RPG element, which allows you to make your character stronger, faster, a better driver, more efficent with weapons etc.  Not to mention you have to make sure you're well fed enough or else you'll starve, or in the other extreme, your character will become too fat.  You'll even get love interests, take them out on dates and keep them happy, or completly ignore them if you so wish, that's the beauty you can play how you want.  The great part about this is while it adds some depth to the game it doesn't go over the edge and alienate long time fans.  Another big boost is that you can command your own gangs just by locking on and selecting a fellow gang member, he, or they, will follow you and assist you during combat.  Just roaming one of three cities is an experience in itself.  The fighting gangs, the different characters, watching a police car chase go whizzing by, all of these make it seem like a warped, if not frighteningly close reality.The storyline is the best yet, you play as Carl, CJ for short, an urban youth who has just returned back to his hometown after his mothers death.  What ensues is a plot with twists and turns, all I can say is one never felt as close to Tommy Vercetti as they do with CJ, who seems to alive before your very eyes.  You might find yourself like me, with such a dislike for rival gangs and CJ's enemies that the very sight of them causes you to break off from a mission objective for a confrontation.The downsides to the game don't hinder it that much, but it's really hard to overlook them.  Let's face it, the graphics and engine to this game are dated, don't get me wrong, I'd choose game quality over graphics any day, but a new look would be nice.  AI is still somewhat stupid, they are easily tricked and you shouldn't be too suprised if you find one or two of them running into a wall over and over and over...The targeting system can also be a bit finnicky, especially in combat when you mistakenly target an ally instead of an enemy, and during that time that same enemy has wasted you.  Don't let these flaws keep you from picking up San Andreas however, as I mentioned they're minor, most of the time you'll barely notice them if ever notice them at all.This looks to be the last of the GTA 3 series and Rockstar certainly made sure it went out with a bang.  Now we can look foward to GTA 4, and if current trends are any indication, it's going to be a-freakin'-mazing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2004"}

Don't get me wrong the game is a good game, but it didn't grab me and hold me like 3 or Vice City did.the story here is that CJ has returned to his home in Los Santos after recieving news that his mother has died.  Realizing that the police were not going to do anything he teams up with old Gang Members to extract vengence.  Along the way you gain turf and eventually become a wealthy man.The time frame here takes place around the time of the L.A. Riots in the early 90's.  The music itself fits that era, whihc hits problem #1.  Much like 1-3 the music in this game is primary Rap and Reggae, which is fine if you are a fan of that genre.  However if not than your stuck listening to Country, a Rock Station, or a a less than satisfying talk radio station.  Which hits Problem #2.  One of the best things in 3 and Vice City was the talk radio.  In this game, it's not as funny.  Maybe they ran out of ideas but overall it was dull.Problem #3 is the Sims like feature.  This time you have to keep your guy in shape and feed him.  If you don't he loses speed which is a serious issue when escaping the cops.  You don't have to feed him often, and it's actually funny watching him turn into a tub of lard, but overall it's an OK feature.However that doesn't mean it's all bad.  There are high notes.  For one the targeting system is a lot smoother, and driving is less stressful.  Also for the positive side of the Sims feature you can customize your guys clothes, hair, and tatoos.  This makes for a truely unique experience playing as your own guy.Overall however this game is OK.  I didn't have as much fun with this as 3 or Vice City and overall the experience was less than satisfying.  This time I will wait for the Xbox version where at least I can use my own custom tracks.  But if your stuck with a PS2 than this is still recomended.  It's just not as good as Vice City.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0015HYPOO","description":"Logitech Driving Force GTPS3 racing gets real with the official wheel of Gran TurismoHold on to your seat. Designed from the pedals up for PLAYSTATION 3 and Gran Turismo, this racing wheel lets you feel every bump in the road, crash and tire spin with jaw-dropping realism. With true-to-life race car steering, shifting, braking and acceleration, your game gets so real you may want to buckle up.","reviewerName":"Gearhead Mania","summary":"Inexpensive way to get started with PC racing sims","reviewText":"Logitech Driving Force GT (DFGT) Wheel and Pedal SetEvaluated on the PC platform with SimBin's GTR2, Race07 WTCC, and GTR Evolution.I missed out on the opportunity to test these in the Vine program only because Logitech did not post any information indicating this pedal set would work properly on the PC platform. I am a heavy PC racing sim player and had been looking for a wheel/pedal set for GTR2, Race07, and GTR Evolution. So the bottom line is that I actually paid for this setup and did not evaluate via the Vine program. I confirmed the DFGT is compatible with the PC!Logitech's packaging is very attractive and obviously design-oriented for the customer experience. The wheel assembly and pedals are packaged with care and all you really need is an AC power brick and a free USB port. I didn't have a free USB port on my PC, so I bought a Belkin 4-port mobile USB hub, which did not result in any connectivity issues with the DFGT. The pedal assembly takes up little space and works with my desk setup.The wheel measures 10.75\" in diameter, very small compared to the steering wheel on a real car, and it is made of injection molded plastic/vinyl/rubber. I don't buy that it is rubber because it feels like the stiff but grippy plastic they use on dashboards. There are a number of buttons on the wheel, including two on the back that can be used as \"paddle shifters.\" The \"paddles\" are nothing more than plastic covering two switches. The plastic hinge is part of the wheel itself, so I am not sure how durable they are. Given that the DFGT was designed for the PS3 GT5 gamers, I'd imagine it would have to endure a severe amount of punishment for such a mainstream game and console system. The sequential shifter feels very flimsy with an audible click in each position. The switches feel like the same ones used in most PC mice. I have gone through half a dozen Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer mice because the switches started double/triple-tapping on me, so I can imagine the sequential shifter having a finite lifespan. Funny story about the double/triple tapping is that I could use those mice to make pistols almost fully automatic in games like Rainbow Six 3 without any cheating.There is a brake pedal and a throttle pedal. There is slightly more resistance with the brake pedal which is positioned at a steeper angle than the lighter throttle pedal. It is easy to use for heel-toe downshifting, except there's no clutch pedal. The DFGT pedal assembly is significantly better than the G25 pedal in terms of ergonomics. I found my size 12 feet would hit the throttle and brake pedal simultaneously with the G25. With the DFGT pedals, there's enough spacing and a difference in angle to prevent this. In most street-legal cars, the brake and throttle are spaced far apart with very different angles (brake pedal sits higher, all the time) to prevent applying the throttle while applying the brakes. Sports cars and race cars have different configurations for obvious reasons. The pedal set lacks carpet grippers so they will slide around (unfortunately). Luckily for me, I found that I could jam them against my desk and not have it interfere with the pedal positions. This also gave me a comfortable driving position that wasn't obtainable with the G25 due to how the G25 places the pedals.To use the DFGT on the PC, simply download Logitech's Wingman Profiler software and select the Driving Force Pro settings. You will lose quite a few buttons: the \"GT\" horn button, the +/- selector, the \"PS\", the Return key and the red rotary switch. The \"GT\" glows dimly white and is almost unnoticeable. Logitech could have used a much brighter white LED to give it a better effect.You can select up to 900 degrees of rotation with the steering wheel, although I prefer about 540* in most games. In Race 07 and GTR Evolution, it is recommended that you select a steering configuration that gives you a steering ratio of about 15:1, or 540* of wheel rotation with 18* of in-game steering lock, or 900* of wheel rotation with 30* of in-game steering lock. The Force Feedback is decent although it does not transmit the same feeling I'd get in a real car, but it's close enough.Doing some research, I found that Logitech used lessons learned from the G25 to develop the DFGT and it definitely shows in both the wheel and pedals. Granted, the G25 has a better paddle shifter setup, better quality pedals, and a 6-speed gated shifter, the DFGT improves on the wheel and pedals and Logitech was able to sell the DFT at less than  the price of the G25.Pros: Less expensive than the G25, more ergonomic pedals, more buttons on the steering wheel, same 900* of wheel rotation, and easy to setup on the PC platform.Cons: Pedals feel cheap - although the throttle is the same design as the drive-by-wire throttle in my car down to the single zytel nylon throttle assembly. Paddle \"shifters\" feel cheap. Sequential shifter feels flimsy and easy to break.Overall: You get what you pay for, but it's the least expensive and fastest way to get into racing sims with a 900* steering wheel that is an improvement over the G25 wheel. The G25 would be a nice upgrade if you desperately want the 3-pedal setup and gated shifter (Which I found to be unnecessary with most games/sims).UPDATE:Logitech's wheel software version 5.04 now has direct support in XP/Vista 32/64-bit for all of the controls on the wheel!!! The Logitech Driving Force GT is 100% compatible with the PC.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2008"}

Rhodes","summary":"The History of Metal Gear Solid in One Complete Collection","reviewText":"The Metal Gear saga has had quite the legacy over the past two decades.  The games have gone on to further a genre and they helped change the way video games tell stories.  Konami seems to hoping to get as many people as they can to experience these games.  If you've never jumped into Metal Gear before, this collection comes at a very affordable price for the number of games you get with it.There isn't much need to discuss the story of Metal Gear here. In the first place, we'd be here all day just trying to discuss what it all means. And in the second place, the majority of you getting your hands on this have probably already experienced these games once before. I will only say that the story of the saga is absorbing, confusing and a lot of fun. Gamers have been absorbed by the themes of these games for quite some time, but experiencing them again isn't always so bad. The cutscenes are usually good. Some of them are a little long, but they're very well done. Complete with great voice acting, humor, drama and action. The cinematic experience of Metal Gear Solid is a jack of all trades.  This review assumes that you are at least somewhat familiar with the Metal Gear franchise.This particular collection comes with pretty much the entire saga all in one place.  You'll get the original Metal Gear Solid.  Metal Gear Solid 2: HD Edition, Metal Gear Solid 3: HD Edition, Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker HD Edition, two digital graphic novels, Metal Gear Solid 4: Trophy Edition, an artbook and download vouchers to get Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid VR Missions.  While I'd have much rather been given an actual disk for the original game and VR Missions, I'll make due with a code.  Because you are getting the HD Editions of Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3, it should be known that you will be getting the Substance and Subsistence versions respectively.  Meaning, dear fans, that yes, you can experience Metal Gear 1 and Metal Gear 2.  In short, you truly are getting the core of the saga.As such, it's also fun to see just how the games have really changed over time.  If you begin with the very first game and play all the way through to the fourth you'll notice that all of the games play strikingly different from one another.  The first Metal Gear Solid is a gem no matter what, but it's nice to take into account just how much the second game adds to it.  Likewise, the third game also has its own gameplay variety, some of which carries to the fourth game.  It's incredible to see just how Metal Gear has evolved over the past two decades and how their stories are told.  Obviously if you're getting this, you'll need to prepare yourself for some moments where you'll be watching a lot.  Metal Gear has a pretty dense story, even as far back as the first game.  This is especially true because future games have no shame in referencing older ones.There's a lot in this collection and for the price that's a pretty big value.  There's always the question of whether or not it's worth getting a new collection when the games within it have had previous releases.  It's hard to answer this question.  If you've yet to pick up the Metal Gear Solid Saga before then this is definitely the buy you should get.  You'll get the entire core story if you decide to go with this collection and you really can't beat that price in this regard.  On the other hand if you've already got the HD Collection and you've already downloaded the Metal Gear Solid on the PSN there isn't much else beyond the digital graphic novels and artbook that you're really going to get.  Certainly you get MGS4, but that's a pretty common find in almost any used game shop for a pretty cheap price.  It's not so much that these games have all gotten pretty recent releases, it's more so that their last release (the HD Collection) wasn't all that long ago and is still readily available in stores.  Personally, I find that for all you're getting it's a solid collection.  Not only is all the stuff in the HD collection here, but you get an artbook and two graphic novels as well as a voucher for the original Metal Gear Solid as well as VR missions.That voucher does bring about a minor issue for some, however.  The first and simplest is that if you bought the game used that voucher might not do you any good.  The other (and probably bigger) issue at hand is that if you bought Metal Gear Solid already the voucher won't do you any good.  For the sake of collector's value a physical disc of Metal Gear Solid and VR Missions might've actually been better.Nevertheless, on its own, the collection is probably one of the best collections you could get for Metal Gear Solid.  It's a pretty decent price for all that you're getting with it.  You might have to think for a moment if you've already got the HD Collection in your hands, but for the inclusion of the graphic novels, the downloads for the original Metal Gear Solid and VR Missions as well as the artbook, it might just be worth trading in your HD Collection and simply replacing it with this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2013"}

I am middle aged, but like the FPS's and have had some excellent times in multiplayer settings. But for the most part I can't keep up with the hair-trigger kids out there. Additionally, there is a pretty high titer of jerks online, ranging from racist ranters to intolerant neck beard people. I just want to have a good time and there were possibilities that Black Ops 2 might have offered with skill matching and training levels. Oddly, and I don't understand why someone who prestiged twice in the first week feels the need to be in the Boot Camp or my League Play level. The matching system seems irrelevant.I would love to see COD either hone the skill matching system/ranking or eventually change around the gameplay enough (it's exactly the same layout as before) so that newbies and people who just suck at it can still enjoy the experience without getting yelled at or frustrating the better players.

While playing I've noticed that the imprint of past Ubisoft games.  The visuals and character movements feel very much like Assassin's creed.  The characters movements are not as sophisticated as Assassins Creed's. You can climb small obstacles, but no buildings.I'm having a blast hacking the traffic lights and turning all sides green, but if you do it too much the cops will come after you.  It gives me a good laugh when I cause a pile up in the middle of the intersection. Speaking of cops, they are little smarter and therefor harder to get away from than in GTA games.  You can also, hack into cameras, which helps you move around an area.  This hack helps you move around during missions without getting noticed.  Watch Dogs is a stealth game, and it would be easier for you if you try to stay undetected.  I also found aiming easier than GTA too.  In Watch Dogs the dot is red when pointed at enemies, but in GTA it's white.  The red dot is so much easier to see, and therefor easier to aim.The game takes place in Chicago, and you play a hacker turned vigilante.  The city is large and well design. Unisoft did an excellent job with recreating the city of Chicago.  Some people are saying that they don't like the driving, but I really don't see anything bad about it. You can switch the view from first or third person.  Personally, I find it easier to drive using the first person perspective.  Yes, I can see how people get frustrated when trying to escape, but that's just smart AI chasing after you, not necessarily bad driving controls.I've completed the first act, and I've gotten a good feel for the characters and plot. There are five acts in all, which makes for a long game that will keep you busy for a long while.  Act one took me six to seven hours to complete. There are also tons of side quests, and mini games to complete on top of the action packed main campaign.Most of the time the supporting characters are believable, but a few small parts they had been a little flat.  The plot is energetic and suspenseful, and keeps you wanting to discover more.  Watch Dogs does a good job of keeping me at the edge of my seat, especially when I'm trying to escape.I will update my review as I play more of the game, but if you're on the fence trust me it's a buy you won't regret, especially if you like open world games like Gran Theft Auto.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2014"}

During World War II, many lost souls from the global conflict were left to wander the world in search of salvation. Desperate to escape  their terrible plight, they sought to resurrect Dracula's Castle from the rubble of society, assisted by two mysterious vampire sisters. Now Jonathan and  Charlotte must work together to confront the two vampire sisters, and ensure that this villainous catastrophe is not unleashed on the world.GameplayEvolving the action-adventure gameplay that has been the series' trademark for 20 years,Castlevania: Portrait of Ruinlets players switch  freely between Jonathan and Charlotte as they proceed on their heroic mission, each with their own strengths, abilities and style of play. Players can now  utilize powerful combination attacks in which both characters unleash the full extent of their combat abilities to decimate the game's more than 100  different enemies and bosses. In their quest to stop Dracula's resurrection, Jonathan and Charlotte can collect and use different weapons, equipment, and  items to increase their overall skill level and acquire new abilities.As mentioned before, players can switch freely between both characters, a  necessary option to win the game.

They don't spend a lot of time on plot development or letting you know who is who. It really comes down to Jonathan Morris being the 'fighter' while Charlotte Aulin is the 'magic user'. You can have one or both of them on screen at any given time. Not only do they fight together as a team, but they can puzzle solve as well.For example, you can have one of them stand on a pedestal, and use the other one to push the pedestal along to a new ledge. There aren't tons of these puzzles, but enough to keep things interesting.The graphics are engaging enough to keep you interested without getting overly complicated. They do a good job portraying the skeletons and other monsters with the pixels they have available.One of the fun aspects of Castlevania games is the level design. Levels have multiple tiers to each area and you go up, down and around trying to figure out how to progress. It's a logic puzzle to figure out how to get past blocking obstructions.If you're addicted to three dimensions then this old-school fun might not be quite your cup of tea. However, there really is a simple elegance to a side scrolling adventure. It's a puzzle, how to navigate through the maze, how to use your pair of skills to overcome different types of enemies.Also, the music and sound is rather well done. It helps draw you into the atmosphere of the game.The game is super for what it offers. Monster-killing fun. Side-scrolling puzzles. A good team of characters.

{"product_name":"B00309XHD0","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Cooper","summary":"[2A + (-1.5 Sx)] x mRv/$' = dS2  --->  *See Translation Below","reviewText":"*Twice as Much Action, Half the Scare Factor and Only Minor Revisions in a Large Budget Horror Sequel Equal a Slightly Disappointing 2nd Chapter for the Dead Space Series.Little Big Planet 2, Uncharted 2, Killzone 2, Assassins Creed 2, and God of War 3.  Whenever a sequel to a big name game is announced, people expect it to feature more than a few improvements over the original.  These aforementioned games raise the benchmark by delivering on the promised experience.  As my pre-order implied, I expected nothing less from the next installment of Dead Space.  Yet through my 14 hour trek across the Sprawl, I found myself more often disappointed than inspired.  Ultimately, my dissatisfaction with this game boils down to one issue: it feels rushed to market.  After setting down the controller I found myself wondering which of the two games was better.  Dead Space 2 features more enemies and environments, more streamlined action and slightly refined combat and telekinesis.  The original Dead Space had a more convincing story, a more frenetic sense of urgency/survival, better enemy and item placement, and a darker ambiance.  In effect, Dead Space 2 is like a Carnival Haunted House.  It has predictable scares, confined corridors and a few cheap thrills.  Most of why it feels scary is because of where you are, rather than what is actually going on.  In the end, it feels like you paid a lot of money for an experience they rushed to build.  My review places an emphasis on areas I feel could have been improved if more time was spent in development.  I would still consider Dead Space 2 a good game, just not everything we expected from a large budget sequel.FEATURES:For those of you who buy USED games BEWARE: Dead Space 2 has an online access code that you must enter to play multiplayer.  If you buy the game used and the code has already been activated, you will have to purchase a new code before going online.  Dead Space Extraction, included on the Limited Edition, is a very good port of the Wii game.  The Move is much more accurate, video retains the grainy look of the Wii version but is much sharper, and sound has been radically overhauled. I recently purchased the Sharp Shooter for Killzone 3 and it works SUPERBLY for Extraction.  My only complaint for controls is that the weapons must be cycled through with a button, or with left/right on the d-pad.  The Wii version allowed you to map different guns to specific directions, so I wonder why this was not added to the analog stick or directional pad for PS3.  On another note, the full game must be \"downloaded\" to your hard-drive from the Bluray then installed to play.  It is a 3.5GB install, and will not play directly from the disc.  To prevent you from letting your friends borrow the disc to get Extraction for free, you must also have the Dead Space 2 disc in the system to access the game (even though it was fully downloaded onto your system).  It doesn't bother me, but I'm sure it would aggravate somebody with less hard-drive space.GRAPHICS AND ENVIRONMENTS:Graphics have not received any noticeable improvement.  This comes at somewhat of a cost considering the limited facial animations and character movements hold back the terrific voice acting.  Suit design is flawlessly executed whereas character models look like early release PS3 games. This juxtaposition carries on throughout other elements of the game.  Newer enemy models are drastically split between being cleverly designed (ones modeled after Velociraptors named Stalkers) and very poorly animated (Yellow Necromorph Babies called Crawlers).  There are multiple new settings, each of which is essentially a chapter or two within the story.  The problem is that each environment features graphics or room design that is copied and pasted.  It becomes rather tedious to pass the same storefront 3 times within a single mall, or to read the same messages (written in the same size and same font) across the walls of 5 Unitologist apartments. Banners and video messages also repeat every 5-25 seconds, so the longer you explore an area the more it feels contrived vs organic. Lighting is excellent.  Set piece sequences feature some distinct visuals, but are usually over very rapidly and almost ALL of them were featured in the trailers for the game.  A few areas offer some exciting eye candy (wood backdrops in a gym, flowing lights in a tunnel, duct-taped insulation, frozen storage) but ultimately these make me disappointed in what the game could have been.  If more time was put into the game I'm sure a lot more of these visuals would have been implemented into the settings (instead of spaced apart every 2-3 hours to hold your interest).GAMEPLAY:Targeting can be changed between Centered (sight will be on middle of screen), or Classic (sight will follow path of weapon).  I found myself using the Classic mode from the first game, because it kept throwing me off to have my left aligned character aim at a different angle than where he was pointing his weapon.  Most of your arsenal operates exactly the same as in the original game, which is a good thing.  You have to keep in mind that the ammo you find will primarily be from whatever you have equipped. Equipping a weapon you do not use often will result in finding less ammo for guns you do use! Several new members of the battery are quite helpful when upgraded, but must be utilized against certain enemies for full damage.  The detonator is a proximity mine that is very effective against Stalkers when accurately placed.  However, the game once again feels rushed with its detection coding.  Rather than detonate based only on enemy movement, the mines will be set off if they touch anything of necromorph origin.  The problem is that mines will continue to explode as you set them if the blue lasers touch any necromorph segment on the ground or wall.  This can be troublesome if trying to set them in a hurry.  The Javelin is functional, but much more difficult to aim against fast foes without stasis since it has a single point of impact and takes multiple hits to dismember or impale.  The Rivet gun pre-order is virtually useless since it has a very small target zone and takes the most hits to dismember an enemy.Zero gravity is far and away the best revision of the sequel, giving you the ability to fly in any direction and easily re-orient towards the ground.  Sadly, most of these parts feature either very primitive puzzles or very basic action despite having the tools for much more.  Some of the set piece sequences also place you in a position without immediate prompt.  I sat on a train car for about 3 minutes once, looking at the city outside before I realized I had to progress to the next car for the train to get any closer to the station.  The few action segments that try to break up the pacing are dispersed VERY far apart.  One sequence involves riding on top of a mining vehicle, but ultimately plays out like any other \"stuck in the elevator with enemies pouring in\" section of the game.  It would have been better if these sections featured unique gameplay and controls rather than simple backdrop exchanges. Remember that annoying enemy that couldn't be killed in the first game?  He's back too, with an army of friends to push you through a series of corridors. The ending boss also feels like they ran out of ideas on how to implement Isaac's internal struggle with his external.  Running in circles to find ammo and watching the same death sequence 40 times from recycled enemies was disheartening.  At least the section afterwards offered a slight reprieve.  Why were more sections like this flight sequence not offered in the rest of the game?SOUND:Ambient sound and voice acting is well executed.  Isaac's character is believable even though not entirely unique or memorable.  Most of the better lines in the script actually come towards the last 2 hours of the game when Isaac starts to express his frustration.  The voice actor delivers these lines right on target.  Some of the \"startle effects\" are impeccably used the first time you hear them, and then become cliche as you progress.  For example, I almost jumped when a toilet flushed by itself as I explored a room.  Following this, whenever I walked into any other bathroom in the Unitologist apartments the toilets would flush by themselves too.  After the first time, \"surprise\" tactics lose their punch. These are used quite a bit although giving more examples would ruin that \"first time\" for you as well.  To save production time, I believe certain objects were all programmed to behave the same way.  The scrambled voice effect and lower sound mixing for the \"dementia\" scenes also made it very difficult to determine what was being said.  Since the story is primarily driven by Isaac's state of confusion, it was disappointing that these moments become lost in the fray.  Turning on subtitles helps, but the subtitles are not perfect and will fall behind the voice acting.  Usually a subtitle will scroll slightly before audio, but this was not properly designed in DS 2.STORY:From start to finish, Dead Space 2 really struggles to come up with a meaningful story.  Isaac supposedly has progressive \"dementia,\" but it doesn't manifest itself in his abilities in any way whatsoever.  The \"ghostly presence\" of his dead girlfriend throughout the narrative sometimes comes across as either forced or unnecessary.  It fails to convey a real sense of mental degradation.  Remember that one scene in the trailer where he is struggling with himself and the needle?  The brevity and placement of the scene ultimately fails to serve as the effective foreshadow it was meant to be. In short:  It worked better for the trailer than it did in the game.  The other characters really have no motivation aside from: we were here and need to get out, or I'm doing this because the person in command told me to.  I found myself asking all of the same questions at the end of the game.  So how did Isaac initially become the target of contesting factors?  What are the real motivations for the Church of Unitology and what IS the joining the marker is used for?  All of these questions and more have a nice little blanket thrown over them.  You can make your own assumptions, but I was really hoping for the details.  There was never any moment where I thought WOW, that was great storytelling! The worst part is that the story of the first game actually sets up the premise better than this sequel.  I didn't really like the \"Hey Isaac..now we need you to go here and rebuild/fix this\" from the 1st game; however, it still seemed better than the \"Hey somebody from an organization we just heard about is looking for you and the shuttle only goes here...get aboard!\" from this game.Aside from plot holes, certain inconsistencies screamed out to me as well.  In a few scenes, main characters are disfigured or injured and seem helpless.  In the following scene they're acting all bad ass and the injury doesn't affect them at all.  The Dead Space fiction from DS1 also states that the Hive Mind was created by the Marker as an overseer to direct the actions of the Necromorphs aboard the Ishimura and Aegis 7.  Random online sources speculate that the invincible enemies near the finale of DS2 are juvenile stages of hive minds because of minor visual similarities.  The problem is that the story never alludes to the Hive Mind, or offer any continuity in regards to how the Sprawl became infected with Necromorphs.  According to one journal, creating a \"new Marker\" on the Sprawl began to show signs of life returning to destroyed Necromorph \"goo.\"  However, nothing details the exact nature of this resurgence nor does it fit with the original model found on Aegis 7.  Ultimately I just felt like I was constructing a detailed puzzle that was missing quite a few pieces out of the box.  I would have been much more entertained by the narrative if I felt it added to the mystery of the Necromorph origin and motivations.As I played the game all I could think about was how my review would differ from those I read online.  In summation, it seemed like the game was quickly executed to follow up on the animated film Downfall and Wii's Extraction.  Sadly enough, this game has more than enough opportunity to become an instant classic.  It seems like an impressive storyboard was constructed for different enemies and environments, but then filled in between with just enough cover to release it on time.Dead Space 2 is a fun ride, just be sure to get a cheaper ticket before you hop on board.

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or fighting the good fight solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house.Key Game FeaturesSpecial Controller Included- Designed with input from the Capcom development team, the Wii Classic Controller Pro is included in this bundle.Hunt Together- In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone.

How does it live up to the hype? Pretty well.First of all, this game is in a shooter-genre all of its own.  The setting is the Wild West, but with a spin, vampires and undead.  If any other games have tried this, I haven't seen them.  It really is a refreshing setting and helps to make Darkwatch feel fresh while in reality it is just any other shooter.As a shooter the game delivers fun gameplay, but nothing stellar, and no real moments that made you say wow - like the dual weild in Halo2 for example.  The controls are fluid (as others have mentioned if you are familiar with Halo and Halo2, you will want to use the Cheifton controller configuration right from the get go) but occasionally I found that the charachter just didn't always turn when I told him to, especially when taking damage.  This was rare, but odd.  In addition, his ability to fan the hammer on his revolver for rapid fire didn't always work by holding the fire button down the first time, and I had to release the button and hold it again.  So far, those are the only glitches I've noted.The maps are actually very small and/or linear and you are limited in where you can run (and thus, your strategy is limited).  You have the added ability to lean from side to side, and while I haven't noticed much of a difference using this ability, it could prove helpful.  The appearance/mood/setting is very well done, creepy and dark, and mature.  Their are corpses and muilated bodies, etc. that push this game into the mature realm.Now, shooting is the key element of shooters, so on that note, the guns are very, very fun and inventive (but not believable) given the era.  You start with a simple revolver but you won't be limited to that for long at all.  In the same opening level you get the Redeemer and that is the pistol you will most likely keep throughout the game.  While holding an amazing amount of ammo and having rapid fire, the Redeemer also allows you to fan the gun's hammer and thus greatly increase your rate of fire.  It is a great way to mow down waves or put rounds into a large target, but it can also eat your ammo and it is difficult to adjust your aim.  You will also have the options of dual pistols (fire more lead, but very inaccurate except at close range), a carbine (slow rate of fire, somewhat powerful), shotgun (not really my favorite, only effective at close, close range and slow rate of fire) and Range Rifle (sniper rifle).  You will encounter stationary weapons and you can shoot with unlimited ammunition from the back of your horse - undead horse.  You can also throw dynamite, and shoot dynamite bolts from a gas powered crossbow.  This weapon is fun, great at distances and against groups, but the delayed explosion means that nearby enemies will be on top of you before the dynamite explodes - and you get to blow up with them.  All the weapons have a melee attack, and for some, like the crossbow, you may use it more than the primary fire in some instances.The enemies in Dark Watch all looked amazing to me, and have very good animations - although they are all the same after a short while.  They all look creepy and really add to the atomoshere of the game, and are just plain fun to shoot up.  Some elements of the world around you respond to gunfire/bashing, but not a lot.You have some vampiric abilities in Darkwatch, but I found them to be somewhat bland.  You earn them by doing good or evil deeds and thus earning good or evil (if you will) powers.  The powers are essentially defensive sheilds and buffs to the power you deal with your guns.  You have a double-jump that is quite useful from the start, but unlike some other vampire games you don't have a glide, hover, slow fall, or anything of that nature, and you don't have any sensory awareness (radar) to tell you where enemies are - and they will come at you from behind a lot and you won't have any advance notice that they are there.  You do have \"bloodvision\" that turns everything into shades of red and gray and allows you to see the enviroment much subdued and the targets and certain items are easier to make out - they glow pink.I've completed what I would guess is 50% of the game, not a very long game, but typical for a shooter.  I haven't really noted a lot that would make me want to replay the game in full, but I can see myself coming back to it from time to time.In short, if a Vampire Western theme appeals to you, this game will deliver hours of enjoyment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2005"}

There are just not enough of them and as such they don't break up the action as much as in other games.An odd fact of the story is how short your character is.  Your eye level is right at shoulder level of your fellow space marines.  Why?  Who makes a five foot tall hero?  At least he has regenerative health.  Duck behind cover and wait a few seconds to recover.A lot of my fellow amateur reviewers out there have complained and complained about the controls.  The defaults are a little loose.  A quick adjustment in the options menu solves that issue.  The controls are not designed to be as surgically precise as you would find in Halo.  You are not going to be able to get a headshot from across the map.  That is the point.  The controls are designed to be realistic and fair.  A real machine gun or pistol is not as effective when used as sniper rifle.Speaking of the guns...Most of the guns are some variation of machine gun.  There are rocket launchers and some sci fi themed weapons like the electricity gun.  The selection is a little lacking for a game set so far in the future.  Killzone 2 falls into the same \"weak as shooting frozen peas\" ammo trap that so many FPS games fall into.  It is not very realistic to unload an entire clip into an enemy and have them survive.  Is it too much to ask to have ammo with some actual realistic stopping power?I am usually not a fan of multiplayer, but for Killzone 2 I have made an exception.  Multiplayer truly shines.  The maps are well thought out and very detailed.  I have yet to encounter any lag.  Ranked matched are highly addictive and a good way to find players at the same skill level as you are.  I found myself playing \"just one more match\" to get points to rank up.  The various classes you can earn are well balanced.Voice chat is supported.  It just does not work as well as it should.  Maybe, it is my internet connection or the Playstation Network bogging down.  I rarely hear what people are saying.  And it stinks not being able to warn my team mates when the enemy is in my base killing my guys or coordinate a solid offensive push.The downside is there are no vehicles to be found in online matches.  None.  I hear they will fix this with a downloadable map pack.Killzone 2 is no \"Halo killer\" and it does not redefine the genre.  It is one of the best I've played.  Easily one of the top titles on the Playstation 3.  Killzone 2 is just solid fun with a boatload of replay value in the multiplayer.  I recommend picking up a copy right now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2009"}

Yes and no. Yes because, well, it is what it is...it's indeed a First Person Shooter. But is it done better than the most popular releases of late? I'd have to say that KZ2's online play is the most diverse, best looking FPS ever released for the PS3. The campaign--while fun, a fair story and fantastic looking--stands in the shadow of online play. So much so that I only played up to the second chapter of the campaign; KZ2's online play is so compelling fun while the campaign seems to just be there because \"it has to\".I lovedCoD4...both the (short) campaign and the endless hours that I spent playing it online. What I like about KZ2 more in the online play area is its diversity. You can set up or just join games that are large or small; you can play in one game mode or join a match that strings together all or various game modes...this latter being my favorite way to play. I think that there are like 5 game modes: Let's see...Body Count (like TDM), Assassination, Search & Destroy, Capture & Hold, and Search & Retrieve.You rank up similar to CoD, but you reach the top rank of general very quickly in KZ2. However, you are rewarded most is for earning \"ribbons\" associated with how effective you are with weapons and with the abilities that come with each of the 7 character customizations or \"classes\".You start as a Rifleman (you just fight), but you can quickly complete the challenges necessary to unlock all of the 6 other classes that include Medic (you still fight but you can revive team mates), Engineer (you can deploy bots), Tactician (you can plant a strategic respawn point near a target), Scout (you can be pretty much invisible), Assault (makes you run really fast), and Saboteur (makes you look like a friendly to your enemy).Campers still exist in KZ2 like they did in abundance in CoD4, but in KZ2 camping is naturally deterred because if all you do is camp with the same character you will very very quickly fall wayyyy behind in strength and abilities rewarded for completing the challenges required in all the classes of soldiers. The quickest way to rank up is learn and be familiar with the maps, and the quickest way to learn the maps is not to camp.The classes of soldier are all fun to play. Every time that I think that I've found my new favorite class, I get a Ribbon that awards me new abilities and new challenges in another class that make switching new and exciting. If you play with a Clan or with friends you'll find that having a diverse set of classes on your team will greatly increase your chances of victory...so strategize prior to play, and if you join a match and see that a class of soldier is missing, take one for the team and switch to the missing class.Initially I complained about the controls, but I did get used to them. Strangely, at first I thought that they were too sensitive. Then I thought that they were too slow to react to certain movements. Perhaps this was because I had just finishedDead Space, and I was used to the perfect controls associated with that game. But like I said, KZ2's controls seem fine to me now, so all I can say is if you don't like them try adjusting them or just get used to 'em like I did.The graphics are great, the sound is perfect and online play is as fluid as it gets. I've seen no load issues or more importantly no issues with host ending game or lags that were common in CoD4 andCall of Duty: World at War. During the short period that I played the single player KZ2 campaign I noticed some load-lags, but they weren't that bad. Again perhaps I was sensitive to this after player the most perfect campaign EVER (Dead Space) that never had a noticeable load.So overall, Killzone 2 doesn't bring the next gen FPS to the table or present something that really hasn't done it before, but it does present PS3 owners with the absolute best online shooter on the market today...in my opinion anyway. The campaign, while okay I guess, is really there simply because I think too many people would have complained if it wasn't. KZ2 is an online shooter game developed for online shooters...and stands head and shoulders above the rest.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002I08RR8","description":"","reviewerName":"G. Ware","summary":"not bad but not for me.","reviewText":"This is my first go at Assassins Creed. I always wanted to try it because I like the darkness of it, the graphics and the Medieval scenery, based on the commercials and reviews. So when it arrived I was excited to give it a try. There were a couple of non gaming related items that were a bit of a surprise for me, even before I started the game. One was how long it took to get this game started. Seemed like maybe it was loading a bunch to my hard drive but it never asked me if I wanted to do that, like other games. Must have been 10+ minutes before the game was ready to play after all the loading but maybe it is required due to the heavy graphics of the game. I was also surprised by the need to provide a code for UbiSoft on-line setup in order to do multiplayer. Maybe this is unique to UbiSoft but I have never had to do this before on a console platform.Once I finally got into the game it seemed pretty cool but not 100% my style of game play. I can see why it has done well over the years as it is a lot different then the point and shoot style of the Call of Duty games. Took me a while to get used to the controls but the game does offer some training in the beginning to help you learn, if you have not played the other AC games before.Once I got used to the controls I could get around pretty well, fight, and defend myself through the story. As expected, the graphics are very good and I enjoyed moving around the different scenes in the story.I wasn't disappointed but I guess I've played too much Call of Duty and just found AC Revelations a bit not to my style of gaming. If you are looking for something different to the point and shoot games then I do feel this game offers enough interesting game play and graphics to make it worth while to check out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2011"}

Now, for the first time, players can see true depth of their environment without the need for special glasses. Super Mario is a 3D evolution of classic Mario platforming featuring new level designs and challenges.","reviewerName":"Joey Z. \"Joey\"","summary":"A Clever Mix of 2D and 3D, but Not Without Problems","reviewText":"Nintendo promised earlier this year, that Mario's first 3D outing would be his best. Super Mario 3D Land mashes-up both the 2D side-scrolling Mario with the 3D exploration Mario. The result? A game that feels fresh and exciting, even though you won't find a lot of new things.The story, as in most Mario games, is as simple as can be. A special tree in the Mushroom Kingdom is hit by a storm, and all of its leaves have blown off, the leaves have been scattered around the Kingdom in the form of Tanooki tails (more on that later). Mario and toads stumble upon this tree in the morning, and notice a letter from Bowser and, yes, once again, he has kidnapped Princess Peach. The story isn't meant to be all cinematic and plot-like, because that's the beauty of Mario games. Its simple story is enough to keep you interested, and it makes up for lack of story in the gameplay department.Super Mario 3D Land, like said above, is a mix of 2D and 3D Mario. I think of the game as a blend of Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario Galaxy, and the result is something magical. The game is set-up in 8 worlds, with more being unlocked after completion, and Mario ventures through each level in the worlds, usually 5, to reach Bowser and rescue Peach. There is a fun little \"world map\" that represents each level, and Mario can jump between worlds and access toad houses this way. Each level contains 3 star coins for Mario to collect, and these can be brutal towards the end. The levels themselves start very easy, and a Mario veteran could breeze through the first 8 worlds in about 5 hours. Upon completion, however, a special counterpart to every world is unlocked, and these contain extra challenges like time constraints or Cosmic Marios, and I died a bit during theseThe most refreshing part of Super Mario 3D Land is its levels and gameplay. Each level has a flag at the end, and a time limit, which makes it feel like 2D mario. However, the levels encourage exploration, and there are hidden alcoves and lots of other areas to explore, making it feel 3D, as well. Power-ups are aplenty in Super Mario 3D Land. The Tanooki leaf is back, along with its tail-swiping and fluttering abilities, and a new leaf is unlocked after you beat the game. Mario's signature Fire Flower is back, along with the regular Super Mushroom. New is the Boomerang Suit, which gives Mario the ability to throw boomerangs, perfect for getting flying enemies or multiple Goombas at once. Also, a Propeller Box is returning from New Super Mario Bros. Wii, which allows Mario to soar to great heights. The only problem I found with these were that they felt too common, and a power-up felt more of a regular, rather than an exciting surprise. They're a lot of fun, but the game seems to just give you these out for free. Mario controls just like he used to, and you'll be running and jumping in no time. The only problem is some of his moves, like long jump and high jump, aren't even necessary, unlike in Super Mario Galaxy 2, and I completed the game without even realizing that they were there. This discourages fast movement and shortcuts, which limits replay value.Here's my one problem with the game: difficulty. The game starts out slow, and I barely died on my way to World 8. Sure, it picks up at the end, and Mario vets shouldn't be turned off by the early easiness. The problem is there are way to many additions to the game that make it easy. First, Mario starts each level as Super Mario, so he can take two hits at the beginning instead of one. Second, power-ups are everywhere, giving Mario extra support. 1-Ups aren't even difficult to get, and bonus rooms are all over each level. Getting to the top of the flagpole isn't nearly as hard as it used to be, and I finished World 8 with over 100 lives, which shouldn't be right. Also, there are only two boss battles, but they're mixed up differently. Sometimes you fight Boom Boom and his lady, others you fight Bowser, and the same tactics to defeat them are there each time. If you die, you get free power ups instantly, and a golden Tanooki suit and P-Wing make the game even simpler. This is certainly good for new Mario players, but for old players like me, it's condescending, and I wish there was an option to turn these off, or make a more difficult mode.The 3D effect in Super Mario 3D Land is astounding. This game was clearly made for 3D, and it shows. Special rooms are impossible to play without the 3D, and cleverly hidden coins make for interesting 3D puzzles. Bullet bills and fireballs come right out the screen, and you even have the option to choose pop-out 3D or depth 3D at the start of each level. The soundtrack is nothing special, and I would have preferred to see more orchestral pieces akin to Galaxy, and less happy, jumpy tunes, but the soundtrack is still very catchy and fun. There's no multiplayer option, but you can share your completed bonus boxes with friends, and it's fun to compete for best times on each level.Super Mario 3D Land is an excellent mix of 2D platforming Mario and 3D exploration Mario. The level design is brilliant, as is the wonderful 3D effect. The only turn-off is difficulty, but that's no reason to shun this wonderful 3DS title.Pros:Fantastic Level DesignClever Mix of Old and NewGreat Graphics and 3DCons:Easy as Pie!Limited Controls","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J5JW","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"An Incredible Value But the Series is Showing its Age","reviewText":"Ah, so I've finally wrapped up playing the Tomb Raider Trilogy on the PlayStation 3 and I feel a proper review is in order. I specifically set out to experience as much of TR: Trilogy before writing a review and I'm happy to say that I've finished all three games to 100% including acquiring the platinum trophy in each.I've been playing Tomb Raider since the days of the PS1 back in the mid-to-late 1990's. I've followed the series from its heyday with Core Design to its eventual decline and then resurgence with Crystal Dynamics as the developer. Tomb Raider Trilogy consists of two modern games: Tomb Raider Legend and Tomb Raider Underworld. The third game of this trilogy is Tomb Raider Anniversary a remake of the original Tomb Raider game.If you're new to this series and have purchased or are considering purchasing TR Trilogy then I would recommend playing the games in this order: Legend > Anniversary > Underworld. That way the story will make more sense although there are considerable gaps in time from one game to another.Tomb Raider Legend is arguably the weakest game of the trio. The graphics are early next-gen (X360) and definitely show their age more than the other two games. The entire design of the game really strayed from the original Tomb Raider formula. The game is less dependent on exploration and puzzles and is extremely linear. The few puzzles presented in the game are ridiculously easy and offer virtually no challenge. The game is also very, very short and can be completed in one play session or a few short ones.The basic plot (spoiler free) follows the events of Lara's life after a horrific plane crash in the Himalayas when she was a child. Lara's ultimate goal is to collect the fragments of a fabled sword which she believes is the key to her goal. Along the way Lara encounters an old friend turned enemy.All that said there is still some positive. Mainly the game is entertaining and offers a clear and concise story driven by short cut-scenes between levels. The environments are also varied from the typical tombs and ancient sites Lara is familiar with to modern day Tokyo. It's a neat deviation albeit feels a bit out of place in a Tomb Raider game.Challenge and replayability mainly come from the time trials after you complete the game. In order to unlock cheats, costumes and extras like artwork you'll have to complete each level in a timed run. The time trials are also a part of acquiring the platinum trophy. No online modes or DLC here folks.Next up: Tomb Raider Anniversary. As I said TR Anniversary is a remake of the original game. Certain liberties have been taken with the remake including (of course) vast improvements to the graphics engine as well as improvements to level design and overall gameplay enhancements. While the game is leaps and bounds ahead of the PS1 version of Tomb Raider folks who played Anniversary on the PS2 will immediately notice similarities. I believe that Crystal Dynamics in essence ported the PS2 version of Anniversary to the PS3. The game looks fantastic though not up to the level of the latest PS3 games.TR Anniversary is in essence the best of the three games included in this trilogy. Anniversary is the way Tomb Raider was meant to be; large open-ended levels with much platforming and a variety of challenging puzzles that can be completed in (mostly) an order of your choosing. Later Tomb Raider games are extremely linear and lean less on exploration and puzzle solving.Some Tomb Raider vets may be put off by the story changes made to tie Anniversary in with the plot set up in TR Legend. Personally I've no problem with this as early Tomb Raider games were light on story anyway.The gameplay, graphics and camera control are all smooth here and generally very good. There are times when Lara gets herself in situations where the camera simply doesn't have a good angle. This is probably the biggest weakness of TR Anniversary and the series as a whole. Core Design and Crystal Dynamics have both struggled to get the camera right.Once again the main challenge and replay factor come from the time trial events after you finish the game. The time trials here are considerably more challenging than those in Legend due to the nature of the levels and presence of more enemies and boss fights. Completing the time trials is required to unlock cheats and the platinum trophy.Last up is Tomb Raider Underworld. This is where I'm most critical of the Tomb Raider franchise and the work done by Crystal Dynamics. The short of it is that Underworld would be probably considered a flagship platformer if it weren't for Naughty Dog's title Uncharted: Drake's Fortune. TR Underworld is completely eclipsed by Naughty Dog's game in every way imaginable.Uncharted: Drake's Fortune established in one game what Core Design and Crystal Dynamics have failed to get right in 8 separate Tomb Raider games spanning over 10 years.So what exactly are the problems in Underworld? Sadly many of the same old problems that have always plagued the Tomb Raider franchise. The camera is terrible and actually worse than the camera in both Legend and Anniversary. The camera is jerky and moves entirely too fast. It also fails to position correctly for many platforming sections leading to many frustrating deaths. The controls are equally jerky thanks to said camera.The game also shipped with various bugs which affect not only gameplay but also trophies. If you're planning on working toward the platinum I strongly encourage reading the known glitches related to the trophies first. Glitches regarding the gameplay include Lara not grabbing certain ledges/platforms or falling after doing so. It all leads to a very frustrating experience.The story in Underworld continues and possibly concludes the story arc started in TR Legend. However, the massively disappointing choice to cut out almost all fighting cripples the game. There are barely any enemies in the game and zero boss fights. When the game concludes it sort of just... ends.There are curious design choices too. Both TR Legend and Anniversary include a chapter select feature and the ability to quit the game to the main menu. Those two basic options are missing from Underworld. Trust me when I say this will be frustrating later on after finishing the game.All is not lost though and there are some genuine positives to Underworld. The graphics are excellent and many times I found myself just looking around at the incredible work Crystal Dynamics pulled off. Environments are lush and beautiful and full of small details. Out of the trio, Underworld is head and shoulders above the rest in the graphics department. Additionally, Underworld features a much better level design than that of Legend though still short of Anniversary.In conclusion Tomb Raider Anniversary offers and incredible amount of value for the dollar. Three full games for less than the price of one. The series is definitely not the `AAA' premier series it once was and Underworld especially shows the shortcomings because of the inevitable comparisons to Uncharted. For those that have missed out on these games I would recommend purchasing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2011"}

Paolucci \"Collector of Entertainment\"","summary":"I Wished I Had Played the Game Everyone Else Did","reviewText":"The first thing I noticed was that everyone seemed to love this game. But for me, it was a dull experience. Yes, at first I was amazed at the gorgeous graphics and the interesting concept of puzzle/action, but after about four giants I soon understood that nothing else was going to happen beyond the simple idea of searching out the giants, climbing up them and finding the weak spots, and stabbing a magic sword into those spots in order to bring the beasts down. And though the Colossi were all very different and unique, I quickly grew used to the amazing graphics and even the curiosity of finding out what the next beast would like left me as well.At first, yes, I did think this game was amazing. Seeing the giants move about and attempt to crush your main character flat had my heart pounding, especially against the first giant, which killed my character. And the landscapes were definitely some of the best I've seen in a video game. Also, the simple game-play made it easy to pick this game up (but more on this later). The horse was an interesting concept, too; when galloping at high speeds, it seemed to add some beauty to the landscape. But great graphics, to me, can't carry a game for long.The simple game-play also left a lot of wanting on my part. All you had to learn was how to climb, how to use your sword and fire a bow, and learn the basics of exploration. There were no advanced skills to be gained, no combos to be learned, no nothing of anything to ever change the way your character went about his business of killing massive creatures. The simplicity made it easy to get into the game, but it also killed it for me in the end. After doing the same thing only slightly differently seven times in a row, I realized I couldn't do it anymore. It was fun in the beginning, but boring in the middle, and had I kept playing, I'm sure my rating would've gotten much lower by the end.Now, how do I recommend this game? Well, firstly, if you enjoyed Ico, a puzzle game made by the same people who made Shadow of the Colossus, then you'll definitely like this game, as it's basically a lot of the same concepts only with giants. Also, if you enjoy great graphics and don't really need super interactive game-play (like what's found in puzzle games but not action games) then you would also find some enjoyment out of this, I think. The problem is, there just aren't many games to compare this too, so it makes it difficult to recommend. All I can say is rent it, try it, and if the novelty doesn't wear away, then you'll probably love this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2006"}

I picked up this game thinking I'd have zaney NPC's coming along with me on some huge adventure full of sidequests and crazy fun.  When I first started, I was impressed with the graphics and sound, and it seemed rather promising with the characters too.  As the game progressed, I quickly found out that it was essentially a Diablo clone (i.e., a massive dungeon crawl).  You hack and slash through level upon beautifully-rendered-level, all the while taking trips back to the local store (with your recall potions) to drop off your loot and upgrade your equipment.  The sidequests usually involve you talking to someone near the local store, finding the item they are looking for, and returning it to them.  Over all, the character interaction is a bare minimum, and the story is rather stretched.  Before you know it, the game is over, and you import your character into a harder mode and do it all  over (replay value is better with friends around). Pick this up if you want a fun way to kill a couple of hours with some friends (or by yourself).

The platfroming is as close to gaming heavon as you can get. It is just so much fun. There were times when you would die, and you wold be happy to redo a section.In regards to the fighting elements of the game, they could have been better. There are a variety of different moves you can do but it still isnt that deep. It is mostly contained in one button, then later you get another weapon and it uses the Y button.The story in PoP is great. You activate the sands of Time and you have to escape the castle in which they are spreading. while all of this is going on, you have to find the assistent to the king of persia, you father is the king, and kill the assistent. Im not goning to reveal all of the story to you so you have to play it to find out.The only thing I dont like about this game is that it is one of the hardest games I have ever played. even on the easy difficulty level. On hard, its almost impossible.Overall, Prince of Persia The Sands of Time is one of the best platforming games ever made.Concept-Bring back the Prince from old times.Presintation- 9.5- Overall, a great package, with good menus and box art, it brings the Prince's world to life.Graphics- 9.0- This game is pretty. The lighting, texture work is all great. Though the character models could use some work as well as the lip syncing.Sound- 9.2- Music is awesom, voce overs are good, battle sounds are good as well.Playability- 9.7- It works perfectly. i would give a 10, but the camera can be a bit wonky.entertainment- 9.6- In my mind, one of the best platformers of all time.Replay Value- 7.0- One you finish it, you might want to play it again, but chances are you got so frustrated that you dont.

Weapons of mass destruction, deployed with complete impunity razed the land in the blink of an eye. The dire situation forced the two opposing factions to negotiate a cease-fire and an agreement was quickly reached, but although the war may have ended, its effects remained. With the deteriorating environment, Earth's population was drastically reduced and those who survived lived a confined existence trapped in underground cities. Eventually countries joined together to form the Greater United Nations and turned their eyes skyward, to space. With the establishment of the USTA, the Universal Science and Technology Administration, man began to seek new worlds beyond the stars.AD 2087...The first year of the spacedate (SD) calendar. Thanks to the success of Professor Trillas Bachstein's warp drive experiments, mankind's dream of a spacebourne existence has inched closer to reality and the USTA secretly began to implement its SRF project, the Space Reconnaissance Force. Now it is SD 0010, and the first official SRF mission and your adventure has begun.CharactersPlayers ofStar Ocean: The Last Hopewill meet and interact with a wealth of characters from different parts of the galaxy, each with their own history and weapons of choice. Just a few of the more prominent characters to familiarize yourself with include:Edge MaverickAlthough generally possessing good judgment, this young Earthling commander of the maiden deep space voyage of the SRF ship the Calnus, can be reckless. His signature weapon is the sword.Faize Sheifa BelethA young Eldarian committed to etiquette and logic, and capable of astounding feats of engineering, Faize is always honorable of those possessing abilities he lacks. His signature weapon is the rapier.Reimi SaionjiThe kind and levelheaded navigator of the Calnus, Reimi was born in an aristocratic Saionji family and has a shared history with Edge back on Earth. Her signature weapon is the bow.Lymle Lemuri PhiOrphaned on her home planet of Lemrick long ago, Lymle is mischievous, but friendly and inexplicably retains the appearance of a young girl. Her signature weapon is the wand.Gameplay and CombatAlthough Edge Maverick is the main character inStar Ocean: The Last Hope, players will of course experience gameplay action in the form of a number of different characters and utilize the signature attacks assigned to each. The game features a real-time combat system which allows for up to four party members to remain active in battle at a time. Improvements to the game's combat system include 'Rush Mode,' where players can switch out active members of their combat groups for reserve members in real-time; 'Sight In/Sight Out' which allows for timed evasive and counter moves against enemies; and the BEAT (Battle Enhancement Attribute Type) system, through which players can change a character's fighting style at will. Other actions players will master through gameplay include piloting of the spaceship Calnus, a first in theStar Oceanseries; item creation in the form of weapons, healing items and accessories; and Private Actions (PAs), a cause and effect relationship between character in-game actions and the acquisition of new abilities and scenarios. Through the increased flexibility mastery of all these skills provides, players should be able to more easily increase their team and individual team member's combat experience and status, and so unlock more advanced combat styles and linked combinations.Key Game Features:Series prequel-Star Ocean: The Last Hopeis a prequel in the classic series, combining sci-fi and fantasy elements, spanning multiple planets and the vastness of space itself to recount the origins of the Star Ocean universe.Exciting Battles- Exhilarating combat expands upon the franchise's famous real-time battle system, including the amazing graphics and visual effects only possible on Xbox 360.Compelling Scenes- The game features breathtaking CG movies by Visual Works, the cutting-edge studio whose previous work includes cutscenes for the acclaimed Final Fantasy RPG series.","reviewerName":"Patrick_91 \"Patrick\"","summary":"Calnus, Engage!","reviewText":"Star Ocean The Last Hope (Star Ocean 4) is the 4th installment in the long running Star Ocean series. Star Ocean 4 can be played by itself as it has a standalone story, however if you have played the previous Star Oceans (especially 1&2) then The Last Hope will give you more insight into them as this is a prequel to the series.The story in The Last Hope was something I really enjoyed. The game revolves around a man name Edge Maverick who with his childhood friends are going into space to find a new planet to colonize as World War III has left the surface of the Earth uninhabitable. Along the way to their first possible new planet something goes wrong mid warp and everything goes haywire on the new planet they eventually crash land on. From here on out Edge learns that humans are not the only intelligent beings in the universe and that the universe itself is on the brink of destruction and its up to Edge and his crew to try and put a stop to it.Overall I thought the story was the best of the series (I have played/own the other three SO's) I like how the main characters love interest is not forced as the two of them (Edge and Reimi) already have something there that just needs a little extra push to become something more. On top of the main story you have Private Actions, a series staple, Private Actions allow you to build relationships between the characters in order to boost their affinity with you and hopefully score you their endings (you have these extra characters endings on top of the main ending), when the female's have enough affinity for you, you can put them in your room to boost their affinity a little more. One complaint I do have with the Private Actions is that a lot of them are missable and unless you are really lucky, or have a PA guide with you, you can miss two of the extra endings in the game.Gameplay is where The Last Hope really shines, if you have played the other Star Oceans there is really only two new things here, if you have not played a Star Ocean game before, the battle system is done in real time, you have a field map where you can see all the enemies on screen and if you touch one, you go into a battle map, here you can pull off some stupid combos if your good enough and even preform super attacks that can crush bosses in one or two tries. The new additions are the blindsides and bonus board, blindsides are when you get behind an enemy and hit them for massive damage, of course the blindsides only last for a few seconds at a time, the bonus board is little crystals you get for doing certain things in battle, the crystals can range from anything to extra money to extra experience all in all the battle system is solid and I found it very fun and it never got stale for me.Graphically The Last Hope is top notch, it may look a little dated compared to games like FF13, but the character models do look really nice and colorful, I'll admit at first the characters do have somewhat of a doll look to them (its in the eyes) but after a few hours you don't even notice it anymore and it actually grows on you. The environments are somewhat plain as there could be more there but overall it gets the job done. What I really like though, is there is a lot of things to see, you have a couple forests,snow fields, beaches etc, it makes you feel like you actually are going to different planets and exploring the universe! The voice acting in The Last Hope is decent, I mean, it didn't bug me at all since I was not expecting anything groundbreaking, but others will absolutely despise it.If I had one complaint about The Last Hope, it would be that the last boss is cheap, he can use area attacks that hit everybody and he only gets more cheap as the fight goes on, however with a last minute super attack I managed to finish him off. One word of warning, if you don't like long cut scenes (some of the ones on disc 3 can get more than 45 minutes long) than this game won't be for you. But if you don't mind any of the above than you should pick this one up for sure.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00309U0M6","description":"","reviewerName":"Chip L \"chip1978\"","summary":"Good follow up to the original, but consider renting","reviewText":"If you've played the original Dead Space, you probably know exactly what to expect from this game. A 3rd person over-the-shoulder shooter that is linear and very well polished. The soundtrack, sound effects, graphics, and game play are highly refined and quite flawless. Game play follows the same formula as the first Dead Space: blast off limbs of attacking necromorphs using weapons, telekenisis, and stasis (freeze/slowing enemies).If you're expecting anything new, you may be disappointed. I think it's good they didn't mess with a good thing too much. You still level up weapons, armor, and abilities.  You still get a shock the first time that giant thing with tooth and claws jumps out at you. This game does a great job mixing up the level designs (even if they are very linear), so it doesn't feel like you're just walking down slightly different looking space-halls.If I had to point to any short comings it would be these: the enemies spawn from the same place every time. After the initial scare of walking into a room that's suddenly overflowing with terrible little critters; you learn the timing of the enemies' attacks and can plan out a response. The other complaint would be multiplayer and online access. EA is the biggest offender of restricting online access. If you buy this game used, you cannot play online unless you pay EA for the privilege (never mind the fact that you probably already pay for an xbox gold subscription). EA has already done this sort of thing with this year's Madden; and it really grinds my gears.  The multiplayer experience feels a little tacked on (not as bad as bioshock 2), and you're not missing much if you can't play online.All things considered, the single player story is really great and the graphics, sounds, and game play are second to none. Unless you tend to play single-player modes over and over again, you could probably simply rent this game, beat it over a weekend and get about as much out of it than if you had purchased it. Whether you rent or buy, you should definitely play this game!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2011"}

I really do. But I am not one whom you would describe as a rabid Trekkie. I know enough on the subject of Star Trek to make me somewhat knowledgeable on certain facts; Even-numbered Star Trek movies are the best ones, guys in red shirts invariably die anytime they beam onto a planet, and Captain Kirk would kick Captain Picard's tush in a pitched fight clear across the Great Barrier. But again, I'm not a rabid fan, so when my brother picked this game up for his X-box 360 I was only moderately interested in it. I played it over this past week and have come to the conclusion that the game, while fun, is not as good as it could have been.ST: Legacy wants to be epic, but only partially succeeds there. Individuals and fans of all Star Trek related shows will love the pure dedication that has been given to the ships, who are clearly the stars of this game. Players embark on their trek (pun intended) during the Enterprise series time frame with Captain Archer and the gang up through the post-TNG era. The plot follows the protaganists of the various series in their pursuit of a rogue Vulcan intent on introducing her own brand of the Borg into the Alpha Quadrant over the course of 200 years. The plot seemed a little weak to me, especially considering the visuals that are included in the game, and seemed little more than a vehicle to introduce the starships themselves.The graphics are impressive, as is the ship selection. Be forewarned that if you're looking to hop into the controls of a Romulan Warbird in the story campaign you'll only find that in the Skirmish or Multiplayer modes. I noticed that many of the TOS series ships seemed to be pulled directly from Starfleet Battles, like the little Apollo Class scout ship, which consists solely of a saucer section and a single warp nacelle slung underneath. The ships themselves are beautifully rendered and match that of what you saw on the screen of all the movies. Every sound effect from the hum of the impulse engines to the unique sound of the phasers has been dutifully implemented into the game. And the larger the ship is, the less agile it is, giving you more reason to put a few Miranda or Steamrunner class ships in your fleet. The little ships are definitely the most fun but it will be the big battleships that you end up using to win, using brute force.The music is fine, and certainly more than adequate to set the mood. Some of it seemed to be recycled a bit through most of the game a bit too much though. The voice acting was also adequate but I couldn't help shake the feeling that the voice actors themselves, more or less, just phoned in 30 lines apiece and collected their paycheck. There was no real feeling behind the words being spoken, and it was particularly noticeable with Shatner's Kirk, who is supposedly having some sort of blood feud with this rogue Vulcan but speaks about it in the same tone of voice one would use reading the annual earnings report of a mid-size toilet paper company.The controls are a big detraction from the game and that is just the plain truth. Through the 20 odd hours I spent playing the game I was never really able to figure out at times which button did what. The left thumbpad controls motion, the right the view, while the bumpers and various buttons control everything from energy settings, hailing, scanning, selecting the closest enemy, initiating repairs, etc. And I'm not even including the weapons fire buttons. Furthermore if you have the ability to target individual subsystems on an enemy ship (sensors, engines, etc.) then please tell me how to do that. My brother has played through the game twice on increasingly difficult settings and said he didn't know either and usually elected to just continue firing and blow up the enemy ship. You'll find yourself repeatedly hitting the wrong button in the middle of a fight and about the only one I was 100% sure of at any time was the warp button, which coincidentally is one of the most tempermental ship subsystems on this game as it will quizically work only half the time.Despite the controls the game is, as I said earlier, quite beautiful. Watching your fleet exchange broadsides with a Borg Cube is really breathtaking and seeing so many types of ships made available to the player is wonderful. I do not have X-Box Live, so I could not engage in a multiplayer battle with anyone, but did tinker with the Skirmish mode for a while. And here I found the single biggest detraction yet. Skirmish mode reminds me a great deal of another great game, X-Wing Alliance. Players don't cooperate on pre-made missions but rather use an editor to \"build\" a fleet from scratch and then send it towards another fleet. That's fine and dandy but I want to relive the epic space battle of STII: The Wrath of Khan (and who doesn't?), or take part in the giganto space battle over the Earth from ST: First Contact. Heck, even the battle of Wolf 359 would have been welcome. You'll find none of that here and it makes me sad since all the necessary shipsets are there and are obviously begging for it. Another quick note is that collisions should be catastrophic events for any ship but here ships bounce off of each other, planets, asteroids, and a host of other objects without once taking any damage. A \"Worf Maneuver\" style assault, warping your ship right into the side of a Borg cube for instance, would have been a most welcome weapon to have at one's disposal, especially on the last (very hard) mission of the game.The game is pretty enough to perhaps warrant playing through it again, and maybe getting to try it out with some more of the smaller ships. But other than that I don't see much replay value in the Campaign mode. This is further hampered with no scenarios to play and a very spartan Skirmish mode. Overall this is a good, solid game but with some flaws attached to it that drag the overall score down. I enjoyed it a great deal and heartily recommend it to Star Trek fans who have ever had a hankering to pilot their own Sovereign class starship at will.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2008"}

This is definitely the best action game I've ever played, it even has more action than the Metal Gear Solid games! Dante is really cool(a hell of a lot cooler than Raiden) and Trish is quite the stunning demoness. This game is like a complete upgrade of the Resident Evil games with better controls, weapons, graphics, enemies, etc. The only thing that the game doesn't have enough of is a story. That takes away one star from its score. If it had more cut-scenes and a better story, then the game would have been PERFECT; it would of even surpassed the Metal Gear Solid games!!Stories are very important to me in video games, without at least a decent story, the game will always have one star or half of a star taken away. Actually, this game deserves 4 and a half stars, cause it's just so damn cool!!! If you like those games like \"Resident Evil\", \"Tomb Raider\", or \"Onimusha:Warlords\" then you'll love this game.Trust me. I've never beaten any Resident Evil games or the Tomb Raider or Onimusha ones, but I know those games are similar to \"Devil May Cry\".

Save your ten bucks.That said, the game itself hasn't really aged well. The mechanics of the classes are derived from the quake days, and the limitations show.Biggest example is the soldier. Now, the soldier relies heavily on a move called the \"rocket jump\" where you basically fire a rocket at your feet and then use the energy to fly in the air towards your enemy.Without the rocket jump, the soldier is lousy.However, the rocket jump is also very hard to get right. It also does damage to you. It relies on what amounts to a bug in the original quake's physics engine.Other games have done it better. In particular, Firefall (a game that is still in beta) has the assault class which fires rockets just like the soldier. He has a rocket pack. And several movement boosting abilities. It works out quite well. ALso, the jetpack class in warhammer space marine does it better.Beyond that, death comes to quickly in this game. It quickly becomes stupid for that.TF2 tried to implement a coop horde mode recently but it was terrible.now, it's filled mainly with novelty items.

I was skeptical of the Kinect technology at first, but after using it I can safely say that it's fun to use, but it has a few downsides which I'll explain below. Now, I'm going to talk about the three different parts of this bundle separately.1) The XBox 360 SNothing much new here--it's an XBox 360, but smaller. Still, I should mention that, in the short time that I've owned the system, I haven't yet experienced any of the issues that plagued my previous 360 systems, such as lockups and the dreaded red ring of death (which is now a Red Eye of Doom on the XBox 360 S). There are also a few minor differences. The air vent is located on the side (or the top, if you mount it horizontally), the buttons are touch-sensitive and don't have to be pressed in, the system makes pleasant ringtone-like sounds when you turn it on and off or you eject discs, there's no faceplate to change out, the hard drive has plenty of room, and the system has a spiffy, shiny black finish. And of course, it has a specialized port in the back reserved exclusively for the Kinect sensor. There's really not much else to say, and certainly nothing to complain about.2) The Kinect SensorThis is probably the most significant part of the review, and for obvious reasons. Microsoft is betting a ton of money that Kinect will take off like a rocket and be supremely popular on the marketplace, but how good is it really? Well, it's a fairly large device for starters, and it's strongly suggested that you not mess with it very much whether it's on or off. The reason for this is that the Kinect has a little motor in it that gives it the ability to tilt and up down, and if the user attempts to tilt it himself he might damage that motor. You should also place it in a stable location, and I certainly wouldn't recommend mounting it on top of your TV unless you have a special mount for it. Finally, make sure your playing area has plenty of space because you're going to need it.Anyhow, enough of the safety PSA's. How well does it work? Well, the Kinect, from what I've read, basically projects thousands of little infrared dots all over your room, and uses their points of impact along with the camera to determine your position in the room and what you're doing. It usually works fairly well, I found. Characters would follow my own movements (at least to the degree allowed by the game), which was neat to watch, and despite my concerns about the Kinect lagging behind my movements it wasn't really noticeable. There are issues, though. The tracking was not as accurate as it could have been, and with some games I've been having trouble getting the Kinect to accurately interpret my movements. For instance, sometimes on Dance Central I could swear I'm doing a dance move in exactly the same way as the onscreen character, but for some reason the game just doesn't recognize it. Another example would be on Sonic Free Riders, where a certain move called a \"Kick-Off,\" which gives you a temporary boost of speed, seems to go off on its own whether or not I actually wanted it to. It's not as bad as I might be making it sound, though. Most games should work really well with the Kinect.The Kinect can also be used to navigate the XBox Live menu, but personally, I preferred to just use the controller because it's quicker and easier. Manipulating the menu by gesture is slow, owing to the fact that your hand must hover over your selections for about a second, and even with voice commands you may find that the Kinect doesn't always interpret what you say correctly.Finally, you might be wondering what kinds of games you can play on this. Well, thus far there's racing games, pet-raising games, exercise games, and mini-game collections (like Kinect Adventures, see below). At this time, however, I'm really wondering if that's all the Kinect is capable of doing. I mean, you stand in front of the sensor, you move your arms and legs around, and that's it. It's not very complicated, but there also isn't a lot you can do with it. Would a hardcore game like God of War or Halo, which require complex commands and a high degree of precision, even be possible with the Kinect? If that doesn't bother you and you aren't interested in those kinds of games anyway, more power to you. You'll likely have a lot of fun with the system in spite of everything, it's great for motivating yourself to exercise.Oh, and before I end this part of the review, I'll just mention that some future Kinect games may use the Xbox 360 controller, though at this time I have no idea how well that will work.3) Kinect AdventuresI have to wonder why they didn't pack Kinect Sports in with the Kinect rather than this game. I thought including a sports mini-game compilation was a motion control tradition or something! But seriously, Kinect Adventures is a fun game and it makes for a pretty good tech demo for the Kinect, which is the most you could ask for when it comes to a game like this. Most of the issues with the Kinect that I mentioned earlier don't have much impact on this game, as the body-tracking seems accurate enough to play all of the mini-games without any issues--well, except for one particular game, where I had trouble using my hands to reach out to block some water leaks appearing to either side of me. That's it, though. Aside from that, the biggest problem with Kinect Adventures is probably that it doesn't have very many mini-games on it, and there's only so many times you can play them before you get bored. So, just as a suggestion, if you go to pick up the Kinect or a 360 bundle with the Kinect in it, go pick up at least one other game for the system so that you have more variety.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00012BSJ4","description":"When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better.

The game improves on every level over Fusion such as the graphics, sound, and game play (you can play as Zero Suit Samus!) The story isn't as good either, in fact it's hardly there at all. All I knew is that Samus was sent to Zebes to destroy Mother Brain and that's it...yeah some story.All the same weapons and power ups are here that were in Fusion and ZM features a whole new set of bosses and enemies. I really hated the boss fights in this game because they were so difficult and almost impossible. If I weren't playing this on an emulator then they WOULD be impossible.

After nearly half a year of conversion ,PC owners can now find out why the Xbox and PS3 community loves/hates this game so much.The gameplay is about the same as console games, and since I previously wrote a review for the xbox version, I hesitate to repeat all of it.  To sum up gameplay; guards attack you for going to fast, it is wrong to punch the retards even if they started it, no matter how many guards you are up against they will still come at you one at a time like a bad martial arts movie, cinematics and conversations are unskippable, but it looks really good.The big change I noticed in the PC version is the ability to warp to locations.  No longer do you have to walk all the way back to the mountain after each and every kill.  But, there were penalties for this new found gem of gameplay.First, the game is locked in wide screen mode.  I played on a wide screen display but for most \"normal gamers\" out there this would be annoying.  I noted in one review a person swore they changed it.  Sadly, they altered the resolution, not the aspect.  They played the tall, skinny version of Assassin's Creed.I used my own controller setup so I cant tell you how nice it works with a mouse and keyboard.  From the 2 seconds I used it in the intro I can tell you this, get a controller.  I use an adapter which turns my PS1 controller into a USB connection.  Worked wonderfully.It is nearly impossible to quit this game.  The Youtube video of the sums it up nicely.  At minimum, you need to make about 10 keystrokes over about 2 minutes to exit.  Impressive since I never found out how to quit and had to exit using alt+F4 every time.  I would also not recommend trying to minimize the game.  It will never restore and you will have to end it in task manager.Aside from that, it was a decent port.  I didn't have the video artifacts or crashes that many complain about.  I ran it on a dual core 2.4, 8800GTS Video and with just 2 gigs of ram.  Maxed my settings completely without a hitch.The new content was a bit of a let down given that it was shamelessly tacked on.  I figured Ubisoft would come through with their marketing promises and include naked pictures of Jade Raymond in hopes of selling out even more, but alas more disappointment to follow.  A couple of extra mission types are tacked on.  Talk to an informant, kill archers, race across town and that sort of stuff  Nothing really new, and nothing that adds to the story or enjoyment.In all, Assassin's Creed was a decent console game (if you tried not to think about it too much) and it is a functional game for PC.  The user interface is terrible and the widescreen mode is obnoxious, but if you can tolerate that it will be enjoyable.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2008"}

My main reason for getting this was mainly due to getting the RRoD on my first 360 (which was purchased when Gears of War came out).  Microsoft, of course, sent me a replacement unit in March of 2008.  However, the replacement ended up sounding worse than my original.  The fan was louder.  The disc drive was louder.  I heard all kinds of weird chirps and whirs coming out of it, which was very distracting and irritating.  Needless to say, I was not pleased.I began hearing about the new mother boards and power supplies being shipped with the newer sku's and started to get intrigued.  Could Microsoft finally be solving the dreaded RRoD problem?  Supposedly, the newer mother boards included a smaller, 65nm chipset that produced less heat and required the fans to spin slower (hence less noise and overheating).  Many of you have probably heard of the Falcon chipset or the Jasper chipset.  Well, I can't really tell which one my unit has, but I can tell you there are some improvements.The new 60gb 360 has the 175 watt power supply.  It is smaller and lighter than the original power brick.  The console does run a little quieter and cooler.  I would not say that it runs whisper quiet, but it's not nearly as loud as my original or replacement unit.  The disc drive runs a little quieter as well.  According to the label, my unit was manufactured in June of 2008, so I assume it has the Falcon chipset in it.  If anyone has more information about these chipsets, please enlighten me.It comes with an HDMI port, which I really like.  I will say that after I connected the console to my TV, the image seemed a lot brighter than with component cables.  I had to turn down the brightness on my TV, but it looked fine then.The console comes preloaded with several demos, including Pac-man, Geometry Wars, and several others I can't remember.  It has a full version of Hexic installed.  After I transferred my game saves and gamer profile, I had about 45gb of storage left on the hard drive.  Plenty of room for other demos and whatnot.Getting it connected to Xbox Live took no time at all.  Set up was straight forward and easy.  I certainly hope that this sku stands the test of time (at least until the Xbox 720 comes out).  So far, I like what I see.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2008"}

Also, in battle looks a lot better than in the previous versions. Animations look better and battles progress a whole lot faster!As far as gameplay is concerned, its hard to put Pokemon Gold/Silver down.  There is a new feature introduced in this game that once again shows that the GBC is more than we think it is.  The internal clock has made the gameplay so much more interesting.  The game actually changes between day and night and it changes based on how YOU set it up!  Not only that but pokemon only come out at a certain time of the day.  Some come out in the early morning and others come out at night!Catching Pokemon hasn't changed much from Red/Yellow/Blue. The difference is that you now have several different kinds of pokeballs.  You've got Heavy Balls to capture Heavy Pokemon, Level Balls that catch pokemon at rather low levels, Marine Balls for catching water pokemon and the list goes on.The other interesting tidbit is perhaps the Pokegear that is introduced and the Cell Phone feature.  The Pokegear makes it so you can carry more than just 20 items like before. You've got a seperate pouch for Balls, Key Items, TMs and HMs and just your normal healing items and such. The Cell Phone feature is nice and probably one of the best additions to the game!  After you challenge some trainers you can ask them for their number. When you have their number they'll call you and do a few things. Some wlll ask for a rematch, some will tell you of Pokemon Swarms, some will give you an items. Most of the time, however, trainers will call to tell you stupid things, such as the status of their pokemon or how they beat other trainers.Of course the whole story is to become a Pokemon Master.  You get to explore a new world of Johto but in the end you'll end up having a nostalgic time in Kanto (the setting of Red/Yellow/Blue games) but in a different sense that once you defeat the elite four, you'll have to start a new journey and ultimately you'll end up fighting the toughest trainer in the game (the hero from the Red/Yellow/Blue Games).The small gripes with the game.  Well, for starters the Random Encounter rate is high at times which is rather annoying.  Second, some trainers are just imopossible to dodge. In fact on most routes you'll have to fight all the trainers and it isn't by choice. You fight them because you HAVE to.The music is great! In Johto at least.  In Kanto the remix music of the Red/Yellow/Blue versions is terrible.  Not to mention that when you get to Kanto, all the Pokemon are of low levels and are actually the exact same level they are in Red/Yellow/Blue.The game is worth the buy though.  This is one of thsoe addicting games that you'll find yourself coming back to over and over again and the best Pokemon game of them all! If you like Pokemon get Gold or Silver.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00004XOWT","description":"If the original PlayStation was the video game console equivalent of the  '60s-era Volkswagen Beetle--economic, reliable, loads of fun--the PS One could  be considered the new Beetle--a hip restyling of those same qualities.Make no mistake: the PS One has all of the same functionality as the original  PlayStation workhorse, will work with all of the same peripherals and  accessories, and will play the existing PlayStation game library, as well as  audio CDs (also note that, like the original PlayStation, it's not compatible  with the more advancedPlayStation  2). The difference here is that this new model is quite a bit smaller than  its older brother, and quite a bit cuter, too.The system is made up of a 32-bit, 34-MHz RISC processor with 16 Mbits of main  memory, 8 Mbits of graphics memory, 24-channel stereo sound, double-speed CD-ROM  drive, and one Dual Shock analog controller. That's not a lot of power, compared  to a next-generation system like theSega  Dreamcast; but, when you factor in its very low price and the enormous  library of games that are available (more than 1,000 that are spread across  every genre imaginable), one can see easily why it's as good a deal as ever.

{"product_name":"B00002STGL","description":"A first-person shooter that mixes spy and sci-fi,Perfect  Darkis both a thoroughly engrossing one-player experience and a  riotously fun multiplayer romp. Easily one of the best games of its  genre on any video game console, this long-awaited follow-up toGoldenEye 007is a must-have for Nintendo 64 owners--and a damn  good reason to be one if you're not.The futuristicPerfect Darkcasts players as Joanna Dark, a  secret agent who becomes embroiled in a sinister conspiracy involving  aliens and an evil corporation. Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy. However, the real fun here is in  the highly customizable Combat Simulator, a one-to-four-player  simultaneous-play mode that features both free-for-alls and team-based  challenges and can include up to eight Simulants, computer-controlled  combatants of varying behavior.Although Simulants make for decent adversaries or teammates, you'll want  to grab a friend--and an Expansion Pak, as only 35 percent of the game  is available without one--to fully enjoyPerfect Dark.--Joe  HonPros:One of the best first-person shooters on any video game consoleOutstanding multiplayer game with huge replay valueBevy of game options, cheats, and secret featuresExcellent training mode with challenges all of its ownCons:Graphics get ugly when playing with more than two players","reviewerName":"Disintegration","summary":"Outstandingly perfect...Almost...","reviewText":"With a game made by the same developers as Goldeneye 007 for N64, it is nearly impossible to go wrong. Perfect Dark does not disappoint. In fact, I am going to go out on a limb and say that Perfect Dark is better than Goldeneye, here is why...Graphics- 10/10 Goldeneye set the bar when it was released, and Perfect Dark surpasses it, beautifly. Although the graphics are very similar in nature, everything is much clearer and smooth looking. The guns look much more realistic, and the special effects are upgraded. It isn't a dramatic difference, but Goldeneye had graphics far ahead of its time to begin with, and this game still satisfies. In fact it does much more than satisfy.Sound/Music- 10/10 The music, also, is quite similar to Goldeneye. It has the same unique sound to it, and every track suits the level. The music in Perfect Dark has much more of a techno-esque sound, though. The music in Goldeneye set the mood quite well, and so does Perfect Darks, except now it is much more noticeable and louder. The sound effects are great (especially the reaper), and the guns sound realistic. There are some voice-over moments that are laughable, but that's about it.Controls- 10/10 The amazing control scheme that made Goldeneye so great has made a flawless return. You use the R button to aim and the control stick to move the cursor around, and it's easier since your screen doesn't always move with the cursor, a flaw that ruined every PS2 shooter for me. I absolutely despise the double control stick aiming scheme used in Halo and Killzone (The games weren't that wonderful to begin with, though, especially Halo, avoid that one at all costs). Anyway, no complaints here either. So far so perfect...Stroyline/Gameplay- 8/10 If I were to complain about anything, this would have to be it, but only on a minor level. The gameplay is flawless and retains that Goldeneye feeling...but the story...well I wish I could say the same. While definitely not a bad storyline, it isn't at all memorable. Basically, it is the generic \" Aliens are attacking and we must destroy their base\" ruitine. During the first half of the game the storyline is well- executed, but the horror begins later on. Basically you meet up with a cute little alien named Elvis later on,and discover some interesting things. The first half are spy missions similar to Goldeneye, just more featuristic. But later on, it turns into a Halo-deal, something I wasn't looking forward to. Actually, when I played this game when it first came out, I hated the solo missions, but loved the multiplayer. After playing through the game again, I can say that the solo missions are indeed very fun, but I never found myself getting attached to them or wanting to finish the game on the Perfect Agent difficulty setting. Overall, the solo missions aren't the masterpiece that was Goldeneye, but given the fact that the gameplay is the same as Goldeneye's, it still manages to be fun.Multiplayer- 100/10 The multiplayer is so good in this game that I decided to give it its own category. Unlike Goldeneye where you had to pick a weapon scheme, this game lets you custon design the weapons selection. Theres a whole array of Sims, too, and you can put up to 8 on at once. The nostalgia of this games multiplayer is just amazing and hard to fathom, very difficult. You can also choose from a whole plethora of Sim types, venge sim, turtle sim (They get a barrier for a long while, but they movem extremely slow, making for hilarious moments.) Difficulty settings for sims are Meat, Easy, Normal, hard, perfect, and dark. Dark sims basically can do maneuvers that humans cannot, kinda like robo-bots or something of that sort. Add 3 friends, yourself, and 8 Sims to the mix, including teams, colors, and a whole array or multiplayer schemes (king of the hill, license to kill etc) and you are setting yourself up for a indefinite blast. I can't even begin to explain how fun this is, you just have to experience it for yourself. I have played Killzone and other new-age shooters and can still say PD surpasses them to extraordinary lengths. Also, lest we forget the challenges. The challenges are extremely fun missions where you have to accomplish a certain deed, and if completed you unlock new stages, weapons, and sims for Multiplayer. You can also play the challenges with up to 3 other people, but the difficulty level goes sky high.Multiplayer stages- 7/10 I wish Rare would have designed more Goldeneye-esque multiplayer stages. Most of the new stages are rather generic and not very innovative. There are a few great ones (sewers, ravine, and some others whose names I forget), but overall the stages have a rather dull and uninspired look. Don't fear, however, because the Goldeneye favorites are back. Facility (how called faculty or some other odd name) returns as basically a ported but slightly upgraded version of the goldeneye level. Another favorite, Complex is back, and the same can be said about Complex, basically a ported version. Temple also returns, although unfortunately I am not a fan of this multiplayer stage.Overall- 10/10 Solo missions asside, Perfect Dark is arguably the best first person shooter ever made. The multiplayer is worth it alone, and for a petty 4 or 5 bucks, you cannot pass this game up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. Get ready to jump out of your couch cushions!--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessGreat cooperative modePlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multi-player options","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"Play it for the Engine and Frights","reviewText":"Doom3 is not the greatest 3rd person Shoot-em-up as that honour still resides with HL and maybe even its sequel but let us first talk in terms of certainty. You have never seen anything like Doom3 before. Even the lush landscapes of FarCry can not prepare you for Doom3 however since the game has been developed for the 512mb card systems (only existing as multiprocessing SGI boxes but in a year or two we should see them) you will only really get to see this Almighty engine running on a 256mb pro card like the Radeon 9800 series. So I suggest you think heavily about upgrading to the best card you can simply because this is here and HL2 source.Doom3 is just one big demon kill from start to finish. The story takes place on Mars where an invasion has nearly wiped everyone out. Every movie theme from The Exorcist to The Thing is played out in full. Doom3 borrows like no game you have seen before (just check out The Terminator exoskeleton on one breed of monster) but that just makes it all the better because the fantasy world is 100% immersive and plays as if you are really there in among the horror and action. The thrill of this game is why it deserves the 5 star treatment but there is more - Your PDA is like a mini computer that you gain info from near terminals located at various stages. You read other people's emails and learn codes and secrets that help progress your mission.What can seem annoying at first is the fact that you must play 50% of this game virtually in the dark except for a flashlight. Now for about 60% of the game this effect is like being in the Blair Witch Woods or akin to it because zombies and demons come out of everywhere and you must shoot them, so down goes the torch and up goes the chainsaw and watch segments of your victim carve off if some parts manage to send sparks flying from a computer on the right, or it all happens in the dark. A gun that makes a nice explosive effect might light up the room for a few moments to see that there, in the darkness, is probably the most complete rendered monster ever committed to the realm of 3D gaming. In terms of reality - Doom 3 is like no other and deserves the 5 stars for it, however the story or at the least the novelty of the game starts to degrade towards the end after about 60% completion. The rest is basically boss beating and nothing novel, but the graphics do stun. Also a lot of the story and plot elements borry heavily from HL1 (monster bosses a bit similar, enemy troops after you, vents etc).In short, play this game now on a 256mb card but also look forward to this engine being developed into an even better game. Doom 4 anyone?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired.

The control scheme is fairly intuitive (especially if you've played Uncharted).

This is definitely a masterpiece when it comes to the hand drawn and painted textures.  Makes other games pale in comparison.  I think the equivalent on the Xbox 360 was Alan Wake, but it can't hold a candle to this!+ Great voice work for the characters - Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson are great at voicing Joel & Ellie respectively.+ Brutal intelligent combat system gives the game an awesome feel.  The variety of melee takedowns and the flamethrower are wonderful at giving the game it's dark atmosphere.  Hand-to-hand melee combat is much more intelligent than any Uncharted game.+ Acquiring limited supplies and crafting items from the tools you collect is the hubris of The Last of Us.  The tools and abilities menu gives the game almost hybrid RPG elements.+ WAY BETTER THAN ANY UNCHARTED GAME HANDS DOWN!  I hope there is a sequel because this is the greatest game that Naughty Dog has produced thus far.Cons (Why A 4 Star Rating):- Winter level is the start of where the game fizzles.  There were just too many ambushes and forced encounters by clickers and infected.  One of the strengths of the game is it's emphasis on strategic stealth.  I wish the entire game continued in this vein instead of making the player memorize spawn points of enemies coming in to attack you.- Difficulty on Hard without listen mode can be frustrating in certain circumstances, specifically The Hunt during Winter where you are ambushed frequently.- Switching between Ellie and Joel is choppy breaking the game's fluidity and momentum.- It would have been great if Naughty Dog made this game online co-op where one player could play as Ellie and the other could play as Joel.  I would have rather played as Joel the entire game.  Maybe this should be a suggestion for the sequel on a next gen platform.- Game is just too short to be a $60 game.  I beat it using about 6-7 free Redbox game codes playing only a couple hours per day.  Would I play the game again to acquire all the artifacts, firefly pendants and max out Joel's weapons and abilities?  Maybe.- Brutal and grisly violence and post-pandemic theme is not for everyone.  At times, getting bitten by a clicker was overtly dark and horrifying.  This is a survival horror action game and occupies a specific niche.- Ends abruptly and couldn't tell you what the resolution was.  Did Joel & Ellie eradicate all the infected and save the world?- Technical issues such as loading freezes in addition to in game bugs forced me to shut down the game and delete + reinstall game data in order to fix.  Maybe this means that this game utilizes too many resources and my fat Cechl01 PS3 couldn't handle it.  I don't know, but it hampered my experience with the story.The Last of Us has been a great experience albeit a somewhat short one.  Coming off the heels of Ni no Kuni:  Wrath of the White Witch, I was honestly expecting a longer game.  It felt like the developers lost steam towards the end.  If you own a PS3 though, definitely experience it.  However, it's brevity coupled with the technical hiccups I experienced forces me to suggest renting it first over purchasing.NOTE:  There is a workaround where you can play your second game on Survivor + instead of having to playthrough the game on Survivor first:  The details are here:[...]I haven't tried it but I'm thinking about it if I decide to playthrough the game a second time...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2013"}

In that regard Madden NFL 12 absolutely delivers - and it makes for the most enjoyable and satisfying Madden this generation and arguably reaching even farther back into the previous platform era.POSITIVES-PRESENTATIONA concerted effort was made with Madden 12 to capture elements of the television viewing experience and the game attending experience and though there is still plenty of work to be done it represents a significant and valuable advancement in presentation. Authentic camera placement, team entrances, blimp shots, crowd cuts, and more were all great touches. Crowd noise is much better than NCAA but there should be more impact to the crowd affecting road teams and roaring louder in appropriate situations (such as after a challenge decision).Of course there were aspects of the presentation that eroded some of the overall satisfaction. Players bumping into each other on the way back to the huddle, the jarring cut to the two minute warning where then nothing of significance is shown, challenge replays so poorly handled that they don't actually show the event being challenged, a lack of a halftime or post-game show, and sparse crowds in adverse weather conditions stand out. All relatively minor on their own but necessary to clean up for the presentation to reach the next level.-GAMEPLAYThere is no denying that the gameplay improvements received were a large beneficiary of avoiding going the `gimmicky' route this year. Gameplay is much more satisfying with some legacy issues corrected and the lack of suction paying dividends all over the field. Proper football strategy is rewarded more than ever and the result is some incredibly compelling and competitive games that have provided some brilliantly exciting moments. Fun factor due to all of that is especially high.GameFlow and GamePlan have been enhanced with the addition of Custom Playbooks - allowing for the benefits of GameFlow to be more likely utilized. Stats are often in line with expectations and the flow of the games have been ideal. \"Player Traits\" really start to differentiate individual performance styles beyond just ratings. The CPU is finally competent though ultimately the challenge offered by the CPU will vary from person to person. The sliders appear to be effective for those who choose to tinker with the various elements of gameplay.Dynamic Player Performance is difficult to quantify but does seem to have considerable impact and swing performance and ultimately even on-field results. Hot and cold streaks come into play and often early struggles will carry over to later in the game as players lose confidence. When the main positions are user-controlled though the struggles will stand out more than the successes - as getting a small ratings boost is unlikely to completely change the outcome of a play - just as a small ratings decline probably won't mean a drastic result. There does need to be a way to see what DPP is doing without going into the pause menu.There is no perfection here though - the lack of a battle for the ball between the receivers and defenders is especially glaring. Play action remains improperly implemented and special teams has been largely neglected with kick and punt return blocking flat out horrible. The new kicking camera and system, and the surprise onside kicks, are the only positives to mention as it pertains to special teams.-FRANCHISE MODEThough the improvements to Franchise don't necessarily seem to warrant having taken a full year off from the mode they do make a large impact as they capitalize on the areas most requested for receiving advancement. Expanded rosters and cut days, practice mode, trades of future draft picks, draft scouting, and player roles are all intriguing additions.The biggest success is the new Free Agency bidding system. Though it should be more obvious how to view upcoming free agents before the bidding frenzy begins it makes for a fun and pressure-filled event. \"Player Roles\" are an interesting element in how teams are shaped along with how they can affect on-field performance.The weakest aspect is the draft scouting, which simply doesn't provide enough information on enough players to make much (or any) difference. I felt largely in the dark for the majority of the draft as picking at the end of the round meant most of the prospects that had been scouted for the round were gone by my choice. Beyond the scouting then you're left with knowing nothing but their projected round to make a decision on.A few issues worth noting - a few teams are stuck with rain in every (or nearly every) home game, there is an issue with draft classes from NCAA Football 12 not coming over unless they are saved after the players leaving stage, players lose their \"role\" if anything about them even equipment is edited, the new free agency system is not good for multi-user franchises, and preseason games are a complete mess.-ONLINE PLAYThis is the most successful online play experience to come out of the Tiburon studio. Performance has been excellent, the games have been ultra-competitive and very fun, and the Online Communities feature has proven initially valuable.One unheralded but very important tweak to online comes with the kick meter which appears to account for any lag being experienced. The meter will snap back a tad after the button press and it has proven to be quite accurate. Kicks have been missed not due to any lag but due to user error. It's the first time that kicking in a football game hasn't been problematic online. Lag in general has been minimal - a slight sluggishness in some cases but easily adjust to - and most games have felt so good they could have passed for being played offline.Online Franchise was passed over for improvements in favor of Communities - a decision that could be easily questioned. There is no lobby room within the communities making head-to-head games difficult to come by for most people. I've had to tweet out that I want a challenge in order to get a game and most won't have that luxury. Though they offer something considerable the sense I get is most will be completely dead within a month. Maybe smaller ones within groups of friends will have more long-term success.Custom Playbooks and their integration into GameFlow comes in handy for ranked online games. Inexplicably Custom Playbooks were omitted from use in the Online Communities and Online Franchise. There has also been an issue faced by a small percentage of users who have been unable to get past the \"Checking Rosters\" step. EA is still investigating but a temporary workaround is to save the latest rosters to a USB drive and the game will recognize that and proceed past the problematic step.NEGATIVES-COMMENTARYTaking the most flak this year is the commentary and it isn't completely unwarranted. Though there is a decent flow that is about the best that can be said, and it is certainly a big drawback overall on the complete package that Madden 12 attempts to offer given the number of errors called out and noticeable recording flaws.Lines recorded last year vs this year sound completely different, reactions often run far behind when they actually take place, the same stories are repeated every game, and the announcers often call a player by their number rather than their name. There are also unjustifiable gaffes like referring to the Titans as the \"New York Titans\" at every coin toss or talking about the \"new\" overtime rules in a regular season game where they don't even apply.The lack of special commentary for preseason and postseason games really hurt their immersive nature. There is no special Super Bowl commentary - in fact the announcers will talk about homefield advantage. That sort of thing is just killer.-SUPERSTAR MODEThis mode wasn't a main focus and it shows. Touted improvements were an improved interface, skill points to distribute for ratings increases, coordinator audio, and a switch to the standard camera angle. Most of those things actually were provided but did little to make the mode interesting. Coordinator audio and commentary was completely absent however.Players automatically start at their respective position regardless of ratings and there is nothing that goes on in the off-season. The mode is just flat out dull. It also isn't readily apparent that quarter length can be adjusted - that is done through the main profile and not within the mode.SUMMARYNFL fans will appreciate what has been done with Madden NFL 12 as the title attempts to tap into what it means to be emotionally invested in a team or the league. The vastly improved presentation and gameplay combined with a much more enjoyable Franchise mode help to cover up the flaws that comes with growth that can't be completed and goals that can't be reached in just a single year. It's finally alright to be excited about the Madden franchise - that is if they don't change course in their vision yet again.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2012"}

I thought it would either be a total flop, or it may be interesting.  The trailers where cryptic, no information online, and mostly skeptical critics commenting on demos they played.  I heard that it was too hack and slash, then I heard that it was a totally in depth RPG complete with gardening and fishing.  Its both.I know, that's really weird.  It doesn't usually go.  But it does here.  The game play is rather difficult at first, at least for someone not accustomed to hack and slash action type fighting.  The fact that it lacks a \"lock on\" function is a real draw back to me, honestly.  But over all, it's enjoyable, and challenging.  Some of the fights have reminded me of Zelda with their puzzles and problem solving aspects to it.The game starts out with a bang, and within the first half an hour I'm certain you will be intrigued and must play more!  It makes you want to know more, it sucks you in.  The story, so far, is like nothing I have seen before.  It reminds me, in looks, of Shadow of the Colossus, except about a million times better because now there are towns and many people and creatures to interact with.  It's also beautiful, and the back drop is indeed haunting, while still keeping a hint of Whimsy for the Square Enix touch.  I'm so pleased that Nier has come out, when I was tired of being disappointed by SE's Final Fantasy releases post FFIX, and I was recently disappointed with FXIII's lack of an open world, well Nier fills that in spades.The world is vast and gigantic!  and you will be sent into it for many reasons, to deliver fragile packages that will break if you are knocked down or jump, to kill sheep and harvest mutton to a fussy lady with tons of fat children, or to run off and save your Daughter.  And no, I'm not at all feeling that I lost out on the Japanese story, I like it much more as a father.  I think it is more unique, and it makes more sense.The characters are outrageous, and will often be saying very filthy things that will have you laughing out loud.  I would not advise playing this game around small children.  :x but many times I will laugh so loud that people who are in the other room will ask me what happened, and I will recount the video games content.  It's very funny, and very unexpected.The game is an all around hit.  I've been playing it non stop since I got it, and I only stopped because I got caught on a particularly hard boss and my fingers started to hurt, not because I wanted to stop.There are multiple endings, and quests that effect your characters proficiency in many of his day to day things, like fishing or gardening.  And of course, he has his daughter at home, he cannot ignore her, he has to go home and check on her too.  All of these actions affect the outcome of the game.  The world is completely open, you decide in what order you do things, and it is beautiful and wonderful.  It reminds me of the open worlds in old Final Fantasy games. (I am a Final Fantasy loving geek, so you have to understand, that is a huge compliment in my mind!  hehe)My only complaints is with the camera angles... some of them are terrible in certain boss fights, and the camera control can be buggy in small spaces.  I dont consider it a huge issue, or any debilitating issue of the game, though it can be frustrating in the grand scale multi-tier boss fights.  Also, it appears that you can only play as Nier, and not as Kaine or any of the other supporting characters.The story is wonderful, the game play is fun and the music is absolutely fantastic.  I would buy the Soundtrack without a blink if I found it on sale anywhere yet!  All around, the game is a total hit!  Any RPG or action fan would love it!  I can see the \"God of War\" and \"Devil May Cry\" fans going for this, just as much as the \"Final Fantasy and other RPG\" fans as well!  (I'm in the later category, and I have no complaints!)  I love it.  I recommend Nier, and I'm excited to see more of this new Franchise of SE's.  ^^Edit:  I just found the soundtrack on iTunes, all 44 some+ tracks.  It's amazing!  This game is really phenomenal on all the right levels :)Edit: I've played through the story, and I have played the second ending.  Oh... my god.  No really, I can only ADD stars to my review.I the game has 4 endings, all revealing more shocking and unexpected story twists... new cut scenes, and other FUN stuff.  After you beat the game, you do not have to restart the whole game and get to keep your character info and weapons/items (to avoid spoilers I will leave it at that)  I love this game.I find myself thinking about it, months after buying and playing it, and still wanting to play it.  And the music, wow phenomenal!  I still want to, and plan to play through the other 2 available endings, I'm procrastinating because once I play them, there will be no more Nier, not until they release another, and that makes me sad.  This game is really something wonderful!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2010"}

Wii, like all the previous releases in theSuper Mario Bros.franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun.

{"product_name":"B00004SVS7","description":"GAME CARTRIDGE CLEAN WITH CASE, NO ORIGINAL INSTRUCTIONS. [A FUN GAME]","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"Oh, imagine that, another 8 robots to fight.  After I've already beaten 40.  God this is getting monotonous.","reviewText":"By the time Capcom released MEGA MAN VI on the NES, it was obvious to all in the industry that Nintendo's 8-Bit console, the machine that resurrected the video game market in the mid 1980s to the multibillion dollar industry that it is now, was on its last legs.  Capcom wanted to move Mega Man to the SNES, but before doing so, they made a final chapter for everyone's favorite blue bomber.Ironically enough, Capcom chose not to release MEGA MAN VI in the United States, publishing the game only in Japan, due to their decision to put their efforts behind the new MEGA MAN X series.  When Capcom informed Nintendo of this decision, Nintendo took it upon themselves to publish the game in America, which is why the game was never released in Europe.How does it stand up to the other five games?  Actually, not that bad.  It's obvious Capcom is running out of ideas.  The basic story is that a mysterious Mr. X (gee, I wonder who that could be) has been setting up a robot tournament, and when Mega Man shows up, all the robots turn against Mega Man and Mr X tries to take over the world.  Naturally, when you defeat Mr X, turns out it is Dr. Wiley and you have to go into a second castle.  While Mega Man IV and V at least at an element of surprise in their \"twist\" ending, by VI you can tell it's Wiley from the beginning, even kinda looks like him.First off, the graphics are top notch, and so is the sound.  But that is little surprise as Mega Man always had great graphics for the NES.Capcom was so bereft of ideas They even had contestant winners in Nintendo Power design two of the robot bosses (Wind Man, designed by Michael Leader of the US, and Knight Man, designed by Daniel Vallie of Canada).The other six bosses are largely retreads of previous robot masters or just plain ridiculous.We have Plant Man (who, might I add, is the single worst boss in not only Mega Man, but in all of video games - he's just gay).  His (lame) weapon is a flower shield, and basically he's a poor boy version of the superior Leaf Man from MEGA MAN II.  We have Blizzard Man, who for whatever reason is on skis.  Ripoff of Air Man from II and Ice Man from the first game.  Flame Man is yet another heat-based robot master (we've already had Fire Man from I, Heat Man from II, and Napalm Man from V).  We have Tomahawk Man, who is very formidable, but still feels out of place and like Capcom was really stretching for ideas.  Centaur Man is at least somewhat imaginative. The worst, though, is Yamato Man.  Apparently Yamato is a geographical term in Japan.  It'd be like Oxford Man or Birmingshire Man or Las Vegas Man.  Incomprehensible.  Stupid.  Even Wind Man, who was designed by one of the contestant winners, is little more than another version of Air Man.The levels themselves, while compentant, are hardly what you call inspired.  A lot of them you have seen before in previous incarnations, especially Flame Man's level (come on, we've had fire-themed levels before).A bad part of the levels is that four of them have false endings, I guess in attempts from Capcom to give the game more replayability. In each of the levels for Tomahawk Man, Yamato Man, Knight Man, and Centaur Man, two separate boss chambers appear, one more difficult to reach than the other.  By accessing the more difficult of the two you get one of four letters (B, E, A, T), and when you get all four you can now use Beat, the robotic bird from Mega Man V.  Quite frankly, the fake endings are rather dumb.The last levels have some engaging moments, even though one of the castle bosses (a big dragon) is a little too similar too the boss dragon of Mega Man II for my comfort.  There's another stage in the Wiley's castle which is primarily dirty water and those spiked orbs, which is again a throw back to Mega Man II.The end features Dr Wiley being thrown in jail, with the last words and a newspaper picture printed.  The ending provides good closure for the series, but then Capcom spoils that by saying \"To be continued\".  Still a good way to close the NES leg of Mega Man's journey as far as story-wise goes.Mega Man also has some new features.  Taking a page from Mario, he has a rush adapter that allows him to fly (albeit, pretty briefly).  This is featured prominently on the game art.  Beat returns.  I would like to have flown longer, given how much this was hyped.Is MEGA MAN VI a good game? Yes.  Without a doubt.  It would be an even better game its five predecessors did not exist.  Because ultimately, even though they tried adding some new things to the Mega Man formula, at the end of the day, Capcom with this title feels tired and uninspired, like they trying to squeeze one more dollar out of the Mega Man franchise.  But that's largely because MEGA MAN VI is just more of the same.  If you like the formula you'll love this title.  But it is still very formulaic.All the NES Mega Man games are good, but they're largely the same.  I'd go with II or III first, but if you haven't played any Mega Man games VI is a good place to start.  But II and III should be your first choice.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2007"}

It seems pricey still at 399 but once you play around with it for awhile you understand why. It's such an elegant machine. The build quality is immaculate and the on screen menu (XMB) is smooth and professional. The old complaint that \"it doesn't have enough games\" no longer applies. There are many great games out now and more exciting titles on the way, like Uncharted 2, Heavy Rain, Ratchet and Clank: A Crack in Time and God of War 3.Setting it up to connect wirelessly to my router was a breeze. It has built in wifi. There are quite a few nice little things you can do. I set up my PC as a server, which is very easy to do, and I can basically see my entire C: drive on the PS3 menu, and really cool is how the PS3 can read .avi and other movie files. Just click on the .avi file on the XMB menu and it plays it. No need to insert a converted and burned disc in the PS3. How cool is that. Want to view all your pictures on your tv and listen to all your music that's on your computer? It's all there. Recently they updated the firmware with a nice new photo viewer. It's an excellent media center if you're into that.If not it has great games to play. Another nice thing is the free Playstation Network. I've spent a lot of time browsing stuff on here. Tons of free demos, game preview videos, interviews with developers, the free biweekly magazine Pulse and quite a few good games. There are casual games if you need something lighter, your Bejeweled type games. There are also more serious games like Wipeout HD and one of my favorites Super Stardust HD. The standard price for games is 9.99, but some are a few dollars more or a few less. There are movies to buy or rent too, but I haven't done that yet. The general consensus is that X-Box Live is better right now. However, I'm satisfied with the PS Network Store, expect for one thing, the text and pictures are a little too small.Another feature is the browser. It's basic but functional and usable when you get used to it, and it nice to see the web on your HDTV if you have one. As an example I could have easily written this review from it, but I don't have an extra usb keyboard. It could use some work though, like updates to various plug-ins. It does support flash though and can play Youtube videos and Hulu.A quick little complaint is the usb cord that comes with it is too short, it's about four and half feet. So if you're charging the wireless controller it's hard to play games. I bought a ten foot cord for about 3 dollars to solve that. As many others have said, it doesn't play PS2 games. But after playing current-gen games it's hard to go back so it doesn't really bother me. I've only watched two movies on the blu-ray player and they looked great. Eventually I'm going to upgrade the hard-drive because I am running out of room. There are other cool little things I didn't mention but a new owner will discover them. So overall I'm very happy with the PS3. It's a fine piece of equipment providing many hours of entertainment.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2009"}

This is not your balls to the wall shoot em up, but rather a thinking person's game where the point is to interact and enjoy the story, creatively think your way past enemies and make decisions that will affect your game play.All of you have probably heard about the creative elements of the game play...others who reviewed it have covered it, so I really don't want to get into that...if you have read enough about it I would say you have to see for yourself.What is more important to me is how much this game creeps up on you and scares you into playing a little bit more. This game IMO revolutionizes the FPS because of the content. It's pretty much doing things storywise what Resident Evil and Doom has been trying to do for years.I am recommending that if you play this game, don't do it on anything less than a home theater system.I am playing this on a 51\" HDTV, 7.1 surround sound with the lights on dim and my goodness it is IMMERSIVE. YOU WILL JUMP...you will laugh...you will be scared....the first time I faced off with a big daddy it was to be believed. It crept up behind me...I heard it coming and instead of turning with my joystick I literally truned around and luckily I didn't already aggro it but it was up on me and walked byand my heart was in my throat.  There is this one scene early on (and u get to see it in the demo) where you see a sillouette of a lady rambling to a baby in a carriage and it's truly eeirie and there are SO many moments like this throughout the game. You can gather recordings to listen to the insanity that these people were into. And sometimes feel sorry for some of the people that you have to kill.And yes, there are even more mysteries in this game. again similar to Lost...and this is where I wrap up:- Is it a coincidence that your plane crashed here?- What is the story behind the tattoes?- What went wrong and made these people crazy?- Who or what are the Little Sisters and why must you choose?- Why would any seemingly sane person that wound up on this island willingly inject himself with gene altering material to get powers and what effects will they have on your character by the end of the game?If you are looking for a game that will keep you in the dark while you play it in the dark (best way to play) BUY...THIS...GAME. I have a feeling that this will be the bestseller of the year...Halo my sell the numbers due to the fan base but Bioshock will sell because of the immersive story alone","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"Tex \"dionysus_olympus\"","summary":"Superb Gameplay --> Game of the Year","reviewText":"This has to be one of the greatest FPS/adventure games, right along Deus Ex and Red Faction.  This game overall has distinct similarities to the original Deus Ex, as permitting the character to develop as he or she wishes with biomodifications.  The underwater environment of Rapture is simply awesome to behold.  The neon glow as you stare out the window is reminiscent of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.  Continuing on, the only downside is that there aren't too many variations on the \"regular\" enemies such as the Splicers.  Splicers are essentially mutants.  The cool factor of the enemies lies in the Big Daddies.  They are essentially bosses of each level, and they are generally escorting a Little Sister.  The Little Sister is essentially the basis of the game.  They have been mutated, and they drain the component ADAM which is needed to modify you. After killing a Big Daddy, which takes at least some planning and strategy, you have two decisions to deal with a Little Sister -- harvesting or rescuing them.  This stems throughout the entire game -- moral decisions, some insignificant and some rather significant as the Little Sister, and this mirrors its predecessor Deus Ex. The biomodifications and the old-style weapons are very easy to use, add and modify. Overall, this game should be in lead for Game of the Year.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2007"}

Some flaws but generally great fun!","reviewText":"The Good1. Huge world, really really big.  You could spend days just exploring the different areas which range from snowy mountains to desert to jungle to beach.  This is easily one of the biggest maps I've ever seen on a game like this.  You can't reasonably drive from one end to the other which is why airplanes and even the extraction (fast travel to known places) comes in so handy!  Plus there's so many villages and places to explore, its easy not to get to all of them!2. The feel of the world is very accurate in many ways.  Having lived in Southeast Asia for a few years, many of the buildings, road stands, food carts and other details were spot on.3. The story is very interesting and engaging.  I enjoyed playing out the main story line and seeing how it went.4. Lots and lots of missions and activities that will keep you entertained for many hours.  Between the races and the faction missions and the main mission, there are a lot of activities.5. The place names and speech makes me think this is like Malaysia, but a lot of the character symbols and buildings are Thai in nature.  Interesting!6. Lots of things to destroy.  As a matter of fact, destroying things is pretty much a requirement of the game and there's always stuff to take out.  The amount of items in game that can be destroyed or damaged is impressive, though in many cases the destroyed thing seems to respawn as repaired later on (only for items that can be damaged but don't contribute to point totals).  But they seem to have nailed our inherent need to blow stuff up!7. The details can be pretty neat.  Like dust on a car after you've driven down a dirt road for example.8. I finished the main game in about 41 hours and got around 43% completion.  So while I took my time and enjoyed what I was doing, there was still lots left to do if I wanted to.  After you finish the game, mercenary mode lets you go back and destroy stuff,  discover and complete places, do races, etc.  I was pretty happy with where things ended up so I didn't feel the need to do more, but I enjoyed it while it lasted.The Bad1. You really need a good computer to run this thing.  I have a quad core with dual graphics cards on Windows 7 so it was pretty smooth on my end.2. The buttons don't work half the time.  I don't know if this is a port issue or what, but I have to hit the F1 button (for map) about half a dozen times anytime I want to see the map.3. The physics, especially for driving, could have been a bit better.  This game came out in 2010, over a year after GTA 4, yet the driving physics seems a bit inferior.  The physics is more in line with a game from 2005 or 2006, NOT 2010.4. The damage to vehicles seems to be what  you would have seen in a 2005 game (like GTA San Andreas), not a 2010 game.  It as if you're driving a box and when you hit something the box gets a dent which is pretty unrealistic.5. There were a few buggy times when my guy would get stuck somewhere or sometimes the NPCs would get trapped in a place and you had to restart the mission (or load a save if not in a mission) to get out of it.  It didn't happen often but it would happen from time to time and it could be frustrating when it did.Overall it was a great game and an amazing value.  I bought it on sale here at Amazon when it was under $4.  For that price and the amount of gameplay you get, it's a no brainer to try it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2013"}

I'm not saying it is the best fps to come out (it honestly is a 4 star game), but factoring in that it wasn't on my radar and thus coming in with low expectations, it really surprised me in how much fun it is.  I played the first Darkness and couldn't get myself to finish it because it was a bit tedious and lacked cohesion so I found myself getting bored about half way through it.  I think the developers realized this and basically streamlined the whole experience with Darkness 2 and made it a fast paced fps.  The gimmick is that you control 2 serpents from your shoulders, one acts as melee and the other as retriever.  They're always available to you when you're in the dark so shooting out light sources is a prerequisite to each new area.  The boss battles are fun, but all too similar and lacked any scale.  The weapons and upgrades are very fun to use and the controls are exceptional which is really what makes the game fun to play.  I skipped all the cutscenes in the game because I rented it and wanted to be done with it quickly and even then, it took me about 6 hours to finish, which is my sweetspot for an action shooter.  Someone wrote that it took abut 3 hours which is utter nonsense.  I'll probably buy this once it hits bargain basement which shouldn't be too long from now and see what the story is about.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003ZSP0WW","description":"","reviewerName":"Dr. D","summary":"Definitely Not the Best Controller Out There","reviewText":"I don't understand why people would say that the Xbox wireless controller is the best, most ergonomically designed video game controller on the market.  It really isn't.  Number one, it uses batteries, so you constantly have to buy new batteries or use a recharging kit.  I tried looking online and conducting research to find out if there's a separate USB cable that could hook the controller up to the Xbox in order to make it wired, but I found no such thing.  If anybody knows of a cable that can do this, please comment about it below, but to the best of my knowledge, no such device exists.  I see a hook-up port of some type on the superior aspect of the controller, but that seems to be a slot for your headset.  As great as that convenience might be, I'd rather have that port be available as a cable hook-up for the controller.No such problem exists for the PS3 controller.  For the PS3, it doesn't have any batteries, and the wireless controller charges while it's plugged into the system.  Why couldn't the Xbox controller do the same thing?  It's mind boggling...Another drawback to the Xbox wireless controller is the battery pack itself:  do you know how hard it is to remove the batteries from it?  It's ridiculous!  It was so hard to take the original stock batteries out of it, and then I put in a set of rechargeable ones.  Those, too, were very hard to remove from the pack, to the point where I thought I had to break it in order to get them out.  Not too good!Speaking about the design of the controller, why do people say that it's more efficient and \"better\" than the PS3 controller?  I don't see how.  The PS3 controller has a more linear style to it, with the thumbsticks neatly arranged in a horizontal fashion, and the trigger buttons are appropriately labeled as L1/L2 and R1/R2.  The Xbox calls them LB/LT and RB/RT.  What the heck kind of designation system is that?  I get so confused when an action calls for using those buttons.  Giving them a number system is a lot more efficient.Overall, I strongly favor the PS3 controller over the Xbox one.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2012"}

I havent played The Run yet, but in my mind, the series was at its best with Carbon.  VERY slick graphics (especially considering the release date), cheeseball (but fun) drama and dialogue, fantastic music (always a highlight of the series) and manageable controls (i.e. pick 'em up quick) all make for an excellent racer.Upgrades come quickly and plentifully, but the challenge is there - this \"balance\" is what is missing in so many racing games, the ability to dive right in with little learning curve, yet is still not easy to master.  The car selection is strong, the mods are cool enough, the characters are enjoyable (if not over-the-top), and again, the sound/music is maybe the best of the series, overall.Its not perfect - later sessions in the game become almost impossibly difficult (for me, resulting in eventually giving up on the final race), but until that point, it walked a fine line between difficultly and enjoyability.My favorite thing about the game, though, is the inherent \"slickness\", from the menus to the chrome paint of the cars, it just glldes in and out of actions and cutscenes and interface screens like its on rails.  It has a \"look\" about it, and its something more games need, that cohesiveness that more than makes up for the weak points.

The premise has not changed. There is a back story with a modern day guy reliving the life of his ancestor. This time it is Ezio Auditore, a nobleman's son in Florence Italy. Ezio is driven to the assassin's life by the murder of his father. I actually started playing the game before visiting Tuscany for the first time. It was fun seeing some of the sites in the game that I would soon visit in real life. The game also gives in game background about the history of certain buildings and people.Comparing AC1 and AC2, AC2 seems to have more of a sandbox feel than the first one. In some ways, it reminded me ofThe Saboteur. There are numerous side missions and things to collect or do in each place. Some of the side missions are pretty vanilla and short, but the Assassin Tombs are more challenging. AC2 does not have the repetitive investigations that were part of AC1. If the side missions don't excite you, they can be skipped without affecting main plot. I think the hand to hand combat in the AC1 was more fun. AC2 allows you to use medicine in the game which makes dying in battle practically impossible. But AC2 has more weapon options and the extra features of the blade are cool. Money has also been added to the game. It allows you to purchase arms, armor, medicine, etc. This was kind of neat at the beginning of the game when your resources are limited, but as you progress in the game you'll have more money than you could ever spend.The DRM has been modified. You can now change the settings in Uplay (UBSoft's online service) to allow you to play offline. The Cloud Save Synchronization (remote save) is now optional. For all those that passed on the game due to the DRM, it's safe to come and enjoy the game.

Maybe they aren't as over the top as other games, but they have a personality all their own.  Right when you pop Tekken 6 into your system, you may seem overwhelmed with the HUGE character roaster.  All of the over 40 Tekken characters are unlocked right from the get go.  You will see some old favorites, as well as a few new comers.  Most of their moves are similar to previous Tekken games, so if you were a champ at Tekken 5, you should have no problem here!Beginner Friendly:Not many fighting games will let you be good right from the get go.  In Tekken 6 even if you have never played a Tekken game before, you will have no problem getting onto the groove of things.  Whether you are button mashing, or pulling off the crazy 10 hit combos, you are going to find yourself having a great time.Sense of StyleLike most fighting games, they try to make themselves flashy in some way.  Tekken 6 may not have any super special moves in games like Street Fighter, but the combos are extremely in-depth, and have a deep sense of satisfaction after putting a chain of moves together.  It isn't just the fighting that has style either.  If you know anything about the Tekken story-line, you will know that it is just simply ridiculous.  The endings for each character have their own sense of craziness and all Tekken fans will enjoy them.BalanceNo character in Tekken 6 really seems over powered or unbeatable.  Each character has they're advantages and disadvantages, but there is not one single useless character, or one God character to be found.  So if you see someone who looks cool and you just want to play as them, practice makes perfect kiddies.  Become an unbeatable master with Jack-6, or destroy everyone with one of the Mishimas, it's all up to you!More than the fight:Fighting games need to have more than just fighting now a days.  Tekken 6 offers a large form of customization for all characters.  You may not be able to make your own custom character, but with all the options to change the appearance of one of the Tekken 6 fighters, you will think you did!  Tekken 6 also sports a single player story mode which can sometimes be enjoyable, and this will last you a good number of hours.The Bad:LagOnline matches are great in Tekken 6...except when you encounter lag.  In all fighting games lag can simply kill you, the same can of course be said for Tekken 6.  When you encounter lag, you will find yourself having a hard time putting together combos, or trying to perfectly time your attacks.The Verdict :If you are in the mood for a solid fighter that has PLENTY to offer, Tekken 6 is for you.  Even if you have never played a Tekken game in your life, this is something to be experienced.  Lengthy single player, cool characters, customization out the wazoo, and an ever growing online community make this a must own fighting game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2009"}

It was one of the early console RPGs and features a nameless party of 4 trying to save the world.  Fast forward 15 years and we come to the 10th installment in the Final Fantasy series.  This one is the first Final Fantasy to make it to the Playstation 2 console.  The game features voice acting (for the first time in the series) and the graphics are so far advanced from the 8 bit sprites of the original that it is only in brief glimpses that we remember the original.We see a character named Tidus, star player of a popular aquatic sport called \"Blitzball\".  He is going to play in a big game and we learn that he is still living in the shadows of his father who was a legend in the sport.  As the game begins we see a tidal wave crashing in on the city and a large monster attacking.  We learn later this monster is called \"Sin\".  As Tidus meets up with a family friend and tries to escape, he falls off a bridge and after a dreamlike sequence he is in a different world.  As Tidus learns where he is, we learn that it is 1000 years after the destruction of his city, Zanarkand.  He meets up with a local man named Wakka who agrees to help him find out what happened (nobody believes Tidus's story).  Tidus accompanies Wakka and a Summoner named Yuna.  Yuna is on a quest to defeat Sin (still around a millennium later).  Tidus is heading to Luca (a central city) to discover a way home.  Thus begins a game that increases in scope as events unfold.The first thing that must be said when talking about this game is that it is the most beautiful game I have ever played.  The graphics are incredible.  Nothing really compares to these graphics.  The colors are vibrant and the characters are free of the old school sprites.  While this game may have come out early in the life of the PS2, these graphics are still a standard.This is the first Final Fantasy game to feature voice acting, and while it is well done, it does not reach the level of either of the two Metal Gear (Konami) games, or even Kingdom Hearts (Squaresoft).  The voices do not match the movement of the characters mouths and occasionally sounds clipped and inappropriate for the scene.  Even so, there are no major complaints with the voice acting.  No major praises, either.Previous Final Fantasy games had an Active Time Battle System.  This meant that each character got to attack depending on how quickly his attack bar filled up.  Final Fantasy X has a turn based system, where each character gets to attack (or cast healing magic, etc) in his own turn (based on speed, and status affecting spells).  This is a small change.  The big change is that for the first time you can switch characters in and out of battle during the battle.  This makes it easier to use everyone in a battle (gaining precious experience) and to use the characters in the most effective way possible.  Out of all the Final Fantasy games, this is my favorite battle system yet.Overall, this is not my favorite Final Fantasy game.  My favorites are Final Fantasy VI and VII (with IV coming a close third).  If this game did not have to be compared to previous games in the series, it would rank as one of the top of the line RPGs (with only Suikoden III as the other top line PS2 RPG currently on the system...as of January 2003).  Excellent game, if a little too linear for my tastes.  You could only explore the world at the very end of the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2003"}

In their journey across a vast landscape, these lawless gunslingers will stop at nothing to achieve their goal &mdash; and woe to any man who tries to stand in their way. Arm yourself with pistols, cannons, machine guns and more as you strike out on a mission with two fearless compatriots whose bonds of blood are only strengthened by the blood they spill together.","reviewerName":"A Gamer at Heart","summary":"UNIQUE AND ENJOYABLE BUT LIKELY BETTER AS A RENTAL","reviewText":"I am about halfway through this game, which is a first person shooter set in the Old West.  The story is fairly cinematic and centers around three brothers, two of whom are gunfighters and the third a priest.  The story mainly concerns the struggle amongst the three brothers for their morality.First, I need to give points to the developer for setting the game in a unique setting, the Old West, versus yet another science fiction or military setting.  The graphics are quite nice and the western towns and landscapes look realistic and authentic.  The voice acting is also top-notch.As far as game play goes, the game eventually drifts into somewhat of a repetitive rut.  This isn't to say the game is not fun, it's just that it gets a bit predictable.  Similar to the latest Grand Theft Auto, there are movie-like cut scenes that advance the story.  As soon as that cut scene ends, you are immediately placed into a massive gunfight, playing as either of the two gunfighter brothers. The gunplay is far more arcade style than realistic, as you gun down 40-50 opponents per level despite being shot yourself over and over. You are basically doing the same thing (shooting and running) to the same enemies (infinite enemy cowboys) in slightly different settings.  That said, the game play is still enjoyable, since the period weapons of revolvers and lever action rifles are fun to shoot within the game.Multiplayer is a bit lacking.  It seems crude and primitive, and reminds me of early PC shooter multiplayer modes.  The MP population is sparse - I have been unable to even play a ranked game because too few people are even on line to populate a single match.Once the single player game is done, given the lack of multiplayer population, this game lacks replay value - hence I think it better a rental or a bargain bin purchase.  The single player game is not entertaining enough to play through again as whatever brother you played through initially. I have still enoyed playing it in between rounds of Call of Duty. As of this writing, Amazon is selling this game for $35 - which I think is a fair price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2009"}

Man, I love this game to death.  I always remember the Christmas morning when I got this, stayed up waaay too late playing, really love it.  But this game seems to get a lot of flack from the youtube \"gaming community.\"  I see a lot of people calling it \"childish\" or weak compared to the first two.  A big problem according to people are the main characters, Kiddy & Dixie.  They say \"oh kiddy's too slow and looks too childish.\"  First off, Kiddy controls EXACTLY to DK in the first DKC.  He's a heavy weight, moves a bit slower...but he can take out the larger enemies with a lot less effort.  And Dixie was in DKC2, we all seemed to love her there...  And as far as the \"childish\" aspect goes, the whole DKC series was always very youngin' friendly.  This isn't \"Yoshi's Story\" (N64) by ANY means!!  This game has a lot of challenge and only improves upon 1&2.  The controls and gameplay are basically the same, only with added mechanics.  My only complaint is the music on occasion isn't quite as memorable....but that's just my opinion.  it still has GREAT GREAT original tunes.  Otherwise, DKC3 holds the high standard.  Anyone who played 1&2, PLEASE!  If you haven't, play DKC3!!  And good luck completing this 100%.  A very challenging feat.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0053B5RGI","description":"The Next Evolution in Pokemon comes to Nintendo 3DS.","reviewerName":"S P","summary":"A masterpiece.","reviewText":"The Pokemon series has been going strong for over fifteen years now - and for good reason. The formula works. The idea of catching monsters and leveling them up appeals to core RPG mechanics and it's simply addictive gameplay. Yet, the series seemed to have quieted down; you could even say it became sluggish for a few years there. Me, and I'm sure many others, got pretty bored with the series somewhere around HeartGold/SoulSilver and Black/White. The formula seemed to have been tried way too many times way way too few changes.Welcome to Pokemon X and Y. From the time they were announced it's been clear: this is a reboot of the series. From the simpler and more abstract names to the new console they're on, this is a fresh entry in the series in many ways. Whereas the DS was flooded with Pokemon games (ten, to be exact) that all looked more or less the same and all played more or less the same - including many remakes - the X and Y pair bring much that's new to the table.First, and most noticeably, is the 3D graphics. The game is 3D in two senses - the polygonal models that are a first for the series, and the 3D effect that you can only experience on the 3DS. The graphics pop off the screen and make 10+ year old monsters seem fresh again. The sheer joy of seeing Zigzagoon or some other old creature in 3D is really special to a veteran of the series.The core elements that players love are still here. You'll find an amazing variety of Pokemon hidden in bushes and bodies of water and at special scenes in the game. But much seems to have been streamlined - less reliance on HMs, the reintroduction of experience sharing across your party, and fewer new monsters (they can slow down at this point, I'm sure we can all agree).The series has developed into a masterpiece.. not just fun, but beautiful.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2013"}
