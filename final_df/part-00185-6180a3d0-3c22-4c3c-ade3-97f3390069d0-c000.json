I'm of the minority that found AC 3 to be fun it seems but I feel like this one definitely was back on the level of the first two in terms of overall polish and excitement.I really liked the open world gameplay and all there was to do in the game, the graphics were amazing, and the main story quests seemed to work well with the game to keep things lively.I don't have anything negative to say about the game -- I highly suggest playing it at least once.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000067DPC","description":"The year is 2027. The machines of Skynet have risen, reaping a bloody harvest of human flesh across the globe. You are a soldier of Tech Com, a ragged team of human resistance fighters intent upon stopping the overwhelming onslaught of cybernetic assassins in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. Your ultimate goal is to reach a time travel device in time to send Kyle Reese back to 1984, with the hope of preventing a relentless Terminator model T-800 from murdering Sarah Connor, mother of resistance leader John Connor.This game is set before the events of the firstTerminatorfilm. There are three playable characters, each with specialized skills and abilities, including Kyle Reese, hero of the film. The 11 massive missions take the player through diverse, richly detailed, highly interactive environments. The dynamic camera system allows the player to target cyborgs with speed and accuracy, using never-before-seen weapons of wanton destruction.Terminator: Dawn of Fateincludes both missile and melee combat in third- and first-person play modes.","reviewerName":"Gregory John Ranzoni \"r_to_the_z\"","summary":"\"It's Always Darkest Before Dawn.\"","reviewText":"The game opens with the drumming theme from the Terminator movies, the camera pans along the twisted nuked blasted wreckage of what was once Los Angeles. Once a sprawling metropolis, now nothing but a twisted surreal, hunted nuclear waste land. As the bingeing cut scenes progresses, John Conner gives a foreshadowing narrative telling of, briefly, the creation of Skynets, (later on he gives a more complete story as you complete one level after the next), and the up coming mission of the game. The cut scene ends with an explosive shot out between Kyle Reese and a T-800 Infiltrator (For all those Arny freaks out there, he dose not appear in this game, as far as I know.) That's where the game begins.Terminator: Dawn of Fate is a prequel to the terminator films, much like Phantom Menace, only better acted, it tells the story of the final battle to crush Skynet and the events that lead up to the first movie. You play three characters through 10 very long missions, Kyle Reese, the hero of the first movie, Captain Justine Perry, who Reese mentions in the first movie, and then there is Lieutenant Catherine Luna, who I think is mention in the Terminator 2 movie book by Randall Franks. You can use a vast arsenal of weaponry throughout this game. Each weapon has it's special use, like the AP50 machine pistol and the AP10 Assault Rifle good for quick kill head shots. The PLM40 is an all purpose weapon, but I think that the best weapon in the game is the shot gun, It can kill anything, from H/K Recons, to the HK Spiders.The controlling of this game is very awkward it changes with the camera, and the camera changes every fifty feet of movement, leaving the play slightly disoriented, how ever the Adrenaline rush feature and the First person targeting makes up for it.This is game is for those who are true fans of the Terminator franchise, not just the movies, but the comic books and video games, you have to like this game for it's story, not it's game play and action. The story is what caught my attention to this game, not the graphics or the action but a story that has substance that goes beyond the main body, in this franchise, it's the movies.I loved this game, I rented once and played it for three days straight beaten it on easy mode, and I must say that it is [very] easy. I just bought this game recently and I'm now working my way through the medium levels and at the same time, trying to unlock the cheats, which isn't any easier. If easy mode was hard, and medium is next to impossible, what would Hard mode be like.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2003"}

When I did get it and found out what it was about I thought geez how boring, but turned out I found this game addictive.  It's a bit of the Sims with better graphics.There are a few things I would change but they are minor.  First, I found the watering of plants/crops annoying if I wanted to build up my stock I had to spend several hours of my day watering crops.  They could have easily added an irrigation system or watering can upgrade that you could purchase where you could water your field instead of each individual seed.Second, you are given the task of finding a wife among 3 different girls, but really there is no purpose to the wife.  She mentions that she's done all her work, but really she does nothing.  I'd have loved to have been able to have a button or option to have her water plants/crops or cut the fodder.As I said those two things sound major, but they didn't stop me from playing this game.  The game graphics/caption chat were a welcome over the traditional unintelligible SIMS speak.  The ability to fish was nice.This game even now sounds utterly boring to me, but I am enchanted by it's farm simulation!

{"product_name":"B002ZJNWWC","description":"","reviewerName":"J. W. Mullins","summary":"Squandered Potential","reviewText":"There is no way this game could have lived up to the hype, nor did I expect it. I had just hopped for a good, quality FPS to enjoy. And I got that in this game, though partially. A big thing about the game is the talk about th 'tier one' operators who helped in development. Out of that came some good, the weapon selection is very good and true to what was often used by the different forces. There is a good amount and mix of weapons scattered about the levels. On thing that is helpful, but not too realistic, is that you can always request ammo for your main weapon from a team mate. So you don't have to worry about running out or picking up some other weapon. But the amount of ammo everyone carries is a little crazy, but needed for the game I guess. The kits and uniforms used by the conventional forces and SOF is pretty good. I'll caveat that by saying the Ranger's wearing the newer UPJ pattern and ACU during the time the game is based is less than accurate. The weapon handling is very good though, with the reload drills and the like very good and real world accurate. The weapons being used are also very accurate with what the actual units were, and are, using at the time the game is based.The story is familiar to anyone who has read of SOF operations in Afghanistan early in the war which is nice. That said the story over all is a little thin and character development is almost none exiestant. You take turns playing a DEVGRU Sailor, a Delta Soldier and an Army Ranger which gives good pacing at least.The AI is poor for both enemies and team mates. While the opposition is able to shoot remarkably well, they also keep sticking their heads out from the same place in cover or running to the same position to be shot. The team mate AI isn't any better, which is ashamed considering what they are supposed to represent. The missions are totally linear. More so than past MOH games or even the CoD franchise. There is normally only one way to do things and one path to follow, don't do it and you die or fail the mission. There are a few running and gunning sections including a flight in an attack helicopter. It does help vary the missions some.The graphics are exceptional at times, the cut scenes are really something else. The controls are very familiar to any who has play CoD recently. The game play is not as good as either MW2 or BC2, both of which is will constantly be compared to. You spend a good deal of time mowing down endless waves of enemies which takes away from the realism that is hyped so heavily in the ads for the game.All in all it is an enjoyable play. The campaign is about six hours or so and with the lackluster story and linear path is not worth more than one or two play through. The muliplayer is very BC2, which makes since as it was developed by the same company an BC2. I enjoyed the game and while the story and mission is more 'realistic' than other offerings it fails to match MW2 in terms of gameplay, pacing or story. The game is painfully linear and there is often only one way to do what you need to during a mission. If you deviate from that you die, if you deviate from the path you have to follow, you die.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2010"}

I didn't really understand him or Waluigi and felt they were unlikable. I still don't like either of them, but the WarioWare games have always been fun and wacky. Touched tried to utilize the unique features of the DS such as the mic and touchscreen. I honestly feel this is the weakest WarioWare yet with mini games that are too obscure for the one word instructions and some even feel unresponsive. It doesn't help that the game is so short you can beat it in one sitting. I even felt the little stories were stupid as well.The menu consists of icons that you can touch varying from \"toys\" to people who feature mini stories. The stories are lame and make no sense, but in a bad way. You have to watch these stupid long unskippable cut scenes and then you are thrown a montage of mini games. They range from slicing, tracing, pushing, pulling, spinning, poking, blowing, and various other acts with the DS hardware. Most feel appropriate for the hardware, but some are unresponsive. You will try to make and object move and feel you aren't getting anything done in the short 3-5 seconds you get for the game. It took me 2-3 tries for each level because the one word instruction was too obscure to follow for these zany mini games. The games are some of the weirdest yet like a nude cherub statue urinating water on a mountain that's on fire and other wacky stuff. Some mini games are too simple like popping bubble wrap or spinning objects to make them match or even lighting candles. They start out super easy then get extremely tough. Like all WarioWare games you get four lives then it's game over. The boss stages were really tough and some were just frustrating.Apart from that the toys are just plain stupid. They last all of 5 seconds and you never use it again. Things like making flan jiggle, banging on a piano, or blowing a little toy windmill. Why would you put these in a game? Maybe a 2-year-old would find them interesting, but no one above that age. It's just a waste of space in which more mini games could have been in. There was just a lot of stupid ideas put into this game and it was rushed to show people what the DS could do. If the game were longer or had better mini games it could have been something great.As it is, Touched! is a decent rental for a day and that's it. The toys are lame, the games repeat often, and they are either too easy, too easy, or unresponsive. Some are even down right lame. It's a shame because WarioWare is one of Nintendo's unsung heroes in their library and needs more attention. If the game wasn't so rushed it would have been so much more.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00001XDUB","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"Enter Silent Hill if you dare","reviewText":"What a perfect day to review a dreary, scary classic video game.  This is one of those rainy, cold and windy April days.  We have them every year. After being teased with exceptionally warm weather a couple days ago, days like today make you realize how lucky you are to experience warmer than normal temperatures.  I could sit here and talk about the weather all day (and I probably will after this review is finished) but it's time to review a game that was groundbreaking at the time of its release.  A game that was VERY disturbing then, and just as disturbing today.For those of you older gamers who've been playing games way before Silent Hill was released, I bet you've played games that had their share of creepy moments- a certain memorable level in a video game that you've always felt uncomfortable exploring because you just didn't think you'd be able to calm your nerves when you arrive to that area of the game.  Come on now, you can tell me it's \"just a video game\" but when everyone leaves your bedroom, and it's just YOU in front of your TV screen playing a video game late at night, you're bound to come across SOMETHING in SOME game that will frighten you.  Now imagine if an ENTIRE game featured TOTAL nonstop adrenaline-pumping fear.  A game that strikes fear inside of you like no other.  We're talking about a game that forces you to think about death, and really frightens that little part inside of your head that you thought had been permanently laid to rest once you entered your teenage years.  This game brings back every childhood fear and then adds some more.This is truly a game for the strong-gutted.  It's true that the level of fear in this game is so high that you will constantly be looking over your shoulder whenever you begin to feel frightened- you will be looking down the hallway of your home and looking out the window to make sure nothing is there.  You want to make sure all those noises you are hearing are coming from the game and not under your bed or somewhere else in your home.  I never thought it was possible to create fear in such a way and pull it off successfully in a video game, but that's what Silent Hill is all about.  Believe it or not, I really think this game is scarier than any movie I've ever watched, and that includes classics like the Exorcist and the Ring.  That's because, in the world of video games, you can picture yourself as the main character (Harry) and picture what it must be like for him to visit a town like Silent Hill and the amount of fear that must be going through both you and Harry. You see, because you, the gamer, are controlling Harry, it's not just Harry going through the dreaded town of Silent Hill by himself, it's YOU and Harry. You two have to stick together and make it out alive.  Both of you have to put those scary feelings aside and progress through the game.There's a little something that makes this game even scarier- the sound of hearing an enemy coming closer to you but not being able to find it. Many times it will be too late and the enemy will have found you first, and you'll take an unexpected blow.  That's not to say the game is a frustrating experience with enemies coming out of nowhere cheap-shotting you, but occasionally it will happen, and this makes the game a LOT of fun. It makes the atmosphere so real and intense you can almost taste it.  If you like entering the world of survival horror and thriller movies, this is the game for you.Just picture this- you're walking down a street in an empty town.  It's snowing, and it's quiet all around you.  Suddenly you hear wings flapping far off in the distance.  You stop dead in your tracks.  The sound becomes louder and louder as *something* gets closer and closer to you. You quickly check all around you to try and see if you can find where that sound is coming from, but you don't see anything.  A scream is heard from far away, a demon-like scream, and then another louder scream soon follows.  Before you know it, you see giant flapping wings right above you, attacking your head.  Your instinct is to defend yourself, but when you turn and aim the gun, the enemy is nowhere to be seen.  You continue to hear flapping sounds and prepare yourself for another round with the beast.  But the sounds get softer and softer until they disappear.  You ask yourself \"is it gone, is it over???\" while continuing to hold your gun in the air.  Sometimes during these moments the enemy WILL be gone, other times it will trick you into thinking it's gone but then come back for another fight.  And this is just in the DAYTIME part of the game!  Imagine how much harder and more frightening this battle becomes when the sky suddenly turns dark and the enemies want to come out and play.  That's what makes the game so great- you just don't know what to expect.Or how about when you arrive to the hospital?  You enter a hospital and no one is around.  Once again, everything is quiet.  It's not so scary, but it's definitely eerie, and it makes you cautious.  You think about what might be ahead of you.  You don't want to explore this hospital but you HAVE to if you want to finish the game.  You look outside the hospital window to see snow still falling to the ground, just as it was before you entered the hospital.  Not so scary, but MAYBE I would feel better if I could find someone.  This hospital is just a LITTLE too empty for me!You explore all the rooms, find some clues, and arrive to an elevator.  You click to go to the third floor but the door is locked, so you have to go back.  You try the second floor and once again, you can't go through the door so you have to go back to the elevator.  You think to yourself \"okay, this is just strange\".  Back inside the elevator, for some unexplainable reason, a 4th floor suddenly becomes an option, so you go there.  You ask yourself \"was that 4th floor ALWAYS there?\"  This time, when you come out of the elevator the door isn't locked, and you're allowed to enter the floor.  Once you enter that floor you WISH that calm, snowy daytime scenery from a few moments ago was still around because now you're in a dark haunted hospital surrounded by nurses with knives constantly slashing at you, floors that have been turned into gates and dreary walls soaked in blood all over every room in the hospital, and the music that plays here is simply amazing the way it makes you think about blood just waiting to ooze from all over the place.  It scares you so much you just want to throw up, and there's no avoiding it- you can't turn back now.  It's a total nightmare!I know the Playstation's old graphics look dated by todays standards and many people have a problem with them, but this game is an exception because the grainy graphics really add more fear and excitement to the game.  It makes it so, no matter where you go, you're surrounded by this world of dreariness.  The level of fear doesn't let up at ALL throughout the entire game- you are forced to either get used to it or else turn off the game if you can't handle it.  I honestly believe there's nothing to be ashamed of if you can't handle it.  Many people can't watch horror movies because after the movie is over and they turn the television off, they're afraid of the silence.  Every little sound they hear after the movie is over will make them jump and yell \"what was THAT!!\"Silent Hill features a variety of fears- you have the \"boogeyman in the closet/sleeping with the light on\" type of fear, and the other major and more dangerous \"please don't make me think about death because I don't know what happens when I die\" type of fear.  It's important to realize, no matter how frightened you may be, in the end you're only playing a video game.  I don't want anyone to go crazy letting the amount of fear in Silent Hill get the best of them, and walk around all day light-headed and nervous.  It's just a game (and you may think I'm exaggerating, but I'm honestly not- it's very well possible Silent Hill could bother you days after you play it).But you have to give a lot of credit to all the people that brought this game to the Playstation- they set out to make the ultimate psychological horror experience, and they succeeded.  It was groundbreaking at the time because no other game company at the time dared to attempt to turn up the amount of horror that this game offered.  It was revolutionary in the world of video games.  With all due respect to Capcom and the Resident Evil series... those games are fantastic and a lot of fun, but Silent Hill made the amount of fear so high that many gamers are afraid to not only play it, but even THINK about it.I think the one thing that makes the experience so overwhelming is the music.  In the final level of the game you will come across some atmospheric parts that sound exactly like an evil wind blowing right by you (and I mean YOU, not Harry Mason).  That's an incredible sound right there.  I'm not someone who usually exaggerates but the creators of this game may have surprised themselves with this constant flow of creepiness!Silent Hill also offers plenty of other things.  A good (but confusing) story, plenty of enemies to shoot with your three guns (or smash with your hammers and swords) and fantastic attention to detail in every area of the game.  Truly deserving of 5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2006"}
{"product_name":"B000GHLBUA","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Great Fun but a Mite Tricky for Tykes","reviewText":"The problem with games like Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz is that you have rabid fans of the series - some who love them no matter what, and others who hate any slight change, no matter how small.That means that no matter how well or poorly the Wii version was, those who loved the game on previous platforms will either hate it for changing - or love it because it has the same theme.Let me first say that I love the Super Monkey Ball series in general. I grew up playing the actual marble game - Labyrinth - that this is based on. In the Monkey Ball games, there is a marble (holding a monkey) that rolls around on a surface. You tilt that surface via the controls, to move the marble. Your aim is to gather up bananas, avoid obstacles, stay on course and reach the goal. There are both the main game path, which involves trickier and trickier courses to navigate, as well as mini-games.With the Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz version for the Wii, you get an entirely new level of interactivity. In essence it's becoming more \"real\". In previous versions you pressed buttons to tilt the board - but now you are actually *tilting* the controller. You're in essence playing with a real board, with a real marble. You tilt your controller forward, the marble rolls forward. It is incredibly intuitive.For some people, like me, this is great. It's no longer a button press \"translating\" into motion. Your hand is causing the motion. I can hand the controller to anybody that comes into my house, show them the game, and they get it immediately. It's physics, it's beautiful.While this is great, it also means that it gets challenging for really little kids. They don't have great hand-eye coordination yet. While they might be OK with button pressing, they aren't wonderful at holding a controller steady to guide a marble along a path. They probably aren't playing professional soccer either. I'm not saying this is \"bad\" - but I'm saying it's something you have to accept. The challenge level of this game is fine for kids in the intro levels, but the later levels are meant to challenge talented gamers. Little kids might feel stumped here. They can always replay those earlier levels to try to get all the points there, and practice their skills until their bodies catch up.In addition to the main gameplay path, there are 50 mini-games. This is of course a huge number, but as with any new release, some are upset that their previous favorites are altered. That's going to be true with any new game. I have to agree that some mini-games here aren't my favorites. I specifically don't like the games like the \"harpoon\" games that make me \"thrust\" my spear into fish. I don't find that thrusting motion with the Wii to be very accurate. On the other hand, I love some of the other games. That's why they give you 50 of them - you'll like some, dislike others. I'm sure other people love the fish game and hate some of my favorites. If you're fond of some of the previous GameCube mini-games, heck, stick the GameCube game into the Wii to play them. The Wii takes the older discs, after all.In general the graphics are quite nice, bright and colorful. The music also strikes the right note of fun and casual gameplay. The real beauty of this series - and the Wii controllers - is that you can get anybody to walk into your house and within minutes they grasp what is going on and play along. You can't say that for most XBox 360 or PS3 titles, or even for several other of the Wii games we own. I really do give Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz great kudos for what they have here. If I had any complaint, it's that they might have wanted to add a \"super easy\" mode so that little kids could play through the entire game even if they lacked coordination. This is one of those super-kid-friendly games and while it could allow adults to cheat, I think the benefit to little tykes to \"get through the game\" and be happy would be worth it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2006"}

{"product_name":"B003Q9RG9K","description":"","reviewerName":"Arch Stanton","summary":"As Good as a PSP Valkyria Chronicles Could Be","reviewText":"In this review I am generally going to try and avoid comparing this game with the original, but there are somethings that need to be said so I'm getting them out of the way here. This game cannot hold a candle to the PS3 original, and the reason is almost entirely the graphical limitations of the PSP system. The beautiful cinematic cutscenes have gone, replaced by still images with text boxes that don't really add as much to the feeling of being present in the world. Another limitation is that the levels cannot be as large or detailed as the ones in VC1, which means that they had to find new ways to expand them. They do this by making each battle consist of several separate levels. Worse, except for the main story-advancing ones they repeat the same level maps over and over. It gets tiring very quickly.As a standalone game VC2 holds up quite well. The combat system is still unique, and one that I wish more SRPGs would copy. You place your characters on a map and then click on one at a time who you then control. You move him around like a third-person shooter, only no other characters can move at the same time. The enemy will still shoot at you, but they can't move around to do it. When you stop to aim the game pauses to allow you time. It's an excellent combination of the best parts of shooters and SRPGs.A nice feature of this game is that you level up classes rather than characters. This means that you don't have to keep alternating characters to get their stats up (though you do have to alternate them to get their story bits completed). To this has been added an individual character customization setting which might seem a bit of a throwback considering what I've just praised, but in fact adds to the experience by letting you change an individual's specialization alongside the group stats. And it doesn't require any experience to do it, just awards that you're given for completing missions. Unfortunately, that does mean that the characters you want to specialize have to be the ones you play as, but then again that's why you'd want them to change specialization isn't it? Specializations can be ignored and still let you win the game, though it's pretty much impossible not to gain a few here and there.As I mentioned in the beginning, the levels are not large maps but a series of smaller ones connected together. When you capture an enemy base it captures one of their bases on a different map as well, allowing you to travel there. This means that while the levels are technically quite large, the game only has to load one small map at a time. It's a fairly clever way of getting around the limitations of the PSP and doesn't actually bother me. It's probably not as fun as it would be were it just some large map, but the challenge then becomes managing multiple maps at the same time. In other words, the challenge of multiple maps requires different tactics from a single large one. I'm rather more annoyed at the repetitive levels used over and over again. There are only about five of these and you'll be thoroughly sick of them by the end.The story is not particularly gripping, partly because they get distracted by minutiae. You don't get to be pursued by enemies or have your schedule changed that greatly. You spend the entire game in school, except when you go on missions. Those missions are run through your classroom. It's a pretty decent control mechanic to allow you to select missions and train characters, but it does rather lower the sense of drama and danger. You know that nothing can change too much or they'd need to redo all the settings. It's also a bit irritating that the game is set in a school and not the army. It seems a bit unlikely than they would send students out to right a massive rebellion.It also gets bogged down in secondary character subplots. These are actually a great improvement over the first game since they give you a real feeling of camaraderie. However, it is possible to have too much of a good thing. It seems like it would have been better to incorporate this character fluff in a slightly less-integrated way. As it stands it often seems like advancing your side characters' subplots are more the point of the game than the main plot. At the least, it needed to find a way to make the main plot seem more important than the side missions. These side plots are fun, but they shouldn't come at the expense of the main one.Since we're discussing characters I have to turn back to the first game for a brief moment. That game had an abundance of memorable characters including Welkin, Isara, Rosie, and Largo. I'm going to focus particularly on Welkin here since he was the lead. That man was great as the focus of an SRPG. He was clearly intelligent and thoughtful, and his amusing character traits that saw him obsessed with wildlife grew out of that intelligence. Avan however, is not that. He's kind of a thoughtless idiot. Now this wouldn't be a problem in a normal game, but since he's constantly beating all the other characters (because he's being controlled by you) it appears that he must be a bit of a genius, all evidence to the contrary. It's not so much that he's a bad character per se, but as the lead in a game that's about intelligent planning he is very much the wrong choice. The side characters are entertaining though, including Zeri, his ever-irritated Darcsen second in command, Helmut, the scary Imperial exchange student, and many others. And because of those side quests you get to know them a lot better.So my verdict: This is a darn good PSP SRPG. It has a great combat system, a neat world, and engaging characters. The graphics are very good for a PSP game, and are used to good effect. There are some irritating features such as the limited number of battle maps and the silly lead, but on the whole this game achieves greatness. However, when compared to the original it just isn't as good. It could never have been. And that irritates me. If only they had released this game for the Vita instead. That system would have been perfectly able to handle the graphical challenges posed by the original game. Since it seems unfair to blame the game for not living up to its predecessor I'm giving it five stars for gameplay that is as unique and addictive on the PSP as it was on the PS3. The only truly annoying bit that could have been avoided is Avan, but aside from that the game is as good as it could have been considering the PSP's limitations. But please, try theoriginal. It's much better. Promise.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0047THYWC","description":"","reviewerName":"Flea Returns: FF13","summary":"Not Origins but still a great game","reviewText":"Quickly I always rate games on three categories. Gameplay (how it plays, graphics), Story, and Characters (Character development and how I enjoy the characters). Story usually is weighted the mostDragon Age 2 is a great game. I will start off by saying that I loved DA:O and, while this game doesn't quite stack up against it, it's still a great game IMO.Gameplay: 8/10Amazing really. Some small sacrifices like limited customization of your party, missing specializations (I'm looking at you Champion and Arcane Warrior) and recycled dungeons kind of hurt it but added things like battle animations, cross class combos, and non linear progression in your abilities all made up for it. A lot of people are complaining about the recycled dungeons but honestly it really doesn't bother me that much because every time I walk into the same old dungeon, new battles and events are waiting on me. I did think that blocking off parts of dungeons/houses was kind of lame but really just a small negative in the grand scheme of things.The limited customization of your party members is a big sticking point with people as well. I like the fact that my party members have their own clothes and look completely different. I hated the fact in DA:O that all my warriors looked the same, my rogues looked the same, and all my mages (except for Morrigan) looked the same. This is a good way of solving that problem. I am saddened that they took out my favorite two specializations (champion and arcane warrior) but they gave me enough in the other specializations to make the hit less noticeable. The graphics were a big uptick from Origins as well. For every negative in the gameplay there is at least 2 positives.Story 8.5/10Pretty good. You can't help but compare this to Origins though. The story doesn't come anywhere close to Origins however it still does a good job. The story seemed a little frantic and was taken over by the IMMENSE number of sidequests. I like sidequests and I definitely saw the purpose of them in this game but it did detract from the main story. The change in tempo is refreshing for me. I mean who wants a world that has a potentially world ending problem every 5 years. Thedas would be awful. We just had a blight 7 years ago...let's not throw the world into chaos again this quickly. But it is obvious that the story overall just doesn't stack up against Origins. Not many stories can stack up to a corrupted god leading an army of ravenous flesh eating mutants against the world.Characters 9/10About on par with DA:O to me. The characters had about the same spread of awesome characters and forgettable characters. For awesome characters DA:O had Morrigan, Shale, and Alistair. DA2 had Varic, Isabella, and Anders. For forgettable characters, DA:O had Oghren and Zevran where DA2 had Aveline and Sebastian. And the rest fell somewhere in the middle (DA:O you had Leliana, Sten, and Wynn that were neither awesome but they were still good characters, and DA2 had Merrill and Fenris that were actually pretty good). I'm not counting in the siblings because I have only done one play through and that was with Bethany. And since ***Spoiler***you lose your sibling for the majority of the game ****End Spoiler**** and the fact that my playthrough I had Bethany, I can't really count them.The one area that DA2 had better in the character department was easily the character quests. Fenris, Isabella, Merrill, and Varric's sidequests were amazing. DA:O character quests had maybe one amazing one? That would be morrigan's. The others were good but not as good as DA2. Also, the fact that Hawke was voiced in this one surprisingly made me enjoy the game more than I thought it would.  This was a major sticking point before the game came out but I haven't really heard many people complain about it now that the game is out. That probably means Bioware did this part well.Overall 8.5/10Really this game is a good follup to DA:O. It definitely has it's weak points in forgettable characters and lame gameplay elements (repeated environments, the vast number of sidequests that were virtually little more than fetch quests, and limited party customization) but overall it served it's purpose by giving a quality story to expand the world of thedas.  With the absolute awesomeness that was DA:O it's hard for something to follow up to be anywhere as good. But DA2 does it's best and does well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2011"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Very fun follow up to the original masterpiece","reviewText":"Has it really been over a decade since the release of Sega's original Nights?  Hard to believe, but yes, and what's even harder to believe is that it took Sega all that time before coming out with a follow up to their cult smash.  Anyway, Nights: Journey of Dreams is here for the Wii, and the game is a very fun follow up to the original masterpiece, and despite it's flaws, is a blast to play.  If you've played the original Nights, you'll feel right at home here with the flight-based gameplay, wonderful soundtrack, and brilliantly realized level designs that populate the Nights universe.  The game's artistic style is by far it's greatest strength, giving Nights an undeniable charm that is hard to top.  Where Nights disappoints is with some of the Wii-mote controls, which come off as too cumbersome, but this can be fixed thanks to the fact the game supports the Classic and Gamecube controlers.  Where the game also falls is with some of the on-foot platforming elements, which just aren't much fun at all.  Not to mention that just like the original game, Nights: Journey of Dreams is too short.  It won't take you long to get through the game, and once you do, as before, you'll be begging for more.  Despite it's flaws though, Nights: Journey of Dreams is one of the better third-party Wii titles to see the light of day this holiday season.  The charm of the presentation makes it worthwhile for children, and the addictive gameplay makes it worth playing for older gamers with fond memories of the original.  For those longtime fans of the original Nights, you'll be pleased to see many references and homages to the original game peppered throughout Nights: Journey of Dreams, but the game doesn't do this enough to put off new gamers either.  All in all, Nights: Journey of Dreams may not be as memorable or as close to a masterpiece as it's predecessor, but it is a very fun follow up regardless, and worth checking out for gamers of all sorts.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2007"}

Like Arkham, it is built in the Unreal Engine and viewed from an over-the-shoulder POV.However, the similarities end there. Unlike Arkham, Deadpool takes place in linear, distinct levels, which allows the developers to add more in the way of flashy set-pieces. Combat is also a bit more forgiving, with Deadpool having two attack strengths and dodging being considerably easier thanks to a handy teleporter. There is also ranged combat, and the chore of aiming, locking onto targets, and managing ammo is honestly one of the game's weakest points.Of course the reason to play a Deadpool game is the character's fourth-wall-breaking sense of oddball humor, and this game delivers in spades. The writing is punchy and hilarious, and Deadpool's wacky hijinks are backed up with all sorts of sketch comedy, musical cues, and flat out surrealist hallucinations. Even the serious parts of the game are pretty loony (one memorable sequence sees Deadpool traverse the demolished island of Genosha in the severed, rocket-powered foot of a gigantic sentinel robot). So engaging is the game's humor that it provides abundant inventive to overlook the way the camera likes to hide enemies from you sometimes, or the way that sometimes you will be unable to lock onto a distant enemy because they're obstructed by the over-sized hitbox of a stack of books.Special mention also goes to Deadpool's boss fights, an area where it actually surpasses Arkham. Every boss and miniboss requires a unique approach, but these aren't just gimmick fights- you need a solid understanding of the game's fighting mechanics too. It's worth noting that many enemies Deadpool fights are, in comic lore, well beyond him in power, and this is reflected with a level of difficulty that is beyond what one expects in a modern video game. It's not God-Hand hard, but some of the fights in this game are way tougher than anything Batman has to put up with in his games.PROS:-Great humor, solid voice acting, fun story-Controls are solid except for aiming which is kind of wacky-Good graphics with healthy doses of color and lots of fun details-Memorable battles and action scenesCONS:-Aiming for gunplay is a chore-Camera sometimes decides to do its own thing and is totally useless when fighting in close quarters-Combat just isn't quite as dynamic and fluid as in the Arkham gamesNOTES:-Activision lost the Marvel licenses a while ago, so this is it for this game. Buy it now or buy it never.-This game is a lot swearier than Deadpool's comic is, so parents of little gamers should be aware. It's also gruesomely bloody, but you knew that, right?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00006GSO1","description":"James Bond... Solid Snake... Ethan Hunt... Based on their recent games, all these so-called superspies could stand to take a few lessons from newcomer Sam Fisher. His name isn't important; the important thing is that his game,Splinter Cell, comes from Tom Clancy's game studio and offers up the kind of sophistication and control you'd expect from the studio that brought gamersRainbow Six. It's all about the details. When Sam enters a dark area, he's got two options, thermal and night vision. Thermal lets him see the body heat of an enemy soldier, even through walls and doors. Shoot through cover with a high-powered weapon, and you can watch as the heat fades from the body. Not dark yet? Shoot out the lights. Need a distraction? Pick up and toss a tin can. Come up to a door too thick to pass thermal readings? Sneak up to it, slip a fiber-optic lead under the door frame, and peek at what's beyond. When you're ready, open the door--just a little bit at a time. WhileSplinter Celllacks a famous hero in the lead role, it does sport the famous technical military thriller author Tom Clancy in the title. And you can see the evidence of his expertise in every facet of the game. Who needs the baggage ofMetal Gear Solid 2when Tom Clancy'sSplinter Cellbrings you better weapons, better controls, better graphics, better spy toys, and a coherent story?","reviewerName":"L. Blasiman","summary":"Good solid game.","reviewText":"Needless to say there is a lot of hype surrounding SC. Most of it is well earned. Perhaps what SC does better than any other game is deliver a solid well made experience with a lot of style, polish and oozes atmosphere. In short: there isn't a single element in the game that is lacking. It's hard to think of a single good reason why someone should overlook this game. And for PC gamers the game got even more work to use the newest state of the art graphic effects. The games' lighting and shadows not only look impressive but also is a key to the vast amount of stealth movement used through the single player campaign. For once a game that not only looks good but makes the graphics an integrated part of the gameplay.However I did not find it to be the game to end all games. Much of the campaign is scripted. Meaning some things will not happen with out the player triggering it first. This makes the game rather linear and requires some irritating trial-and error before you can pull off a perfect mission. There is also no type of multiplayer or other features to explore (would co-op be too much to ask for these days?). After you have played it once there isn't anything more to do but play it again and again, taking the same linear path to complete the objectives.Splinter Cell however focuses on doing one thing right rather than try to do too much. Certainly it delivers a just plain cool game well worth every penny.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2003"}
{"product_name":"B0000BVGOM","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"Best one yet","reviewText":"It's been just over a year since Unreal Tournament 2003 burst onto the scene and hooked PC players with its intense deathmatch action, but soon after its release, fans craved more levels, more game modes...more everything! Well, more has finally arrived, and boy, does UT 2004 deliver the goods. UT 2004 addresses all the flaws that plagued last year's edition, starting with the revamped single-player tournament. While a broadband internet connection is preferred, the superior combat A.I. ensures you'll have fun offline, too. All told, there are nearly 100 levels spaced across 10 play modes; you'll still find old favorites like Double Domination and Capture the Flag along with novel newcomers like Invasion (in which you zap armies of aliens). But there's more. The return of the much-missed Assault mode should please classic UT players, but UT 2004's crown jewel is the breathtaking new Onslaught mode, in which the goal is to capture and defend all the Power Nodes on a given level. Need more firepower? Hop into a devastating Leviathan tank, a nimble Manta hovercraft, or a stationary Energy Turret. Because it combines the best features of Twisted Metal, Halo and Tribes, Onslaught will appeal to a wide variety of gamers, not just hardcore UT fiends. Surprise, surprise -UT 2004 looks absolutely fantastic. From the sprawling battlefields to the tiny blades of alien grass, there's not one visual detail that looks less than stunning. Of course, a powerhouse PC (preferably housing a top-notch video card like a Radeon 9800 or GeForce 5900) yields the best results, but unlike the choppy PC port of Halo, these visuals are actually worth the investment. Besides, UT 2004 is riveting even with cruddy graphics-that's the real test, isn't it?UT 2004 doesn't skimp on the sound front, either, offering rumbling explosions and real-time voice communication, all with nifty 3D spatial effects. The sinister background music is catchy without being grating. UT 2004 isn't entirely free of flaws, but they're all minor irritants. The game consumes nearly six whopping gigabytes of hard drive space-ouch! And while the new anti-vehicle weapons are an excellent touch, a few more traditional guns would've been welcome, too. Despite the name, UT 2004 is no mere expansion pack. It's practically a full-blown sequel, but at a wallet-friendly price. And when it comes down to it, Onslaught alone is easily worth the forty bucks. If that isn't a recommendation, what is?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2004"}

It is the most fun game I've played in a while. The graphics shine and the frame rate does not drop a bit. A must have game for any LBP fan.The collectors edition on the other hand....a huge disappointment. It's only saving grace is the DLC, but that alone would not justify the higher price.Let me start with the sack boy figure, a total rip-off. What you see on the box is FAR from what you get. The sack boy colour is different, it is a chocolate brown; it's also stiff, not at all soft and flexible as the box art makes it look. The eyes are small and the zipper is painted on with a plastic handle. Poorly and cheaply made. This is a prime example of false advertising.The Bookends are made out of cartboard, glued and packed tight enough to give it a false sense of sturdiness. But they are cheap and couldn't hold more than a few games together, forget about actual books or games in tin cases. Again, a rip-off.The only good thing out of the package, besides the game itself, is the DLC offered. Lots of costumes and some avatars. So, if you want some all the DLC currently available, get the CE, but if not, save your money and buy only the DLC you want later on; the CE is good IMO, to get all the DLC now,  but don't expect much more than that. It was a huge let down for me, to the point that I will now think twice before I buy a CE of upcoming games.I was going to give a five star rating, because the game is good, but CE is too much of a let down.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2011"}
{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"G. Denick","summary":"\"Well, abra-goddamn-cadabra.\" -Sully","reviewText":"I have been a long time fan of games that attempt to blend cinema, emotion, and player input into what used to be deemed \"the interactive movie\" in the late 90s. Hideo Kojima pioneered these efforts with Metal Gear Solid and its follow-ups, and MGS was the first game that made me truly care for the characters. Thousands of games have since been produced, but few have been of a similar caliber of the MGS series.Then, Naughty Dog came along and changed everything. Drake's Fortune and Among Thieves truly raised the bar for how players could be drawn into the worlds and stories they were exploring, while streamlining the \"MGS experience\". For instance, much of the dialogue and character development occurs while you are actually playing, as opposed to taking place during static \"codec\" sequences.Drake's Deception continues the evolution of the Uncharted series with perfect pacing, mind-blowing action, and excellent storytelling, all delivered at even higher levels of production than the previous installments. Most importantly, this game compels you to care about the characters - particularly Nathan, Elena, and Sully.By now, you all know about the insane set pieces for the action sequences that this game uses... but still, you truly have to experience them to appreciate them. Battling through a sinking cruise ship or crashing airplane will surely put a smile on the face of even the most jaded of gamers :)I don't think I've ever had this much fun playing a game, and I certainly have never cared for the characters of a game as much I do in this one.

{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon","summary":"So far so good.","reviewText":"Might be kinda early for me to review this product since I only had it for a week but let's go.1. HardwareAs it stands it is the most powerful 8th gen console. It plays games from 720p - 1080p in 60FPS if you care about those. 500GB of space, but you only get 407 GB in reality. The rest goes toward the OS I guess. If you want to upgrade the HDD you can but I recommend waiting. A 4 TB 7200 RPM HDD will cost 200$ and so will a 256 GB SSD. More space is nice, but for half the price of the system? And SDD's load the game quicker but I'll wait for the price to be reduced.2. Software/OSMany times faster than the PS3's OS. Pretty simple as well. That's it.3. ControllerMajor improvement over the PS3's. Bigger, concave thumbsticks, trigger R2 and L2 buttons. Light bar and touchpad are borderline unless in my opinion, the light bar more than the touchpad (unless you have the PS camera). Thumbsticks might be cheaper than the PS3's. Mines already has a small scratch on the right stick on the top, but that might be my fault. I had the controller and the system in a small bag and yeah...4. GamesNot a ton of exclusives or even multi plats for that matter. May take a couple of months for lots of games to come on the system. I'm playing BF4 currently. Took a while to learn the controls from BF3 on the PS3, but I got it. Looking forward to Watch Dogs next. Deep Down maybe. Capcom is Capcom.5. AppsNot many either. Netflix, Hulu, Crunchyroll and Amazon Prime video might interest you. NO YOUTUBE APP STILL!6. OnlineNow you have to pay for plus to play online. I think it's worth it. You get free games across three platforms monthly. And they arent bad and old. They're good and fairly new games. You \"lose\" these games when your membership expires, but you can either become a member again to play them or just buy them (most likely at a lower price). Look up PS Plus for more details.7. Future FeaturesGaikai will supposedly allow you to play PS3 games on your PS4 and then PS3 games on your PS Vita and so on, but Sony haven't said anything about pricing. Will it be free, part of plus, separately paid for or do you have to repay for games? I don't know. Hopefully it will be either free or included with plus.8. ValueThe parts are 381$ for this 400$ system plus testing, labor to make (although it's cheap Chinese labor), shipping and packaging. This system is fairly priced and Sony may be losing money from every PS4 sold and making money from PS Plus and software sales. 400$ for the system is fair.Overall enjoying my ps4 and looking forward to the Japanese exclusives (mainly RPGs and JRPGs). Might want to check amazon every now and then if you want to buy a 400$ ps4. Act fast. They sell out quick. Have a ps3? I say keep it.

I had been in several times looking for one, and when I spotted this one on the shelf it went straight into my basket!  It's a great system, but not flawless.I'll go over some of the pros and cons:PROS:+ Horse Power -- this is a powerful console as expected, on par with many mid-range gaming rigs.+ Improved GUI -- I like the simple layout of the new user interface, though it does take a little getting used to.+ Components -- it comes with fast RAM, a Blu-Ray drive, and modern inputs & outputs.+ Standby mode -- nice feature to keep your system software up to date when you're not using the system, and improves system startup times.+ Controller -- big improvement over the PS3 controller!  I like the look and feel better, and the addition of the touch-pad is promising.+ Footprint -- the shape and size of this makes it pretty appealing to the eye, and is easy to find a spot for in an entertainment center.+ Games! -- while there are only a few blockbuster titles right now, they are among the best experiences one can have on any machine.  Killzone SF was fun, Infamous SS is stellar!  The Order 1886 is in the works and so is a new Uncharted!!!  The games on the PS4 are the most important purchasing factor in my mind at least, and you cannot experience them on any other machine.CONS:- Build Quality -- though well built I would say, it doesn't feel as solid as the PS3 does to me, I'm comparing to a 60gb launch model PS3...- Needs some software updates -- there are certain features which need to be added at this point, for example it doesn't  play CD's as of yet, won't read external HDD's, can't store MP3's, etc...  I'm sure these are all coming, but if your looking at this for purchase as of this writing it's a consideration if that stuff is important to you.OVERALLSony did a terrific job this go around, just as they did last gen.  Probably the biggest difference this time is they made this affordable for most people early on, this is going to benefit gamers as more games will be coming out for it sooner.Overall this is a 5 star system, most of the cons are due to the early software release, and will be remedied in time.

I loved the first Force Unleashed so you know my standards aren't that high to begin with.  All they had to do was make a follow up simple action game in the Star Wars universe and they blew it.  The game seems to drag on forever because even though it's about 12 levels, it's actually 4 huge levels sliced up into smaller pieces so after the 3rd level in the same environment I was just sick of it, then suddenly the game was over and I thought \"Really?  I thought I was only half way through this insanely boring and repetitive game.  How could it be over?\"  It's so sad how infrequently you get to do something fun like dash through hordes of storm troopers force pushing and throwing them off ledges and stuff like that.  Instead they replaced all the fun from the first one with non-stop mini-boss fights with quick time events over and over and over, maybe the dumbest thing I've ever seen in an action game.  It's a decent story at least, but it's pretty terrible when the best thing about the game is the story scenes between the actual game.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S.

Now, FF fanboys can rejoice at long last because FF XII is finally here in all it's glory, and not only is it the best game in the series since FF VII, it's one of the best RPG's on the PS2.  The storyline appears to be something we've seen time and time again: a ragtag group of freedom fighters become reluctant heroes to defeat their evil oppressors, but out of nowhere the story evolves and pulls you in like you won't expect, something that the last few game's in the series haven't done.  This is all seen with incredible cutscenes and surprisingly good voice acting to go along with some impressive graphics for a PS2 game, and the music score is excellently done as well.  As for the gameplay, there are some surprises for veteran fans of the series.  The random battles that went hand in hand with the title Final Fantasy are gone; replaced with battles that take place in context with the storyline.  Not to mention that the battle system is now more strategic and involving now than ever before, adding a new dimension to the turn based battle system that has been used so much it has become archaic.  If there's any negatives to FF XII, it's that the battle system takes some time to get used to, and there are times when exploring and re-tracing your footsteps becomes a chore, but other than that this installment in the long running series has quite a lot going for it: engaging story, lengthy quest, great graphics and sound, and well written and conceived characters.  All in all, though the PS2 may be going the way of the dodo, Final Fantasy XII is another game that is going to help it go out in style.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2006"}
{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Carolyn \"Dedicated Yaoi Fan.\"","summary":"PSP rox.","reviewText":"This is the greatest hand-held gaming system out there today - though I used to love the Nintendo versions, ignore them now, everytime you buy one, Nintendo brings out another one.

{"product_name":"B002TDIEDG","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Ghost Trick has a great story, but lacks in gameplay","reviewText":"The Good: Gorgeous graphics and animation, great use of the touch screen, deep story with memorable charactersThe Bad: Story is convoluted at the end, poor difficulty balancing, too much trial and error, more talking than gameplay, gets redundant after a whileThe last great game I remember playing where you were a ghost was Geist for GameCube. Ghost Trick may not be an action packed shooter, but it does have an interesting story with whacky characters and fun mechanics. You are trying to solve a murder mystery of yourself. You wake up as a ghost out of your body and need to find out who killed you and why. As you play through the 17 chapters the story unfolds more and more and starts out as a gripping story until the very end where it just falls apart and becomes hard to follow. Despite that the game has great art and animation and is worth a play through.The main mechanic is playing as a ghost and being able to rewind time, change people&#8217;s fates, and manipulate objects. When someone dies you can talk to their core where you find out a little about them, you can then rewind time to 4 minutes before their death. Once you see the clip it plays out again but you must manipulate objects to prevent their death. This is a really neat mechanic and very original. These all are puzzles and they get harder as the game moves on. One person may end up dying from a trap that was set up and you have to stop one part of that trap before the person is killed. When you are in the ghost world time stops and you can see all the objects you can hop too. However, you have a limited reach so you need to manipulate other objects to get closer such as knocking stuff down, opening things, and various situations like that. The puzzles end up becoming multiple screens and you some times have to travel to whole new areas mid puzzle. You can travel around via telephone lines, but you must be at the phone when someone calls at a critical time to trace the call. This is all really neat and fun, but after a while it kind of gets stale.I hate to say this because this is a one of a kind game on DS. It uses the touch screen in a unique way, but all you do are these ghost puzzles. There&#8217;s more talking than gameplay which will bore impatient people. Some cut scenes can go on for nearly 20 minutes. When you do start playing you are constantly interrupted with overly drawn out dialogue to tell you what to do. A lot of the times the puzzles can be nearly impossible to figure out or require constant trial and error. The occasional puzzle is thrown out there that is different &#8212; some are timed and some aren&#8217;t. Towards the end you get to play as two different ghosts, the other has the ability to swap objects. This adds another layer of depth and difficulty to puzzles, but most can be figured out after a few tries.I actually got really attached to the characters which is surprising. For the long length of the game (nearly 20 hours) the characters were well developed, but the big flaw was revealing everything at the final 3 chapters then adding another complete twist at the very end to over complicate the story. It all flows perfectly fine until the end where it just falls apart. It gets so confusing with all the characters and details you have to remember, they should have spread it out more. Despite this major flaw this remains one of the most story rich games on DS. There are many puzzles in the game and it is well worth a purchase, but the impatient may not like it.Overall, Ghost Trick is a unique game with original game mechanics that are repeated way too often. The story and characters are great and memorable, but the story falls apart towards the end and gets convoluted. There also is zero replay value because there&#8217;s no collecting and no extra endings. Once you beat the game you are done for good. I also didn&#8217;t like the poor balancing of puzzle difficulty and the high level of trial and error. If you can look past all this you are in for one of the best games the DS has to offer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"M.

As you all remember at the end of Halo CE, you have the epic warthog timer untill you blow. Then you abored a ship and your home free right? Wrong! In Halo 2 you will experience an adventurous tale which takes place right after Halo CE. In the campagin you will be playing as two different roles. The Arbiter \"An elite\" And the legendary master cheif. You will switch back and fourth between the two and you will understand what is going on in the hands of the cov. And play as master chief in the mean time. Although there is much more gameplay of master chief. Anyway, when you are the Elite, you will only be working against the brutes and some grunts though. The reason you play as this elite is because he started a rivalry between the covenant by religious reasons. A great story in fact. You will travel across wonderous lands and be intrigued by how great the graphics and music is. Like in my favorite mission, you are trying to stop the prophet of truth and you stumble upon these ruins with his telegram inside and it sounds like he is singing a song in some language but cortana soon translates it so you can understand what he is saying and what is going on. This has probably my favorite campagin between all of the halo games in the trilogy even though the end was not to great. But, you will be playing it over again right after you beat it, kinda like watching your favorite movie again. The campagin has more missions than Halo CE, however each one is drasticly shorter. But they do tell quite the story. I have enjoyed Halo 2's campaign more than any other Halo game to this day, and i continue to play it now. There is also a new feature that got everyone hyped up about it. Xbox Live. Which allows you to play online with anyone on many game modes and maps. You may also system link or just split screen multiplayer.

Raillard","summary":"Ambitious but ultimately weak WWII shooter","reviewText":"It's funny how game magazines and critics are besides themselves with joy when reviewing this game, because I was so incredibly disappointed with the execution that I sold it back within a couple of weeks.  The idea is simple: take the intensely realistic, scripted action of \"Call of Duty\", throw in some squad based action (\"Full Spectrum Soldier\"; \"Republic Commando\"), add some Spielberg-esque attempts at narration and drama, and voila, the most over-hyped and underwhelming WWII action/shooter in history!The GOOD: Nice Graphics (though not up to \"Far Cry\", \"Doom 3\" or \"Half-Life 2\" standards or even close); the game does present some tense, gritty and realistic moments; the voice acting can be pretty good (though it can also be cheesy and bad).The BAD: Lather, rinse repeat.  Here is the game in a nutshell: you are walking around with your squad.  You spot a german machine gun nest.  You order your buddies to lay suppressing fire on them.  You walk around the convenient hedge/building/car to surprise the idiotic enemy and you try to pump them full of lead.  The game is fun for the first few missions because its strategic element is new, but once you realize that it's pretty much all the game has to offer... Well, let's just say I went back to playing HL2.The aiming is another casualty of the \"realism\".  In an attempt to make you feel like you were really in the French countryside hunting Nazis, your weapon will bob and weave (presumably to simulate \"real\" aiming), you have no crosshairs (though you can insert them through the options menu) and your rate of fire is slow.  There seems to be two camps when it comes to this game: those who love its \"realism\" and accuse the haters of simply liking unrealistic shooters, and those who can see through the hype and cheesy gimmicks (and that's what this game's realism is, a gimmick) and see the flaws and tedium of this game.The UGLY: For all its realistic tendencies, this game magically revives your squad mate after every gunfight.  How convenient!  The enemy AI is mentally retarded (gee, a flanking maneuver!  Never would have expected that!) and the main narrator sounds like an idiot.BOTTOM LINE: I'm not against realism, but this is still a game, and there are certain conventions that exist because they make games more enjoyable.  Sometimes games try to do away with those conventions (save anywhere, good mouse-look aiming, etc) and they usually fail, because at the end of the day... we are still playing in front of a monitor with a mouse and keyboard.  The idea isn't bad, but the repetitive nature of the gameplay really, really got to me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2005"}

Well, you'd figure wrong.  Lego Batman features everything that was enjoyable with the aforementioned games, and slaps the Batman license on it to boot.  Playing as the Caped Crusader and his sidekick Robin, you traverse a Lego-fied Gotham City and take on the usual rogues gallery of baddies.

If you've played any of the previous Lego-based games, you should already know what to expect here, as Lego Batman offers up plenty of funny and comical moments supplemented with tons of unlockables and bonus characters to boot.  The game looks good and even offers Danny Elfman's classic Batman theme, rounding out the presentation.  The only downsides to Lego Batman are the same flaws that were apparent in previous Lego games: the difficulty is simple to say the least, and the game isn't that long at all.  Still, with the hordes of unlockables to find, you'll keep playing, although it would have been nice to have some online co-op features by now.  All in all, Lego Batman is a fun and family friendly diversion that anyone can enjoy and easily pick up and play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2008"}

Features an incredible storyline to immerse you in stylized action. Gameplay involves hair-raising missions both on foot and in vehicles with a plethora of weaponry to remedy tight situations. Driv3r's detailed cities boast over 30-square miles of drivable roads!","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"They need to go back to the drawing board","reviewText":"Like Enter the Matrix last year, Driv3r is buggy and clearly unfinished. The mess isn't as extensive as it was with Neo's nightmare -- Tanner's latest adventures as an undercover cop aren't quite that treacherously crash-prone -- but poorly tuned gameplay and controls sink what should have been a rousing ride from one of Grand Theft Auto's primary forefathers. Bugs and technical issues first. We tested three boxed copies of Driv3r on three different consoles, and a clear pattern of glitches emerged. The most common issue: The game often freezes for between three and ten seconds, then usually resumes without harm. Sometimes, however, it locks up permanently, requiring a reboot. Also, collision-detection mishaps are widespread -- everything from Tanner to his vehicle sometimes passes through walls or gets stuck in walls in a way that significantly interferes with gameplay. Frame-rate sluggishness and pop-up issues are also prevalent. Surprisingly, the pop-up doesn't involve the environment -- in fact, your line of sight is impressively long -- but cars and other traffic often teleport into existence a short distance down the road, adding unfairly to the challenge of high-speed driving. As far as the actual gameplay, Driv3r is like a car badly in need of a tune-up. Like the first two games, you play as an undercover cop infiltrating car-theft gangs by posing as a driver. Reflections created three sprawling cities and added new elements like speedboats and shooter-style gameplay on foot, but at its core, the game still revolves around high-speed pursuits. The best part of the action is how the cars handle on the bleeding edge of losing control. As in past Reflections games (Stuntman and other entries in the Driver series), making the smallest mistake can be lethal, particularly because excessively bouncy physics and insanely invulnerable obstacles (like lamp posts!) can send your vehicle cartwheeling into absurd wipeouts. Completing missions becomes a test of your stubbornness and endurance, and most players won't be able to stomach the process of incessantly repeating a mission until they succeed. The new on-foot gameplay also just flat-out sucks, and it figures far too heavily into the action. Aiming your weapon is an aggravating chore, the enemy A.I. is horribly lame, and there's just not a scrap of fun to be had. Visually, Driv3r looks outdated. Unsurprisingly, the Xbox version is substantially prettier, featuring richer lighting and smoother details that outshine the more pixelated PS2 game. The game's star power (voice acting by Michael Madsen, Ving Rhames, and more) and an impressive soundtrack make for a surprisingly good showing on the audio side. All these glitches and design problems don't make Driv3r unplayable, and the problems aren't as deep or as devastating as they were in Enter the Matrix, another much-hyped Atari disappointment. But they do make the game an intensely frustrating trial of patience that's rewarded with only the most fleeting glimmers of fun. If you love the Driver series with an unswerving loyalty, you'll be able to slog through Driv3r and extract your thrills. But if you're looking for something to tide you over until GTA: San Andreas is released later this fall, you'd better execute a 180 spin, floor it, and flee in the opposite direction.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2004"}

{"product_name":"B0050SY0L2","description":"","reviewerName":"Patrick H. Nguyen","summary":"Great wheel but tricky to set up","reviewText":"Let me preface that my last experience was a steering wheel on the PC that you clamped to your desk.  That experience was a decent one but the wheel kept moving around no matter how hard you clamped it to the desk.  Plus, it was difficult to find settings that would work well and thus my experiences with using wheels for driving games died with that wheel.Fast forward to today and now I'm using the Xbox 360 Wireless Speed Wheel.  Like its name says, it's completely wireless and uses accelerometers to detect motion.  It has accelerometers that can detect motions in all directions, meaning there's potential that this wheel can be used for flight simulators in the future.  However, currently, only some driving games support the controller.The only game I have that supports the wheel is Forza Motorsport 4.  The game developers have recently released a patch that improves this wheel's functionality in the game.  The wheel has vibration feedback so when you're accelerating, braking, driving over sand, etc., you'll feel it.It took me awhile to dial in the control such that it felt natural for me to use it.  The default Wireless Speed Wheel settings had me careening all over the play because the deadzone (the amount you turn the wheel and have it not actually turn) was too big for my taste.  If you go to advanced settings, you can change every detail (though Turn10 did not provide details on what each of settings do).Here's the settings I use and I enjoy the wheel at this level.  By lowering the amount of deadzone, it feels more twitchy and instantaneous so now it feels spot-on accurate, feeling every nuanced movement I make.  I haven't had the wheel long so I'm still tweaking them.  If anyone has settings they feel are better for this wheel, please let me know!:steering axis deadzone inside: 0steering axis deadzone outside: 40acceleration axis deadzone inside: 0acceleration axis deadzone outside: 40deceleration axis deadzone inside: 0deceleration axis deadzone outside: 40clutch axis deadzone inside: 0clutch axis deadzone outside: 40handbrake axis deadzone inside: 0handbrake axis deadzone outside: 40vibration scale: 100The default Turn10 settings (which I don't like):steering axis deadzone inside: 1steering axis deadzone outside: 95acceleration axis deadzone inside: 15acceleration axis deadzone outside: 100deceleration axis deadzone inside: 15deceleration axis deadzone outside: 95clutch axis deadzone inside: 15clutch axis deadzone outside: 90handbrake axis deadzone inside: 0handbrake axis deadzone outside: 100vibration scale: 100The negatives have been discussed in other reviews so I'll give my take on them.  There are no bumper buttons (no LB and no RB).  This is a major omission which doesn't affect gameplay in Forza Motorsport 4 (though it makes it harder to go through some menu settings) but it does affect how many games the controller can be used for.  For example, this would be a perfect controller for a game like Ace Combat:  Assault Horizon (an arcade flight game) but that game heavily uses the bumpers so the game developer would have to develop a game that didn't need bumpers in order to use this wheel.The other negative is that there is no headset jack in the wireless wheel.  This means if you want to talk to your friends while playing with the wheel, you either need a wireless headset or you need a Kinect.Otherwise, I've been loving the wheel!  It makes driving a lot more immersive.  You don't have to have a huge rig in your family room, living room, etc.  No need to clamp a wheel to a table or desk.  No wires.  When you're done playing, you just stick the compact wheel into a drawer.  If you hate having big bulky expensive peripherals, this is the controller for you.  And it's at a great price so you can buy multiple wheels and race with friends.  I'm curious if this will work on a PC as I do have a wireless receiver.  Will test soon...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2012"}

I'm just going to start immediately with my main points:Alan Wake is a game which lacks integrity. From a gameplay perspective, everything works on the most basic level. Guns shoot where you aim, combat is satisfying enough at first glance, and the environments are genuinely creepy and immersive. However gameplay never seems to evolve. The only distinguishing element of later battles just seems to be more enemies who can take more hits. Sure there is the occasional invisible guy or the poltergeists, but ultimately the enemies aren't very compelling once you've killed enough of them to bring you past the half-game mark.Much like gameplay, the presentation seems great at a passing glance. The graphics are great, the setting and exposition set up the plot nicely. But Alan Wake never really manages to do anything really interesting once it has your attention. Not that it doesn't try, it throws everything it can at you hoping something sticks. It has the pomp and production values of a movie, but the plot is set up like a television show. There are also manuscript pages laying around everywhere which make it feel sort of like a book. You can also find t.v. sets around the game world which deliver tangentially related plot information. Unfortunately, none of these individual elements are fleshed out enough for any of them to suitably advance the plot in any sort of interesting way. The plot itself gets somewhat complicated at the end, and the game doesn't seem to know handle it properly. Perhaps if the developer stuck to one single method of story-telling and fleshed it out, the story would have had more integrity than it currently exudes. But as it stands, each element is sort of bland and ultimately hurts what could have been an interesting story.I guess Alan Wake makes the perfect rental. It's certainly enjoyable at first when the creepy-ness of the environments and the tension of the fights still feels fresh. But everything is sure to get somewhat stale by the midpoint and the plot becomes incomprehensible with each aspect of Alan Wake's storytelling trying to wow you at the same time to no avail. Ultimately, Alan Wake is a disappointment, but it certainly makes me hopeful for future games who want to tell less mindless and more mature stories.3 out of 5","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2011"}

Suhr \"naraku junior\"","summary":"a fantastic seris","reviewText":"I have grown more fascinated with this since the movies came out and they made himn stronger. His webs I belive might have been that srong in the original comic but his pyshical body stregth of his actually body was that of normal man not that of super man. Here are some straties for this and other spider man game.I will first start with the arcade game. Played with black cat for the first fight with venom combine  kicks punches with throws to reduce resitanmce to damage venom when he is normal size before enlarge to 3/10 the size orf mr staypuuff. He has a weak resitance of only aabout 12% meaning twelve blows will  him if you used throw punches and kickes. Only used kicks and pucnhes and the fight will take twice to four times as long and his restiance will be 15 t 80% and only take away half as much percentage wise per hit.  Try to limited the elimn8ulator use that actually increase the number of times you have to continue depending on how often you use it I think this guy or did it starting around the second before the lizard battle. You do fight scorpion before venom but he is just an annoyed diversion after a few hit the main fight with venom will commence. You will have your nex fight with the enlarged venom. If you use a special movie and hit hit with  this giant wipe like graphic hook like weapon he has 25% resistance mean  four hits will defeat him untiul you climb up another couple of stories and the scond battle with this nastier venom will begin.  Venon is slight stronger this time only take 16.6% damge with the use of this item so you have to hit him one more time than the previous fight. For the third fight his resitance is strongest at 11%  take a 11 hits or  only 9.09% damage per hit to bet. After you defeat him this t6ime the stone will come out of him and he will go back done to his original size. Fight venom one more time at normal size if you combine pucnhes kick and throw you can over come his 12% resitacne when these are combined with throws it doubles again hit him with about 4 hits pucnhes and throws causing 8.3% damge per each on he does not dodge and it is the end of the first stage of the game. For the scorpion bose fight alternmate between kick punches and throw attacks to cut his resitance  to damage down from about 15% 80 maybe higher down to a mere 12% resitance. Deliver a combinatyionf a baout 9 punches on Doctor octupus or Doc Ock and he will go down.  For the next boss the sand man score about 17 to 18 punches or kick on him and he goes down you cfan maybe cut his damage ristance down by about half if you alternate attacks for normal punched and kick to throw attacks freuqently enough.  Next you must fight two boss fight back to back the hobo goblin who will go down with about 11 hits if you the rit combinations and the after him the kingpin a villian from the cartoon series that never appaeared in the actual movies.  About combination of eigteen blow with and occasional throw will take this big guy down.  For the next fight you are into they ftying pan you must refight the llizard in a cave literall 75% of the screen on the ground is engulfed in flames. A combinatioon of 16 normal movies and 1 to 2 throw attack will take him down. To cut the blow down try to do more throws  throw the weaker minions at the lizard it might have the same effected as you throw him your self.  Now comes one of the longest fights in tghe game the boss battle against the other goblin the infamous green goblin.  This boss has three health bars you can take him down with only ninteen hits if you use and emulator but  yo take damage ten times more easily and faster in this battle so I don't recommend using and inhumilator on this or other games in this series unless you have invulerability one or something like that. I will send the remain boss data later sometime inbetween 7:00 and 9:00 PM this evening I will ao be doing the ultimate spider man the newest game when the man bad guy is venom on this same  review because the speed run is massive for ultimate spider borke up into at least 6 parts maybe more. This is the second segment of ultimate spider man.  Next you have your first train boss battle with venom against wolverine he has a high defense status of about 35% damage resitance so attack him with your wip arm like attack from a distance to reduce damage if play with oun infinite health or invulerability cheats on. 35 hits with this move which does and wimp 2.8% damage of the max 100% this train boss is capable of enduring  each time it is performed correctly try to do a strong move like a throw to speed this up if you get impatient our you find you are taking to much damage.

Roman","summary":"Well, it's certainly better than the seond and third Pirates of the Caribbean movies.","reviewText":"This is the first Assassin's Creed game I've played. I almost went the entire console generation without playing any of them, and it's not that I was trying to avoid them by any means, but they just never interested me that much. Part of this is because of how many AC games have come out in just a few years. It's almost like every November, you can expect another Assassin's Creed game. I'd seen enough gameplay videos from a few of the previous titles to get an idea of what they'd be like, and when I got offered a chance to play Black Flag, I figured I might as well and see how one of these games plays for myself.Playing as a pirate, doing battles at sea with ships, was exciting the first couple of times, but later on, it became a chore, especially when there wasn't much of a point to doing it. Surprisingly, the main character in Black Flag, Edward, is a pirate for the most part, rather than an assassin. Be that as it may, the guy has some slick moves. Being able to use two swords at once makes for some devastating attacks. There were a couple of times where I thought &#34;ok, that was cool&#34; after taking out someone. The last time I got that feeling? Adam Jensen's insane takedowns and kills with his augmentations in Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Combat, both on land and at sea, is fun and where I got most of my kicks. The main story, however, is something I avoided almost entirely. I beat the game, and was letdown by most of it, and I hope it's not like this with the other AC games if I get around to playing another one. Being forced to do something, or read a 4 page note completely killed the momentum that you get in this game from running on rooftops, jumping from beams and ropes, and all the stuff that makes the game what it is. And don't even get me started on the multiplayer. You have THIS GAME, where a big focus is on ship battles at sea, and all we get is -another- round of cat and mouse, walking around a market trying to kill the right target?And people complain about the Call of Duty games being uninspired.As far as the graphics are  concerned, I was impressed with the water effects. The oceans here look like real oceans, and I can only imagine they look even better on the new systems. Character models and landscapes look fantastic as well. Ditto for the voice acting and soundtrack. It's not the kind of soundtrack that I'll remember a few years from now, but it gets the job done and done well.Assassin's Creed IV is a game that I'm kind of glad I played, just to see what the big fuss was about, but I guess I was telling myself to stay away from the games for a good reason. It's just not my kind of game. Clearly I'm in the minority here, as it has mostly 4 and 5 star reviews, mainly from people who seem to be fans of the franchise. You can blame part of it on my lack of interest in pirates too I guess. Still, if you're not sick of these games by now, you'll probably enjoy another round. If I could, I'd give Black Flag 3.5 stars instead of just 3.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2013"}

As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

Based on that I opted to go to Wallyworld last night and plunk down my hard-earned $30 to see what all the hooplah is about. I just finished the game and I'm far from disappointed!FEAR starts with an unusual premise. You're a no-name super-soldier who's joined a special ops group named First Encounter Assault Recon (the titular F.E.A.R.), and your shtick is to investigate (and by extension whack) out of the ordinary bad guys, namely paranormal and psychic types. You have the special ability to use a \"Slo-Mo\" feature, basically a handy function that slows everything down around you, identical to the bullet-time feature from Max Payne. The government has dispatched you to take out an out of control psychic \"general\", named Fettel, who holds mental control over a battalion of his own customized troops. He's on the loose in the local water treatment plant and is killing everyone he comes across. As you pursue him you'll also be seeing a creepy little girl who seems to have personal plans for you, in addition to popping up at random times and scaring the (censored) out of you.I'm not a hardware expert and couldn't pretend to be, but the game ran fairly well on my Athlon 3.2 Ghz and ATI X800. On medium detail the game is well-detailed and despite a few slowups my system didn't have any major problems handling it. I have cheap, stereo headphones though and this is a game that makes me lust after the thought of having a full fledged EAX surround system for my computer. The ambient sound is unbelievably well done, evoking feelings of paranoia and dread at various points of the game.As I played the game I made a few mental comparisons to some of it's forebears. This game isn't so much Half-Life 2 as it is a mixture of Doom 3 and Far Cry, with a number of ideas pulled from AvP2 for good measure. The latter doesn't surprise me at all since both AvP2 and this game are LithTech creations, and these folks *know* how to create a creepy atmosphere filled with things wanting to kill you. Weapons selection was pretty good, although one can only truly carry 3 different weapons at once (much like Far Cry). I found myself drawn to the shotgun and I never came close to using up all the ammo for it. There's a number of different machine guns and a couple of exotic weapons for those who like em' as well as the ability to purportedly use hand to hand actions, though I couldn't seem to get those to work right.Between FEAR's plot, pacing, action, and horror angle, this game does very well for itself. It's not HL2 and doesn't try to be. Still, even a game this fantastic doesn't have a few issues. The flashlight function is first and foremost in my mind. It has a pathetic battery as you can only use it for about 30 seconds at a time, and the last thing I want to do in a pitch black room is have the thing run out of juice and having to wait helplessly for the battery to charge up. On the other hand, as it is, it provides a little extra horror addup since I half expected to see that creepy little girl whenever I turned the thing on again. The lack of manipulatable items (cans, lights, etc), as in HL2, would be a welcome change. I can't count the number of times I went through a half-lit room and couldn't use the little desk lamps sitting on furniture to help light the place a bit more. And as much time as I spent bumping around in the dark trying to find my way a few loose items falling to the ground would have amped up the scare factor considerably.This is a game that was worth *more* than what I paid for it, and I'm very happy with the purchase. If you enjoy a different kind of shooter from the standard fare you may just want to check this one out. Keep your lights on though!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2006"}

S.","summary":"Good, fun game with some unforunate complications.","reviewText":"Solid game, good and fun gameplay with some unfortunate tedious aspects foreign to its series predecessors.  Remarkably through all the changes still holds the unique Silent Hill quality.  Worth purchasing.  However, I should note that this game is most likely in a \"hate it or love it\" scenario.  If you are a fan of the genre or series, chances are you'll love it.Cons:-  Quest items go into your inventory with the rest of the other items, taking up the very limited space you already have and in some instances forcing the player to return back to the storage box to leave survival supplies in order to carry a quest item for a relatively short duration.-  The Megaman effect:  In this game, the player will have to repeat situations multiple times with different objectives with little change to the environment.-  At times, unclear objectives or lack of explanation on certain key elements/quests.-  Simple, uninventive boss sequence.-  Some enemies seem out of place for the Silent Hill series and enemy encounters are sometimes crafted in an unoriginal fashion.  Example: Increased quantity of enemies rather than increased quality.-  Ambience is not used as effectively as it was in the predecessors of the series.  Sometimes ambient noises seem misplaced or irrelevant, creating a more sort of Resident Evil \"jump out and scare you for the heck of it\" theme park ride feel.Pros:+  The new feature of the room the player returns to to fulfill quest objective, heal, and resupply or store items creates an interesting environment that anyone will become submerged in with a wide variety of interesting features like looking out the room window, checking on the next door neighbor, and peering out the room's peephole while it seems as the nightmare world the player enters and the real world the player begins in slowly grow closer and closer together.+  The new limited inventory creates a more thorough sense of the word survival in survival horror, putting the player's mind to work.+  New, interesting, and original storyline which relates, but does not follow past storylines in the Silent Hill series heeds to some colorful characters and situations any player will become immersed in.  Involves a sort of detective feel of storyline as objectives are achieved once the truth of matters is revealed to the player.+  Graphics are well done in the traditional Silent Hill series fashion.+  Voice acting is well done with some new quirky characters.+  New tactical addition to the fighting system makes the eerie enemies more fun to smash than ever before.+  Quality and conductive game mechanics.  This includes: targeting, movement.Both Pro & Con:~  Tedious enemies the player will encounter will create an interesting sort of gameplay in which the player will have to decide whether to run or fight in dangerous circumstances based on their instincts.  However, these tedious enemies can become quite obnoxious if the player wants to investigate the interesting areas that are common in the Silent Hill series.~  Original items unique to the Silent Hill series were not included.  This includes: flashlight, radio sensor, contrast of dark and light atmospheres.  Although players fell in love with these unique items, the anticipation and curiosity they fulfilled is still held up in Silent Hill 4 by the interesting environments and eerie enemies.~  The player will be responsible for a needy character who follows, fights, and protects with the player.  This character is a strong fighter with poor tactics and additionally may be unresponsive at times due to this character attempting to stay out of danger's way.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2007"}

I've waited for this release, but sadly, I will not be buying it. The DRM in this game is a deal-breaker for the following reasons:1. Securom 7, the DRM scheme, installs itself on your computer and is as hard as a computer virus to uninstall. It requires making registry edits, and is far outside the realm of what most people are comfortable with Securom 7 causes possible security issues, system failures, and some legitimate software to stop working. It can prevent legitimate programs that burn cds to stop functioning correctly. It does not install when you uninstall the game. EA doesn't disclose these facts on the game's packaging, or in the game's EULA.A very similar program was deemed illegal by the Supreme Court. The FTC's previous ruling against Sony can by found here: [..]\"Installations of secret software that create security risks are intrusive and unlawful,\" said FTC Chairman Deborah Platt Majoras. \"Consumers' computers belong to them, and companies must adequately disclose unexpected limitations on the customary use of their products so consumers can make informed decisions regarding whether to purchase and install that content.\"2. The game has limited activations (5) meaning that you can only install the game a total of 5 times. I think I rebuilt my computer 4 times just in life span of the original Crysis (always chasing more frames, new graphics card, then two of them in crossfire, new processor {quad core} etc... With this new DRM I would have run out of installs in only 6 months or so! I will not pay $30.00 for a game rental, which is what 5 installs effectively makes this game. Even the version available for download through Steam comes packaged with the install limit and Securom, really calling into question the purpose of both: Steam by its very nature prevents piracy, so why would the Steam version need additional DRM OR an installation limit???3. DRM doesn't stop piracy, it only hurts honest consumers like myself (I own, and have paid for, literally hundreds of games). Spore is a perfect example of how DRM doesn't stop piracy. It is now the most pirated game in history, despite this same invasive DRM. Pirates don't care about DRM; they crack it and then happily play their DRM free version. It is those like myself who buy the game retail that get stuck with all the crumminess of DRM.4. DRM means you can never re-sell your copy. This potentially violates the doctrine of first sale, which has been upheld by the Supreme Court on more than one occasion. Basically, if you buy this game and don't like it or finish playing it and don't want it any more, you will never be able to sell it to someone else, because there is no way to demonstrate to them that there are installs left on your version. You can read about first sale law here:[..]In conclusion, the game itself is not the issue here. The issue is that a really excellent game comes packaged with an invasive, draconian DRM scheme that cannot be uninstalled, has ring 0 access to your computer, limits your installations to three, and can potentially crash software you have installed, or even your computer itself.This would not be acceptable in the case of a DVD or CD, so why would we as consumers accept it in a game? I honestly feel bad that Crytek got hooked up with EA and their malware DRM, as I love their games. I hope that by not buying this one (unless they change the DRM scheme) I and others will influence EA games, or at least Crytek, to steer clear of DRM that only hurts me and you, their honest, paying customers. If you want to learn more about DRM, here is a useful guide: [..]***UPDATE***YES I HAVE READ THE FAQ PUT OUT BY CYRTEK. Their FAQ fails to answer or even address many of the concerns with DRM:1. How is this DRM expected to prevent piracy since all DRM (even Securom 7x) gets cracked almost immediately? (Take a look at Spore which was cracked in HOURS, not days)2. Why do we, the paying customers then get stuck with DRM, while pirates, who pay nothing, get a superior copy without DRM?3. I have problems with any DRM that installs in the background, is virus hard to uninstall, and has ring 0 access to my system. I am the administrator of my computer NOT Securom 7x, and any program that takes that control away from me is unacceptable. It is also well known to cause conflicts with legitimate software, and even cause some user's computers to crash. The FTC shot down Sony's similar DRM a couple years ago; this seems like the same thing all over again. Securom 7 utterly fails in its stated purpose, to prevent illegal copies of the game. So why is it still being used considering all of it's negatives?4. Why is this DRM necessary on the Steam version? Steam, by its very nature, prevents illegal copies from being made.5. Is the number to get new activations toll free? Also, EA has deplorable customer service (check out the fiasco for those of us with Vista 64-bit who purchased Crysis online and were forced to play at 32-bit, all while EA insisted it was our computers that were the problem, when it was their garbage software installer) and I frankly don't trust them. What assurances are in place that if making a call, someone will be able and willing to help us in a reasonable amount of time?If they get back to me with answers, I will happily modify this review as necessary.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2008"}

Paolucci \"Collector of Entertainment\"","summary":"One of the Greatest Reborn in the Same Shell","reviewText":"Dragon Quest (previously known as Dragon Warrior in the US) has always been one of those games that I had to have. When I was a kid, I got the first through a subscription to a magazine, and I was in love ever since. Though as basic as a game can get, there was something addicting about the monotonous walking, fighting, and leveling up. In two, three, and four (four in particular), they attempted to bring more detail to the story lines, and succeeded just enough not to ruin the normal, DW game play that RPG lovers have come to love. Then, we missed five and six, and had to wait for the ugliest PlayStation game ever released in Dragon Quest VII. It was fun, but it seemed dated from the release; the graphics were only barely better than the old Super Nintendo.Then, Enix, the long-time publisher of Dragon Warrior, merged with Square, and thus Dragon Quest VIII was born. I worried, at first. Was Square going to dilute it with all those Final Fantasy cut-scenes, or were they going to take away the simple battle system that's in every DW game?The answer: NO. Everything is there that was in every other Dragon Quest game; dungeons, constant fighting and leveling up, struggling to buy all the new items, seeking out all those rare items, getting lost more often than not, a simple, point-a-to-point-b story, and that same battle system. It's all here, but with one major edition: extraordinary graphics. Akira Toriyama (Dragon Ball creator, and long time designer for Dragon Quest) was able to fully show his skill in this game.This game is excellent to play, as well. Not only for its nostalgia, but for the actual game play. It's still addictive, but even more so since the world itself is now rendered in 3D and huge, making it a lot to explore, and exploring it is worth it as it has numerous things for you to find all over the land-map. Finding these things are important, because they've added a new feature called the Alchemy Pot which requires you to use two or three items to make one are item. Also, its fun meeting some of the new characters, and hearing the interesting ways they are voiced.For anyone old enough to remember the first Dragon Warrior, and for anyone who actually understood it, I recommend this game. I also recommend this for anyone who loves RPGs but hasn't yet experienced one of the genre's roots. Dragon Quest VIII is a great edition to the Dragon Quest library, and an instant classic.ADDED NOTE: I've just recently finished this game, and I must now say that my impressions were vastly ignorant. This game, from start to finish, is pure excitement, never diluted by long, dramatic cut-scenes, with an emphasis on the game play. The ending, without spoiling, was surprisingly interactive and incomplete, though I have had a chance to complete it. It also isn't nearly as serious as those other RPG endings. It allows you to laugh at the characters despite enduring the nearly seventy hours of game play and storytelling involving the end of a world. And the replay-ability is decent, with an entire extra quest and area to explore after saving your game following the credits. Now, I'd recommend this game because it is clearly the top choice in its genre (RPG). It's a great prologue to the up-coming Final Fantasy XII or Kingdom Hearts 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2005"}

This may be the year of the new high-powered game consoles, but Sony developers certainly haven't forgotten their old reliable platform, this new Shadow Hearts sequel is exceptional, and it looks like there's more to come.Xseed games has decided to start a new story on the Shadow Hearts model, set a few years after the great release of malice in Shadow Hearts 2.  The main character is Johnny Garland an orphaned 16-year-old who has set up a detective agency in New York City.  His big cases are still finding lost cats, but weird Professor Gilbert from Arkham University asks Johnny to help find a missing criminal and, in short order, Johnny finds himself plunged into a fight with evil monsters.  The beautiful shapeshifter Shania comes to his rescue and soon he has assembled a team of unusual characters, including a martial arts cat and a musician with a loaded guitar.As in earlier games, character relationships are an important part of the quality of the game.  Johnny's attraction to Shania is kept low key, and is balanced against that of the mysterious Lady and the psychotic Killer.  In Shadow Hearts, heroes don't beat their chests.  Instead they struggle with internal conflicts every bit as important as their battles in the game world.Play is still turn based using the Judgment Ring and various player strike combinations.  I have mixed feeling about this scheme.  It works well, but it's complexities introduce a level of thumb dancing that is sometimes a bit beyond my limited reflexes.  You have the opportunity to mix magic, medicine and muscle in complex and devastating attacks.  My real criticism is that there aren't enough monster (or human) types, so the longer missions can get on your nerves.  Dungeons characteristically only have three to four different monsters plus the boss.  A dozen more varieties would have made the end game a bit more interesting.From the New World has more sidequests than most games have game.  Everything from quizzes to the attack of the sushi warriors.  There are lots of ways to get neat accessories and level up.  To the point that you can over level up and sail through the ending a little two quickly for my tastes.  In fact, the endings (there are two) are the weakest part of the story.  Suddenly things are over and it's time to save a cleared game and start all over again.  But you've had 80 hours of fun on the way, and that's nothing to complain about.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2006"}

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists.

After having taken the plunge I'm very happy to say that my experience with Borderlands has been surprisingly good.  The game is simply fun.  I didn't realize just how addictive it would be.  I do not regret my purchase.The game is a combination role playing game and first person shooter.  You can level up certain skills and acquire new and varied weapons, all with different functions and levels of effectiveness.  You earn skill points that can be used to improve your abilities, such as increased health or increased weapon damage.  Aiming and firing feels really good.  The controls are very responsive.  You can drive some vehicles as well.  Some of the menu navigation needs a little improvement as some of the functions can only be accessed via arrow keys or page up and page down keys.  Just let me click on it, ok?Graphics look very nice.  The cell shaded style is cool, but I hope developers don't all jump on that band wagon.  Games like Prince of Persia and this one look really good, but let's not over do this style.The quests are all fun and interesting.  Some of them can get very challenging, but in the end they leave you feeling proud you made it through.  As others have noted, I hate all the skag attacks.  They respawn constantly and can get frustrating.  Regardless, Borderlands is worth your time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2009"}

After about 5+ hours of play, I'm only about 4% complete! As others have mentioned, the sheer expansive world that is available for exploration and destruction is simply mind-boggling! The story is nothing extraordinary, but you wouldn't buy this game for the story. From what I can tell, the gameplay DOES provide some level of variety with distinct locales, vehicles, and mission types. Although there are only 7 primary \"story\" missions, there are several \"faction\" missions and a seemingly endless number of side missions that SHOULD keep you busy for a long time.One potential issue I see is the variety of mission types becoming repetitive after the first 20-30+ hours. Only time will tell how this game holds up after this amount of play-time. Nonetheless, I HIGHLY recommend this game for any fan of sandbox games who enjoys the ability to choose WHAT you want to do, WHEN you want to do it, and HOW you want to accomplish your goals!!!EDIT: 4/18/10I have now completed 22 hours of gameplay which appears to be around 22% completion. The mission variety has NOT been an issue as I had feared previously. The faction missions include several types of tasks including escort, sabotage, kidnap/hijack, retrieval, disarming, etc. I have been impressed at the amount of depth in the game.

C. Bryant","summary":"Burger King! (FIGHT) Dodge! (NIGHT) Under Armour! (ROUND THREE) ESPiN!","reviewText":"I've browsed the previous reviews, and agree with most that's been said.  This *is* the best of the series.  The graphics are ridiculously good.  The control is terrific.  For once, you really have a feel for how the fight is going, rather than relying upon health and stamina bars that just (in this reviewer's opinion) take away from the realism -- although they are an option.  On the hardest difficulty, the game is absolutely a challenge, at least once your career really gets underway.  You will be knocked down, you may even lose some fights, this wasn't necessarily the case in previous versions.  Creating faces on character generation is much smoother and more intuitive now.  The sound is fantastic.  The ring girl's breasts actually jiggle when they strut around the ring between rounds.Everything is great, really, it's a terrific addition to your XB360 library.  Online is fun, there are ranked and non- matches, it's fast and easy to get a fight, another outstanding aspect to the game that will dramatically increase its longevity.Great!  So we got all that aside, I can talk about the commercials.I've never seen a more over-the-top case of commercialism in the game.  Is this a complaint?  Yes and no.  I mean, watch basically any boxing match, there are going to be ads on the ring canvas, on the ropes, in the arena, even on the shorts of some of the boxers.  So there's just some realism here.  Does it go overboard though?  Yes, I'm absolutely prepared to say it does.  Before some fights, you'll be 'treated' to a 360 degree view of a new Dodge truck while the announcer tells you about it.  That doesn't seem too bad, right?  Okay, later, Burger King's \"The King\" will escort another fighter into the ring and dance around before the fight.  No, that doesn't get your goat either?  How about after that fight, when \"The King\" actually becomes one of your available trainers?  That's right, you too can be trained by, and have in your corner, a creepy guy with a giant plastic grinning mask.Look, I'm not one of those types that goes off the deep-end about stuff like this -- but EA, are you listening?  If you're going to throw it in our faces like this, while lining your already deep pockets with the ad revenue that you get from these placements, how about giving us a break on the cost of the game?  We're paying for it, the advertisers are paying for it, wouldn't it seem fair to throw the consumers you're force feeding ad content a bone?  Here's the thing, it doesn't have to be a big bone, and it gives us less reason to feel as used and abused as many of us are when the suspension of disbelief within a game/simulation like this is *shattered* by having to train with \"The King\".  In fact, then we can cheer the gross commercialism, because we got something out of it too, a few bucks saved.Terrific game.  Worth buying, not just renting.  5 stars for the game, 1 off for taking advantage of me as a fan and customer.  I should really ding it harder for that, but the game is too fun to let something sort of sleazy take away from it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2006"}

Each stage is set up as an episode of a 1970's style grindhouse film, complete with the over-the-top language, violence and even \"technical difficulties\"!  Action is fast and furious, enemy design is awesome, and the music in particular is quite good....really no complaints to speak of as far as the game itself goes.  It's a bit on the short side, which may be cause for some to wait for a price drop.  For me, the game was easily worth $20, and I would definitely support the developers releasing some DLC for this game.Technically, there are very few hiccups.  The Move controller requires some occasional recalibrating during gameplay, but this is remedied in seconds by holding down the select button, which will quickly re-center your aiming reticle.  The graphics and sound remastering are very well done...everything looks and sounds great.House of the Dead: Overkill is an excellent title that is really entertaining to play, especially with two players.  The grindhouse-esque presentation of the game is right on the money, and is good for lots of laughs as well as exciting gameplay.  The game is a much more enjoyable experience when utilizing a Move controller, and much closer to the classic arcade experience, so it is highly recommended that that control scheme is utilized.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2012"}

There are a lot of force moves (my favorite so far is simply throwing objects at people).However, I don't think the criticism about it being too easy is justified. I think the point of an easier game is to let casual gamers play as well. The game does have different levels, so if Padawan is too easy, you can try Sith Lord difficulty.I do wish there had been a single-player dueling mode that I could play when I don't have anybody to play against.

Overall design is much smaller and more simple. The loading tray is manually operated, similar to Gamecube and Playstion 1. Other updates include built-in network, progessive scan, digital optical audio output, dvd-r play, and built in remote receiver! So no more dvd receiver sticking out and hogging up joystick slot! The pegs on the rotor that hold the disc is made of plastic not metal, kinda cheapy here. The disc tray dont open high enough, have to pull the cover more open.... The DVD player is more responsive compare to the older models. More functions too such as display on/off and sharpness adjust feature.

I dont know maybe there playing another game because from what I see from this game is not at all impressive. While the concept and graphics of the game is good, the control of this game is where it falls way WAY short. Controlling your characters is a task in itself and are too cumbersome, simply walking/running in narrow areas can get frustrating, I won't even going into aiming to kill birds that fly off the screen only to come back and attack you from the entirely other direction. I don't know if this was done intentially to make the game harder than it really is, but it works!! On top of that the characters seem slow to respond to your actions, when your trying to pick something up, you have to press the button and wait to see if it responds, you press the shoot button, and your characters just stand there while getting attacked, when your attcked by something an get pushed to the previous screen, you can still be attacked even though you can't see where it is so you can shoot it. Top this off with barely enough ammo to kill the cheesy zombies that grab you and take 7 shots to kill with the pistol. I'm sure the controls take some getting used to, but this game is just too boring to want to learn the controls. The game it self moves entirely too slow and it littered with too many useless and corny cut screens. Cut screens when you pick up something, cut screens when you walk up or down stairs, cut screens when you climb a ladder, cut screens when you open a door, cut screen when you switch character controls. And if the game wasn't already SLOW enough, text goes across the screen slooowly and there is no way to make it go faster. \"A..R..E.T..H..E.......F..A..I..N..T......S..O..U..N..D..S......O..F.........F..O..O..T..S..T..E..P..S.....T..H..O..S..E.....O..F.....S..U..R..V..I..V..O..R..S.?\" is NOT something I want to sit through EVERY SINGLE time I load a game.I'm so glad I didn't pay full price for this game....If this game had fewer cut screens was more faster paced and most importantly, had controls like Xbox's Splinter cell, then maybe this would be a very good game. But as it stands, my second GameCube game is a waste of my time and money. I guess I was spoiled by my Xbox's splinter cell and even my game cube's Metroid Prime. And to think I thought splinter cell was cumbersome when I first played it. HA! Don't waste your money unless you absolutely LOVE the resident evil series.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2003"}

I'm not going to go into much detail about the game, but I do have a few things to say.  A pros and cons chart seems like the easiest way, so, here it is.Pros:- great graphics for the 3DS- monsters are cool- press turn battle system (hit a weakness and gain a turn, miss or hit a resistance and lose one)- soundtrack is awesome- can revive after losing battles, reducing frustration from having to constantly re-load- fusing demons is as fun and addicting as everCons:- dungeons are all pretty same-y.- battle system is easy to exploit, making battles repetitive and tedious- far too easy to get lost on the world mapOther (good/bad depending on person):- tons of grinding- difficult- very bare-bones story that exists only to send you out to fight more monstersBasically, the game is decent.  The simple story (search for somebody, and do quests for people you meet on the way) is enough to give you a reason to fight monsters, but nothing more.  Battles boil down to finding the enemies weakness and using that attack until you win; if you lose, grind a few more levels and try again.  If you're looking for a grind fest, or a game focused more on a traditional turn-based battle system, you might like this.  If you're looking to collect and fuse demons, or are a fan of Shin Megami Tensei games, you'll love this.  If you're looking for a story-driven game like JRPGs are often known for, avoid this.Personally, I found the pros and cons were decently balanced, but I had some fun with the game and don't regret playing it, so I give it 3 stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2014"}

The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4.

In all honestly, it's better than any other Resident Evil game that I've played although I do prefer the scarier style of the older games and the controls which made the game that much harder.With that said though, this game is still a wonderful gem.Gameplay: RE4 has excellent controls. They are much improved over the other games and the quick button presses you need to use for certain events is the icing on the cake. The point of view is great and the action is almost non-stop. I preferred the slower, clunky controls of old for the scare factor, but otherwise, Capcom did well in improving everything in this category. 4.5/5Graphics: Rather breathtaking actually. Pushed the GameCube to the max in this department. 5/5Story: Leon Kennedy has to keep Ashley, the president's daughter, out of harms way. Nice, but wasn't the strongest point of the game. Not saying it was bad, but it didn't stick out enough for me to remember it all after almost 6 years. 4/5Characters: Many return from other games but there are some new faces also. 4.5/5Sound: The sound was very, *very* good.

Agnew \"rothwyn\"","summary":"Evil never looked so good. . .","reviewText":"The mantra for all fans of Resident Evil who play the fourth installment for the Nintendo GameCube (and now for the Playstation 2) is this: \"Forget all you know, or think you know.\"With the new installment of Capcom's seminal horror franchise, Capcom has shed the trappings that began to drap the series down in the past. Gone are the clumsy box inventory systems, the out-dated, clumsy camera/control system has been axed, and there are no more shuffling, stupid zombies. That's right, the series that introduced gamers to the creepiest, nastiest, most persistent zombies in video game history, has axed its own staple. Now, as Leon S. Kennedy (the rookie Racoon City cop from RE2), you'll be fighting for your life against crazed European villagers, sinister monks, and far scarier. . . things.The story, after quickly dealing with the loose ends from the Umbrella story arc of the series' past, centers on Leon. Now a special agent working for the United States government, Leon is sent to an isolated corner of Europe to find the president's daughter, who was recently kidnapped. After some decidedly strange happenings at a local village. . . well, let's just say that, zombies or no zombies, this is still a Resident Evil game, so expect the unexpected and truly horrifying. Suffice it to say, the game features some of the best boss fights of this generation, and that doesn't mean just shooting random violent villagers.However, even that is extremely engaging and enjoyable, thanks to the game's new mechanics. Thanks to location-specific hit detection, a new over-the-shoulder camera, and incredibly advanced enemy intelligence, combat this time around is much more fun and much more terrifying. Rather than shamble slowly toward you, enemies will now run at you in packs wielding anything from axes to chainsaws to lit dynamite. They'll dodge out of the way if you shoot them and come in through windows and break down doors if you hide in buildings. It makes especially the first couple hours of the game (before you get access to the really good guns) extremely tense.Which isn't to say that feeling goes away. In fact, Resident Evil 4, rather than relying on the jump-out-at-you shock scares, it instead creates a constantly intense and gripping tension, as you are continually hunted by crazed (possibly) humans, and worse. This is made even more heart-pounding when you are tasked with protecting Ashley, the president's daughter. Yes, it sounds like a \"great, another escort mission\" type of situation, but honestly, this time someone got it right. Not only does Ashley actually have a survival instinct (unlike, say, Yorda from ICO), she's also got a couple brain cells. When threatened, she'll try to hide behind Leon, and if she gets in your line of fire if you use the quick-turn (a feature new to the series that should be included in every shooter from now on), she'll duck out of your way to give a clear sight.Which is invaluable, as you'll want very much to kill the enemies in this game. Running past them is not only a bad idea generally, it's also impossible most of the time. Besides, they'll drop coins, items, and treasure that you can use for trade with a few mysterious merchants that are scattered across the landscape. These strange salesman will help you buy new weapons as well as upgrade old ones, an oppurtunity you literally cannot pass up. There are boss fights that are literally impossible if you haven't upgraded at least one of your weapons mutliple times.Which brings me to perhaps one of the greatest parts about the game. During the boss fights especially, as well as during several cutscenes, you'll be given the option to take part in something incredibly cinematic and cool with the well-timed press of a button or two. It's a great way of presenting the game's story while still keeping the player very much involved in the game, and it makes the razor-thin escapes and sweet fighting moves that much cooler when you're actually doing them rather than watching them.Overall, Resident Evil 4 is not only the best game in the series, and not only the best survival/horror game ever made, but it's also one of the best games released this year. It's easily the best-looking title on the Cube, offering eye-popping characters, incredible effects, and monstrous bosses (with no slowdown whatsoever), and is hands-down one of the most engagingly terrifying experiences you'll ever have. Even if (like me) you were never that big a fan of the series, you shouldn't pass this by.So if you like edge-of-your seet thrills, good action, or are just a fan of violence and mayhem, play this game; play it at night; play it with the lights out; and bring an extra set of underwear or three. You'll need them.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2005"}

WTF? So I was a bit skeptic when I found out that Konquest mode in this version here had the same thing.However, Midway listened to the complaints from the previous game (Deception) and even tho they kept it as an unknown character, at least this character was an adult, and easy to get used to. He is the son of a sorcerer and elder god, whom he and his brother where frozen in stone to be awoken when Mortal Kombat needed them to prevent Armageddon. He finds out his brother was somehow resurrected by mistake many years before he was, and it has warped his mind to become evil.

The only thing I found a little disappointing about it was a few of the sub bosses are a lot harder than the actual big bosses of the game. Scorpion's Klan seemed to be the hardest to beat, but that is the second last or 3rd last battle of the game... then I got to the final fight and thought \"is that it?\" I don't get to battle such and such?\" but then I guess, this is a sub-story of Mortal Kombat, kind of like \"Shadows of The Empire\" where you are playing as a character you didn't see in any of the Star Wars films, but none-the-less, this game made a great side-story to the Mortal Kombat realms.Also in the game is Arcade mode. Much like Mortal Kombat 4, only much, much, much better. It contains just about every character from the Mortal Kombat history in this game, so it's kind of like a Trilogy, or Quad-trilogy, even tho some of the characters do not appear anywhere in Konquest Mode, but who cares, they haven't been left out!The Kombatants you can select are all your classic favorites, non favorites and a few that unless you played other side games, you may not be familiar with yet:- Ashra - Barak- Bo Rai Cho- Chameleon- Cyrax- Dairuo- Darrious- Drahmin- Ermac- Frost- Fujin- Goro- Havik- Hatoru- Hsu Hao- Jade- Jarek- Jax- Johnny Cage- Kabal- Kai- Kano- Kenshi- Kintaro- Kira- Kitana- Kobra- Kung Lao- Kurtis Stryker- Li Mei- Lui Kang - Mavado- Meat- Mileena- MoKap- Moloch- Montaro- Night Wolf- Nitara- Noob Saibot- Unaga- Quan Chi- Raiden- Rain- Reiko- Reptile- Sareena- Scorpion- Sektor- Shang T-Sung- Shoa Khan- Sheeva- Shinnok- Shujinko- Sindel- Smoke- Sonya Blade- Subzero- Tanya and a few to unlock- Blaze- Tavern- Meat- DeagonOff the top of my head right now, I can't recall anyone else from the video game series of MK that they have left out. Everyone from MK1 to MK4 seems to be here, including sub games like Mythologies and other titles.The only thing that I'm not all that impressed with is the new fatality system. Pretty much everyone has the same thing, a combination of moves you can do for fatalities, but none seem to be specific to a character. So good by Sub Zero's head rip, bye-bye Scorpions flaming skull toasty fire... had they only included those this game would get a flawless victory.Also included is Motor Kombat. Much like Mario Kart! I kid you not! You can select a few of the Mortal Kombatants and their vehicles, and go racing. It's a very simple racing style with special moves and powerups to collect along the way, but it does not require any skid turns, so it's not as advanced as Mario Kart, but none-the-less, it's not a bad bonus game!Everything else included is unlock-able kontent like videos, stages, alternate costumes and what not. Completing the game and finding the 60 artifacts along the way will unlock it all, or you can purchase them with the koins you collect.Now, the best thing about this game is FINALLY, there is a Kreate a Kombant mode! You can now finally create your own character, and I must say, Midway have outdone themselves with the choices you have to create with. You can make pretty much whomever you like, especially from the Street Fighter games, and you will get a pretty close enough looking character to what they look like. You can also select your moves, special moves, taunts and what not.This is by far been one of the best Mortal Kombats I have ever played. I like Shaolin Monks story mode better, but this one here is by far better in everything else. Sure, you can pick a few plot-holes in the story, but who cares, at the end of the day, when everything is said and done, would I still load this game up to play again? Hell yes! GET OVER HERE GAME, I'm playing again right now!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2013"}

The greatest 3-D weapons-based fighter will provide non-stop action, excitement and surprises as you go one-on-one against your favorite challengers.","reviewerName":"Christian Wheeler \"Husband/Father/Gamer/Proud...","summary":"Xcellent on the XBox","reviewText":"The original Soul Calibur was the best game made for the Dreamcast, and since that platform's demise, fans have waited four years for a follow up. It was well worth the wait. The game is premiering on all three major game systems at once, and although each version is essentially the same, each game has one distinct quality: They feature different lead characters. For the Playstation, it's Heihachi. For the Gamecube, it's Link. For the XBox, it's Spawn. They're joined by many of the classic characters from the original game, plus some great new ones. The biggest question, however, is this: What prevents this from just being another run-of-the-mill fighting game, another Kakuto Chojin or another Mortal Kombat clone? One needn't worry.Although similar in style to other combat games, this one rises above them with extraordinary gameplay, first-rate graphics (esp. on the Cube and XBox) and surprisingly easy controls and fighting techniques. The attacks are pretty straightforward: kick, horizontal weapon, and vertical weapon. But there are some good combination moves available, as well. Like all other combat games, this requires button/control combinations and some well-timed maneuvering. Unfortunately, the XBox's Controller S is not well-suited for these moves; the buttons aren't aligned very well for some of the trickier attacks. (My thumbs still ache from playing Kakuto Chojin on the Controller S; of the 3 systems, only the PS2's basic controller was the most user-friendly. A possible solution: Try the Mad Catz MicroCon controller for the XBox). However, the XBox has other advantages that may offset the sometimes difficult controller. The XBox's excellent graphics engine (by far the best of the three systems) make this game a sumptuous visual treat; the player is surrounded by beautifully detailed scenery and environments. Gameplay on the XBox--thanks to its superior hardware--is smooth and load times are not a problem. There's really just one problem with the game: no story, plot or goals. Basically, you just fight. If you don't mind a straightforward fighting game, then this is your cup of tea. Truthfully, it's not that much different from the first version. But if it ain't broke... For those who never played the original, here's a chance to enjoy one of the best combat games ever devised. For those who loved (and miss) the original, it's just like experiencing this fabulous title all over again.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2003"}

It is an RPG for gamers who don't like RPGs; and RPG that even casual gamers can enjoy.Combat is all real-time, not turn-based, which is a large part of why I was able to ease in to it.  Expect lots of hack and slash gameplay; whether you choose to use magic, swords and melee weapons, or bows and arrows.Fable's main draw might be its ambitious good vs. evil gameplay.  Every event you take part in throughout the game, and most missions you take on, will be open ended enough to allow you to approach them in a good or evil way.  For instance, depending on whether you team with bandits and kill villagers, or team with the villagers to go after the bandits will give you either good or evil points, and your allignmnet (from good to evil) will alter accordingly.  The more evil you become, the more evil your character appears; eyes glow fiery red, your hairline recedes, and horns sprout from your forehead.  Become a good hero, and you will begin to glow.  Either way, villagers and merchants will react to you differently.  For instance, my first time through the game, I chose to become evil, so I spent a large amount of time slaughtering civilians and merchants in the beginning.  By the end of the game, I couldn't approach a merchant to purchase an item wihtout him running away.  This good/evil system is not entirely a gimmick as you may expect.  It is an intriguing aspect to a great game.The graphics are gorgeous.  Up close, charcaters faces look very detailed, light dances off your clothing as you run through the forest...  Very pretty, indeed.  And the voice acting is also impressive during cinematics.  The real-time cinematics look good, but some cinemas are told like a story book, with drawings and narration, and those stand-out as the best story-telling aspects of the game.The game itself is fairly short for an RPG; anywhere from eight to twelve hours I'd say, the first time through, depending on how you choose to play.  The story is not anything special, but the gameplay is terrific, and incredibly addicting.I seriously recommend checking this one out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000BXKA38","reviewerName":"Steven Rinck","summary":"Wow.  The best game in the series, and a great game besides.","reviewText":"Metal Gear Solid 3 is the 5th game in the official Metal Gear canon , and is by far the best of them all.This is a prequel to the series, set in 1964 and sets up a lot of the history behind the game (Big Boss's origin, formation of FOXHOUND, and why Revolver Ocelet got the name Revolver).First off, the game is graphically beautiful.  I didn't think that PS2 graphics could get much better than MGS2, but this game surpasses that by a noticeable amount.  The sound is equally impressive, and the voice acting is, as usual, quite good.The gameplay much more difficult this time through though.  There's no soliton radar.  No more warning when enemies are coming around the corner, from the side, etc .  There are some other tools you can use, but they aren't as good, and use battery power (a limited resource that recharges when not in use).  As you probably already know, camoflague is a big part of this game, but you're not the only one who uses it; your enemies are camoflagued and difficult to spot sometimes too.This took a bit of getting used to, but adds to the feeling of the game; being cautious and stealthful instead of running full tilt until you see an enemy on the radar like in previous games.The story, the best part of the Metal Gear series, is superb here.  MGS2 got a little cheesy at the end, but this story works great.  The pacing, the emotions, and almost all of the characters are done perfectly.  The Cobra unit is a little over the top (though I did like The End), and Volgin borders on cartoonishly villainous, but everyone else turns out a superb performance (especially The Boss).There were a few obnoxious parts in the game that kept the \"fun\" down to 4 stars (like automatic alarms when a scientist realizes you're there even though enemy soldiers have to call it over the radio first), but overall this game hits 5 stars easily.===========THE EXTRASThis game comes loaded with extras that are suprisingly worthwhile.  It comes with the first 2 games in the series (not the Metal Gear Solid titles, but the originals for the MSX).  Both games are worth playing (as long as you can get past the graphics).In addition, it comes with Snake vs Monkey, a fun and humerous side game where you have to hunt monkeys in the jungle.I think my favorite was the secret Demo theater, which is a bunch of \"outtakes\" from the game with hilarious consequences (mostly Snake getting blown up, shot, or run over).All in all, this has been probably the best PS2 game I've ever played, and definitely one of the best video games I've played ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2006"}

I can't believe I preordered this game; big mistake. But AC was (sort of is, in spite of everything) my favorite PS3 series.It was fun, until 18 hours in at memory 4.  Then it started freezing and crashing. Then it crashed during a save and I had to start over. This kind of crap, is why I gave up on the Sims franchise.Being forced to back up saves and replay, just to complete the game is just taking away any fun I am having. I haven't spoiled myself, but it doesn't even sound like this torture is worth the story based on reviews that didn't give away what they were disappointed with.I gave Ubisoft support a chance and they ignored all my questions about the freezing and just focused on yes, the save is corrupt; you'll have to start over, ticket closed. They opted for silence - 3 strikes. Some honest acknowledgement and letting me know they aren't going to fix it, would at least renew a smidgen of goodwill. At least make me not feel like a chump owning ACIII, which at least I know wasn't a one year rush cash grab and has support. This issue was reported months ago by other players, so I doubt it is going to be fixed.I've tried deleting all game data and starting fresh, while playing offline - still eventually starts freezing and Ezio/PS3 become unresponsive. When it happens during an autosave, then you better have a backup, because it is now over and that save will load to freeze.I don't know how to revert my PS3 xmb to before 4.0, to see if that helps. I only have this problem with this game.I've read the other bug reports. One year, was clearly not enough time. Why this game was so much harder for them to keep clean, compared to Brotherhood, I don't know.Right now, I'm just playing to see credits and my patience ended.  I am stupid, since I not only preordered AC III, but have now bought AC Liberations Vita bundle.  This is more like mixed signals that will only encourage their bad behavior (and my disappointment).  That's two chances and a lot of money, I'm sure Ubisoft does not deserve.  Clearly, I'm addicted.I guess there isn't any series I am going to routinely preorder, anymore, thanks to a lack of quality. It isn't like I've never played and still loved a buggy game (Red Dead Redemption).That said, the game itself is unfinished, the Desmond grey room tell, no show monologues are tortuous, too. All the different elements of the game, don't integrate well. Some enemies get stuck. Given the frustration, I'm not adding trophies and complete collection.I see complaints about consequences for not being a stealthy assassin.  Challenge is good and fun in my books and if I want to be impatient and rash, I don't mind the game responding in kind, but I prefer to feel I've earned something, rather than empty instant gratification.  Really, it is too easy still to lose your maximum alert level and even at your max, things are never intense the way they are in say, a GTA game, when you're most wanted. Without the bugs, I think a fun replay would have been no players, maximum mayhem, high costs and few reprieves. If they'd made the game too have your cake and eat it, then that wouldn't be an option. It is more realistic if you're brazen, to be brazenly hunted and to have to pay more at shops. It is kind of cheap that there's basically all or nothing and the all isn't even that crazy in AC:R.The distance is quickly covered and as long as you don't rob the Herald and just run back and forth, you can take down 100% notoriety in less a minute. But if you're that high, you get a close-by official to kill and often stalkers. That's really easy. Notoriety/ Templar Awareness isn't balanced. There are not levels and it increases very quickly and goes away just as easily, so it just feels like non-rewarding busy work.Den defense in and of itself, isn't really that fun. Mostly because it is basically one strategy that works without any subtlety and you need to get the hang of the cannon. But you don't have to take towers, renovate, etc. So early on you have to play it safe, place your master assassins, and earn your right to go on crazy killing sprees with fewer consequences to avoid den defense. Raising master assassins to permanently defend the dens, seems to be a contributing factor to my freeze issues, though.Without the game halting bugs, I would have rated I liked it, even with Desmond torture, lack of cohesion, story issues, other bugs, etc.I'm frustrated, disappointed and angry. I play games to relax and have fun, and this is none of that.  This game isn't worth it free, as it causes freezing that force you to reboot your PS3.  This would have been 4 stars, if they patched this buggy *bleep*.My review was of the PS3 version . . how did it end up on under xbox and some small retailer - weird.  Hopefully it will stay put this time.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J6DC","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"A new story for an old classic...","reviewText":"Lords of Shadow scrapped the existing Castlevania story and chose to remake the entire story.  This can be pretty controversial as the existing story for Castlevania is a classic.Gameplay:  The biggest change right off the bat you will notice is that castlevania no longer is a 2D game.  It enters the 3rd Dimension rather stylishly boasting amazing graphics, puzzles and combat moves.  At first the gameplay might seem a little sluggish and dull.  Constant moments of going from God of War style arena fights to platforming sequences and lack of enemies sometimes for upwards of a few minutes.  The one thing that works however is the game doesn't over do it.  There are many different sequences which changes up the game pacing nicely, and for a 15+hr long game that is a plus.  Combat is very fluid and rewards you for mastering the block/counter system, you can unlock various combos which get enhanced by using Light or Dark magic.  If you die during a chapter you are returned to the last auto-save point, which are very generous in my opinion.  Do not be swayed by the platforming problems people complained about at launch either.  Yes Uncharted / Uncharted 2 spoiled us all with the platforming but Castlevania isn't bad at all. A tad more sensitive yes but the game is ultra forgiving; if you fall you simply lose some health and start right back on the ledge which you fell from.Sound/Story: Amazing sound and effects I think.  The sound track feels like a refresh of the original classic OST's from Castlevania games.  Combat sounds are very fluid and have a nice flow to the audio; like the whizzing of the silver daggers as you toss them.  The storyline is fantastic.  It makes up for any problems the game has easily.  There are plenty of clues you get to hint at the ending yet when the final boss comes  you are shocked.  ** Don't skip the credits either as you get treated to an awesome 4min cut-scene **Graphics/Presentation:  Amazing graphics, in fact some environments were just down right gorgeous.  Because of this however there is a frame-rate issue but it is minor on the PS3 and 360.  The detail in the environments is just staggering.  Game presentation was fairly smooth as well.  There were segments early on which could be annoying.  Bad camera angles that hide objectives off the screen, parts where platforming seems impossible at first due to camera angles (the objective is only visible when standing in ONE spot on the map..). However once you realize the minor flaws  you can easily prevent them by spending an extra few seconds of exploration (which rewards you often with extra crystals and items)  Titan battles, though very Shadow of the Colossus are handled nicely.  In fact they were awesome to partake in, especially the final colossus.  Merging grip timings, with platforming and those insane graphics just floored me!Length/Replay: 15+hrs easily and that was on EASY mode.  12 chapters long ..  At first the game might seem a lil sluggish but after chapter 5 it picks up especially when Gabriel gets stronger and begins to solve puzzles himself, instead of relying on capturing beasts.  The game encourages replay also. after you beat an Act for a chapter, like 3-1  you can either continue to 3-2 or return to 3-1 .  In returning you can find crystals you missed, arks, attempt a difficulty trial (like beat the level in 3 mins etc) or simply replay it at a harder difficulty.  Many arks are put in front of you but just out of reach such as double jump needed, or long jump.  Perhaps a way to remove this pesky rock ?Overall Score: 85%I enjoyed this game a lot.  There were some frustrating moments with the bad camera angles (one spot in chapter 11 especially) and parts where the game had my adrenaline boiling for more and suddenly.. CHUPACABRA for like the 8th time and it just drained my enjoyment instantly, having to do a 10min puzzle just to get back into the action (the puzzle was actually really cool to solve though ^_^ )  Yes there are problems with the game, some lack of polishing here, a bad camera angle there... HOWEVER the sum of the parts equal to a great game.  You rarely see a game 15+hrs long give you such a great storyline and have such a great overall gameplay feel that changes it up often.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2010"}

And still what baffles the brain is how EA can take steps forward yet backwards at the same time with each iteration. I really liked last year's edition because it seemed like EA was finally listening and doing what they could to get the series right. Well a year later and I am reducing my enthusiasm because of what they still refuse to address. And thankfully I am borrowing this from a friend with a dead 360 because otherwise, I couldn't see myself buying this year's edition, however I wanted to satisfy my curiosity. Another issue is that this year, I picked up NCAA 11 and while I felt that the NCAA series made some strides, Madden fell backwards, so it made sense to do a comparison.Sidenote: I still feel as if NCAA was the bastard child of \"all things that didn't quite go right so let's toss it in here and fix Madden later\" gameSo let's jump right in:Control - One of the bigger changes to the series is the dual stick control and it feels a little more realistic in that there is no turbo and the right thumbstick does the diving, juking and hurdling for you. It takes a moment to get used to, but it feels a little better than the button mashing we have done in years past. One issue I do have a problem with that is supposed to be addressed with a patch (why do console games constantly need patches now???) is controlling and adjusting your D line at the line of scrimmage. If you aren't quick enough, it just won't happen as the computer is fast in hiking the ball.Graphics - Stadiums are rendered nicely as always with IMPROVED lighting...a little more attention has been paid to the helmet reflections, however most of the faces on the players look busted as always. One interesting glitch however is that in some in game cut-scenes, the crowd has their backs to you in the stands. Funnily enough, my wife picked that up. The animation is more varied and realistic, even for penalties; when they say someone is facemasking or holding, when the replay is shown, you can clearly see the penalties...which is a good thing because it kept me from challenging a whole lot of plays that I thought were questionable.Sound - Another area where it seems like EA still seems like it feels that they need to take baby steps with that the 2K series (geez I said this last year) has gotten to a science, and I don't know what happened but I did notice this year that the QB cadences aren't individually keyed to that QB so in essence you won't hear Brady's or Manning's voice bark their calls, it's just some generic voices. The biggest addition is Gus Johnson's commentary which adds a lot of life that this game needed for years. However, I really wished that they would lock him and Collinsworth in the booth for a weekend and let them record a session so we can get the same quality commentary that (yes I know) 2K has done for years. There are even times both will call out a player or an action that is not going on the field and it's completely wrong or there are times there are small hitches in Johnson's voice as the game tries to figure out who did what.Presentation and halftime show - This is one area that still in glaring need of being fixed. How many years have to pass and how many fans have to shout to EA that 2K5 set the bar and if they own the ESPN license, it should be a cinch to hurdle it. I mean, NCAA makes a better usage of the ESPN license in their game yet it's very absent in Madden 11. The  time show is gone and the Extra Point show is nearly non functional. EA and Tiburon really should fire up 2K5 and see how it's done. Even without the NFL license, the 2K series of sports STILL manages to put together a decent presentation in their basketball games which gives you the feeling that you are `watching' the game. In going thru and reading some of the dev notes and posts in the EA forums, I hear that supposedly they didn't have enough time to fix this in the franchise mode (which remains unchanged) and this will be overhauled in the Madden 12 edition. Really? We have to wait another year for you guys to fix this? Which brings us to...Franchise mode - Ok EA, this really needs to be fixed and no more excuses that no one uses it. This mode has been going backwards since Madden 2004 when the Owners' Mode was introduced and it's been regressing ever since. If you are going to overhaul it...just do it but not at the expense of making people `wait another year' or using the excuse that `nobody uses it' because if it wasn't so crippled, more people WOULD. Same with the Superstar mode...and what you guys added the AFL mode...really EA??? COME ON!Last up...the \"NEW\" Feature this year, GAME FLOW!!!!! It's supposed to cut down how long I play a game right? WRONG. My games still take nearly an hour to play and really, I don't care how you dress it up, a pig is still a pig. This is indeed a glorified ASK MADDEN mode and yes, if you intend on using it, I do advise that you play around with it and put in plays that you would use because while it does work, there are some times where you would be completely baffled by the plays that are called. And the coordinator's voice that comes with it...turn it off...sheesh! It does take SOME of the guesswork in playcalling but there are still times in crucial situations I want to call my own play because that what I feel comfortable doing.Other observations:AI - I have seen some weirdness in watching the AI run right PAST a ball carrier and make no attempt at tackling him. I have also seen a glitch that carries over from NCAA series in which occasionally CBs will just stop running a route and stand there as balls are thrown towards WRs and make no play on the pass...huh? Also maybe it's me but the balance for defense feels a little more `off' this year as in some games, it's almost impossible to stop the CPU from running without having to adjust the sliders. This year's version is definitely more run oriented. Worst offense is watching all too often WR magically `slide' 3 to 5 yards from a safety or CB and catch a pass and the end result? A touchdown. There is not that much of a speed burst in the world.Why, during cutscenes, do all of the players look so...angry? And I'm a Ravens fan why does John Harbaugh look so OLD?Why is Fight for the Fumble still here? Thankfully you can still turn that offOk, how is it some players get hurt and it's still not announced until like a play or 2 later? This also occurs in NCAA...why wasn't this cleaned up?In game ticker: Nothing makes you play a little harder than seeing how well other teams are doing throughout the course of your game...it's still not here EA...fix this!!! This was something that was done WAAAAAAAY back in older Maddens like Madden 93 even up to more recent last gen versions!!  Again this is due to a lack of not using the ESPN licence.When all is said and done, it's really sad when you still can compare a new football game with a game that is 6 years old and last gen and still feel that the older game still gives a bigger bang for the buck.This year's version doesn't feel like another 60 buck roster update but with some of the glaring omissions, it's hard to say that it isn't. It's even harder to justify this year's purchase, so I think I can go for a year with no Madden and if others do the same, maybe EA will listen and fix Madden or at least let the NFL license expire so that someone else can put out a proper NFL game.On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give this year's iteration a 6.Addenum: Allowing players to buy cheats? EA...bad move...(Have you noticed how I added some things to my review that I said last year? This is what EA does and needs to stop doing to fans of this once great game!)","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2010"}

{"product_name":"B002BS47YE","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Weir","summary":"Really bad enemy AI, otherwise near perfect gaming experience","reviewText":"First let's get something out of the way. Yes, Crytek has \"sold out\" to the console market, making a Crysis title with engine optimization more friendly for the aging hardware of the PS3 and 360. And yes, the PC game has all but no way of tailoring any of the graphical settings to your needs.  This is either good or bad, depending on who you are. If you're the hardcore PC gamer who spends $1000 a year getting the latest CPU/GPU combo to ensure playing every hot Triple-A title on max settings at ungodly high resolutions, you'll probably get butthurt. If you're a more casual PC gamer who only spends a few hundred bucks every other year or so, and you've been caught with your pants down and an 8800 GTS and core 2 duo processor, you'll be pleased to know that Crysis 2 will look great (it looks great no matter what) at 1280 x 7XX on High settings (the lowest of three graphical settings - high, very high and extreme).At first I was a little put off when I loaded up the game and went into the graphics options menu, before even starting the game, as I'm sure most other PC gamers do, and saw that I could only change resolution, toggle vsync on or off, and set my graphics setting between 3 different settings. Then I shrugged it off and started playing the game. I'm not a graphics whore.20 minutes later I had completely forgotten about all of it. I didn't care.You see...it's a breath of fresh air to \"set it and forget it\". No more going back and tweaking AA, or AF, or geometry detail, trilinear filtering, blah blah blah. No more trying to figure out that sweet spot of great graphics and a playable frame rate. I'm not saying I want all PC games to dumb down the graphics settings, I'm just saying it was nice to make two decisions and dive right into the game.And Crysis 2 looks phenomenal folks. No other game does a crumbling right before your very eyes New York City before with such immersion. Play this thing with a good set of headphones and you'll forget about the real world around you, drawn into a near future version of NYC that is under attack by a violent alien race who has no qualms about destroying skyscrapers and sinking entire city blocks into the earth(Or ripping out central park and lifting it way up into the sky)...all in real time as you play, not cheesily done through cut scenes. Resident gamers of the big apple will probably feel unsettled at some of the events in this game, which make the destruction of 9/11 look like a walk in the park.There are some major enemy AI issues that break the immersion. Let's just say sometimes the behavior and/or pathing of random aliens or humans will break entirely and you'll see enemies stuck in a walking animation facing a wall, or other such oddities. However, I frequently had fun with my suits cloaking ability, messing with enemies and enjoying the AI in action correctly. The aliens in particular have some amusing reactions to your appearing and disappearing before their eyes antics, and will do some funny things like charging blindly into a spot where they think you might be, unleashing a flurry of spastic melee attacks, or frantically firing their guns into the corner you just were moments ago, or in random nooks and crannies. Other aliens play it more cool, thoroughly patrolling around the area you were last seen, once in awhile emitting some sort of shock from their armor that reveals cloaked technology so watch out! Overall I think the AI is pretty advanced for a shooter, but there were some bugs that didn't get resolved as a result of its intricacy.Another common gripe is the lack of open world or \"sandbox\" which gamers grew accustomed to in Crysis and Far Cry. Let me just say that Crysis wasn't that open world. It did a good job of creating the illusion that it was, but really it was linear with options. You knew where your objective was, but would you take the beach approach or make your way through the woods 50 yards away? Crysis 2 is the same way, maybe not to the extent of Crysis, but there are different ways to approach many of the fights, and the game tells you when those points are very specifically. There are also more traditional confined corridor crawling sequences. Crysis 2 does a good job of blending both. I generally don't feel that either Crysis or Crysis 2 are open world by any stretch of the imagination. Go back and play Far Cry for a truly open world experience. Levels were literally square miles sized and, for the most part, if you could see it, you could run, hang-glide or boat to it.Crysis 2 is lengthy for a first person shooter and shooter fans who just walked away from Homefront, jaded by its pathetically short five hour campaign, will find 10+ hours here, depending on your play style. Nano suit upgrades and weapon attachments you find throughout the campaign mode stay with you after you've completed the campaign mode into new playthroughs, giving you more survivability on harder difficulties and adding some replayability. There are also hidden collectibles scattered around, par for the course of modern shooters.I did not play multiplayer, nor do I really care to so I've got nothing to say on that.Finally, people need to chill out and stop shaming Crytek for going multi platform...they are a business and need to make a profit. Let's face it: developing huge budget games like Crysis 2 for just one struggling, prone to piracy platform (hint: PC) is not a profitable business model anymore. Get over it, and if you don't like it, don't buy their product. The choice is yours.Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to get started on my second playthrough.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2011"}

The game is no longer a slow and heavy feeling as the past entries and the story is actually pretty interesting, which is more then I can say for Call of Duty or Battlefield 4. With all this said, the game is not very long or involving and while they did a solid job removing all the unnecessary cursing and stupid jar head characters, the game is still lacking overall; the AI is either brutal hard or getting stuck in walls and waiting for you to shoot them, the single player can sometimes feel barren or boring and your next objective is not always clear.

Action first person shooters. I really like excellent first person immersion.This is the first game that does a really good job of combining first class first person immersion with the really free and wide ranging aspects of a top quality RPG.Warren Spector tried with Deus X and later Thief, but they give only the barest taste of what was acheived in Fallout 3.My biggest complaint is the ending and the way it is handled. Fallout 3 has one main and several side quests that let you wander all over it's impressive \"Waste land\". But when you complete the main quest it's over and requires backing up several \"save\" steps to step aside and go do additional side quests. And if you get wrapped up in this game as much as I did, you will want to go back till youve uncovered and done everything you can. At the end I was most distressed by who was going to take care of my dog back in my shack at Megaton.A lesser complaint is the first person shooting. The Vats mode is a lot of fun, but straight out unenhanced high accuracy shooting could be handeled better and permit the users finesse and accuracy to count for more.Still, this game will draw you in and you will really feel a part of it.In addition to your dog \"Dog Meat\", the mutant guy you can pick up in Vault 87 is a great companion.By the way re Paradise Falls.

{"product_name":"B0000DJX7I","description":"Praised for brilliant scripts and open-ended gameplay, vilified for unapologetic violence and mature themes,Grand Theft Autohas deservedly become one of the most popular game franchises in history. This double pack contains the full versions of bothGrand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto III: Vice City, enhanced for Xbox. Xbox gamers can rejoice that the grand king of video games--The Sopranoswith a gamepad--is finally available on the big black box.Grand Theft AutoWithGrand Theft Auto IIIRockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games. This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action. InVice Citythis is--to use a clich&#xE9; that is for once apropos--taken to a whole new level.--David StoeszPros:Open-ended gameplay; player can chose to be relatively law-abiding or engage in wanton virtual destructionVaried missionsBrilliant scripts with Hollywood voice actingRocking sound track (also available in our Music store)Xbox-enhanced graphicsCons:As theThe Sopranosof games,GTA 3draws unwanted attention from overzealous legislatorsNo multiplayer","reviewerName":"Wu-Tang_Assassin","summary":"Grand Theft Auto Double Pack","reviewText":"This pack is great.

Why should I play this? It's just another Call of Duty. Before you go making drastic decisions Call of Duty started out as a WWII series way before the Modern Warfare explosion. Call of Duty was known for great cinematic atmosphere, tight gun play, and excellent story telling. United Offensive is the expansion to the award-winning debut game in the series. Offensive is just superb and even hold up on all levels today.The game has three campaigns that run between America, England, and Russia. You play as three different faceless soldiers, but the environment is the main character here. Each campaign has an amazing opening scene as well as some memorable moments like the escape on a Jeep in the American campaign, the gripping plane scene in the England campaign, and the tank scenes in the Russian campaign. There is never a dull moment in Offensive and everything from sound, great voice acting, and realistic sounding war effects bring together a riveting experience that I truly have not found in any other WWII game (even in later CoD games).Instead of trying to pack every scenario into one game (including weapons) we get some long battles that feel challenging, but not terribly hard. Some scenes can last up to 20 minutes (like the plane scene in the British campaign), but it holds you out just enough to make you feel the terror of war and a little helpless. Some battles require waiting a certain amount of time before reinforcements arrive and then a wonderful orchestral soundtrack picks up and makes it that much more intense.The gun play is solid and feels great with favorite weapons like the MP40, M1 Garand, MP44, and the Springfield sniper rifle. We've used the weapons dozens of times but each weapon feels different which includes power, accuracy, and mechanics of the gun. I feel the grenades still have no weight, but there are a variety of them. Each level and scenario feels different and gripping, but you never get attached to any characters because the environment is the main attraction.Mutliplayer would keep you coming back, but due to the age there is no one playing online ever so you have to stick to LAN. War games just aren't like they used to be, and United Offensive shows how to put across the feeling of war as well as realistic feeling weapons. United Offensive stands up graphically as well thanks to tiny details. The only thing dated are the low poly models, low resolution textures up close, and some static lighting. Most of the time you won't notice because you're sucked into the experience too much. If a game from 2004 can suck you in after playing modern war games then that really shows how much a games stands up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

The storyline is good, the war sequences are the most fun yet, the minigames (particularly the fishing minigame) is entertaining, and yet, and yet...NOW LOADING...You will never get more sick of a screen, and truthfully, there is no excuse for it. After every battle, after going into any door, NOW LOADING, every time. Every time.The battles would be nice except that each one is about 10-15 seconds longer than it should be, due to the ridiculous amount of time necessary to enter and exit the battle screen. Couple this with an uncomfortably high encounter rate (in some dungeons, about 1 battle every 10 steps), and you are looking at hours spent waiting for battles to begin and end. Were it not for this (very noticeable) flaw, Suikoden V may have given Suikoden II a run for its money. As it is, it'll have to settle for second.I won't spoil any of the story, but I will say that if you know Suikoden II, there are MANY more ties to that game other than Georg Prime. Moreover, the story is interesting enough to survive the incredibly slow beginning (it took about 6 hours for the game to get off the ground!) and the overly long battles. Nearly 60% of the Stars of Destiny must be discovered on your own (i.e. they won't join merely as part of the progression of the game), and there are numerous sidequests involved in finding them. Unfortunately, the load times really hamper the experience (and frankly, I see no excuse for them, as this is the 3rd offering from Konami on the PS2 - haven't they figured out the hardware yet?).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2006"}

Now, the world is in peril, and only Mario, Bowser, Princess Peach Toadstool, and two new heroes, Mallow, and Geno, can possibly save Star Road.  Mario goes beyond the Mushroom Kingdom to meet new people and explore new places.  My favorite by far is Nimbus Land, a kindom in the clouds.  The play is great, and the moves are really cool, especially Geno's moves.  The only downside is that the item menu is extremely limited.  There are only about 50 slots, instead of the usually never-ending.  Oh well, them's the brakes.

{"product_name":"B0001ADAME","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyableReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Well Done Western","reviewText":"Red Dead Revolver is a classic western story complete with rolling tumbleweeds, a lonesome hero and the quick-draw slaying of bad guys.You play the part of Red, a boy born on the prairie to a gold-seeking father and his Native American wife. Your peaceful life takes a turn for the worse when your father's corrupt partner kills off your parents to take over your mine. Wounded, seeking revenge, you grow into an adult and learn the ways of the gun and knife. The rest of the game is about you tracking down various bad guys and blowing them away.They've put a lot of effort into giving an \"old time feel\" to this game. The cut scenes are deliberately laced with flecks and lines, as if it was an old movie you were watching. The environments are dusty, with red cliffs on the horizon, twisty trees near streams, you feel parched just playing.The sound is reasonably good as well. From the western drawl to the period music, you feel right at home with all those spaghetti westerns you've enjoyed.This game is definitely a violent one. Bad guys laugh while they kill woman, point blank shoot dogs in the face, arms go flying off of the shoulders they once were attached to. Any parents looking to buy this game should be aware it's not a \"sanitized\" version of the Wild West. It shows the lawlessness in full detail.Also, for anyone used to PS3 and XBox 360 graphics, this is clearly a game of the \"previous generation\". The characters are blocky. The textures are sometimes a little repetitive. Even with that being said, though, they did an amazing job with what they had available. Character animation is smooth and the glaring sunshine coming down onto the baked desert floor really does blind you at times.Well recommended for any fan of the western genre, who enjoys tracking down those who have done you wrong.Rating: 9/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2009"}

Of course, I was sceptical for the first 5 minutes of play, but once you learn the controls, you'll be gaming for ages. It's just got a great mixture of Fear and ambition when you're playing the game. There is nothing like standing in a locker and having 6 enemy soldiers run by, It really gets your heart pumping, even after 3 months of play!I have to be hnest, I really didnt think I'd like MSG series, in fact, about a month ago was the first time I had ever heard about it. And I can tell you, What a world of fun I have been missing. Really I played Substance to fimiliarize me with the controls and kind of get a loose idea of the stuff that will be in MGS3:Snake Eater. My main reason for trying out this game was the much awaited Snake Eater. (By the way, there is no question I will buy that)First of all, Hideo Kojima is a GENIUS, this guy is a master at making games, and any game he makes, I'm pretty much going to buy from now on. His storylines are great, the action's good and he knows what gamers want to do in a game.Alright this game has AMAZING graphics, and everyhing looks so real. Like being shot at, you hear the bullets go wirring past your head and hit pipes, that in turn vent out steam, it's just amazing. You can tell Kojima doesn't mind going that extra step to please you.Here's a Break down:Graphics- 15/10 top notch, very real and reactive invironment.Gameplay- 10/10 the controls are very naturaland once you learn them you're set for life.Difficulty-9/10 not the hardest, but at times, it's a headscratcher.Fun- 15/10 A lot of fun to just go on a rampage with a USP M9 and shoot up the Russians.Overall- 49/40 This game is worth every penny.This is a really awesome game, that no one should miss out on,an instant favorite and welcomed addition to any PS2 game library. By far one of the best games ever.I recommend playing it and getting a feel for it before you rush out to buy Snake Eater, besides, it's fun and worth the money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2004"}

There is no health regeneration, forcing you to replay missions 20+ times. Im down for no health regeneration if there is occasional health packets through out the mission. There rarely is. And when you get a bunch  saved up, you lose em all trying to beat something thats damn near impossible.I played this game on moderate, and id say there was about 4 missions that i had to attempt to beat over 20 times, meaning i would be 5 minutes into a mission and die...then have to start wayyyyy far back. Some missions took me 1 hour just to get pass one thing, due to low ammo or no health and glitches.Apparently there is no running on this game? Max Payne too old to run for his life? Well you cant run, there is a run button, but when you use it he does not move any faster.As for the glitches, that is what really gets me going. Many, many, many times you get stuck on wall cover and the only way to get off is to roll out into gunfire, which usually results in death and having to restart the mission. It happens to me on almost every mission.When you have plenty ammo and game isnt glitching its fun. But with me i have way too many glitches going on which made me just want to hurry up and finish the game.Id say save your money til this game is dirt cheap cause its not worth it","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2012"}

With the help of Murfy, Rayman and Globox awake and must now help fight these nightmares and save the Teensies!","reviewerName":"Andrew Gray \"Beezer Review\"","summary":"No longer a Wii U exclusive","reviewText":"Originally designated as a Wii U exclusive title due out in February this year, Ubisoft appears to have had concerns over the low Wii U console sales and decided to delay Rayman Legends until late August and release on Xbox 360, PS3 and PS Vita alongside the Wii U. With the delay, this has allowed Michel Ancel and his team to add a whole bunch of extra content with more levels and a much more polished experience.The story in Rayman Legends in very basic.  Whilst our heroes have slept for a hundred years, the nightmares have invaded The Glade of Dreams and kidnapped 700 Teenies (Little blue creatures, no not Smurfs, the ones from Rayman Origins). Murphy then awakens our heroes with a smack, and Rayman & his friends have a mission to rescue all the Teenies they can find. You can play single player or four play co-op with friends. To complete this adventure Rayman and co. must run, jump, climb, swing and swim to collect thousands of Lums (small yellow creatures) along the way to rescuing the Teenies. Each level has ten Teenies to find, some are in hidden doors that open up new areas with puzzles to solve to reach the Teenie.This is pretty much a direct sequel to Origins but in my opinion it's much more polished and fun with a lot more variety. Each level has a skull rating to determine difficulty from one (easy) to five (insanely hard), and trust me they do get hard towards the end with every level throwing something different at you! Collecting lums from hidden coins, enemies or turnips that you have to pull from the ground, each level also has a reward system for the amount of lums you collect 150 = Bronze Cup, 300 = Silver Cup, 450 = Scratch Card, 600 = Gold Cup the more you collect the more levels or bonuses you unlock like new characters, costumes, art work, bonus levels, scratch cards giving access to more Lums, even bonus levels  from Rayman Origins, which have been updated to match Legends visual style.The difficulty increases at a steady pace, and expect to spend a few hours extra if you wish to find all the hidden rooms, lums and Teenies. One thing that deserves a mention is the musical levels that require you to control Rayman to the musical cues of actual songs like Black Betty or Eye of the Tiger! These are very well designed and show off how the difficulty can increase with some of these levels requiring ninja like reflexes to select Rayman's correct ability at the right millisecond! The boss battles don't really off anything new but they are very clever and really show off the visuals with lots of animation going on in the foreground and background during the battle. The level select screen is a map of paintings and can get a bit confusing to navigate through at times, and allows you to go to different worlds all which are very different from the last some levels are timed, some require stealth which is a nice surprise and adds a lot of variety unlike some other platformers that tend to rehash the same levels over and over.The Visuals are absolutely gorgeous and a lot of work has gone into every animation and level videos online really don't do the game justice until you see it in HD on your own screen; the art style is very reminiscent of an oil painting and that's a good thing. Match that with the amazing sound track and the incredible accurate controls (Unlike DuckTales/Castle of Illusion) which manage to immerse you into some of the best gameplay available in 2013.And with over 120 levels (Including forty updated levels from Rayman Origins) and a crazy soccer mini game make this title a must buy for any platformer enthusiast or anyone who thinks Nintendo or Way Forward are the only 2D platformer developers left. I reviewed the Xbox 360 version but I recommended to anyone with a Wii U to go get this game now, it has be designed specifically for that platform and it shows. This is not something I thought I would be saying about this game but it is the best Non-Nintendo platformer ever made everyone should go buy it! Note. If you purchase the PS Vita version it will be missing 28 levels, these will be added later as free DLC.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2013"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game.

Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis. But the story jumps all over the place, the enemy AI is  less than impressive, and most gamers will be able to finish the game in a mere  10 to 15 hours. The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons). The game includes only eight multiplayer maps, but they  are all perfectly designed, and in order to be successful teams have to work  together.

It uses the  powerfulQuake IIIengine to great effect, and the character models,  explosions, and lighting effects are all perfectly done.

You really don't need to have taken a course in orbital mechanics to understand this game or know what the Lagrange position 3 is in order to storm a space station located at L3.  You don't have to have a broad understanding of the cosmos to enjoy this game, but there is so much depth to be enjoyed by those who do.Mass Effect was a bit nostalgic for me.  It reminded me that long long ago when I was a kid I wanted to be an astronaut and explore distant planets.  This game lets you do that.This is a great way for shooter fans to be introduced to role playing games.  I've always been turned off by RPG's because of turn based fighting.  It's so boring and unrealistic.  \"Ok I'll hit you once and stand back and wait for you to strike me.\"  When this game was first announced everyone hyped Knights of the Old Republic, also made by Bioware.  Since Mass Effect looked so awesome I had to check out KotOR.  It was an excellent game with an excellent plot, however at the very beginning I was so disappointed when I turned the first corner and the game paused for me to queue up my attacks.  Mass Effect solves that problem.  Third person over the shoulder shooting is what the Next Gen is all about.Don't be fooled though.  At its core this is still more of an RPG than a shooter, which means lots of dialogue.  Unlike older RPG's where you have to read through lines and lines of dialogue, the dialogue in Mass Effect plays out like a movie.  My only complaint is that you can't pause the game during a conversation.  If another character is talking and your phone rings all you can do is mute your TV and miss what is being said.Edit:  Actually you can pause your game during a conversation.  Hit the big silver and green button in the middle of your controller and the dialog freezes.  This brings up the dashboard blade.  Just be careful not to hit Y.Mass Effect isn't really an RPG and it's really not a shooter.  It isn't defined by any one genre of video games.  The best way to describe it is an interactive sci-fi movie.If you're still unsure about dropping your hard earned cash on this game after reading all of the positive reviews and seeing all of the awards Mass Effect has won, then check out KotOR.  You can now get it for a fraction of the price it was originally released for, and it's backwards compatible with Xbox 360.  If you do check out KotOR, then do yourself a favor and play the game to completion.  You will NOT be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2008"}

It deserves to the the first in a series. It does so many things right. The graphics are beautiful even compared to modern consoles. The atmosphere is the reason you play the game. The controls feel stiff, unresonsive, and good enough to keep you going. The story explores the psyche of a man trying to hide something, and you are discovering it for the first time. The town itself is an enemy.The combat is not the reason you play this game. Sure, you kill strange, slightly effeminite, enemies, but you are playing this game to understand what the Hell is going on. That is the important part. THis game is good because it makes you care about a character we do not even know. It makes us want to find out, explore, find everything, go everywhere, learn... try... do... be repulsed, confused, aggrivated, amazed, and then doubly confused. This game makes you question reality, question yourself, and discover something about YOU, the player.The puzzles are woven gently into the story, still complex enough to warrent a guide, but not so difficult that a sharp-minded person could not solve the problem, although the fire axe you carry SHOULD be able to cut through that lock, it will not.This is a game a collector needs.

The addition of high-resolution graphics, improved control, and custom skins and soundtracks help make one of the best games of 2002 even better. Nobody who has even remotely followed video games needs an introduction to the GTA series.  Love it or hate it, GTA 3 single-handedly put Rockstar Games on the map, and for good reason - the game is a masterpiece in every sense of the word, and its appeal transcends its violent subject matter to reveal one of the most enriching gameplay experiences ever created.Rather than start from scratch and reinvent the series like the third installment, Vice City instead expands on the strengths that made GTA 3 such a killer app.  All the violent action, antics, and activities from 3 are back in full effect, only this time; it all takes place in the seedy underworld of the 1980's.  There are loads of new gameplay additions as well, such as helicopters, motorcycles, and the ability to build your own criminal syndicate as the game progresses. But you already knew that.  What you want to know is how the game differs from the PS2 version.  Well, it has better - MUCH better - graphics and aiming, custom soundtracks, and the ability to create skins.  Other than that, there is relatively nothing changed from the PS2 source.  The small glitches where you would lose health after stepping off some small ledges such as sidewalks seem to have been somewhat remedied, but there is no extra content, and that is a shame.  I am not suggesting that there should be an expansion pack's worth of extra material in the game, or that it should even tie into the main story.  Still, one or two extra &quot;strings&quot; of exclusive optional missions would have been a nice nod to those who have waited for this, the superior version of a fine, fine game.  Where's the love, Rockstar? Another gripe is the continued lack of mod tools.  GTA 3 proved that there is an extensive community just waiting to put real life buildings, cars, and structures into the game, and possibly recreate whole towns.  To deny us this pleasure is just wrong, and I can damn sure knock the game a few points for it.  Tack on a few bucks to the game for the mod tools, guys.  Anything.  If you're going to take the time to perfect multiplayer, by all means, do it.  But please, give us the ability to mod. Despite those two major complaints, GTA Vice City is still one of, if not the best game money can buy.  It feels right at home on a PC, and is worth playing all over again.  Even if you have played the original, sell your PS2 copy, pick up a used PC one on Ebay or Amazon with the cash from that, and get ready to do the Lance Vance Dance all over again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00064MUIA","reviewerName":"blackaciddevil","summary":"The Nintendo DS........","reviewText":"I'm pretty impressed with the Nintendo DS. I have to admit; I wasn't expecting very much from this new handheld, at first, in the way of true 3-D gaming on a handheld. Yet, after playing games such as Super Mario 64 as well as the demo for Metroid Prime Hunters(called First Hunt), I'm convinced this system is one to be reckoned with.  I like the fact that it gives portable gaming a more grownup look and approach. Indeed, it represents a rather large leap in portable gaming but a much needed one. Judging from the launch releases as well as the ones to come in the new year, Nintendo- definitely- has third-party support gamewise. I look forward to seeing what innovation the developers come up with concerning the DS' dual screens. I can think of a whole list of things that they can do with them, myself. At any rate, it 'll be interesting to see how things go for this system. I have high hopes for it, personally. There's alot to like about it. Look here, later on, for a more in-depth review on this system as times goes by. Let me spend a lil time with my system first and I'll let you know what I think. For now, my response is very favorable.The fact that it's in a clamshell design is a plus to me. Like my SP, it saves the screen from scratches and whatnot.If I had any gripes, whatsoever, about the DS....it'd be the size of the system. It's too big to fit in a pocket like the Gameboy Advance SP. But, that's a gripe I can overlook. I mean, who knows, Nintendo might come out with a smaller design for the DS, just like they did with the SP.All in all, the Nintendo DS reminds me of a handheld Nintendo 64 but smaller and significantly better. If I can see some of my favorite franchises on the system(such as Golden Sun, Breath of Fire, Duel Masters, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and Dr. Mario); I'll be happy that I got one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2004"}

I had a store credit from a major retailer so the game only cost me $5 total. If I had paid any more I would have been very upset .... the game mechanics could be much better and the stealth mode is among the fussiest I've ever seen in ANY video game, you can't do any worse than Sniper: Ghost Warrior. The game designer \"City Interactive\" needs to take some lessons from the makers of COD, Assassins Creed, and game designer Bethesda (to name a few), and learn to control the random AI that appears out of nowhere. I won't even get into the gunfire accuracy of the AI which is SO GOOD its ridiculous.The game has some great graphics but the game fails because the designers failed to deliver on the gameplay end. There's obviously a reason why City Interactive don't have too many decent titles to their name. Just be careful if you are considering this purchase, frustration comes with it. I hope to get through the campaign mode on the normal setting but you can only do so much with a poorly designed game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2013"}

No ground-breaking, as it were, but the subtle differences...well, make all the difference-The extended gameplay.  The game continues to give, in terms of gameplay.-Multiple classes you can play as.  Slight combos of the traditional warrior/mage/ranger-The pawn system.  You can really customize your team of warriors, and they are actually useful in battle.-Variability in combat. E.G. Mage combat is so different from warrior.Negatives:-In my honest opinion, the only thing that annoys me about this game is that at the end of the game, you really are required to use a lantern because of the darkened atmosphere.-I would appreciate some more armor/goodies to find and use, but that is a trivial thing.Some people aren't fans of the lack of a fast-travel system.  I, at first, was annoyed.  Then, I began getting into the game, and I realized that the required time spent walking place to place is part of the magnificence of the storyline-of the fun.  You encounter monsters in their natural habitat.  Sure, you will see the same group of bandits again and again, so what?  Part of the fun is trying different ways to destroy them!  Also, it extends the gameplay in a very pleasurable manner.  I know for Skyrim I spent all my time fast-traveling, and thus didn't discover many of the game's little secrets.  You WILL find things in DD.Overall, this is a very engaging game, with a lot of fun quirks and a great combat system.

Another option isPlayStation 3 320GB System with PlayStation Move Bundlewhich would make sense if the Move was something you wanted with your PS3._______________________________________&lt; BEGIN REVIEW >Briefly, the PS3-250 is the exact original PS3 'Slim' with a twice as large hard disk.I had the opportunity to actually see and use a PS3-250 on the Sunday prior to its launch. As I expected, the only difference between the ps3-250 and the PS3-120 is the larger disk with everything else the same. Many reviews of thePS3-120 are HERE.&lt; END OF REVIEW >Once the decision was made to get a PS3, 2 important questions might be:- Which model to buy? PS3-120 or PS3-250?- To upgrade or not to upgrade to a 500/640GB PS3?Based on personal experience and the experience of other PS3 owners that I know, the options are the following - remember, these are my views:PS3-120, no upgrade---------------------Buy a PS3-120 and do not upgrade if you use it mainly to play movies and you rarely download games from the PSN store. It will take you very far and it should have sufficient room for storing thousands of pictures and a lot of music besides it playing Blu-ray content and CDs.I found that 120GB would not be enough for me. After a couple of years of use, with a few downloaded games, many more demos, lots of pictures and songs and some videos the kids made with the PS3 Eye we've breached the 120GB threshold. I would not worry about that if all I wanted was one of the better Blu-ray players. In addition, anybody comfortable with backing up/restoring the PS3 and upgrading the disk can postpone the upgrade step for later.PS3-250, no upgrade---------------------Buy a PS3-250 and do not upgrade if you do plan to download a few movies and games but not a lot of them AND/or you don't feel comfortable with upgrading your PS3 yourself.Anyone who is not an almost-exclusive movie viewer and doesn't want to mess with screws and OEM disks should buy the PS3-250. It should have enough capacity to last for quite a few years with good disk space management (delete the demos and downloads you no longer need).PS3-120 upgrade to 500/640GB------------------------------Buy a PS3-120 and upgrade it to 500/640GB IF you don't mind swapping the PS3's disk. You get to upgrade your PS3-120 to quadruple capacity for very little expense and probably for less than a PS3-250 would cost you (see next paragraph). This should buy you peace of mind for the rest of your PS3's lifespan.Keep in mind that a 500GB HDD such as the500GB Scorpio Blue Mobile Sata 5400RPM 8MB 2.5INor theWestern Digital 640 GB SATA OEM Notebook Hard Drive WD6400BEVT (Scorpio Blue)if you don't mind the extra expense can be had for about 90 dollars at the time I am writing this. That would make a 500GB upgraded PS3-120 appear a little more expensive than the PS3-250 BUT you are left with a brand-new 120GB HDD (the drive originally in the PS3) when you are done and you can either sell it or use it as an external USB-powered backup drive or maybe to upgrade your laptop's drive. This would effectively set the price of the 500GB upgraded console to match that of the PS3-250.There are many online guides that detail the process. I will post a couple URL's in a comment to this review.PS3-250 upgrade to 500/640GB (not recommended)------------------------------------------------Do NOT buy a PS3-250 if you are planning to upgrade it to 500/640GB unless you really need a spare 250GB external HDD instead of a spare 120GB HDD and think that the price difference is worth the larger spare drive.EVALUATIONThe PS3-250 while not for everyone, deserves its 5 stars. In my view, there is enough value added by doubling the storage capacity to justify the price difference over the PS3-120.______________________________________NOTE: If you want to upgrade you are better off if you upgrade immediately.This way you avoid the backup/restore hassles and therefore greatly simplify the process. I would include the upgrade HDD on the same order with the new PS3 and maybe add a HDD enclosure if planning to use the drive I removed from the PS3 as an external drive.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2009"}

L. Hanson","summary":"Another hit for the Wii!","reviewText":"To anybody who has reservations about Mario Kart Wii being a disappointment, let me ease your worries.Nintendo has hit another home run here. I have yet to play one bad game for the Wii, and this game here just kept me up until 1:30am, which I have to say hasn't happened yet with any Wii title since buying the system back in 2006, which includes Metroid Prime 3 and Super Mario Galaxy.I didn't really care for the last console Kart, Mario Kart Double Dash!! for the GameCube. While a visually pleasing game, I felt it lacked the heart of the original series, and ended up disliking the \"two-person-per-Kart\" concept, sappy levels, the feeling that the Karts were only going 10mph and the immense cheating by the AI were a real disappointment. The list goes on.That being said, I was a bit apprehensive to buy (not rent) the new Mario Kart, until I saw someone playing it the night before it went on the shelves. No question I had to buy it. While Mario Kart Wii is basically the GameCube version with stepped-up graphics, a lot of what made MKDD stink (in my opinion) was removed. It feels more like a true sequel to Mario Kart 64, much like Super Mario Galaxy is considered to be a true sequel to Super Mario 64.What Works: The biggest feature of course here is the Wii Wheel, which your Wii remote fits in. You can go without the wheel, and use the remote and Nunchuck, or a GameCube controller, but the Wheel really adds to the game. The cars and characters are a blast to see and hear. When you pick up a Turbo Mushroom, or transform into a massive Bullet Bill to catch up from behind, or blast through a cannon, you can feel the speed. This was something I felt lacking in Double Dash. Motorcycles are now available, and you can now choose either Manual or Automatic controls with whichever vehicle you choose. Manual allows you to \"jump\" your Kart, which was an omission from Double Dash which I sorely missed. When jumping before hitting a curve, you can drift and release to gain a small burst of speed. While easier, automatic doesn't do this for you. If you hang behind an opponent, you can gain speed by drafting. This is a cool little feature which works well. When in midair, you can do little stunts, I haven't figured that out just yet. The boards are terrific, colorful, and addicting. There are even a bunch of throwback boards to each Cup, with some of the best of the best in the series, including the music which you're sure to remember. By far though, the best feature is the online play. You can play with opponents from all points on Earth, which is an absolute blast. You can even use your Mii character to play, which I think has to be unlocked. Again, I just bought the game, I haven't gotten that far. Too many pluses to go on.What Doesn't Work: One thing I wish they'd get back to is the Coins. After all, it is \"Mario\" Kart, and the coins were a nice touch. The more coins you got, the faster your Kart. The original SNES and Mario Kart Super Circuit for the GBA were the only Kart games (I think) which had coins. I kind of wished they'd return here, but oh well. Another downside is what plagued Double Dash, which was the AI rubber banding. If you're way out in front, you are sure to get nailed by a POW block, red or blue shell, or some other obstacle which will leave you in 4th place. I haven't run into it much so far in the 50 or 100 Cups, but the 150 I heard is insane. Anyway, I'm too happy with the game to complain, and the online gaming, to me, more than makes up for what the AI does.Folks, if you're a Mario Kart fan, and have a Wii (or if you don't have one yet, get one and this game) you won't be disappointed with this game. I had my reservations, but they are a thing of the past.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2008"}

They had such a presence during the NES's glory days and it only intensified later on. In 1992, they continued one of the company's best known franchises by releasing Contra III: The Alien Wars and it looked and played so well, they could have released it in the arcades and people would line up to play. They pulled out all the stops and kept the series' legendrary difficulty level intact to make sure it hit hard on the SNES.Contra III sees the return of the heroes from the previous two entries as they once again stick their necks out to save the world from Red Falcon. Yes, the nemesis of the Contra series returns once again and this time his army of aliens and deformed creatures are bigger and meaner than ever. It's a straight shoot 'em up action game where you will explore 6 stages. You can choose your difficulty level from easy to hard as well as how many lives you want to start out with and configure your controller buttons. Each stage is littered with enemies and the infamous power ups like the Spread gun, the Laser and the Machine Gun. This time around, you can wield two different guns at the time and switch them back and forth on the fly. The more enemies you shoot, the more points you rack and eventually you earn extra lies (you'll need them too.) If the action gets too intense, grab a friend for the 2 player co op mode to double your chances of beating the game.The PROS: This game looked amazing back then and it still holds up to the test of time. Contra III uses every bit of processing power from the SNES to deliver the best graphics the series has seen up to that point. The music rocks and gets you pumped to shoot enemies and destroy everything in sight. The sound effects and controls are spot on. You will not have a problem controlling your character or hearing how each gun sounds different from each other and shooting enemies and blowing up the boss characters sounds like sweet music to your ears. The 2 player co op mode means you can always get another person to play with you, doubling the fun you can have with this game.The CONS: Compared to the previous two entries, this one is a somewhat, shorter game so it might disappoint some gamers. Contra III is manageable on both the easy and normal modes. But in order to see the game's ending sequence, you had to play it on hard mode and it is brutally hard. If you can't take an intense challenge, stay away from the hard mode. Grown men have tried and were left to console themselves and even to this date, I haven't legitimately beaten the game. So you have been warned.Contra fans have already plowed through this game and very few of them have finished it on the hard difficulty level without cheating. Many will tell you that the series hit a very high point when this one came out and they are right. So for those who want to see what this game is about and are not afraid of having their game skills pushed to the limit, track down a copy of this game ASAP. You can also download this title for the Wii from their Virtual Console Service for 800 points (US $8.00) It's a game like no other from a series like no other. I highly recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2011"}

Raillard","summary":"One of the better Star Wars games...","reviewText":"I had a lot of fun with this game, and SW fans will undoubtedly love it.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's too short and there isn't much replay value.  That said, this game taps into one of a SW fan's most ardent desires: to go to Jedi school.  Think of this as a Jedi Harry Potter game, where you get to design lightsabers (and re-design it halfway through the game, with the option to use 2 sabers or a dual saber), learn cool force powers (the Darth Vader choke grip is awesome and really useful for tossing fools off cliffs) and go on a wide array of missions from Hoth to Tattoine and Korriban.While I liked this game, I still feel that the best Star Wars game out there is Knights of the Old Republic (on Xbox and PC).  It offers more depth and story and is consequently more engrossing.  That said, if you are a fast-twitch gamer or a FPS fan, opt for Jedi Academy.  If you liked Jedi Outcast, you'll love this.  I actually didn't care for Outcast that much (horrendous level design) and found that Academy has much, much improved flow and is more intuitive.

With all of the DLC included, completing almost every single mission (missed 6 out of the 216 or so), this game has a lot of stuff to do. It took only 30 hours to do everything, so I was expecting a bit more. There is replay value if you do playthrough 2, but I don't really want to do the same thing twice. Other than that, it is a fun game to play alone, but even more fun when you have a friend join you. I wish there were more missions because a lot of them took under 5 minutes, so it wasn't as long as I thought it would be. I didn't mind the graphics at all and the guns were cool as well. I liked picking up new weapons every couple of minutes and seeing which one I would rather use. Overall, if you like first person shooters and RPGs, I would recommend this because the GOTY gives you a good value for your money.9/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2011"}

Along with an amazing storyline which will reveal many things that just about every Kingdom Hearts fans has long awaited to learn. It also has many new worlds to explore, with great bosses, some of which are very challenging, like Xehanort and Vanitas . In addition, being able to play through the story as the three main characters and their different points of view is another awesome quality about the game. This allows you to see everything that is happening to thie main characters, unlike previous Kingdom Hearts games, where you only play through the story as one character. However, this also means that you have and start from scratch, and you don't keep all of your hard earned abilities. Although, this does give people the chance to try different techniques each time through. Also all of the battles are even better in this Kingdom Hearts game than in previous ones, especially with the new abilities you receive throughout the game. You can mix these abilities together to make new, better ones that also have their own unique abilities, for example: Triple Firaga with Hp boost. There is also a new finish command, which, once you fill the bar completely, you get to use a really powerful move, such as, Blade Charge (which is, I think, the most powerful of all of them). Overall, this long awaited Kingdom Hearts game will be many hours of amazing game play for all Kingdom Hearts fans, whether that have been a fan for many years or even if you are just becoming a fan.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2010"}

Cadieux","summary":"Good platforming, weak combat","reviewText":"The platforming is pretty good, including the old Prince of Persia moves you know and love, as well as some new tricks.  It's made much more interesting by adding elements of timing to the platforming (once the water comes into play), but the downside is that the control can be a little difficult.  You'll sometimes need to use all 4 trigger buttons in a single platforming sequence, and you'll frequently hit the wrong button.  The Final Climb section is particularly frustrating, requiring some pretty fancy timing and button presses.  You'll be very happy when you finally get through it.  The design of the levels is excellent, you can tell it took a lot of thought for the designers to create them.The weakest part of The Forgotten Sands is absolutely the combat.  It poses no challenge at all, except for the boss fights, and even those are pretty straight-forward.  The regular soldiers can be mowed down in huge numbers, often without even landing a hit on you.  Your special powers will decimate them, but even regular sword strikes can do the job, if you upgrade the sword.  The story is also nothing special.The length is a little on the short side, but considering this game is now selling for less than twenty dollars, it's definitely worth it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXCQ6","description":"","reviewerName":"Nikodem Leszek Blach \"Nik\"","summary":"4 and a half star honestly.","reviewText":"*Update* Just beat the game and got a platinum so I cleaned this up a little.Here is a quick list of what I found to be the good and bad of this game/setPros-Value: 80 for a fun game, nice steel case, statue, DLC codes AND Zeus/Isaac Clark for Allstars!Graphics: As good as 3, possibly larger scale. It's incredible to watch. They love cutting things open so you can see their insides. Tons of that in this game.Variety: I love GOW combat but I'm open to changes - this game has some.  The 4 spells of this game aren't just cast, they effect how your weapons function and encourage you to play better. Grabbing is very different and the World Weapons give you more options in the heat of battle.*After finally beating it I have to say that I love the combat and possibly more than 3. Though it's harder (cause of the enemies), it allows for a different level of strategy. Some fights where I was stuck I would finally try out new elements and be shocked at the difference and the power. The game seriously encourages you to break away from Kratos' typical multi-hit combo and try something new.  It also encourages you to be cheap and spam moves sometimes, but that's up to you - it'll only work for so long.Multiplayer: Go figure, it's good. Some moments feel like Power Stone to me. Much less lag than on the Beta.Cons-Difficulty: It can be frustrating. This is probably the hardest in the series, especially in the earlier part of the game where they start throwing harder badguys at you but you don't have many upgrades. Most enemies fight like Satyrs in this one - as in they can attack through your combos. You'll find yourself abusing grab/throw moves while playing on hard.*The game has a part that's so difficult that they're releasing a patch.  When I heard about the patch I had coincidentally just gotten to that part of the game and I was determined to beat it before the patch came out. The night prior I got frustrated and after 15+ tries I gave up and went to sleep, the next morning it only took me 2 tries.  Having a cool head goes a long way in this game. And I wasn't cheap, I didn't spam one or two moves, I was smart and I managed to beat that damn elevator. most unfair part about it are the lightning *bleeps*. And like most of the game, no enemy is a problem by them-self, but mixed into a crowd they can be devastating. Divide and conquer and the day is yours.So, if difficulty scares you, know that a patch is going to be released for the most difficult part. But if it doesn't, there is plenty here to keep you going.Statue Quality:  The base of this one is sort of cheap, Kratos isn't terribly detailed. Some reviews said he doens't fit on his stand right - he fit fine for me. It still looks great, but upon further inspection it isn't as great - compared to - other sony exclusive statues (Drake and Cole specifically)Glitches: I don't remember any other game in the GOW series ever having a glitch that stood out to me! This one though... Ugh. Nothing game breaking by any means, but the audio can be weird at times, text put on the screen to help you (like an explanation of how to do a mini-game) doesn't disappear for like 5 minutes (until more text appears to help you), and then it has some annoying things with this one item you get that you primarily use for puzzle solving... Every time you press L2 to activate the item and then let go the screen flickers for a second around Kratos.  Then more than once I made a new path with that item but the path wasn't usable (it was still highlighted green like it was before I used the item), so I had to undo the path with the item and then re-do it so I could continue.I won't mention story for either category. 3 is my favorite but I felt that one had too much story, which is silly, but because of the tone of the series it should have ended with Kratos standing above the world burning with \"You Win\" written in blood on the screen. Not the sentimental scenes they tried to pull. Ascension's story isn't bad, but I wouldn't write a book about it.Also, the controversial scene... Ugh, I don't get people. I was playing normally, I passed that scene and when the trophy popped up \"Bros before foes\" I thought \"Wait, that was it?!\".  Compared to Every kill in GOW3 it was very tame. I suppose the trophy's old title could offend some people... I don't know. My girlfriend thought it was stupid and I don't personally understand it. How the trophy was described to me was on the scale of Hercules in GOW3, but it was more like a generic badguy, 3 punches and then a throw. I guess it's a half-pretty woman so people are offended. No one was upset with all the things you do to her unattractive sister.That's it. Go buy it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2013"}

Paolucci \"Collector of Entertainment\"","summary":"Same Old, Same Old","reviewText":"Gran Tourismo has been the best since it first released on Playstation. It's so good that I went out and bought it, and I can't stand driving games. I think they are overly repetitive and once you master them, you'll never lose again. But Gran Tourismo brought with it constant replay-ability by letting you choose from a massive list of car makers and their most popular cars. Plus, you win limited edition cars by racing certain events.Gran Tourismo 4 didn't stray too far from this line. The list of cars has tripled since the original, as did the number of race courses. Events are categorized by ease or content, and generally you can only enter these races with specific cars (lightweight model cars, FR cars, 4-Wheel drive cars, etc.) forcing you to race the earlier events to gain money so that you can buy the required cars. And as time goes by, more and more becomes unlocked. Plus, there are special condition events where you must perform a certain task in order to win the race. These are surprisingly fun, despite the fact that they are glorified license test. And, of course, I cannot forget those frustrating, nearly impossible licence tests that you must pass in order to continue in the game. It wouldn't be called a Driving Simulator without this, so I can't complain too much. That includes endurance races in the real driving simulator title. One of the very few things I hate about this game (and all the others) are the ridiculously long endurance events. Some are actually twenty-four hours long. Luckily, B-Spec mode is in this game, which puts you in the pit crew and lets you call orders to your driver. It also lets you speed up the race by three times. Twenty-four hours becomes eight. Still long, but nowhere near as agonizing.As you progress in the game, you start to become endeared to certain cars, and so starts the long process of \"souping-up\" that car. This has always been my favorite aspect of the GT series, but it doesn't have the option of buying race-paint for your car like the first and second games had. I've been waiting for this to return, but it hasn't and I have to say it has disappointed me. Still, fine-tuning cars to peak performance is still fun and challenging.Now, to the negatives:1. It's the same formula as every other GT game, which makes it older faster.2. No online play.3. Dumb AI of opponents. You'd think they would respond when you bash into them.4. Dominating cars. Every race has that one car that you can obtain that gives so much of an advantage that the games loses its fun.I'd recommend this game to anyone who loves non-arcade racing games. It's as in-depth as any there is, with a huge selection of cars to collect. If you've been away from the series, this is a perfect way to get back into it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

The first thing that disappointed me about LOTRO was how close the initial races were geographically.  The game fails to duplicate the epic feel of the books.  The Hobbit locations are all packed together.  Personally as a LOTR fan I wanted to take the game slow and be able to have to take time just to travel from hobbit town to hobbit town.  Even if you walk your character the game fails to deliver the feel of the books.  Then on top of that all the race locations are virtually next to each other.  And finally the game does not have all the locations of the books yet.  These will be added later as expansions.  As a LOTR fan this is unacceptable. As a LOTR fan I don't want to wait.  I don't mean waiting to level my character because that is actually relatively fast to do compared to other MMOs but I wanted to be able to level one character and explore all the locations the books have to offer.  I felt LOTR could have even been used as a companion to the books and thought maybe even schools which have the books as part of their learning could use the game as a companion to.  But since the game does not contain all of the locations in the books yet this is impossible.  As it is I am leveling many different characters just to keep playing the game while I wait for the expansions.Looking at the game as an MMO fan I was disappointed to.  First off the game has limited content which was the same problem Turbine had with DDO and combined with the relative ease of leveling characters is going to cause a lot of players to leave who like the game instead of having to grind character after character just to warrant the monthly fee until new content is added.  There are many elements similar to other MMOs and few things that are unique to LOTRO but don't feel they establish a niche for LOTRO.  The rabid MMO fans will level quickly and you better have a lot to do when they do and LOTRO fails because the endgame is stale, although admittedly WOW endgame was stale until they implemented all the PVP elements they wanted so there is hope that the LOTRO endgame will improve also.Overall I still like LOTRO.  Graphically the game is stunning and had all the locations in the books been implemented from the beginning would be amazing.  The problem is many fans of the books are not likely to have the high-end gaming machines required to fully appreciate the great graphics.  If you do have a superior gaming machine then LOTRO is worth the purchase for the graphics alone.  You can play the game on lower settings but that is really a let down.The crafting and monster play still need some refining but I can see a future where these might be some of the better things in LOTRO.  The combat system could have been better and really isn't better than MMOs already in existence but is sufficient for LOTRO.  The quests are nice and range in length from short to long and fit in nicely with the lore of the books, and there are a lot of quests. Many of the quests you won't even do with your first or second character but they are still in the same limited terrain. The character creation is better than most MMOs.In the end I thought Turbine should have tailored the game to fans of the books instead of trying to satisfy both fans of the books and MMO fans.  Ultimately MMO fans will move on and LOTR fans will be left and because of that felt they should have duplicated the epic feel and distances of the books.  As an MMO fan I honestly can't recommend LOTRO but as LOTR fan I do recommend the game if you have the patience to wait for all the locations in the books to be added.  If you are a fan of the books and can't wait for all the locations, I would suggest waiting a year and revisit the game.  Turbine has a good reputation for improving on their games and many of the locations in the books will be added by then. Also by that time many people will have the gaming machine to fully appreciate the great graphics.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2007"}

But I've seen much much worse. Sometimes doing \"actions\" takes a second to line up. Like jumping or climbing over something/through a window. But after you get use to it, shouldn't be too much of a problem at all. Just like any game, the controls may take a while to get use to.For starters, this is by far the smoothest running game I have ever played. The game just flows. Everything from loading a level to switching from an in-game-movie to game-play are seamless. I was amazed by the graphics. The lighting and the texture detail left me speechless. Everything from the control to the menu style was very well thought out.The crisp DTS sound shakes the house and really puts you in the action. It sounds great on my Onkyo 7.1 system. Character dialog is also well done. Not cheesy at all.The in-game-movies run great and look amazing. Facial features and expressions are really cool.The characters really have fun personalities. This is NOT one of those flat feeling games which try to give each character life but fail. This game pulls it off perfectly. I think the AI is great. Probably the best I've ever seen in a game.The level design is pretty good. Very solid and keeps you wanting to know what is around the next corner. It is the type of game that you have to make yourself stop playing. I'm a huge fan ofCall of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Game of the Yearand this game ranks pretty close to it.The fun factor is high.

{"product_name":"B00005ME7X","description":"Originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System,Dragon  Warrior IIIis a Game Boy Color port of one of the all-time classic  role-playing games. The game reunites two of Japan's greatest RPG talents in Yuji  Horii (story and game) and Akira Toriyama (character design). Toriyama is also  known as the creator of the immensely popular Dragon Ball cartoons and comics. A  prequel to the first two games in the series,DWIIIcasts you as the  child of a great hero who must defeat an evil demon. New additions to the port  include improved graphics, new minigames, new items, and a better translation of  the original Japanese dialogue.The game starts off with a personality test that loosely determines how other  characters will react to you. Gameplay is standard RPG fare: exploring, building  experience levels, acquiring allies, gaining weapons, and ultimately going after  a large monster. There are some interesting minigames to mix things up. The  Monster Medals feature adds a collectible aspect to the game. Monsters may leave  medals behind after you defeat them. Some monsters only appear during certain  times of the day. Getting all the medals unlocks a secret dungeon. You can trade  medals via link cable to make things easier. Most RPG fans will love this game,  but those raised on modern RPGs might find its combat a bit tedious. This game  is compatible with Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance only.--Raymond M.  PadillaPros:Classic gameplayExcellent monster and character designBetween 40 to 60 hours of playCons:Battles can get repetitiveA few character classes borderline on uselessGraphics appear dark on Game Boy Advance","reviewerName":"Ryan Bancroft","summary":"It brings a nostalgia-wrung tear.","reviewText":"One of my favorite introductions to RPGs, Dragon Warrior 3 is one straightforward experience.  I had the honored chance to play this gameboy color version, and was pleased to note that the improved graphics perfectly complemented the tried-and-true gameplay that defines everything enjoyable about the Dragon Warrior series.  Not only were the graphics more of an eye-catching treat, but the story was retold in a charmingly simplistic way that, fortunately, didn't sacrifice that important Dragon Warrior feeling.  I was also glad that the basic class system, starting off the adventure with a class and gaining the chance to change it later in the game, from which many other game's class systems are derived, was left wholly intact, for it was my introduction to classes and remains one of the better ideas in gaming.Even new RPGers, who maybe don't understand the nostalgia, can enjoy this quality title painlessly because there was an original draw to the game, right?  Perhaps this old draw will attract a new legion of gamers, a wave of past-seekers who want to relive the games of yesteryear.Whatever your experience or familarity with oldtime games, Dragon Warrior 3 is sure to offer an enjoyable experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2002"}

{"product_name":"B001FPBZ3U","description":"","reviewerName":"Carl Carter","summary":"A Great Value for the Money","reviewText":"Before I begin, let me be clear.  I'm not a Microsoft fan.  If anything, I'm a Microsoft hater.  I use a Macintosh for my personal computing, and I've never had much love for Bill Gates or his corporation.  That said, I'm having more fun with the Xbox 360 than I have with any other console.  I'll divide the rest of the review into categories for clarity.GRAPHICSThe graphics on the Xbox 360 are, to put it simply, gorgeous.  I've played games from every genre, be it shooter, RPG, action, etc. and I can honestly say that pretty much every one of them has been beautiful to watch and play.  That said, the best way to play the Xbox 360 is on a high definition television.  But even if you don't have one, the graphics are still very nice.CONTROLLEROne thing you may not think of when purchasing a console is the controller.  The Xbox 360 controller is incredibly comfortable, and it simply doesn't get uncomfortable, even after hours of playing.  I much prefer it to the Wiimote and PS3 Dual Shock controllers.  Then again, this is just personal preference, so your mileage may vary.GAMESThis is the area where the Wii faltered.  Sure, it had tons of multiplayer party games, but I just couldn't satisfy my appetite for a good singleplayer experience.  The Xbox 360 has been out for over three years now, and has an extensive library of games from every genre.  Most of the games I've purchased are months, if not years, old.  And I've still got several more that appeal to me that I'll purchase after I finish with the ones I've got.XBOX LIVE/MULTIMEDIA CAPABILITIESThis is the area where the Xbox won me over completely.  Once you make the jump to a Gold membership on Xbox Live, you'll never go back.  Sure, you have to pay for it, but it's currently around $40 for a year here on Amazon.  And it's worth every penny.  I've spent hours browsing through the Arcade, playing Halo 3, and even watching streaming movies and TV shows with Netflix (I took the free trial and immediately purchased a membership), all from my Xbox 360.  And the New Xbox Experience, with its avatars and streamlined user interface, makes browsing around and navigating the Xbox really easy.  And with 60 gigabytes of storage space, I can download all the demos, trailers, and themes I want.  The new interface also allows you to install games to the hard drive, making the Xbox whisper quiet while playing and cutting down on load times.  A very nice feature.  Also, the Xbox incorporates friends lists and lets users communicate very easily through text, voice, or even video messages.  The only downside to Xbox Live is that you need a decently fast internet connection, and this isn't available to everyone.  Also, the Xbox needs a wired connection unlike the Wii.  These things may potentially be deal breakers for some, especially those who don't have an adequate internet connection, as I would get a lot less use out of my Xbox if it wasn't internet enabled.INCLUDED GAMESNot much to say here.  Kung Fu Panda and Lego Indiana Jones are merely average.  My girlfriend has played them some, but they probably won't appeal to the more \"hard-core\" gamer demographic.OVERALLThe Xbox 360 is a great gaming and multimedia console.  If you're considering getting one, I encourage you to not only read reviews here on Amazon, but look at lists of features, as it has many other capabilities that I simply don't use, like being able to connect to a media-center capable PC.  For $300, this piece of technology is a great value, and I highly recommend it.THE BOTTOM LINE+ Has a multitude of features that will appeal to a great many people+ Has accumulated a huge library of games+ Xbox Live is the best online gaming service available+ Only $50 more than the Wii, and a great value for the money- Pretty much demands an HD TV and high speed internet connection- Must pay to use the online features","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2009"}

Rhodes","summary":"\"Welcome Back to the Stage of History...\"","reviewText":"In 1996 Namco released a game called Soul Blaade in North America (known as Soul Edge in Japan) and it was a game that focused on weapons based combat and centered on several characters going after a sword called Soul Edge.  Either to destroy it or attain it for their own means.  When Namco began talking about a sequel one of the first things they knew they wanted to incorporate was the use of the entire arena instead of just characters moving on one line.  This eventually lead the creation of 8 way run.  Where one could--literally--walk circles around their opponent.  But was it right to simply call it Soul Blade 2?  Project Soul thought not.  Instead they called their new creative and innovative fighter: Soul Calibur.Though not having a fantastic run in Arcades, the game was ported to the Dreamcast in 1999 and launched with the system.  When it was released it was such a smashing success and offered so much for players that we had a new champion of fighters.  It was simple enough for newcomers but had enough depth for experts.  But more than that, 8 way run and the detail the game had was, at the time, just unheard of.  Looking at it now, it's hard to believe the game was originally made in 1998.  It was not only well ahead of its time, but the only game that really seemed to give it any competition was the release of Soul Calibur II years later.  Since it's release the original Soul Calibur has gone on to be recognized as one of the greatest and most innovative games ever made.  And to this day, the only game that is really like Soul Calibur are the other Soul Calibur games.Many fighting games are not much for their stories.  A lot of them can tell a story but they're primarily about the fighting.  The original Soul Calibur is the same way, but there is actually an emphasis on characters and the relationships that these characters feel they have with other characters.  Every character has their own unique ending to Arcade Mode and every character has a biography that you can read to learn about them.  There's definitely a story and a narrative at work here.  As you read about the characters you'll learn as to why each of them are going after Soul Edge.  Their stories are tragic but interesting.  It's even more fun for those who played the original Soul Blade.  Things hadn't become quite convoluted with the story yet.  And when you read about all these characters some of them you're bound to find intriguing in their own way.  You may even find yourself having a favorite.  Not just because of how they fight... but because of who they are as a person.  They've got personality here and it shows not only in their exchanges in combat, their endings in Arcade and their biographies, but also in just how well they fight.Soul Calibur has a simple way of fighting.  You've got horizontal, vertical and kick attacks.  You can also guard and, of course, move all around the ring.  You can also combine attacks by pressing two buttons simultaneously for different attacks.  The implimentation of 8 way run really increases the number of moves which can be done.  It's simple to pick up Soul Calibur but the game itself is fairly difficult to master.  Unlike other games, there is actually qutie an emphasis on pokes, precise strikes and quick moves rather than emphasising the need to learn tons of special moves and combos.  It certainly doesn't hurt to learn these things, but no one will feel powerless when playing Soul Calibur.  But it does have a few complex moves and combos none the less.  Some characters have slide input movements while others may have attacks that require much more precise timing.  Anyone can pick up the game and utilize pokes, but a true master will actually have to sit down and train with some of their favorite characters.It's also to no surprise that Soul Calibur does put a huge emphasis on the player's ability to move all over the arena instead of just in a straight line where they my have moves that step to the side.  This is emphasized by the fact that any character can also attack while circling another.  Or they can use this to side step opponents.  This wasn't just some gimmick thrown in, this was pretty much what Soul Calibur was all about.  To put more emphasis on this, Soul Calibur allows players to knock one another out of the ring.  If there was anything that stood out in Soul Calibur as a real flaw it MIGHT be this little tidbit.  Unlike future games in the series, the first game made knocking someone out of the ring a fairly simple thing to do.  Characters went out of the ring far more easily than otherwise.  And while it's great to snatch a victory through ring out, it can be a pain when you suffered a ring out just because a very small portion went over the ring.Aside from that, Soul Calibur was a nearly flawless game.  It managed to do this by offering players what the Arcade couldn't.  Before Soul Calibur came out in 1999 if you wanted the best graphics and best experience with fighting games you typically went to Arcade to have it.  Soul Calibur was one of the games that helped to change this, in part because of the Dreamcast.  The Dreamcast version of the game looked and sounded better than the Arcade version.  The stages were more detailed.  The backgrounds, rather than being pre-rendered, were actually in 3D.  The game was the prettiest thing on the market in 1999.  And the characters were also detailed.  The console version of the game also offered different modes.  You had the typical Arcade mode, but the game also gave you a survival mode and things to keep you busy such as the game's Mission Mode.  Where you went to various stages to partake in missions.  These missions earned you points, which you could exchange in the Art Gallery.  Sometimes when you bought art in the gallery you unlocked other missions, stages or character exhibition theaters.  There was a lot to unlock in Soul Calibur.  It was an experience you simply couldn't have in the Arcade.As a result, Soul Calibur has also managed to age well, in part because it was so far ahead of its time.  In fact, its sequels can only seem to do worse because aside from tweaking characters and adding moves, there isn't really much you can do to improve the experience of Soul Calibur.  A franchise that achieves this much critical and commercial success right out of the gate doesn't really have anywhere to go but down.  And indeed, the Soul Calibur series has often been criticized that not much has been done to the basic formula as the years have gone by.  But when you play the first game it becomes apparent that it's really hard to build on that particular foundation.  We're talking about a game that was hailed by critics and consumers as one of the greatest games of all time when it first dropped onto the Dreamcast in 1999 (and is one of the few games on Amazon that still retains a five star rating years later).  Where exactly do you go from \"Greatest,\" exactly?  No where, really.  But it seems to be a testament as to how powerful and impactful Soul Calibur really ended up being.  The original still manages to be a strong game even by todays standards.The Soul continues to burn bright and those who still have their Dreamcast should own this game.  It is not just one of the best games you can find on the system, but still remains as one of the greatest games ever made.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0000503MO","description":"The third title of the Gran Turismo series takes full advantage of the new PlayStation2 game engine, which is capable of rendering about 20 million polygons per second--roughly 10 times the number of total polygons of the series' previous installment,Gran Turismo 2. Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course. They don't drive perfectly, either; some will spin out and make other mistakes over the course of a race.","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"Quite possibly the best racer ever","reviewText":"Stellar gameplay is what catapulted this series to prominence, and GT3 harnesses the PS2's additional horsepower to deliver thrilling, challenging races. The realism and depth of even the Arcade races mean GT3 is definitely suited for serious drivers only. GT2's lineup of street and off-road courses is joined by two new tracks: a cool downtown Tokyo circuit and the renowned Grand Prix course at Monte Carlo. While the car lineup is smaller than GT2's, it's still vast, offering everything from Dodge Vipers to Cooper Minis. It's a shame that more European exotic cars like Ferraris didn't make the lineup, though. However, GT3's much-vaunted A.I. isn't quite the revolution it was touted to be. Sure, the cars no longer robotically follow the same racing line and they'll occasionally sideswipe you, which are great improvements. But the changes amount to nice tuning, rather than the promised new experience. The off-road rally racing has been greatly improved, though, offering a much more playable, enjoyable ride. It's a lot like playing Colin McRae Rally 2.0-the action is that sweet. But GT3 isn't perfect. The races could really use more cars on the track; depending on the circuit, you'll face between one and five opponents. More importantly, the total absence of wrecks and damage to the cars makes such a highly realistic experience ring false at times. These nagging flaws have persisted since the first GT, so rather than being surprising, it's more of a shame that they weren't addressed. The GT series has a huge worldwide fan base, and GT3 measures up to those high expectations with style and depth. If you're into racing at all, this instant classic is simply a must-own game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2003"}

NOPE...","reviewText":"For a game with so many five star reviews one might think it is overrated, but if you haven't played it , get that thought out of your head immediatly! I'll tell you why this game is one of the greatest games games ever made...Graphics-10/10 graphically, this game is amazing. I've seen games for playstation that have worse graphics than this. The characters and backrounds are extremely detailed in lush color. Some SNES games have a tendency to have rather boring colored backrounds, but not this game. Also, the techniques used during battle look great. There isn't much else to say other than amazing.Music-10/10 WOW...the music is nothing short of miraculous. This game has got to have some of the best music I have ever heard in any video game, especially in the Zeal section. The music is close to the calibur of Super Metroid, which in my opinion has the greatest music for a video game. It is at the same calibur as Final Fantasy 6, tactics, 8,7 and besides those it may be the greatest soundtrack for a RPG ever made. I might think this game has THE greatest soundtrack ever made, but to be honest I didn't actually play this game till 2 and a half or so years ago, so I didn't have any memories of the game tied in with the music, and games I played when I was a kid seem to touch me in a stronger way. No complaints what so ever here.Storyline- 10/10 The idea that things done in a different time period effects the future is not only brilliant, but it is revolutionary. You will really start to feel for the characters here, and the stroyline will grip you into the game.Entertainment/gameplay- 20/10 Yep, 20/10, there are so many side quests to accomplish here, and every one of them is fantastic. You never know what you might unlock if you do something in a different time period. This game is pretty short, only maybe 20 hours the first time through, but if you go through and level up your characters to the max and complete all the sidequests, your looking at easily 40 hours.Overall- 100/10. Yep, you read it right. 10/10 isn't enough for this gem, so I upgraded it to 100/10. Like I said earlier, I didn't first play this game until 2 and a half years ago, and I still loved it, prooving how great this game is. If you are into old- school RPGs then you will probably already have this game, but anyone else will love it too. I think it is innovative and up-to-date enough to satisfy even PS2 fans.....Just get it if you can find it...!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2005"}

The game is without a doubt fun. From driving a tank to blowing up anti-aricraft guns, this game has been very solid. Graphically, it's good though not as good as Return to Castle Wolfenstein. the sound is very solid too except for the grenade explosions which sound like a popping balloon. Here are some of the bad things:1. All of the guys run around like they have stomach cramps2. You can't see very far becasue the graphics get pixally. You can't tell if there is a man in the guard tower or if it is a rail.3. The online play is slow and connection is laggy (My commputeris a Dell PIII 1000mhz, 256 rdram, 64meg video card and I have a cable modem and just getting connected to one of the servers is chore). And alot of the maps it's just a sniping battle.4. You and some of the enemies are like Superman. I shot one guy in the head 3 times and started targeting someone else when the guy got back up and started shooting me. So I shot him 3 more times and he got back up again. Same thing for you except you can take even more damage.Heres what is good:1. Some very interesting levels, especially Omaha Beach. Anything you heard about that is for real. It is definitley the best level and one of the hardest (You got to play to find out why).2. No end bosses. I get tired of playing games that have an end boss all of the time. Seem like all FPS do anymore.3. Nice stories and missions (I was worried in the beginning as it seemed all you did was follow other around while they killed everything. Kind of boring in the beginning)4. Lotsa of different scenery and things to do. There is a level where you have to take out some anit aircraft guns and other units in a heavily wooded area covered in snow. These levels are by far the best graphics and sound in the game. Everytime the breeze blew, I swore one of them dogs was coming at you. Very nicely done. Kept me on edge the whole time.The only other complaint I have is at time the AI was bad. I shot a guy in the back and had to reload my weapon and he didn't even check to see who shot him. Just kept walking. Another time, I came to a depot with 2 guards in 2 different towers and 4 on the ground. I picked them off one at a time with no alarm going off and the other guys didn't seek cover. Anyone who played RTCW knows that those guys came after you in a hurry.But this game is definitely worth it. If the Internet play (which is still pretty fun if you can get on. Unfortunately it is on Gamespy which I think is horrible) were alot better and a little faster paced, this would be one of the best FPS's ever. Oh well, maybe when Half-Life 2 comes out......A little update on the internet play. They now have a patch you can download that gives you an in-game browser, but it has to reload everytime you want to change games or it says server is full. The game also plays a little better, but is still laggy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00020LZAM","description":"Jak 3concludes the Jak and Daxter trilogy with a truly plot-driven adventure game filled with friendship, betrayal, death, and a long-awaited understanding of the Precursor civilization that has, until now, remained a mystery.One year has passed since Jak and Daxter saved Haven City from Kor and the attacking Metal Heads, yet Haven City is still immersed in deadly chaos as three groups fight for control of the streets. The people of Haven City have grown to distrust Jak's dark powers, and as rumors boil of Jak's ties with Krew and Kor, the city blames Jak for its current woeful circumstances. When the palace is destroyed by a surprise Metal Head attack, even Ashelin cannot protect Jak as the High Council's power broker, Count Veger, forces Jak into banishment to the desolate Wasteland. Jak is flown to the harsh island and dumped. With Daxter and Pecker bravely by his side, the three begin their next adventure where the battle for the city has just begun.Five times the size of Haven City, the Wasteland is a desert environment with multiple areas including mines and a volcano. Given the enormity and variance in terrain, vehicles play a large role as off-road transportation is introduced, fueled by a true-to-life physics engine. With a rugged new look and suited with armor, Jak is also equipped with an arsenal of new weapons with upgradeable mods that enable players to increase their firepower and enjoy the freedom to strategize and activate their arsenal at any time.As Jak has been exposed to Light Eco, players can now experience Jak's magnificent transformation to Light Jak. With a glowing electric blue aura and a massive wing span, Light Jak introduces new move sets, including the ability to glide great distances, emit an energy to block enemy attack, and power up at anytime, all of which provide the player with a sense of being invincible. Dark Jak also returns with more capabilities, forcing Jak to find a balance between light and dark.Additionally, game developer Naughty Dog continues to push the genre forward with the introduction of new technology. For the first time in the franchise, enemies feature realistic ragdoll physics, which will allow gamers to witness a unique death for each enemy that is killed. Naughty Dog has also implemented independent cloth movement technology and enhanced the enemy artificial intelligence (AI) with wall climbing and smart formation capabilities.","reviewerName":"Technohead","summary":"Another awesome game","reviewText":"This game's great too.

{"product_name":"B0021TVYCG","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"Two Worlds 2 brings adventure to the table..","reviewText":"however when trying to sit down it misses the chair and everyone bursts out laughing.  Okay okay it isn't that bad of a game but sometimes you gotta laugh at parts in this game. 90% of the time it is GOOD  10% of the time it is just down right BAD.  Overall Two Worlds 2 is a vastly superior game compared to the original Two Worlds, but still misfires on many features.GAMEPLAYTwo Worlds 2 pretty much falls into that vast expanse, near free roam RPG like Elder Scrolls: Oblivion was.  In fact you could call this game the 3rd person cam Oblivion at times.  After a 2-3hr Prologue the game will open up and allow you to branch into different gameplay directions.  Caster, Melee and Ranged are the 3 primary paths you could takeCASTER - Very well polished and will take advantage of the DEMONS system set up to create spells.  While I had gone down the Melee path I did tinker with some spell creation.  It is just amazing.  This kind of feature will make players who enjoy being casters squeal with delight. You pretty much build your spell from scratch by taking an element type, mixing it with another card and then add features to it.  I could take an Ice card w/ a summoning card and add some dmg boosting and duration to create an Ice summon that lasts 3mins.  Replace the ice card with Fire and it becomes a fire summon .  It is a great system that rewards creativity.MELEE - Fairly polished.  Pretty  much it is a button mash with some rather clunky animations that honestly make your attacks feel very weak.  The skill tree is well thought out though with skills catering to axes, two-handers, shields etc.  I actually didn't need many skills to make it through the game. A few basic skills and a nice two handed sword was all I needed in the end (took some time to get used to the block/counter system but once you get used to it mobs become so easy to tackle)  While the skill setup was well thought out, there was a clear lack of polish when it came to melee attacks and the blocking systemRANGED - Very unpolished and clunky.  While it works, the mechanics behind using a bow and arrow really suffer from bad controls (especially on the consoles) The setup is not horrible, but during the ranged tutorial you will pretty much get a feel of how it is like to use a bow.  Took me a handful of attempts to just quit being Robin Hood and return to melee and casting. I didn't level ranged at all so perhaps it gets better with age, but on first impression of it I found it very uncomfortable and badly polished.You can create 3 different \"item sets\"  so actually you could be all 3 types in one.  A simple press of a button and you will instantly switch to your next setup.  I had my UP = two handed setup.  LEFT = casting  RIGHT = sword / shield for defensive combat.  Like Oblivion, once you are tossed into the world it pretty much becomes free roam(except you are trapped on islands).  You can talk to people and shop keepers, pick up quests and travel around the map finding all kinds of things to do.  It starts slow, but once you hit level 10-11 it picks up in terms of combat.  Gameplay is everything in this game and it is vast!  Not to mention picking locks was a lot of fun.  It was very easy once you figure it out but it made for a fun mini-game you could say.GRAPHICS / SOUNDThe graphics are quite stunning even on the PS3. My friend purchased this game for the PC and on his system running at max settings it looks incredible.  The game goes through real time progression so the sun will set and the moon will come out while you play(however I often found the game pulled the change off while I went inside buildings and left) but the graphics are amazing on the PC.  For the PS3 the graphics are still very good but the \"blur\" effect can be a bit much.  There are ways to disable it however if you check the forums out.  *** Game audio however I found very lacking.  The combat sound effects were very unpolished and simplistic.  The soundtrack was fantastic though! So its one of those good and bad situations.  The voice acting is horrifying.  However I almost think this as on purpose because some of the dialogue was just so bad you had to be saying this stuff on purpose.  Besides... there is a quest where umbrellas have come to life and are eating everyone's pets. (not kidding!)  So you could just take it as the game is making fun of itself in a way.STORY / REPLAYIf you have not played Two Worlds then you are missing out on a chunk of the storyline. This game picks up exactly where Two Worlds left off.  However the storyline works with you and you really don't need to have played the first game to get into the story.  I found the storyline not bad.  There are better out there but for the most part the storyline will keep you wondering all the way until the final boss and then some.  Replay value... Campaign(sp) honestly I don't see much replay.  The fact you can actually be all 3 class setups as a single character ruins the ability to remake a character to try the other branches out.  What redeems this however is the fact the game comes with 8 player Co-Op MP.  There is a full 7 chapter online setup to adventure though, plus the ability to Duel and such.  You could easily put in 60 hours before the game starts to feel old.OVERALL (78% 7.8/C+)Two Worlds 2 is a fun game.  There is a clear lack of polish to the game, and sometimes the voice acting down right ruins the moment rather than just be funny-bad.  As a physical score I would give Two Worlds 2 a 78% (7.8 / C+)  With some more polish this game could of been a fantastic title that is a must buy for many RPG fans, but in this condition I feel this game would do well in the hands of Oblivion/Skyrim fans but leave a bit of a foul taste to those gamers not very big into those kinds of games.  Is it a bad game.. NO.  But the game is lacking the polish that would of made it a GOOD game so it falls right in the middle.  However all the bad this game might have, a true RPG or oblivion fan would easily become engrossed in the storyline and forget about what problems exist.PROS- Amazing magic creation system- Flexible leveling system and character setup allowing you to enjoy all 3 major roles w/o having to make 3 different characters (there also is rogue abilities such as traps and bombs)- Vast world with tons of quests and well over 30-40 hours of exploration and questing in the SP campaign- 8 player online Co-op multiplayer with 7 multiplayer based chapters- Awesome graphics- Fun lock-pick system, and item creation/enhancement systemCONS- Unpolished melee animations and Ranged combat very unpolished- Voice acting can be downright horrible in some parts- Audio effects were subpar in some spots- While the game has multiple chapters, Chapter 1 easily is the longest with each additional area becoming shorter and shorter (feels like chapter 1 and 2 had the most effort put into it)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2011"}

I really loved how you can run around the city of Springfield and check sites out between game scenarios and being able to change you're characters from Homer to Marge to Lisa or to Bart when you click on the bus station symbol in the city.  Every new level of the game has you using two characters to get through the level but you can't pick which ones you want to play during these levels meaning that if the episode calls for the two characters to be Bart and Homer you have to be these characters you can't pick Lisa or Marge to play on this level.  When you play single player you can switch between the two characters during situations so that if you want Homer to do something switch to him and you'll control him for the amount of time that you want while the second character has the game moving them about.  The major problem is the camera angle movement it became so frustrating when you're trying to see an area or find a view during battle or a puzzle problem that either something blocks your view or it cuts back to the front view and you loose sight of what you were trying to see or do.  That said I found it very entertaining watching the video clips between levels and hearing the characters and villains smarmy comebacks,wisecracks,and humorous lines in the game.  The video is great as I have seen with most Xbox 360 games even though I have only a 1080i t.v and not 1080p.  So all I can say is if you're a Simpsons fan looking for a great game with some minor cameraglitches this game is for you....","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2008"}

You have a portal gun that can make connecting dimensional portals between two different places.While fun, Portal was very short, and until very near the end you were just running through various lab experiments that were essentially puzzles.  You also were the only human character in the game.Portal 2 fleshes out this world more; you not only go outside the puzzles several times but you also go through an historical predecessor of the puzzle grid you first encountered.  As with all good sequels there are bigger and better challenges, and it feels like the story continues rather than repeats.You also meet (via recorded messages---you're still alone) Cave Johnson, the founder of Aperture Science. The only flaw I really had with the game is that at times it's too campy and silly. In Valve's universe Aperture Science exists with the Black Mesa of Half Life, and the two will likely be tied together in the someday-to-be-released Half Life 2: Episode 3; just I wonder how they'll resolve the sarcastic humor of Portal with the more serious tone of Half Life.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2012"}

But fans ofGTA IIIshould note that  whileState of Emergencycontains adult themes and extremely violent  gameplay, that's pretty much where the similarities end. WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once.

I thought that SOE was going to be a similar type game to GTA3, except with the feature of total destruction of your surroundings and with hundreds of people on the screen at once.  And I was right to an extent.  You can destroy your surroundings in SOE, and there are loads of people on the screen at once, but it didn't have the same zeal that GTA3 had.  SOE played kind of like a Final Fight type game or something. Run around punching and kicking, blowing stuff up, which I know sounds like fun, but it gets old real fast.Now I realize that my expectations were VERY high after GTA3, maybe way too high to be honest. I guess I figured that this game was going to be like GTA3, except with lots of people on the screen and with the ability to destroy your surroundings. What I got when I put it in was a cartoony free-for-all fight. Sure there are missions to perform, but they seemed uninspired and got boring pretty quickly.Sure the game is violent, but it's got a cartoony type violence to it. The characters in the game are colorful but not realistic. And this may be another aspect that I was expecting to be more like GTA3, which had a more realistic look and feel to it.  Not to say that aspect of the game was bad, just not really my style.Now I realize that this game is not GTA3, even though I was hoping that it would be just like it. It's just that the game was not what I was expecting at all. Again, I was thinking that it would at least be similar to GTA3, except with lots of people on the screen at once. Which is another thing about the game. Sure it's kind of neat to see that many people on the screen at once, but after a while it gets a bit annoying. Where are all these people going anyways? They just run around and act hysterical, doesn't make much sense. But it's a video game and I suppose it doesn't have to make sense.For people that plan on buying SOE on the strength of how good GTA3 is, I would say don't.  It's not the same game, or even close in my opinion.  I would recommend renting it first and see if it's your type of game.  I imagine that some will really like the game, I just know it wasn't for me.Well the good thing I did do was trade the game in for Maximo: Ghosts to Glory and so far I have been real happy with that decision. I should have got Maximo to begin with, but live and learn I guess.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2002"}

{"product_name":"B0047TG2R0","description":"","reviewerName":"Kevin Dorff \"kdorff\"","summary":"Good, not perfect","reviewText":"First, let me get this off my chest: THE MINI MAP IN THIS GAME SUCKS.I am probably about 10 hours into this game and probably about one third through it (I am about to start Act 2, from what I've read). I'm taking every side mission offered and completing them before the notable quest that will lead me to Act 2. The combat in this game works nicely, there are some random battles (which I normally loathe) but not too many of them.The good1. The combat is fun, satisfying. You can have as much or as little control as you want. In a heated battle you WILL have to do at least a LITTLE micro-mananging (but not much). Works nicely.2. Graphics are not 100% top notch, but they are pretty good.3. Voice acting is very good.5. The game controls VERY well with a controller. I tried DA1 with a mouse/keyboard and now that I am used to mouse/keyboard I had problems with it.6. I am playing on \"Normal\" difficulty and I feel like it is occasionally a minor challenge, but not too bad. Generally I feel like I dominate, which I like.7. I like the Inventory \"junk\" system. Clear stuff out of my list that I know I won't use.8. Conversation system is fantastic, just as with all Bioware games.The mixed1. I like the fact that I don't have to run all over creation to get between locations like in many open world RPGs but it took me a while to get used to their system of find an Exit and then select the next location and warp there. Sort of an weird fast travel system, BUT, I really like that the locations are clearly marked as to which quest objectives are there.2. Their save system could use improvement. It will auto save when you leave an area / enter a completely new area but it would be nice if it would auto-save after major battles or plot points. I tend to end up manually saving after each major battle. If you aren't fighting, you can save anytime, anywhere.4. The Junk system is nice, but I love that games like Torchlight let me \"send my pet\" to sell my item's I don't need. If you inventory is full and don't want to run back to a vendor, you have to just destroy stuff.5. The inventory comparison system is \"ok\". It works, but could have been better.6. Your actions don't make you good or bad (as with Mass Effect) but instead influence how your companions feel about you.The not so good1. THE MINI MAP SUCKS. It should rotate with the direction you are facing as up.2. At least in the first act, many of the locations / caverns are VERY copy and paste. I'll be in a completely new area and it is the same as another area but maybe different doors are open. Come on, this is LAZY.3. It seems that nearly all inventory items aren't usable by my companions. Pretty much you can never improve their armor, weapons, etc.Overall: I am enjoying it. The mini-map makes navigation a bit frustrating, but the fast travel system (once you are used to it) makes jumping between objectives pretty quick.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0044S8DA8","description":"","reviewerName":"Kristin","summary":"Very Very Long and a Little Tedious, But Potentially a Good Value","reviewText":"I just finished playing this game and while I enjoyed it overall, I can give you some pretty good insight into the good and the bad of it:1. The graphics are nice but a little too cartoonish for my personal tastes2. The music is good, sets the mood very nicely in a given area or for a scene3. Creatures jumping out creates a startle and a sense that anything can happen.  Even near the end it still can give you a bit of a jump.4. The creatures interact with each other as well sometimes.  Its nice to see various \"enemies\" fighting themselves instead of the standard condition in which all enemies are united against you.  Its fun to creep up on a couple enemies going at it and just sit and watch them and then you only have to fight the winner of that battle rather than taking on everyone at once.  Sweet!5. There's a lot of dialogue to go through with each character you meet and frankly a lot of its repetative.  I felt obligated to go through every subject with every character, but still, it got tedious and took more time than I would have liked.  I suppose this is part of the RP segment of the game in which if all you want is hack and slash you can skip reading or listening to whatever anyone has to say.  About halfway through I gave up trying to read through all that dialogue and only stuck to what I needed to know to do a quest which frankly, you don't even need to read that either.6. There's a lot of RP info out there in books and other items you pick up and can browse through.  It doesn't have any impact on the game of course, but if you like the idea of immersing yourself in a world and learning about it then that option is there.  This is rather nicely done.  The game already takes so long if you try to do everything that I bet it would take twice as long (like 200+ hours) if you really looked at and read everything.7. I like the creatures.  They all seem fairly unique to each other and the graphics of them are decent enough.  Again a bit cartoonish at times but still enjoyable.8. It's a really big world that's fairly open.  There's a feeling that you can just go explore or whatever and different text colors of the creature names tell you how challenging it will be compared to what your development is.  I being a more organized type, went through each area before moving on to the next, taking on as many quests as I saw (but I imagine you can just shoot through doing the main quest as well).9. The voice work is okay but not particularly great.  At times it seems like ridiculous over the top emoting in the voice acting, and some of the accents are unconvincing and silly and they all seem to have these Scottish or Irish accents (not sure which because I'm not great at telling which is which).10.  It can get a little boring and monotonous.  I found myself kind of dreading seeing another person who needed help, yet another side quest that resembled most of the others.  Go get this, go do that.  I took them all, I suppose that's the point of the game but they just got really boring after a while and frankly, I was so knee deep on side and faction quests that I often forgot what the main goal of the game even was.11. Feels like there's just way too much to try and do.  Besides the many quests, most of which get boring after a while, the idea of sage-crafting, alchemy, blacksmith is all nice but to try and learn and experiment with it and figure out all of it on top of the rest of the game just seemed like a bit much to me.  I made a few good weapons and armor, but I never really got the parts to make stuff that was so completely advanced compared to what I was finding or could buy that I can say it was worthwhile, it really wasn't.  I guess to that end,  you don't really need to do any of that.  There's plenty of potions to find or buy, lots of great armor and weapons around and same with gems. That having been said, gems could be a good source of revenue, except you don't really need it.  I just sold most of what I found and still ended up with millions in gold at the end, not that it really does me any good at the end I suppose.12. There's really no point to exploration.  The quests tell you exactly where to go and mark your map and everything, so there's no figuring anything out.  You don't even need to bother reading the dialogue from the characters in which they tell you where to go.  Why bother?  Just look at the map.  Without the map telling you exactly what to do, the dialogue no doubt would be far more valuable to pay attention to and I think the map probably does too much.  If it were me, I would have had an option to toggle show quests on the map for people who maybe don't want it spoon-fed quite as much.13. There's also a bunch of tasks which are filed under quests, but unlike quests, most of the tasks can't actually be completed.  This isn't a glitch or anything, its that they're repeatable, meaning you can just keep doing the tasks over and over so they never really go into the completed file.  As a potentially OCD person who likes to complete things in an organized way, not being able to finish some things like that was a little annoying.  Even if you turn the task down, it still shows up and the guy still has the exclamation mark on his head.After around 70 hours of game-play and 130 quests completed, i just started not to care anymore.  I stopped reading the dialogue and even began to dread seeing more quests coming up.  I reached a point in which I just wanted to be done with it because the quests were getting repetitive and none of it was particularly difficult or challenging.  I tried to turn it up from normal to hard, but all that did was get me more things to fight, not necessarily harder things.  So I was just spending more time fighting stuff that popped up on you as you ran from place to place but it wasn't any more satisfying.After nearly 110 hours and almost 200 completed quests, I finished the game.  The end was a little anti-climactic for me, I thought that the final battle should have been a lot more challenging than it was.  The kind of thing in which you have to use everything you have and really work it to win, but I was thinking that I had battles with countless trolls along the way that took more time than this final battle.I paid $7.49 for a download of the game and at that price it was an incredible value.  Over 100 hours of game-play (more if you actually read everything) can keep you busy for a while.  As I say, it does get really repetitive and a little boring after a while, so how much of the monotonous side and faction quests you really choose to do is up to you.  Still, if you can get a deal on the game, it's worth trying out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2013"}

I just finished my review of Kane and Lynch 2 and felt that doing this review to warn people away from this game was a necessity. There are a few positives but unfortunately, the negative way outdo the positives.Cover system is okay but not great as it not really a sticky cover system. You kind of press against a wall and you are in cover. Poke your head out too far and suddenly you are out of cover!! Sure the first Army of Two was like this too but you would think they would have improved this. Check out Kane and Lynch 2!! Oh yeah, I was supposed to be covering the positives...Graphics are decent. The characters you play as have nice detail and their movements look pretty good. Guns are very customizable and you keep all money and upgrades from one playthrough to the next which always a positive. There is also a great selection of guns that you can purchase and you can change your loadout at any time as long as you are close to your co-op partner.Cooperative is pretty well implemented with split screen and online co-op which works pretty much as you would expect. Would have been nice to be a more drop-in drop-out style but Kane and Lynch 2 didn't do that either so I can't complain too much I guess.Ah, now the negatives.They have implemented the Gears of War style \"roadie run\" almost which is NOT a positive. Holding down a button to run is just dumb(Kane and Lynch uses the hold down L2 method which I actually like more than the usual holding down the left stick method popularized by most First person shooters.) And the run is so dumb that if you don't release the button at the right time you will jump right over the first cover you get to(you should slide into cover a la Gears of Way so I guess they didn't actually pay attention to how Roadie run should be done. Argggg.) so you will find yourself getting shot right out in the open.Checkpoints are downright AWFUL!! YOu will kill 30-40 guys, walk through an alleyway, get helped over a wall, and then get one hit killed by one of the dumb bosses. Guess what? YOu will end up doing the whole section over again. Load times suck too when getting killed. Oh yeah, when you die, you have to watch the unskippable cut scene again and again and again and again!!Oh yeah, say you fully upgraded your gun before a fight in clown colors with a new scope, silencer, shotgun attachment, etc. If you die, NONE OF THIS IS SAVED!!! How idiotic is that? This game only saves your changes at the crappy checkpoints. EA has been doing a really bad job with their games lately. Dante's inferno had the same stupid save only at checkpoints system BTW.This game frustrated me more times than I can count. I like playing games on Normal difficulty but I got so pissed off by the checkpoints that I finally scaled it back to easy as I was tired of killing the same guys over and over again. And for the guy with the review saying this game was easy, BS!! It is not. The AI of the bad guys is so bad that it makes the game hard! They will run by you when you are not looking and shoot you in the back. You can be blind firing from cover and they will run RIGHT INTO THE Bullets so they can run at you and melee you to death. Add in stupid bosses who need to be flanked which are placed right before a checkpoint so you have have to do everything over again, and you have a recipe for tons of profanities being thrown at the TV(and maybe the controller too in some occasions)Do not buy this game unless you are absolutely desperate for a co-op game. Get Kane and Lynch 2 instead. You will thank me later.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2010"}

Like many fans, I was a huge lover of Horde Mode. A few months back, they said that they had changed horde mode so it wouldn't stop at 50 rounds, but would go on \"forever.\" They lied--and that is the part that makes it so tough to swallow. Not only is there no Horde mode at all, they have added a TERRIBLE \"survival\" mode, where you have to defend a silly little objective. What's worse, it goes on for ten rounds--and its over. Just like that. I can not believe that they would take away Horde mode, which has been copied over and over again by other games, and with good reason--it's a blast. I'm not sure why they would make such a deliberate attempt to slight their fans, but I have had the game for six hours and already feel like I was taken-ripped off, plain and simple.There are some very cool character and weapons skins, and the new class based system COULD have been cool, except you can't modify your class at all. This game, quite simply, is totally unfinished. They needed another six months to work on it and add in the content that should have been here. The survival maps are small and not nearly as creative or fun as the Gears 2 and Gears 3 maps.Anda a game cetered on Baird? Are you joking? He's the most annoying character in the franchise.The campaign is significantly shorter than Gears 3. I just don't see what they were trying to do here, and I'm very upset that I purchased a game for 60 bucks that was worth, at most, 40. And that is a generous estimate. I'm going to sell this as fast as I can and go back to Gears 3.

From the motion controlled games for the Kinect to one of the best first person shooters on any platform (Halo). Another game has had three successful releases on this console and it was created by Epic Games was called simply Gears of War. In this game you were pitted against a horde of lizard like aliens simply called the locust and the action spawned two sequels. Now there is a new entry in the series simply entitled Gears of War: Judgement. But is this a game you want to pass judgement on or just simply pass over.This game is a prequel before the first Gears of War so the main characters that you have played in the past will not be available. Instead you will be playing as Lt. Damon Baird and Pvt. Augustus Cole as you are both accused of treason after the battle in Halvo Bay against the locust. During the trial you will be flashing back to various characters that are in the game and play thru the missions as you try to discover what happened that fateful day. The basic controls from the previous games return as you will be running, shooting from cover and engaging the enemy from either far away or up close and personal.Multiplayer has been a big part of the Gears of War franchise and even though the classic modes are coming back in this new installment there is going to be two new modes available the first being called \"free for all\". In this mode you will not be going up against the locust but instead going up against your fellow cog soldiers in a test of grit and skill. You will have a choice of a variety of skins including a younger marcus and a younger dom! The second new multiplayer mode is called Overrun and it is what it sounds like. You are to protect a hammer of dawn beacon as well as two sealed emergence holes. If you protect the beacon until the end of the round then you can bring down the thunder and kill the locusts in the area. However if the locusts get near the sealed emergence holes then it is game over for the COG soldiers.If you are a fan of the Gears of War games and want to not only play an engaging single player campaign but have two new multiplayer modes then this is a no brainer.

I love the real AMC TV show, and October cannot come fast enough. All I can say is, even the cover is wrong on this one as they claim it is based on the AMC TV Show. The only relation to the TV show at all besides the name is the music, the main character name, zombies, and voices. Otherwise its nothing like the TV show at all.There are a lot of low rated reviews here and I have to agree with most of them and what they have to say. The graphics leave some to be desired. They are dated and Activision should have been able to do much better rendering of the scenes. But they were not that bad, and the game is playable with the poor graphics. My biggest beef is with the save points. Pathetic. Whom ever designed this part of the game should be fired immediately. What kind of moron designs a game with one major save point in a mission??Basically, at some half way point, which many times you are unaware of, the game will place a restart point. It will not SAVE the game, its just a restart point. This is also dumber than a rock. In other words if you do not have hours to play all the way through an entire mission, and you have to exit the game, next time you play, ALL progress will be LOST. Even if you make it to a check point. I got so tired of playing the same area over and over and over and over and over again from the beginning or last check point because of the poor design of this game.In the hospital for example at first I examined each room looking for moving zombies, and much needed supplies. I got pretty far the first round, I got into the cafeteria then got mobbed by 8 zombies at once. I had to start over from the beginning. I had to do this repeatedly until I figured out how to safely clear the cafeteria and the following hall. Then finally I got to a check point after running down the foggy hallway and ending up crashing through the floor into a room with, active zombies of course. In that entire first section before the check point there were plenty of zombies that would take huge amounts of health and they were not even close enough to attack or shove away. WTF?? There is one measly soda for health available. The second leg is worse, you have to get out of the room you dropped into with the active zombies in it and run down the hall to a room where you find some guy who wants to help, and you cannot accept his help or even talk to him, so why bother? Plenty of ammo in that room, cannot use it though, or you'll draw dozens of zombies, and of course NO health items at all. You have to run down the other end of the hall into a meeting room to find another measly soda, and more useless ammo.That is just an example of how poorly the game design was in this game. Ammo you cannot use or you draw dozens of zombies. Little to NO health items. Zombies that take huge chunks of health off, that you cannot run away from. Shoving does not help at all. They either will not lose grip on you, or bounce right back faster than you can turn and run. When you have to deal with more than one or two, consider yourself dead. You have no chance of getting away alive, and if by chance you do, there is no health what so ever to be found so the next zombie that you happen to encounter only needs to look your way at close quarters and your dead... back to the beginning to play it all over again. BORING!!!!  The controls are stupid. Game designers who are stupid enough to design a two stick control scheme should be banned from the industry. Yes, you need to control Daryl with two sticks. The left one controls forward and backward while the right one controls turning. If a zombie attacks you from the side you lose most of your health trying to turn around to face them otherwise you inflict no damage if and when you can get to those controls because you were using your right hand to try to turn when you should have been attacking while you turned. Lastly, you can clear a room , lock the doors, and zombies appear out of nowhere. Of course, unlike the show, they make no noise what so ever, its all of a sudden a huge chunk of health goes away as they start into you. What is up with the other survivors thing? They are useless!! They cannot help you,they cannot do anything. Half the time they are gone when you get back or failed their mission.The only thing they did get right with this game was the creepy. It is about as creepy as you can get knowing they are everywhere, and can appear or animate at any time. Dark places, dangers, you never know what is behind the next door or partition. Unfortunately the bad aspects of this game negate anything the creepy can do for it.If they were real game designers, they would have had save game points every new room or end of hall area or at least in every new large room or something. Going back to the beginning was boring and frustrating. There would be no appearances of zombies in rooms that were cleaned and closed off. There would be more opportunities to use guns and not attract more than one or two zombies instead of 20. Less health damage to Daryl each contact, and much easier to take out a zombie with a basic weapon like the knife. Some way to take on multiple zombies and live, or better yet break way and hide. One stick control! There would be much more health scattered about.Over all, I found this game frustrating mostly because of being sent back repeatedly to the beginning when killed. Mission areas between restart points were too long and if you go very far into it then died, you had to go all the way back to the beginning. Stupid. Total lack of health to be found. If I'm going through room and areas rummaging, toss us a frigging bone and give us some health rewards! I would not recommend this game, not unless you pick it up on the $9.99 rack.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2013"}

Martin","summary":"Awesome game! Equal to the Medal of Honor series!","reviewText":"At first I was skeptical of this game, but I decided to pick it up based on some things I'd heard about it from other people who'd played it. I'm really glad I did! I just bought it a couple days ago and played it for 10 hrs. straight yesterday, it's that addictive!The story line is great, in fact even though the Soviet Union hasn't existed since 1990-91 and hasn't been a military threat to the US for decades, this story line is carried so well in the game it's downright believable sometimes.The graphics are simply awesome. Everything in every level looks very real, including the &quot;cut&quot; video scenes at the end of every level. The two main characters, Chris (who's the guy you play as in single player mode) and his brother are designed to look as what Mario and Luigi would look like if they were real people instead of cartoonish characters. The only drawback to the graphics I've seen so far is that while there's several different levels dependent on what you've done before in the game, the levels take place in different areas of the same places. There's two levels (that I've seen so far) on the docks area. Rather than this being IO/EA Games being cheap on the design, I think it's just because the whole story line takes place in NY City, so the designers are pretty much stuck with certain areas of NY for any levels that take place at the docks.There's a multitude of weapons to use in the game, you choose which weapon you wish to use because you're not only able to pick up additional ammunition but on occasion drop the current weapon you have and pick up the weapon of somebody you or your team has just killed. This is especially useful in tougher levels where finding ammunition isn't as easy.The team aspect of a single player mission is very SOCOM like. You're the team leader and can issue orders to your fighters. One additional fun thing is you've got to recruit fighters to join your anti-Soviet fight. If you've got enough &quot;charisma&quot; which you earn by freeing POWs, healing civilian wounded and other (mostly) non-killing things during the game, people will join your cause. If you don't, people will refuse your recruitment. It also seems that the designers have made each CPU character you can recruit have different fighting abilities. So far, I've had teams of recruited fighters that seemed to fight and follow orders better than others.Even on the easiest setting, the AI does present a challenge in most levels, they don't just walk in blindly to your fire and almost willingly get killed. There are also soldiers with full body armor on in the game in certain places. These guys take a lot of strategy and smarts to deal with because unless you shoot them in the face, everything else just bounces off. It also even takes multiple grenades or molitovs to kill the guy. I think it's great because it requires you to use stealth sneaking as well as use your weapons wisely.I also think as a bonus for players who don't play this type of game very much the levels on the easiest setting aren't TOO difficult and shouldn't cause a player to give up in frustration after just a couple levels.I really hope this isn't just a one-time game from IO/EA Games. This game I think is of such good quality that it's worthy of a series of games that come out yearly, just like the Medal of Honor series. Perhaps the next game could be about terrorism in NYC and not the Soviets.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2003"}

This game is simplicity at its finest.  Everything about it is simple...WHICH IS WHY IT IS PERFECT!!I must say that this game wasn't truly fun in a traditional sense.  But if you have a political keenness, that doesn't matter.The story begins at the early years of the 21st century (2002 or 2003 I think).  Chris Stone, a plumber and the hero of the story, is working on a job with his brother at a news anchor's house when.. DUN DUN DUN!  The Russians kick in the door searching for her.  The Russians have invaded US soil and are taking over!So why in the world are the Russians holding up the Americans?  This game actually takes place in an alternate universe.  What would have happened back during WWII if the USSR had developed the first nuclear bomb?  The game answers that for you in the intro.  1945, the USSR drops the world's first A-Bomb on Berlin, ending the war and giving Communism the upper hand in Europe.  As the years pass, Communism takes over Europe, and I think in the `70s England is the last European nation to join.  The US is one of the final Capitalist nations left.The Communists believe that the US is oppressing its poor people and other folks that live within the borders.  So, they decided to spread their doctrine of FREEDOM to the land of the OPPRESSED.  Sounds a little like present day politics, doesn't it?  By way of military might, the USSR forcibly occupies the United States.  But your man, Chris Stone, has other plans.  As Chris, you play as an insurgent....I mean...FREEDOM FIGHTER!  You and your ragtag gang of ticked-off Americans will shoot your way to the heart of the Communist regime in order to retake New York.That's the story.  So how's the game?It's simple. So simple.  In fact, the auto aim system is perfect.  Yes, it auto aims for you.  Most shooters can be determined based on how well you aim.  It is clear that the developers wanted players to experience other aspects of the game.Charisma - As you complete your tasks, you will gain Charisma points.  Also, if you heal the wounded, the same happens.  When you gain about 50 points, you'll get enough charisma to recruit people.  The more charisma, the more allies.  I think that by the end of the game I had about 11 or 12 slots.Squad based action - Squad control is perfect.  You can deliver 4 commands by using the X, Triangle, Circle, and Square keys, all of which are 100% useful.AI Brains - Your allies are incredibly smart and powerful.  They know full well how to storm a room and clean up or charge a field while you provide cover fire from a perched machine gun.Auto aim - This feature is actually very nice.  Often times you will see someone and start firing, but it will actually be your ally.  Since auto aim does not lock you onto your allies, chances are you probably didn't hit the person.Difficulty - Very easy.  But this doesn't detract from the experience either.Graphics - This is a 2003 game.  Therefore it suffers from 2003 PS2 graphics flaws.  For those of us who have been spoiled by the near-movie quality of graphics in the more recent 2005 games, then maybe this may cause some trouble,  But once you get over this, the game is superb.The Music - IS AMAZING!!!  It is desperate, but not hopeless.  It effectively generates the \"keep on fighting\" feeling that one needs in any game about a revolution.The Enemies - You will know when you've made a wrong turn.  The enemies aren't impossible, however if you miss a step, they will kill you very fast.  But it keeps the order in the story.Saving  - The Autosave system is very nice.  It does all the saving for you, and it can never hurt your progress.  It's nice because you will never forget to save.  Also, you can quicksave at each manhole.Bottom line:  The game is excellent.  I beat it in 4 hours...which is less time than I spent on Zone of the Enders.  I was very surprised.  But it was among the greatest four hours of non-Japanese gaming that I have done in a very long time.  Don't go comparing this game to Mercenaries because they are not the same.  Mercenaries is like a movie, but Freedom Fighters is way deeper.  Really think about it what's going on today when you are playing this game.  You will never forget playing it.Happy gaming!You should really check this game out.  It is one for the keeping.  It has replay value.  And even if you only play it once, for the price tag you might as well just buy it and share it.  Everyone will love it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0000696CZ","reviewerName":"C. Conard \"ExtremeAvalanche\"","summary":"Revolutionizing the Gaming World!!","reviewText":"Vice City is the follow-up to 2001's GTA III. GTA III was one of the best video games ever created, and now Vice City extends upon that legacy in an admirable way. Vice City is a fresh way to play the GTA series, but right off the bat, it is easy to see why Rockstar didn't call Vice City GTA IV. The styles between Vice City and GTA III are astonishingly the same. So, if you are a GTA fan who is hardcore and looking for a brand new game, you won't find that within Vice City. However, most people won't be this stingy, and if you are a casual GTA gamer like me, you will get as much enjoyment out of Vice City as you got out of GTA III, and probably more. Let's start at the basics of the game. Vice City does take place in a whole new city, Vice City. Vice City is much more colorful than Liberty City, with fancy neon lights and a tropical landscape. Vice City is based on Miami, Florida, and the entire game will look very much like Miami Vice or Scarface. Vice City also moves to a new time period, the 1980's. This is an interesting feature, and it makes the game even more fun. The city seems very much like a 1980's city, with pimps, beautiful women, hot cars, pastel-colored suits, and neon lights. Another feature to Vice City is that you can go indoors in several different areas, and now you can own properties, which were not options in GTA III. Different properties to own include a strip club, dance club, taxi business, ice cream factory, print works, and even a boatyard. There are missions involved with these, and the properties accumulate money as well. Another big feature is the updated and expanded soundtrack. The music is superb, with real hits from the 80's. You will have hits like Gary Newman's Cars, A Flock of Seagulls, and others. These are seperated into several stations, but two of the stations are chat stations. They are VCPR and K-Chat. These stations are humorous, and much better than the chat stations in GTA III. By the way, there are new radio hosts, and Lazlow has gone off to host the rock station, V-Rock. There are many more missions in Vice City, and you will do missions for a Cuban drug lord, a rock band, and even a porn director. These will build up to the finale, an intense and very fun string of missions similar to Scarface. This brings me to my next point. Vice City is just like the hot movie Scarface, and if Al Pacino ever ran out of cash, he could easily sue Vice City. So, if you are a fan of Scarface, then you will love Vice City. Now in the series, there are even more side missions. There are dirt bike tracks, selling ice cream, rampages, and the usual slurry of taxi cab, ambulance, and police missions and your service. If you put everything together, Vice City is the best game and biggest game ever made. I have had Vice City for nearly a year now, and I am only 86% completed. That should give you an idea of the sheer size of the game. It all boils down to this-If you are a fan of GTA III, you MUST buy Vice City! It will please any fan of gaming!

Not as much as I love RPG games, but they definitely rank a close second. Recently, I was craving a good, old fashioned, cartoony platform title, and I came across Super Paper Mario. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised with this one. Super Paper Mario is fun, funny, and plays out with aspects for both old-school gamers as well as those new to the crowd.PlotThe difference between Super Paper Mario and traditional Mario games is that there are some RPG aspects included. That is, your character levels up and gains either additional HP (Hit points, or health), or attack power (the factor that determines how hard you hit a baddie). While the RPG aspects are simplistic, it does serve to add a dimension to the game that sets it apart from other platformers. That said, it is reminiscent of titles like the PS2 Ratchet & Clank franchise, which is also a series of platforming games with minimal character development through levelling.Now, you may be asking, what does this have to do with the story? It serves as a primer. In this title, Mario is called upon to save the universe from being completely obliterated due to a crazy Count, Bleck. The game starts out with the Mario brothers sitting in their home, and decide to go visit the princess (Princess Peach). On their way out the door, Toad runs up to them, and says the Princess has been kidnapped! Thinking that their old nemesis, Bowser, is behind this, they quickly run to his castle, but discover that while he had planned to take the princess, he hadn't acted on his plans yet. At that point, Count Bleck appears, and kidnaps Bowser, and decides to take Luigi for fun. Mario is knocked out, and wakes up in the 2D town of Flipside, where the wizard Merlon tells him that he is their only hope of stopping Count Bleck from destroying all the worlds.While all of this may sound cliche, the acting and the story itself is cleverly written, and while sometimes predictable, keeps you wanting to move the plot along to find out what happens next. I often found myself laughing out loud at the funny dialogue that takes place between the characters. On your quest to find the 8 Pure Hearts (needed to counteract the Chaos Heart unleashed by Bleck), you will run into many colorful characters, all with something to say. While I often find myself avoiding townsfolk in many RPGs (talk about boring), in this game, you want to speak with them just to hear what crazy thing they may tell you.Overall, the plot is clever, funny, and well-scripted. That being said, what about the gameplay?ControlsThis game uses the Wiimote, held sideways. You use the d-pad to control your movements and direct which way to run, etc. The 2 button is used to jump, the + accesses the menu, and the 1 button is used to access the special abilities of your Pixl.What is a Pixl, you ask? If you have ever played a Legend of Zelda title, you may be familiar with your fairy that follows you through the game. A Pixl is essentially the same thing, and they float along with you, lending you their special abilities. As the story progresses, you will find new Pixls, each with different abilities. One helps you pick up things to throw them, another acts like a hoverboard and flies you across spikes and other hazardous traps, and still another gives you the ability to use a hammer to break blocks and smash hard-shelled enemies (think Koopas and Beetles). At the time of writing this, I had found 10 Pixls, some hidden, some mandatory to completing your story.In terms of control, I never had issues of missing a jump, etc. One some occasions, I had difficulty getting my system to register the \"Up\" press on the d-pad. I switched Wiimotes and still had trouble getting Mario to speak to different townsfolk. I do not know if this was a quirk with my system or the game, but after a while, it worked again. Also, some items that you can use may require you to shake or tilt your Wiimote. Sometimes the game didn't register the tilts correctly, and I would miss a mini-game. This got to be irritating, especially when the item was meant to heal my character and I lost out on some health because of this.GameplayThe gameplay for this title, in short, is fun and entertaining. New to this sequel is the ability to temporarily switch to 3D, adding a new dimension (no pun intended) to gameplay. Rather than feeling like a cheap gimmick, 3D was used throughout the title to avoid obstacles, find hidden power-ups, and locating new paths to reach another location. The downside to this is that you only have a limited time to remain in 3D, before you start taking health damage. Most obstacles that require this transition to 3D can be completed well within this timeframe, however, but as your desire to explore further kicks in, it can become a hindrance. The only frustration that I found in 3D was a bit of difficulty in lining up a jump to hit a block or kill an enemy. There are shadows, but it is still not a precise science, and you may find yourself taking damage from an unseen enemy, or worse, one that you see clearly but cannot line up to hit.As you quest through the game, you will also acquire 3 other playable characters: Bowser, Princess Peach, and Luigi. Each of these characters has their own abilities and weaknesses. Bowser, for example, has twice the attack power of any of the other characters. He also breathes fire, which helps in attacking a lot of character types you may not be able to jump on to kill. However, his drawback is that he is painstakingly slow, very large and more susceptible to accidentally jumping into something, and cannot climb ladders. The great thing about this, though, is that you cannot rely solely on one character to complete an area. In some cases, you may need Peach to use her parasol to float to a distant ledge. Or, you could need Luigi to jump to a high location. This adds another fun dimension to an already interesting and entertaining title.Sound and GraphicsThe sound to this title is fun, vivacious, and very true to the mood. Every area you visit has its own song, and all of the classic sound effects that you have come to love from the previous Mario titles are there. There is no voiceacting, however. For some games, this could be a drawback, but in the world of Nintendo, Mario and Company have never had true voices. This also means that the game is very text heavy. The good news, however, is that the text scrolls quickly but gives you control on how fast you wish to move to the next paragraph.Graphics are bright, colorful, and appropriate for the title. Super Paper Mario is just that, a two dimensional rendering of Mario. The inhabitants of this world are also two dimensional, also. The only 3D rendering in this game is through Mario's ability to change into a 3D viewpoint, but even then the detail is still colorful and bright. Overall, the game is fun and bright, and very detailed.OverallI recommend this title. Two thumbs up. A-OK. I cannot say more. It is fun, funny, bright, colorful, and simply a great game. If you like platformers, the Mario franchise, and want to find a new game for your Wii then this is for you. It is easy to pick up and learn, and hard to put down. The best part is that this title is great for all ages. Rather than the violent titles of the XBox 360 or the Playstation 3, this game is a refreshingly interesting change of pace.You won't be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2013"}
{"product_name":"B008GEH9HO","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"Finally, Nintendo delivers on the 3DS' potential (an in-depth look at the improvements and differences over the original 3DS)","reviewText":"If one looks at the 3DS with an unbiased, objective point of view, there is a lot to love. It is basically a next-gen successor to Nintendo's vastly successful DS handheld, with the horse-power of a console somewhere between the Gamecube and the Wii. It utilizes a very cool 3-D effect that, when done right, really adds to the overall immersion of the gaming experiences available on it. Everything about it is an improvement on the original DS. Granted, it also has some caveats and issues as well. The 3DS XL does a very good job delivering the goodness of the original 3DS, while making vast improvements over its smaller brother original. In this review, I will focus on the differences and improvements this model makes on the 3DS line. I'll warn you right now, this is a long review. If you don't like long reviews, then you may want to skip this. :PScreen Size: With a title that includes \"XL,\" obviously the increase in size is the biggest difference between this and the original 3DS. It may be easy to hear that the screens are 90% bigger than the original, but it really is a stark difference when you take the system out of the package and see it for yourself. The XL's screens are HUGE compared to the original. It's comparable to the jump between the DSi and the DSXL, for those savvy to what that means, but in this case its even bigger because the top screen is in a widescreen format. Despite the size increase, the picture is still crisp and pops with nice detail. I thought that because the screen would be bigger, but with the same resolution as the original, the XL's picture would be distorted and fuzzy, but that's not the case here. I've put the screen detail and quality through rigorous testing since buying the system, playing many different games, and the bigger picture really makes the scenery more detailed than I ever noticed before. It's no exaggeration to say that the games actually feel new due to this greater detail. It's great!Screen quality: Instead of the top half of the XL having a shiny, glossy finish of the screen and the area around it that the original featured, the 3DSXL features an almost \"smoothed over\" finish that was meant to lessen glare from the sun or other lights from bothering your eyes. It actually makes quite a difference. The trade-off is that the back-lighting seems just a smidgen less bright, but not much at all. One of the biggest problems I had with the original 3DS was the problem of \"ghosting.\" It was especially frequent in games with areas of high contrast. This was a common issue people had with the original 3DS, but I haven't noticed it much at all yet with the XL. This is a big plus for me, because that ghosting was one of my biggest gripes with the original. I made my peace with it though, because ghosting naturally occurs from time to time with the tech being utilized in the 3DS, but to have it mostly gone here is a real treat. The colors in the XL seem brighter and a bit more vibrant as well. The touch screen is really nicely made, and seems to be a slight improvement on the original, but the difference is negligible. The saying, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it,\" comes to mind.DS backwards compatibility: Honestly, this is one of the best things about the 3DXL. If you look up comparison videos of the first 3DS playing original DS games and a DSi playing DS games, the 3DS is surprisingly inferior. The colors are more bland, the resolution is fairly fuzzy, and if you choose to play it in its native resolution to fix that blurry smudginess, the screen becomes so small it's hardly worth doing that. The XL makes drastic improvements in all of these areas. The colors are just as bright and beautiful as playing on a normal DSiXL. Due to the larger screen size, playing in a native resolution still leaves ample room for playtime and is no longer the cramp experience the first 3DS offered. If you choose that route, the screen will be close to a normal DSi. Even if you don't, the picture is still decent at full-size, shockingly. This fantastic backwards compatibility is a real plus in the 3DSXL's favor and should not be understated. Massive improvement here.Build quality: Much like the new DSi and DSiXL made notable improvements in build quality to their predecessors, so does the XL refine the design of its predecessor. Instead of an outer glossy finish, there is a sleek matte exterior that makes the XL feel more heavy duty and refined. It definitely has a better build quality than the original. My original 3DS' top screen hinge became fairly loose and the lock-in positions a little weak after just one instance where I accidentally jostled it. The hinges on the XL click and lock into one or two set angular positions before locking into the flat position and I know there's no way this thing is going to break easily at all. That's a really nice improvement. The system is surprisingly slick in its form too. It's about the same thickness as the original (which is kind of clunky in comparison, let's be honest), and even weighs less than expected, despite the larger screen and button size, and this size and shape really comes across as a mature, sleek gadget from Nintendo. I felt the same way about their classy DSiXL system too. The buttons are also vastly improved. The home, select, and start buttons are actual separated buttons that have a bit of click to them, which is a vast improvement. The other buttons have more \"squish\" to them, but still click in a satisfying way. All-in-all, the buttons feel very balanced, if that make sense. They're very similar to the DSiXL's button quality, which is to say, very nice. The 3-D and Volume slider are also different. When all the way off, the 3-D slider clicks into an off position, and when you want to turn the 3-D effect on, you must click it out of position and then slide it to your desired 3-D level. Both the volume and 3-D sliders seem more heavy duty. They stick and stay where you leave them very, very well. A lot of small details add up in this system, to be sure.Battery life: In my personal experience, the original 3DS had battery life that lasted about 3-5 hours with the 3-D slid up, 4-6 without 3-D, and roughly 6-8 hours with DS games. The 3DS XL is supposed to last 4-6 hours with 3D, 6-8 without, and 8-10 with DS games. It's not a HUGE improvement, but every bit counts. If you're like me and play a lot of the time with the system plugged into the wall, it won't really matter all that much anyway, but for those who want to play on the go, this is a really nice improvement over the original. Of course, battery performance will vary depending on how bright you have the screen and how many power-draining features like wifi that you choose to use at any given time. Still, I really like the battery life of the 3DS XL.Sound: Supposedly, the sound tech in the 3DSXL is pretty close to the original, but I (and others, I've checked) have noticed some differences. The speakers on the XL seem a bit quieter than the original. Not a ton, mind you, but it's noticeable. The speaker volume level seems to depend on which game you're playing too. 3D Classics: Kirby's Adventure seems just as loud as before, but better now. I tend to play my 3DS with theseamazing headphoneson, and the difference becomes really noticeable then. The sound from the XL with headphones seems a lot more detailed and ambient than before, and the volume level is fine. The highs, mids, and lows are distinctive with no aspect overpowering or distorting the others. Much like the visuals, I'm hearing things in games I never heard before, and it has enhanced my experience even further. Games with amazing soundtracks are a real delight to listen to on the XL. Great stuff here, and a very pleasant surprise!Memory: The 3DSXL comes with a 4 GB SD card, making for a much bigger space for storage than the 2 GB SD card included with the first models. This is nice. I almost filled my first one up and still had a lot more games to get. Granted, you can buy any sized SD to use with the 3DS after some formatting, but having more space right off the bat is nice.Any issues?: In many ways, the 3DSXL is what the 3DS should have been from the beginning, and it's a fantastic little handheld. It's not quite perfect though. For one, where's the second analog slider? There's ample room under the right-hand face buttons for it, but alas, no slider. It's not a problem that bothers me much, but I must note it because there are many who will view it as an issue. Imagining the boat-peripheral they're making for this system makes me giggle a bit. It conjures up visions of Nintendo releasing a laptop-sized 3DS with trigger buttons, lol. I understand they kept it out due to tech/power/space optimization, which makes sense. Personally, I never cared much for a second slider, and not having one has pushed developers to come up with some really creative things in the past on the DS and 3DS alike. I also find the design of the XL to be, like the original, cramped and painful to hold after a while, especially in high-action games. It's definitely better, don't get me wrong, but the cramping is still there a bit. To fix this issue, I highly recommend purhasingthis comfort grip, as it is worth its weight in gold in this area. :D Perhaps the most annoying thing about this handheld is the d-pad. It works just as well as the one before, but now it's extremely \"clicky.\" I don't mean the button clicks when you use it; that has always been the case with the 3DS. What I mean is, now the d-pad seems to be looser in its area, and so makes this \"clickety\" sound against the bracket if you lift your thumb off of it even if only for a split-second. It can be really annoying. One more personal gripe: the color choices. Really Nintendo? Bright blue and red? The DSiXL had really mature, fetching color options that made the system feel like an adult's gadget. These slick red and blue colors are a lot less subtle and elegant. Don't get me wrong, I own a teal 3DS (not exactly the most \"mature\" color choice) and love it, but I wish there had been a more subdued teal, gold, or forest/jade green finish to choose from. Just you wait, as soon as I post this review, that option will become available, knowing my luck. lol(Update: Nintendo has since released two more models with different color schemes. My wife has a lovely Pink/White model and it is very pleasing to the eye, and I say that without shame or feeling like a wussy. There's also an all-black XL which seems like more of an \"adult\" choice. Nintendo also releases limited edition models from time to time that gives more variety if your timing is good. Being a massive fan of the Legend of Zelda series, I ended up buying thegorgeous golden LE 3DSXL commemorating A Link Between Worlds, with no regrets. It looks amazing. So there are better color options now, thankfully, even though I grew to love my blue XL. Just thought I'd throw this update in there.)I realize this review is very long, but when considering tech purchases that are this pricey, these kind of reviews always helped me make informed decisions better. I have both the original and now the XL, and I must say the 3DSXL feels like the \"true\" 3DS. The system should have been like this from the start, honestly, and when it was originally announced, I, along with many others, hoped for an XL edition. Now we get it and it has been well worth the wait. For those who don't own a 3DS yet, this is the perfect time to get it. This system finally delivers on the promise of the original 3DS, and now there's an excellent library of titles for newcomers to joyously embrace. At a mere 30$ more than the original for practically double the space and a big jump in hardware quality, it's more than worth it. This is a great value. I'm glad I got the original a year ago, but I am absolutely thrilled to get this version, and heartily recommend it to all gamers with a heart container for Nintendo or great gaming in general. It's not a choice you'll regret. I hope you enjoyed this review and found it helpful. Have a good day. Toodles.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2012"}
{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"Female Spy","summary":"It's the Newest Sensation!  (by Laura)","reviewText":"At a time where the Playstation 3 was too pricey, and the XBOX 360 was too boring, the refreshingly revolutionary Wii came out: and, let me tell you, it's one of the BEST gaming systems out there!  In this review, I will describe the Wii's strongest and weakest points, starting with the stronger:1.  Revolutionary motion controls.  Though there are a few \"traditional\" games, most of the Wii's games feature controls based on movement (e.g. swinging your arms to throw a punch, or pointing to select an option).  These controls are AWESOME!  They work pretty well, even before the fancier things like Wii Motion Plus and the Wii Balance Board came out (each sold separately).  With motion on your side, this system is also probably the most calorie-burning game system on the market today.  The motion controls make games a MUCH more immersive experience; like you're playing them instead of watching them!  VERY revolutionary indeed!2.  Easy to set up.  I won't lie: this is the first game system I managed to set up without any parental assistance.  Just make sure that you find the right TV channel that will show the Wii screens (for me, it's Video 2, using the input button; but it probably varies).  Once you get the hang of it, it will only take about ten to fifteen minutes to set up before play, if you choose to take it down.  In other words, the fun starts almost instantly!3.  FUN games!  Many great games have come out for the Wii since it's release (e.g. \"Sonic Unleashed,\" \"Super Smash Brothers Brawl,\" \"Sonic and the Black Knight,\" \"Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games,\" etcetera; each sold separately).  In fact, \"Wii Sports\" alone is a great game, and it comes WITH the Wii!  Buying a Wii is basically like buying a mine that holds gold; you're going to get a LOT of rich experiences out of it!4.  Gamecube game compatibility!  All of the great games you can play on Gamecube can be played ON the Wii!  There are some GREAT Gamecube games to boot!  So, if you buy a Wii, you're basically buying TWO great systems at once!  How's that for a deal?5.  Most inexpensive of the newest systems.  The price has even come down since I bought it!  At the price it is now, it is MORE than remarkable!6.  Decent graphic capabilities.  I've heard many people complain that the graphics for the Wii games aren't any good; those people obviously haven't played games like \"Sonic Unleashed.\"  You buy that game and tell me: do the graphics stink?  NO way!  True, they may not be the VERY best graphics on the market, but that's basically just splitting hairs; the graphics still hold their own, even when compared to the other latest systems.7.  Fun features!  The Wii is capable of interacting with the internet to allow multiplayer capabilities through online resources, weather updates, shopping, and more!  It can also do stuff with pictures, but I've never explored it; this thing has thousands of features, but, alas, most of it is useless if you don't have Wi-Fi.  Still, if you're internet savvy, this is one of the BEST systems to have!  My favorite non-internet feature is creating the Miis (basically little computer people for some games); it's AWESOME to create an in-game version of yourself, and your family!  That feature alone will keep you entertained for at least a couple of hours!Well, that's all I can think of on the great features; and, trust me, there are a LOT of good features with this system!  Still, it has it's weaknesses; and, while I don't think they're deal-breakers, each buyer should be aware of the system's limitations:1.  Questionable durability.  Though I have never tested the durability for myself, the Wii just doesn't feel the strongest; while it may be able to take a hit or two (I don't know; I've never dared to try), I wouldn't throw it on a hard surface, drop it, or hit it in any way shape or form.  Because I don't trust its durability, I never use the stand it comes with (which can make the system stand vertically) prefering, instead, to lay it down horizontally.  At least it won't fall apart the second you touch it, and it doesn't overheat easily if you follow the directions on ventilation (trust me, if it did, mine would be dead by now); but, again, no hard hits.2.  LOTS of parts.  Unlike a PS3 or an XBOX 360, which probably only come with a remote control and a few wires, the Wii has many parts: a sensor bar (for reading the motions), wireless remote controls (which can easily get lost if kept away from the system itself), and a couple of wires (for audio and visuals) all come with the package.  It's easy to forget items like the sensor bar; and, guess what, without the sensor bar you can't play as the Wii loses the ability to sense motion.  Just something to make note of.3.  The Wii remote runs on AA batteries, because it is wireless.  This means you'll throw more money down the tubes keeping the Wii remote powered in order to play.  Have some Energizer batteries handy: you'll need them.  Constant play will wear out Wii remote batteries in about two to three days (six to a week if you only play only an hour or two a day).4.  Synchronizing is needed for multiple controls.  In order to add controllers and, therefore, multiplayer gameplay, you have to do this thing called synchronizing: basically, making it so the system can sense the movement of the remote.  While I've never done it (I'm a mostly single player), the process looks confusing compared to simply plugging in the controller and starting.  Also, speaking of multiplayer, bear in mind that the system itself only comes with ONE Wii remote and ONE Nunchuk; you'll need to buy more remotes and nunchuks separately if you wish to engage in multiplayer.Conclusion: well, that's that.  The Wii IS oriented on family fun and exercise: so, get your family together and play!  However, if you're mostly a single player (like I am), don't stress: there's a lot of great things for you too!  Overall, the Wii is one of the BEST consoles of the times; and, maybe, the decade!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2009"}

Bush \"mechanical engineer\"","summary":"Marvelous execution.","reviewText":"I had every reason to hate Borderlands.  Weeks before it first hit the shelves, my annoying college roommate insisted that I watch every single trailer and webisode he could find.  He then played the game nonstop, laughing way too hard at its cheesy one-liners, then abruptly ceased playing only a couple weeks later when Modern Warfare 2 debuted.  Zoom forward two years to the present day and a friend of mine, who had already lost some credibility by recommending Dead Island to me (we both later agreed it was a flop), suggested Borderlands, which Dead Island appears to have copied (poorly).  I tentatively gave it a shot, expecting and even wanting to dislike it.  Furthermore, I generally prefer pure FPS games, not those sprinkled with RPG elements or weapons with \"stats,\" games like Rainbow 6 and Call of Duty.So after all that...I absolutely love Borderlands.  I can't get enough of the game and often put off other more important activities in order to play (lame, I know, but normally not a problem I suffer with games).  Not only do I thoroughly enjoy the gameplay mechanics, I also find the execution of details to be top-notch.  The game does have some minor flaws, but overall it is a very polished title that brings a lot to the table.What is Borderlands?  The game is set on a foreign desert planet known as Pandora, which has a very post-apocalyptic vibe.  The story follows a group of four \"vault hunters\" who have arrived on the planet to search for the legendary Vault, a hidden repository supposedly filled with advanced alien technology and weapons.  Such a vault had been found on a neighboring planet by the monolithic Atlas Corporation, placing them far ahead of their competitors in the market of weaponry, seemingly the primary commodity of the time.  Competitor Dahl Corporation set up shop on Pandora searching for the Vault, then abandoned the project after it became cost prohibitive, releasing their workforce of prison labor just in time for the planet's summer, which unleashed a variety of hostile creatures from hibernation.As a player, you can choose from one of the four vault hunters, which include a soldier, sniper, \"muscle man,\" and a spy.  Each character has unique abilities and a special \"action skill\" which suits them for different types of combat.  While the game performs like a first person shooter with a large assortment of guns and a melee skill being only a minor inclusion (like Call of Duty), there are also RPG elements included.  The game is quest-based, and experience points are gained by kills and quest completion.  As experience is gained, the player will \"Level Up,\" unlocking access to more special skills to enhance their performance.  To prevent the game from becoming too easy, enemies also level up and become more difficult to kill.  As such, weapons available for sale or looting increase in power as a player progresses.  Looting is also a primary gameplay mechanic.  Enemies drop money, health, and weapons when they die, and there are a vast assortment of \"lootable objects\" around the map which include lockers, safes, weapons chests, toilets, etc. which contain a variety of objects.  Unlike other games of this type, there are not random items to be found.  All items that aren't quest items are either weapons, shields, \"class mods\" (give a special performance boost to one of the characters), grenades, cash, or ammo.  This simplifies things and ensures that all lootable objects will contain something potentially useful.The game was largely designed to be a multiplayer experience.  Most of the game can easily be accomplished in single player mode, but some missions (especially arena matches in one of the DLC packs) benefit from additional players.  The game can be played with 1 to 4 players and offers a variety of ways to connect.  Joining the game is \"drop-in/drop-out\" meaning that one will enter the host's world wherever they are located and can then simply exit at any time.  However, if the host quits, the game returns to the menu so that the player can select their own world again.  Despite the fact that each player has their own world, they can still complete and receive XP for quests performed in a co-op game.  To prevent imbalance, all kill XP and money received is given equally to each player.  To offset the obvious ease of combat granted by additional players, enemies become more difficult in multiplayer.The game was hyped at launch for its \"random weapons generator.\"  While this sounds more exciting than it actually is, the fact remains that there are literally millions of different guns to be found.  However, these guns can be narrowed down into much smaller groups, and within those groups only vary in power, accuracy, rate of fire, magazine capacity, and special effects.  Weapons types include sniper rifles, submachine guns, combat rifles, handguns (revolvers, \"repeaters,\" and machine pistols), shotguns, rocket launchers, and special alien \"Eridian\" weapons, a flavor of the theoretical Vault contents.  Some weapons have special \"elemental\" effects, which include shock, incendiary, corrosive, and explosive, that can do further damage to certain enemies.  Though playing the game for a few hours soon reveals most of the weapons types that will be found, I can attest to the fact that even hundreds of hours later, there is still great excitement in finding some powerful or fast-firing gun that trumps the one being used at the time.As I mentioned, the details are what really cause the game to stand out after the basic gameplay tenets have been laid out.  Rather than trying for a photo-realistic appearance which would have given the game a different flavor, Gearbox aimed for a completely different feel by portraying the game like a graphic novel.  The planet of Pandora resembles a post-nuclear landscape, consisting mostly of a barren desert interspersed with vast junkyards and ramshackle corrugated metal structures.  In some of the later DLC, there is even a dried-up sea (Aral Sea, anyone?) littered with the broken remains of a vast superhighway system.  These settings combine with the graphics to really set the tone for the game.  Weapons in the game are all branded with a handful of manufacturers, each of which specialize in a certain style of weapon.  For example, the brand Maliwan always has an elemental effect.  Weapons, shields, health packs, ammo, and such are all available from vending machines scattered around the map, which feature a random jingle by the vendor when accessed.  If one leaves their character idle for too long, the character will say something derisive about the lack of activity.  The game contains a fair amount of humor, and this increases with the later DLC packs.  Some of the \"Echo recordings\" (recorded or broadcast messages from various AI characters which can be found or automatically accessed) had me laughing out loud.  The game also contains a variety of pop-culture references which add to the complexity and style.  All these small but well-thought-out additions make the game shine.Borderlands can get boring from time to time as it is \"just one quest after another,\" but the frequent combat caused by groups of enemies standing in the way of quest progress spices things up.  In addition, the drive to level up and acquire new skills, and the hopes of finding some sweet new weapon keep the game enticing.  The game can also be extremely challenging at times.  If one tries to progress on the main plot too quickly, they will soon encounter large groups of enemies who are all very difficult to kill, and this can result in repeated death (which respawns the player at the last checkpoint location and removes 7% of total money, which can be fairly devastating).  In these cases, it is best to try easier side quests until leveling up, at which point the challenge will become more reasonable.I have also experienced a few glitches from time to time.  Sometimes (rarely) my player gets stuck, which necessitates a costly death; I have also seen enemies get stuck.  I have had some errors with the map and one error which prevented me from opening lootable objects.  However, most of these issues (except getting stuck) have gone away after accessing the in-game menu.Borderlands offers great replay value in a variety of ways.  First off, completing all quests will take a considerable amount of time, and there are four DLC packs which add considerably more quests in new Pandoran locations.  Second, after the game is completed once, \"Playthrough 2\" can commence.  The player starts this new game with all their acquired skills, cash, and weapons, and as such the enemies are tougher to begin with.  Of course, the weapons are also better.  After the second playthrough, there are no more quests, but the world can still be explored, enemies can still be killed for XP, and weapons can still be found.  In addition, there are a variety of \"challenges\" (such as getting a certain number of kills with each weapon type) which yield additional XP and will take more than one playthrough to achieve.  There are also a variety of hidden achievements which can be unlocked.  Completing both playthroughs fully will take a substantial amount of time, and after all that, one can always try the game again with a different character.  Several games can also be started at once, which allows different strategies and characters to be tried.  As multiplayer games will be too easy or hard depending on the host's level, this multiple save file system can also allow for different levels of characters to be stored for ideal co-op use with different friends.Overall, Borderlands stunned me with its marvelous gameplay and execution of details.  I did not expect to like it, much less become addicted to it.  I have put in roughly equal time in single-player and in co-op with the friend who suggested it to me.  After both of us complete 2 playthroughs, we are already talking about starting all over again with different characters.  In addition, Borderlands 2 is slated for release next year...here's to hoping it lives up to the glory of the original.I definitely recommend this game to any shooter fan.  Like I said, I prefer pure FPS games, but Borderlands has me hooked.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2011"}

Borderlands offers an excellent story, along with the ability to have up to four players join in on your quest, or drop it and follow their own adventures.  My only gripe was that the ending to this game was disappointing, but after doing another playthrough and downloading the zombie content update, this franchise is really going to expand when the sequel comes out.The game plays a lot like Diablo 2, only its an FPS.  Random loot drops, you upgrade your character talents, and you have certain passive abilities unique to the person you choose to play.  Borderlands isn't a super pretty game, and its not without its flaws, but its uniqueness is in how it makes you feel like you're accomplishing something rather than just racking up kills and headshots.  Many people are turned off by this form of play, but this game opens up FPS world in a unique and witty style.The other main selling point for me was Borderlands offered the ability to play a character based on how I wanted to enjoy the game.  There are 4 classes which cater to the head-shot FPS junkies, the stealthy backstabber, to the casual gamer who would rather just beat stuff up than aim.  Even if you're a hard-core RPGer or FPSer, the genres of these two world meld together so well, it's hard not to become immersed in the storyline and looting characteristics.While Modern Warfare 2 took the advertising and hype spotlight of the holiday season, Borderlands was the word-of-mouth winner by far.  This game is how coop gamer communities are formed, and I believe is the turning of a new leaf in the FPS world.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2009"}

It's probably worth about 10 bucks.Pros:More action packed than older style resident evil games (only played the demo for 5 so I'm not sure if this deviates).More ammo but way more enemies.Some interesting design choices for enemies (a guy that turns into a bat).Some gameplay elements have been tweeked to increase replayability (if you'd ever want to play it again).Cons:Graphics gamma (brightness) is just flat out wrong for whatever reason.  If you listen to the instructions (barely visible 6) the graphics are unplayably dark.  You can adjust it after the fact but this is sort of a signal that they didn't put a lot of care into the game and design decisions.Too many quick time events (press button), too many movies.  Gameplay itself seems to be about 50% of the gameplay time which means a lot of loading times for the movies.Graphics are actually bad in my opinion.  I think resident evil revelations (a 3ds port) actually looks better which is ridiculous.  I'm playing through component cables but the models themselves look early xbox 360 grade.  I don't usually care about these things if the gameplay is good but...The gameplay is bad, the characters don't move right and the game just doesn't play great (when you actually get to play it).  Hand to hand combat is a bit too easy for a resident evil game (that's probably on purpose but it's not realistic to just knife through 13 dudes with machetes coming at you without taking a scratch).Anyway, it's an average game with some interesting design choices but overall not a GOOD game.

Third, prepare to be drafted by teams that didn't even bother to interview you. 2K has a horrible roster system.

Be sure to take time creating a character, because this character will be with you for hundreds of hours.In my first attempt, I used one of the pre-packaged character classes. While this gave me a good base character, the problem was that I had a very specific idea of how I wanted to play this game, and the character that I'd created didn't perfectly fit this style of play. As a result, even in the beginning, the game was extremely difficult, and frustrating. Advancing levels was slow, combat was overly challenging, and I spent a good deal of time staring at loading screens rather than playing the game.After reading a little about the character abilities and descriptions, I realized that I was missing certain features that I would need, to play the game the way I had intended (as a Rogue-Mage). By starting over again, I was able to use the knowledge I'd gained to create a new, better-suited character. The game changed dramatically.With this new character, levelling up was easier, I could do all the things that I wanted to do, and see the character improving at them. This changed the dynamics of the game completely. I could now explore this huge world with less fear of constant death, I could advance in the guilds I'd chosen to join, because my abilities were better suited.While Morrowind has some in-game problems (framerate jitters, an abundance of \"fetch\" quests), by far the biggest problem is the lack of documentation, and a lack of direction for novice players. If you know what you're getting into is a huge, open-ended role playing game, in which you can do virtually anything, from slaughter entire villages, to spend all day making healing potions, or bribing the local townsfolk, then Morrowind will *definitely* satisfy.But be sure this is what you want, or you'll quickly find yourself in over your head.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2002"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYY5E","description":"","reviewerName":"Bowman373","summary":"Wow.","reviewText":"This game is amazing. A fun campaign, a great score, and spectacular graphics make Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary one of the best games of 2011. I'll put the different parts into sections, as can be seen below:CAMPAIGN: (no spoilers)The campaign of HCEA is great. You have about 10 missions, which are very fun and somewhat long. The addition of skulls was a great one, as well as the Terminals. Like Halo 3, you have to find the skulls in the campaign, and all are not unlocked by default like Halo Reach. You cannot use some of the weapons, like the Energy Sword or Fuel Rod Gun. In this game, the Shotgun and Pistol are much more powerful than in previous installments. The pistol is so overpowered that one shot to the exposed back of a hunter is a kill, no matter what difficulty it is (you're welcome)! I'd say that the campaign is about 10 hours to complete, and that doesn't include replays to collect all the skulls and terminals and to complete it on a higher difficulty. The music in the campaign, originally written by Martin O'Donnell, is one of the best in any videogame. And if you're wondering how much of a difference graphics-wise this game is to the original 10 years ago, hit the back button to enter Classic mode, where you can play the game the exact same way, but with the original graphics. And for those of you with a Kinect, you can give basic voice commands to your character, such as \"Grenade\" or \"Reload\". You can also use the Halo Library, which allows you to scan various items and look them up at the main menu.MULTIPLAYER:Fans may be disappointed to know that Halo CEA's multiplayer is the same as Reach's multiplayer, just different maps. The game comes with a free download code for the Anniversary Map Pack, which includes all 7 CE maps along with one Firefight map (more on that later). So if you have Reach, you can install the map pack for free and play it on that disc. If not, you'll only have the Anniversary maps that are only playable on the Anniversary disc. I have not played all of the maps yet, but I am pleased with my experience so far.FIREFIGHT:If you do not know, Firefight is a game mode in which you fight off wave after wave of enemies until all lives are lost or the time limit is reached. The new Firefight map, Installation 04, is probably my favorite so far. It is a medium-sized map, mainly focused on a Forerunner structure on one of the Halos. A new addition to this map is the assistance of ODSTs, elite marines fighting with you. They do not help you very much, and die very easily. You start out with a Warthog and Mongoose, which respawn every round. This map, along with pretty much every Firefight map, is more fun with friends.Would I recommend this game to a friend?

A. Balbin Jr. \"Mr.  Facts\"","summary":"almost perfect!!!!!  ( spoilers below)","reviewText":"i noticed that several people gave this game 1 or 2 stars, it really doesn't deserve that. its one of the greatest games outhere. graphicalwise its the best, no doubt. the rain & lighting, , & the sound overall effects are awesome. the framerate is sweet, & the open-world feeling is perfect. its as  horrific as being inside a war, specially at the beginning on campaing mode when you experience being the president...driven all the way to your execution deathpole, while being filmed on tv AND THEN BEING SHOT!!!! REMEMBER!! your'e in first person view, so its even more disturbing!!! first time i see this on a war game...thats creepy, too realistic for a videogame, it really takes you to the horror and makes you appreciatte what our soldiers go thru in the middle east. this is not a rambo or commando like videogame ,where you always prevail, in this game, the enemy dont give a rat's a#*  who you are. they will team on you, hunt you down, and give you a bulletbath. the way its supposed to be. real fighting.why i dont give this a 5???????- the impact of the bullets are too arcade: they really dont go with the realism of the game, i though i was playing, typing of the dead or something. i shot the enemy many times and no extra blood, no nothing, they just blink a little bit....( that sucks)..- on single campaign, you almost dont have to anything ( just run): yup, the team does all the fighting for you, its almost like they dont let you or they don't want you to take a piece of the pie, always hogging over your targets like ( NO, MAN THATS MY TARGET, GET LOST , YOU SUCK!!!!!) that type of thing..its annoying, and it really makes you wanna go back to the rambolike games, where you kill everything that moves..( oh some ducks in the air, let me shoot em and get some health & the spread gun!!!!) ;)- too short for single campaign: it is what it is, too short. a little 5-7 extra hours on campaing would have been great..if you skip or ignore all of this -, then the game is perfect.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2008"}

Romano \"Avid Gamer\"","summary":"Call of Duty 4 Is Destined To Be A Classic!","reviewText":"Call of Duty 4 is by far one of the best games to come out this year for any console or PC platform. The game is even better than any action movie that has come out to local movie theaters this year. The game is just slightly better than Halo 3 which up to this time was one of my favorite games to come out this year. Now my review is based on the single player portion of the game only.There is no comparison between Call of Duty 4 and Medal of Honor: Airborne as far as which is a better game to play. Medal of Honor: Airborne has just six missions to play through and that's it. I am not making that up. Medal of Honor: Airborne takes place during World War II with American Airborne soldiers fighting the Axis throughout Europe during the war. The first four missions in Medal of Honor: Airborne are very realistic. The last two missions are like made up fantasy missions where you are fighting Super Nazi Soldiers that take forever to kill. Call of Duty 4 is a ten times better game to play than Medal of Honor: Airborne.I could tell from the very first minute that I started to play Call of Duty 4 just how great a game it was going to be. The graphics in the game are just simply amazing. They are by far the best graphics I have ever seen in any game except for Crysis. Crysis is the game to beat as far as graphics go.The very first mission in the game takes place on a Russian freighter out in the middle of the ocean where you play the role of a British soldier fighting Russian terrorists aboard ship at night in stormy weather. Just to look at the water come up against the ship is amazing. I just had to stop to look at the huge ocean waves hitting the sides of the ship. I couldn't believe how real the ocean waves look hitting the sides of the ship.In another mission, I play the role of an American Marine fighting terrorists in the middle of a Middle Eastern city. My character, along with some fellow American Marine soldiers, are supporting an American tank going through the middle of this city. Well an enemy tank approachs us and the American tank you are supporting fires a round from the tank's main gun at the enemy tank. The enemy tank gets hit and explodes and the turret on the enemy tank flies off into the air. It was one best looking explosions I have ever seen in a game.In another mission in Russia you are again playing the role of the British soldier. An enemy helicopter follows you around at night with a big searchlight trying to find you and some fellow British soldiers. Why you are trying to avoid being detected by the enemy helicopter, you get attacked by some enemy German Shepherd dogs that are the most realistic dogs I have ever seen in a game. The dogs look very real.Call of Duty 4 reminds me a lot of what is going on today with the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan today. The game makes me proud of our American soldiers who are serving over in Iraq and Afghanistan today. You learn to appreciate more our men and women in uniform and all the sacifices they are making today for our freedoms. This game should definitely be added to your collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2007"}
