Fireball!!!!!!!!!","reviewText":"This is the best JRPG I've played since Trails in the Sky trilogy.  I think the game could have been a little better:(1) In the second half, the story could have been a little tighter.(2) There is not much character development and growth.  Throughout the game Yuri remains cool, Rita hotheaded, Estelle naive and polite, etc, etc.(3) The battle system is not balanced or challenging.  You can quickly grind Rita's fireball in the desert.  Once the usage count reaches 3500 you can fire 10 or 11 fireballs with high accuracy.  Most battles after that is a cakewalk.(4) The game's theme is \"justice\" but the story is completely linear.  Yuri made some debatable choices about justice.  I wish there were selectable dialogues, branching story lines, and different endings based on your choices.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"John Hoffman","summary":"not as good as I remember, but brings me back!","reviewText":"I still am mad at my dad for selling my N64 back in 2002 to a guy in germany, but theyre the cheapest game console I can think of today that is still graphically holds up.game selection 7/10, 386 games is nowhere near colse as the PS1, but alot of 3D games that you loved on the SNES come on here! mario, zelda, FZero, Metroid, DOOM 64 are all on here!Controller 6/10 IDK wat nintendo was thinking with this, alot of game controls need alot of getting used to, like 2 D-pads & a analog stick? do ya think thats enough?! and its not the most conftorable thing to hold, and the rumble paks do make it significantly heavier then say saturn or PS1 controllers, but it does make 3D games more natural to controli really dont get Y they went with cartridges, I mean I love them, but audio & video is almost completely non existant on here, music loops kinda short, the cutscenes are used with polygons instead of CG, but load times are only 2 seconds!now getting one today is easy, since alot of games were made for it, and they wont break, but it kinda feels olde then it looks, always get one with a memory expansion pak! the jumper pak gives the framerate slower then it should","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2014"}
{"product_name":"B001IK1BJ0","reviewerName":"mkllby","summary":"Best RPG in YEARS!!!!","reviewText":"Okay, I typically try not to review a game until I have completely played through it but as I set here at work I can not get this game out of my mind. I have only played about 6-7 hours and I find myself so caught up in the story that I literally dreamed about the game last night. While I do not think this reaches the hieghts of the story from KOTOR (at least not yet for me) this is definitely the most interest I have had in a video game and its story since KOTOR.This doesn't mean the game is flawless. At first I did find the grapics a bit of a let down. Some people and some scenes literally look like the concept art pictures that are released as a game is being developed. For a company that developed the flawless lifelike graphics in Mass Effect, I did find this a bit of a let down. I mean the pine trees off in the distance are literally triangles on sticks with absolutely zero depth. You'll definitely not find yourself standing there looking around the world taking in all the scenary as I did many times in Oblivion. With that said however, beyond the those far away trees and things the graphics are pretty decent overall. Again not Bioware's finest work, but definitely good overall.As for the bugs I have seen in other peoples' review. I haven't experienced too many. Once time while talking to someone my guy kept swaying back and forth as if he were still walking and I admit it did annoy me, but it only happened once though in hours of gameplay.If you enjoy a video game with a great story and your are like me and actually enjoy the stories and conversations of the characters with in a game, you will no doubt love this game. If you are more of an FPS/action game person, this probably isn't a game you will enjoy as the focus isn't really on the combat as muchas the story and characters. For and RPG though, so far I think this is better than anything anyone, even  Bioware, has put out in many years. Is it flawless in every way? No. However, the few minor flaws can be easily forgiven and forgotten once the game and story captures your attention and imagination and keeps you longing for more.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2009"}

More than just a cutting-edge game system, Xbox 360 also integrates high-definition video, DVD movie playback, digital music, photos, and online connectivity into one sleek, small tower, and in the process puts true Next-Gen power right at your fingertips.Xbox 360, shown with wireless controller, is a sleek, customizable gaming and entertainment systemUnder the HoodXbox 360 is much smaller than its predecessor--it measures approximately 3.3 by 12.2 by 10.2 inches and weighs 7.7 lbs. It's powered by custom IBM PowerPC-based CPU with three symmetrical cores each running at 3.2 GHz. It also carries a custom ATI graphics processor loaded with 10 MB of embedded DRAM, 48-way parallel floating-point dynamically scheduled shader pipelines and Unified shader architecture. This is powerful enough to draw 500 million triangles per second. In other words, it makes for great looking games in standard TV definition, and even better thanks to built-in support for HDTV 1080i televisions. It also supports the widescreen 16:9 format.The unit has a 12x dual-layer DVD-ROM drive, which plays both the game media and progressive-scan DVD movies right out of the box. For game-save and media storage, users can choose between the detachable and upgradeable 20GB hard drive, or a separately sold 64MB flash Memory Unit. Along with storing files, the hard drive will make the Xbox 360 backward-compatible with part of the existing Xbox game library.Control your GameplayXbox 360 uses a refined button layout for its controllers. Back and Start buttons sit at the center of the controller and between them is a new Xbox Guide button, which instantly takes the user to the Xbox 360 user interface. From there, they can check for friends online, access personal digital content like photos and songs, and more. The black and white buttons of the first Xbox controllers have been replaced with new shoulder buttons placed above the left and right triggers. Xbox 360 can accommodate up to four wireless controllers and has three USB 2.0 slots to use for wired controllers or for streaming your digital media from digital cameras, MP3 players, and any Windows XP-based PC. Microsoft has also created a video-conferencing camera, sold separately, that will work with the system.Xbox 360 can manage your games, your online friends, and your personal digital libraryThe Media ExperienceAll Xbox 360 titles can be played in either standard or high-definition resolution in 16:9 widescreen, with anti-aliasing for smoother graphics. Game designers will be able to take advantage of the system's multi-channel surround sound. The Xbox 360's digital media allows users to supplement any game's music from tracks in their own personal library.Go LiveA built-in Ethernet port allows users to connect their system to a broadband connection for access to Xbox Live. The Xbox Live Silver Membership included with the console lets anyone create a Gamertag and gamer card to express your online identity, chat live with voice chat, and connect to the Xbox Live Marketplace to buy expansions, maps, and other digital items for your games. You can also update to aXbox Live Gold Membershipat anytime for even more benefits.

Many of these games can now be purchased for as low as $19.99.  My little brother loves playing Viva Pinata!  I have been enjoying epic games like Gears of War, Bioshock and Halo 3. The disk drive is very quiet.  Microsoft's online newtwork (XBOX LIVE) simply cannot be beat. I am also greatly looking forward to the release of the blockbuster Christmas game titles.

It was very ergonomic, but it had a number of shortfalls that finally added up and it was time to replace it. So, when I decided that I needed a new mouse, what I did not like about my old mouse sure weighted a lot in making my final choice.IF TRUTH BE TOLD, PC GAMING CAN ONLY MEAN A WIRED MOUSEMy old (wireless) mouse could loose its connection (and was then slow in responding or turned unresponsive until reset) if the receiver was not in direct visual contact with it. Moreover, there are a lot of negative reviews about rechargeable mice (such as theG700), so my next mouse could only be a wired one.The G500 comes with an ample length of sturdy yet flexible USB cord - and the fact that it is also braided is a nice touch. Plug it in and forget about it for as long as you keep using it. No batteries to replace or recharge, no receiver to keep changing position. Technology is supposed to make our lives simpler, right?ERGONOMICS GET A B+I was used to the much taller MS mouse so the G500 feels too flat. That may be a matter of preference and something one has to get used to. However, with my old MS mouse the angle my wrist was resting at felt much more natural and my wrist was much less strained after some hours of computer use. Apparently Logitech addressed this in its latest G700.Another issue I am having with the G500 is the BACK side-button which I keep hitting whenever I move the mouse to the right. I did find a partial solution to this by varying the weights and selecting the lighter ones for the left side (although the same can be achieved by completely removing the weight tray).Having said that, the wheel-release and the DPI-level buttons are perfectly placed. Also, the two settings for the scroll-wheel are a very nice feature.AESTHETICSI like the way the red DPI-level lights and the scrolling wheel look as well as the texture of the braided cord.On the other hand, the actual back surface looks nothing like the metallic looking one in the product description picture! It is plastic and its looks exactly that. I would also preferred it to be solid black instead of the two-tone sprinkled gray (again, something remedied in the G700).ENGINEERED WEAK POINTS?This is something I came to realize over the years: companies now seem to actually engineer weak points into their products, to ensure their replacement some time down the road. With my old MS mouse it was the silicone-based surfaces that would become impossible to clean after 12-16 months. The G500 has solid plastic surfaces that may not be the most pleasant thing to touch but they are easy to clean.Some fellow reviewers complain about the durability of the scroll-wheel, so this may be it. After about a couple of months of use I had no problems whatsoever - but I promise to update this point of my review if similar problems occur.DIVERT ALL NON-ESSENTIAL POWER TO THE PORT-SIDE LASERS!The G500 is equipped with a \"gaming-grade laser\" (I do not know what that is, however, my MS mouse used to cause the cursor to drift for no reason whereas my G500 is solid like a rock) and it has a DPI range from 200 to 5700. The DPI setting can be adjusted on the fly. This is important because the mouse is programmable and can be customized into numerous Profiles (via its software) but it can only store one profile at a time. No matter, adjusting the DPI is what makes all the difference in the world.THREE IMPORTANT THINGS: SOFTWARE, SOFTWARE, SOFTWAREThis is where the G500 redeems most of its shortcomings: the accompanying software works like a charm.Anyone who ever used a MS mouse can tell you this: the IntelliPoint software that comes with it is a pain to use and a hassle to avoid conflicts with. Using the LOGITECH SetPoint instead was a breeze of fresh air!Within a pleasant yet not fancy visual interface, simple and clear adjustments can be made to customize the mouse to your needs.Overall, although not perfect, this may be the best mouse available to gamers today. Its in-house competition, the G700, does come with better ergonomics and a more pleasant color but wireless technology and rechargeable batteries do not seem just ready yet.RECOMMENDED!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00000DMAX","description":"Mario Kart 64, one of the first games released for the Nintendo 64  platform, is an updated translation of the very popularSuper Mario Kartfor the  Super NES (SNES). And while the game clearly takes full advantage of the graphics  power and speed of the N64, a few components that made the original so compelling  have been left out of this release.Still, Nintendo's expertise at sucking players into the game world is strongly evident, andMario Kart 64offers enough challenges to keep players (especially casual  gamers) entertained. Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a  sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race  computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks.  Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting  power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels.  Grabbing and using on-track items is the heart of the game's fun: a strategically-placed  banana peel sends the unlucky victim into a spin, nailing an opponent with a turtle shell  launches their vehicle skyward, and a rocket provides a quick boost to near-breakneck  speeds, if only for a moment.The multiplayer mode provides enormously chaotic fun for up to four players--flip it on  at a party and watch the guests congregate around the screen.--Eric TwelkerPros:Well-designed tracksSimple controlsStrong multiplayer appealCons:Computerized opponents sometimes pull off questionable feats","reviewerName":"Flmarlinsrule \"Marlinsfan13\"","summary":"A+","reviewText":"It's a classic, anyone that has a N64 should have this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles.

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants.

I got it because I just got through with Mass Effect and loved that game. Well the folks who did Mass Effect for the most part also had a hand in making this Star Wars game, Knights of the Old Republic.I'll make this short, because I think some people need to know just how flipping boring this game is. The dialogue is okay. You have to read it, and there is no actual speach. I can live with that, especially since this game did come out a few years back.However, the action sequences are left the game found wanting. You press a button, and watch your characters do all the work. \"Wow. That's it?!\" Is what I thought to myself. I'm not much of an RPG guy, but when I hear the words \"ACTION\" and \"FUN TO PLAY\" associated with it, I tend to think their might be some challenging action scenes to go along with a game with story line. You know, something like Deus Ex, or Mass Effect. Heck, even the Final Fantasy guys get it right year after year. I say all of that, so I don't get people flaming me saying I just don't like RPGs. I do like RPGs, just the good ones.I felt like I was being spoon fed everything to continue on with the game. It wasn't challenging at all. I had to quit after playing this game for about an hour. I kept telling myself it will get better, and it never did.Sorry folks, but Star Wars games like the X-Wing/Tie Fighter series, Dark Forces/Jedi Knight series, and even the Rebel Assault games were better than this crap.You want a good RPG from Bioware? Play Mass Effect. You want a good RPG period? Play Lost Odyssey, or Diablo, or Titan's Quest, or the Elder Scrolls series, or the Fallout series, or Final Fantasy.

{"product_name":"B001AWIP68","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Another great side step from Treyarch","reviewText":"The Good: Amazing cinemtic graphics, great sound and voice acting, new weapons, JAPAN!!!, great multiplayer still intactThe Bad: It ends, everything else is still too familiarCall of Duty is probably THE best WWII FPS series ever made and there are many reasons why. If you rewind back about six years Call of Duty was released on the PC and console gamers envied this exclusivity. CoD offered cinematic game play, great characters, and amazing visuals. At the time Medal of Honor reigned supreme, but not for very long. With Medal of Honor, Brothers in Arms, and Wolfenstein being the top competitive WWII FPS games CoD always remained on top. With each new sequel CoD added better graphics, a more realistic, cinematic experience, and overall great multiplayer. Throughout CoD's six year life cycle Activision has used many developers to keep the series going strong, and it was also the first WWII series to stray away from WWII and lean towards modern warfare (no pun intended really!). Now that CoD is back on the WWII front line is finally hit the nail on the head and this is what CoD should have been years ago...World at War.I thank the WWII Gods that listened because we finally for the FIRST FREAKING TIME get to go through the trials and campaign of Japan and not just the bombing of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. The game starts out in the jungles of Japan with banzais rushing after you with bayonets, strange rifles never seen before in a WWII game, amazing visuals (slightly updated Modern Warfare engine to be exact), great enemy AI, and just absolute mayhem. The first thing I noticed were the new weapons. Yes you have the Kar98, MP40, Thompson, BAR, MG42, Springfield, Enfield etc. What I picked up was an Arisaka, a variation of the Kar98, a flamethrower?!, a bayonet?!, the ability to toss mortor heads like genades, molotovs?...insane. I couldn't believe this. Someone actually added something NEW. Not only are the graphics amazing and extremely cinematic, but the level design is awesome. There are cool sniping missions (think of the one in MW), tank missions (they drive great for once by the way), and missions where you run through Japanese mortor pits and just torch the hell out of EVERYONE. How fun is that? Well, let's just say it's so fun you won't want to use another weapon during those levels.You don't just fight in Japan though you also fight on the European front as the Russians over taking the Reichstag all the way to planting the flag yourself. If this isn't enough to sell you try out the air mission where you're shooting down Japanese boats and pulling in survivors of the Pearl Harbor bombing on your way back home from Japan. If that's not exciting enough...oh boy I don't know what is.What makes the return to WWII so great isn't just the new content, or the cinematic game play. Its the detail put into the level design, the characters, the ambiance, the dialog, the voice acting it is all top notch and not even the first CoD had this much detail put into it. After playing WaW you will WANT more WWII games and this is the revival we've all been dying for (sorry MoH Airborne was TERRIBLE). If the singly player isn't enough to sell you how about multi player?While I didn't get to try it I was involved in the beta multi player and it was pretty amazing. It's just like Modern Warfare, but set in WWII instead. There's plenty of incentive to go back and play the game again thanks to its fair difficulty and amazing visual experience. World at War has so much detail put into it I wouldn't be surprised to see another MoH, BiA, or Wolfenstein copy any of it. Thank you Treyarch and Activision for reviving this great series...now everyone shut up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Deans \"Shadow\"","summary":"The Untold Story","reviewText":"Well This game i bought first day it came out and have been to busy reliving the, short but well told, story.  Game has the same halo aspect but it plays differently.  Most people were worried on how the game plays especially without overshield.  Well its true you dont have overshield you have a stamina bar.  Runs just like an overshield and recharges like one.  As you get shot the screen gets a darker and darker red tint untill you get safe and let your stamina recharge.  As for stealth there really isnt much of that.  Typical run in guns flaring and hope a hunter isnt around the corner.Firefight is simply amazing.  Kill wave after wave of stuff.  No hard missions just kill and dont die.  VERY time consuming.  Achievements can take a very long time on low difficulties.  No matchmaking though is a pretty big fail on the makers part.  Most of us hope a patch comes to replace that in the future. Also another BIG issue is only 2 people can play on one xbox.All multiplayer maps on a second disk is great.  No more cluttered up xbox with downloaded maps.Overall 4/5 stars it looses a star for short campaign and no matchmaking in firefight.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2009"}

Compare to games (shooters mainly) that come out these days, Halo ODST was a pretty good game; however, IT DIDNOT LIVE UP TO THE EXPECTATIONS.PROS:-INTERESTING MODE ON CAMPAIGN: Campaign is different than what you have experienced in Halo 1-3. As you know master chief is not the main character, but instead it is the ODST special squad troop(s). The  way they have conveyed the story provides you with a unique experience. Unfortunately, I can't describe it more without spoiling it so I will stop here.-ONLINE FIREFLIGHT MODE: This to me was the biggest reason to buy the game. However, you can only make full use of it if you have friends on Xbox live. You and your friends competing against hordes of enemies can be really fun. And enemies in Halo games as we know have the BEST AI. Love it just love it.-GREAT GRAPHICS: Like Halo 3 it has pretty awesome graphics so not much to talk about here.-FEW NEW WEAPONS: Loved the missle launcher. Keep them coming.CONS:-VERY WEAK STORY: The story frankly was very unsatisfying (EVEN AFTER UNLOCKING ALL THE MESSAGES). Again, can't describe without spoiling the content. The ending was simply HORRIBLE (Both the last fight and the story ending)-VERY WEAK CHARACTERS: I am not talking weak as if they are not Spartans like Master Chief and so they are weak. The voice acting was horrible. Master Chief speaks less, but he makes his words count. These human characters just felt stupid and their dialogues were very POORLY WRITTEN. Terrible voice acting didn't help either..-NO DUAL WEAPONS: WHAT THE HELL????-ONLINE MODE SAME AS HALO3: This actually leads me to my concluding remark.I truly think ODST was initially designed as an expansion pack for Halo 3, but I think they wanted to milk the Halo franchise so they sold it for $60 by adding few useless stuff. Each installment of Halo came with awesome new stuff, ODST on the other hand was A SMALL STEP BACK.I would give it less stars, but got it for $30 from amazon which I think is a good price for this HALO 3 INSTALLMENT.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2010"}

I decided to give in (perhaps inspired by seeing a card at gamestop where you can buy and get the down-loadable copy of the game) and i ended up buyin the game on battle.net in hopes to play it when it launched just to be part of the \"launch experience\" so to speak. So i download the game.  the installer had a few issues but did finally download the entire game before the servers went live at 3am EST.at about 3:02am i try to log in.  error....about 4:20am after a few tries i try again. same error.  During the cataclysm launch i was able to get into WoW after 5 mins after it launched.. so i have to say i was a bit down on the fact i coudnt get in right away.  But decided to just go to sleepthat following afternoon i try to log in again, it takes a while. i get to make a charecter and i tried a multiplayer game to start with. was able to get in for a moment. then decided to go to singeplayer so started a new charecter. ...then i got more errors.  Turns out during that time they were fixing some server issues so.  after an hour or so later. I was able to play with no problems at all.  no crashes, no disconnects...The game itself is pretty good. Not perfect but its nice to have a bit of old school gaming. i have motion issues and the fixed camera view works well for me though i wish you could zoom in with mouse wheel instead of using Z button. oh well.  another issue i have is the UI font size at 720p is wayyy too small.also notice some auction house loading glitchesbut other then tha game seem sto run fine on my PC .. simple controls fun to play.. and explore. i like how it seems every npc text is voice acted. granted i agree some of the voice acting isnt the best.  but its a nice change like from WoW to have actual voice overs.I am glad i got the game for the experence of having diablo as i really didnt play much of the first two games.graphics could be a tad better but i suppose they were going for that old school feel.i will say this if you dont have a lot of money you might want to hold out on this and get torchlight 2 instead (only 20 bucks) but if you have the money go for it.as long as your not overly critical i think its a quite fun game and glad i got it.  Hope some patches will fix some of the issues like some problems with AH items loading an easier search text feature and better fonts.but i will say this. its way better then Starcraft 2 in my opinion :-)some of the reviews here are a bit negitive. yes be aware you will have to have always on internet. which can suck if you dont alway shave internet.  so keep that in mind before buying.but i kind of like the feature as it keeps you from wanting to cheat and so makes it feel more legit.

S. Hillis","summary":"Awesome graphics, solid gameplay, good fun","reviewText":"I'm having great fun with this game despite running it on a mediocre system that can't run the game in full graphical flourish. I have a 2.0Ghz P4, 512Mb RAM and an ATI 9800 (the base model, not Pro or XT) card with 128Mb RAM. So it's decent but hardly cutting edge.Despite the fact that of the eight customizable graphics settings, I have set four to &quot;medium&quot; and four to &quot;low&quot;, the graphics are simply the best I've ever seen, on any game at any time. The sky looks absolutely real, the water has noticeable depth and shimmer, and the foliage is lush and crisp. The character models are great -- muscles bulge, clothing wrinkles, and blood sprays in a most vivid fasion. This game alone makes me want to shell out a few thousand for a bleeding-edge system.The game play is quite solid first-person shooter fare. There are no huge breakthroughs, though there are nice details like a stamina meter for running and holding your breath. The weapons selection is nice -- enough variety to keep you interested but not so broad that there is much overlap. The voice acting is a model of over-the-top action cheesiness, and the bad guys shout their lines with such enthusiastic machismo that you have to laugh. Fun stuff.The only gripe I have at this point is weak online play. Much of this is no doubt to my location in Asia, which leads to some horrible ping. But it seems I am not alone in thinking the multiplayer needs a bit of tweaking. I guess there is a patch coming out in June that will hopefully resolve some of these issues.Bottom line: Top-notch job on graphics and setting inject fresh life into the FPS genre. Well worth it, even if your system has to make compromises.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2004"}

The quality and fun factor of this game gets drastically higher when even 1 or 2 human players join in the game with you. If you play with friends it is even more enjoyable. The game does a good job of getting you started playing solo with the challenges and videos but as soon as you start playing with other people you see the quality shine through. The character customization is really a big focus and a lot of fun. Everyone can find something they like. If you played this game for an hour or two and put it down out of frustration I understand because it is tough to play solo....but you really missed out on something special and one of the best multiplayer games to come out in awhile.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2011"}

Back in the 90s Duke NuKem was funny and different when you compare to what was out at the time. If this game came out three years after the original Duke Nukem 3D then it may have been a big hit, but sadly this old horse needed to be left out in the pasture.I only paid $5 bucks for it, so it wasn't bad for that price, but the game felt old and played like a 90s FPS and should have been released on the PS2 or Xbox. The interaction with the environment which made the original Duke Nukem 3D so fun was poorly done in Duke Nukem Forever. Playing air hockey was laughable bad.  Is peeing in the bathroom and throwing poo supposed to be funny?Maybe some pre-teens would like this game because of the half-naked women in this game. They even have a level where Duke needs to find items for a striper so she would have a private dance for him?  This level service no propose but for pre-teens fantasy.Bottom line the original Duke Nukem 3D was funnier and better then Duke Nukem Forever. But for only $5 bucks it isn't a bad deal, but don't think this is the same Duke Nukem you knew and love back in the day, because sometime we should leave the past behind.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2013"}

Befriending the people in town is the key to successfully completing your task. This is the first Harvest Moon title to be in a true 3-D environment. It looks much more realistic without losing the cute animation style for which the series is known.There are 20 new characters--each with his or her own unique personality--richly detailed 3-D environments, and enhanced interaction with animals, including dog training and horse racing.

Do you have what it takes to defeat the deadliest warriors in the universe in order to possess the awesome power of the Soul Calibur?  Are your mental and physical skills up to the challenge of facing other warrior-wannabes in online play?If so, then I highly recommend that you purchase this game.  One play-through and your soul will be changed forever.  Complete the missions, and you will be on your way to becoming a TRUE WARRIOR!Ok, enough of the corny stuff.  Soul Calibur IV is an awesome game.  For solitary players, it offers the following adventures.  Story, Tower of Lost Souls, and Arcade.  The Story mode is similar to what we've known over the years.  Each fighter goes through his or her unique story, fight battles, and then reach their own unique story ending.  Arcade should also be familiar to most soul calibur veterans.  Basically, you pick your fighter and fight through stages until you battle The Apprentice.  Upon beating The Apprentice, which is easier said than done, you get to fight this strange guy (strange, even by SC standards!) called Algol.  Algol reminds me of Necrid from SC2.  Tower of Lost Souls is an advanced stage.  Basically, you want to be very comfortable with your chosen characters' move sets before you set out for the Tower.  I suggest that you play through Story and Arcade modes with your favorite/created characters before going to the Tower.  You want to be able to use helpful skills, as well as the best weapons, in order to play through the Tower.  The weapons can be expensive to purchase.  Hence, the need to play for cash first.  Tower of Lost Souls is somewhat similar to Weapon Master from SC2.  Basically, you play against the CPU.Character Creation is back!  This time, your model will look like one of the main characters in the game.  You can outfit your model with armors, head gear, etc.  You can even strip Sophitia and the other ladies down to their bikini, if you want!  Bear in mind though that although that's eye candy, leaving your character without armor will lower their stats.  In SC4, the armor affects the character stats.Are the characters \"balanced\", in terms of fighting effectiveness in versus play?  From what I have seen so far, they seem to be.  My experience in Versus play is limited though.  Does the CPU play fair in single player mode?  Ofcourse not, this is Soul Calibur!  Fight The Apprentice in Arcade and  you will see how this works against you.  Even a good Soul fighter will find themselves repeatedly off-axis.  A lot of your moves, especially vertical ones, will miss.  However, The Apprentice will usually be on-axis.  And he can pull together a long string of moves that is very, very hard to interrupt.  I found that a character like Amy, with her 4B is much better against this guy than say, Sophitia.  But that's just my style of play, perhaps.  Using a player with hard to pull combos, like Ivy, required me to use a lot of throws just to beat The Apprentice.  But I lost many, many more battles against this guy than I won.I have always been a fan of Namco-Bandai.  They seem to release games that appeal to me.  From Xenosaga, Baten Katos, Eternal Sonata, Tekken, and all the way to the Soul Calibur series.  They have a way of making even the characters in a fighting game very endearing.Yoda or Darth Vader?  I have the XBox version of the game, so I get Yoda with my edition.  Yoda is fun to play, however, I have read other reviews from people who have both PS3 and XB360 versions of the game that say they prefer Darth Vader on the PS3.  I do not have the PS3 version, but let me just say that for fighting games, I prefer the playstation controller to the 360 controller.  I have SC2 in PS2 and Xbox versions.  I much prefer playing the PS2 version due to the design of the PS controller.  But that's just a personal preferrence on my part.To sum up, this is a great game.  SC4 is more technical, and the move sets are a lot deeper than in previous versions of the game.  I believe you could play this game for a year, and still find ways to improve your game during the second year.  And maybe beyond.  The replay value is endless.  And if you are very technical and enjoy complication, you will just simply love Ivy.  If you thought her move list was extensive in SC3, think again.  Learning how to pull off Summon Suffering is a major hobby unto itself!  Yeah, I love Soul Calibur!  I believe you will also.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2008"}

This is due probably to the change in companies who produced the game.Compared to Call of Duty 2, COD3 feels like it comes from a different franchise.  About the only similarities with the original are the same controls, map, and grenade detection.  The graphics are neither superior nor inferior to Call of Duty 2, but the weapons are completely re-done, and have new sounds to them altogether.The missions do feel less stimulating, focused more on following the obvious terrain design to go and kill more Nazis, and occasionally get into contests over your rifle with them, in which you must press buttons back and forth to overpower them.Multiplayer is much more frustrating here than in COD2, as a new weapon can be picked, a rocket launcher, and vehicles can be used.  This leads to people immediately going for tanks, and proceeding to make the map hell on others either not quick enough to destroy the tanks, or feel that a game based on infantry battles should maybe be fought with infantry, and not exclusively in tanks.Also adding to multiplayer difficulty is the new sniper scope.  Some of the positive reviewers complain that the sniper scopes in Call of Duty 2 make the sniper rifle into something of a superweapon, with flawless aim and one-hit kills.  I disagree entirely in that while it is easy to master, it's also easy to counter, and Call of Duty 3 disrupts this balance by not retaining the old sniper scope system, and not bothering to design a new sniper scope system.  Instead, they retain the same sniper scope for ALL sniper rifles, and make it so not only does it wobble far more than in Call of Duty 2, but after letting out your breath from holding it in, your scope flies wildly out of place for no real reason, and takes a moment to re-align.On a plus side, rather than dwell in the same territory as other World War II games, you get to play as Polish and Canadian troops.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2008"}

I have nintendo land, mario u, zombiu, and batman. All look great. The only reason I give wii u 4 stars is because I fear it will likely not stand up to the next round by Sony and MS. It should initially show some sparks to indicate it has the superior horsepower but it shows nothing of the kind. It is right on par with current generation. Many argue it's the first round of games but still, it should be able to show more promise than this. I think Nintendo better get a hefty installment base before Sony and MS come out next. THe other things I don't like is the meager 8gb harddrive. By todays standards that is laughable. Yes, I can, and will have to get a usb drive for saves/downloads. And the lack of headset port is also not smart.  Bottom line, the wii u is fun. It has great features and I have no regrets buying it.

This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving.

With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.'

It's one ugly town, making you wonder why the resistance wants to liberate it, as there's nothing there worth saving. Perhaps those dastardly Nazis are going to bulldoze the town to create the world's biggest Wal-mart.While the world around you is not really worth saving, the bad guys inhabiting it will do their best to torment you. While the majority pose as much challenge as a damp washcloth, some will occasionally make you work for your kill, such as the heavy troopers. But unfortunately, Wolfenstein excels at creating some of the most flat out annoying enemies in the history of the universe. The assassins and mages are so freaking annoying, both in how they can screw you over in seconds, and with their irritating voices. If I have to hear another bald mage babble gibberish in a ridiculously deep voice, or hear another invisible assassin giggling and asking if I can see him, I'm going to scream. Leather clad nazimatrixses are just as bad, but they also have the annoying trait of sprinting up on you with no warning whatsoever, or in the case of a truly wretched boss fight in a hanger, summon multiple undead ghost skeletons (Save me John Freeman!) that are extremely difficult to kill. And those jetpack nazis with twin grenade launchers? You'll want to grab the guy who designed them and turn him into a smoldering skeleton with your Leichenfaust 44.This is one of the game's biggest problems...the most powerful enemies will often come out of NOWHERE and literally stab you in the back, giving you no warning whatsoever. It is horribly common in the second half of the game to be jogging along and suddenly BAM, you're lying on the ground while a giggling assassin, nazimatrix, or flamethrower guy stands behind your dead corpse. You'll go through a completely empty hallway with no doors, rooms, or vents, and when you leave it, someone runs out behind you, blasting away with a high powered gun, giving you little to no chance to defend yourself. And when you try to fight back, it's not always easy. The mage, for example, can put shields around nearby soldiers, throw energy blasts at you, and run at superhuman speeds, making him frustratingly difficult to kill. In the game's absolute worst mission (which is optional THANK GOD), you have to defend a resistance soldier disabling a radio tower while dozens upon dozens of nazis swarm your position.  While the normal troops play fair, jetpack nazis frequently swarm you, and conveniently get out of range of your powerful mounted guns.  After surviving several waves (the resistance fighter sure takes his sweet friggin time), I was ecstatic upon hearing him say that he needed just a few more seconds...and then a nazimatrix ran out from NOWHERE and stabbed me in the back, killing me.  After a dozen or so tries, I just gave up.  The game feels like it's constantly cheating on you, and only gets worse in the later levels as you're bombarded by more and more powerful troops at every turn. I've never seen the words \"You are dead\" on my television screen so many times.While your foes are a pain in the butt, your allies, regrettably, aren't any better. While they all come to adore you, 90% of them are too busy to talk to you, despite the fact that all they do is stand around, staring at nothing. The ones who do talk to you either send you on missions and stay behind to stare at tables and radios for hours on end, or actually come along to shoot at the Nazis and die. With the exception of Eric Engle, all of them are cardboard cutouts that you feel absolutely nothing for. Some characters, such as the leaders of the black market, are so useless that they could be cut out of the story completely without being missed. Same goes for the piece of cardboard leading the resistance and its radio operator, both of whom exist just to tell you things and nothing else.Yet, all of these problems could be forgiven if the gameplay was compelling and enjoyable. But this is Wolfenstein's biggest flaw...with very few exceptions, it feels like we've played through all this before.  Many, many, many times before.  The shooting is average, even with the various upgrades you can earn. The levels, featuring war torn Europen cities, generic warehouses, burnt out churches, farms, underground caverns, endless sewers, bases, and airfields feels generic, with the levels and environments lacking any excitement or intrigue. The sole exception comes from the final two levels, which features the only real creativity and unique design, (But once again, infuriating enemies ruin the experience). You'll go through countless corridors and narrow streets, all filled with billions of empty wooden crates for you to smash. They're also filled with lots of gold lying about (its amazing how the Nazis left so many bags of gold lying all over the place) and intelligence reports that unlock various upgrades for your weapons. Hope you like playing hide and go seek, as you'll be spending hours on end hunting for these powerups.So, is there anything good about Wolfenstein? Not much. The graphics are good, with lots of details and texturing. All the weapons are fun to use and none of them feel weak or useless, a very rare feat in this genre. Special mention must go to the Leichenfaust 44, which not only kills enemies, but turns them into smoldering skeletons. It's so brutally satisfying to have a nazimatrix or assassin run at you, only to blast their flesh off and watch their charred bones collapse to the ground. And they'll look good dying, because Wolfenstein has a very impressive physics engine. Hit crates and they'll bounce around in realistic fashion. Push a chair down the stairs and it'll bounce realistically all the way the bottom. At one point, while going through a library, I smashed two globes free of their holders and knocked them around like pin balls, and they reacted exactly as one would expect two giant globes to react when being knocked about. Aside from the guns and the physics, it's highly ironic that the greatest moment in the game is the ending cutscene...not only because it looks awesome (yet you wish you could play it instead of watching it), but it also signals that your agony is, at last, finally over.From beginning to end, Wolfenstein is a colossal failure, and one of the worst video game I've ever played. The environments and levels are bland, the enemies will make you tear your hair out, and the story and characters are a joke. While other games have worse graphics, worse gameplay, and worse levels, Wolfenstein combines dozens of flaws to create video game junk. This is a game that looks pretty and has plenty of guns to shoot, but is boring, feels like it's cheating on you, and feels like every other generic WW2 shooter out there (and considering the supernatural element, that's saying a lot).  This game is ultimately just a waste of time in every aspect. I paid eight perfectly good dollars to rent this game, and I weep for every penny that I will never have again.Avoid enlisting in this war at all costs. Go play any other game. Really, ANYTHING else. Bubsy 3D is a better then this. Superman 64 at least has unintentional humor at how awful it is. Wolfenstein is just bad. Better yet, take a cyanide pill and spare yourself the agony of any further sequels, as the ending strongly hints at one. To that, I yell, \"NEIN!\" \"","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0050SY5BM","description":"","reviewerName":"D.L. \"generasian\"","summary":"Who cares about multiplayer?  I'm playing for the story campaign.","reviewText":"Call me a fool, but contrary to most, I primarily purchase these first person shooters for the single player experience.  I could care less about multiplayer.  Sadly, most developers seem to have abandoned the practice of delivering on a solid story for a more robust online experience.  However, being the Special Forces afficionado that I am, I felt compelled to pick up this title despite the recent trend these days, especially in a market inundated with shooters.There were two concerns I had leading up to this game's release.  First would it hold up graphically on consoles and would it be light years better than the first title?  I can say a resounding YES! to both.  When I first saw the gaming footage at E3, my first thought was how impressive the game looked.  It was running on a high-end PC which dampered my enthusiasm a bit since I cannot afford a $2000 rig.  However, once I popped the disk in my 360 (oh, and make sure you install the HD visual pack) I was completely blown away.  Warfighter is bar none the most beautiful game I have ever played on a next-gen console.  Everything from the textures to the lighting are top notch and there were some instances where I couldn't believe that a 6 year console could deliver a PC-like performance.  My favorite level involves a high speed chase through a busy marketplace in some third-world country.  Here the Frostbite 2 engine is put on full display.  The level of destruction and mayhem is thrilling as your car barrels through busy street after busy street, desperately trying to catch up with your target, while debris blasts around you.  Little details like mud splattering on your windshield and even a chicken pinned to your hood are great touches.  Granted, there are some drawbacks.  The framerate tends to stutter a bit, especially during cutscenes and the sound cut off from time to time, but it was definately not game-breaking.One aspect of the original title's marketing push was that the experiences in the game were based off of real life experiences from these mysterious Tier 1 operators.  In the end, it seemed more like a gimic as the game was marred by some technical glitches and underwhelming visuals.  In Warfighter, I think the developers fully embraced what they should have in the original game.  The storyline is more dramatic, yet it tends to take itself too seriously.  But most importantly, I was engrossed.  However, as par for the course these days, the campaign is not especially long.  Expect something along the lines of 5-6 hours, but an enjoyable 5-6 hours.So for those who are looking for a single-player experience, Warfighter simply delivers.  Perhaps, this will give future notice for developers to give as much love to the story campaign as the multiplayer experience.  Not likely, but one can hope.  Anyways, just wait until you get to that car chase level...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2012"}

Unfairly. For those not in-the-know, the Quake franchise is basically what the ID guys did after they got bored with Doom. Quake4 is what they did after they got bored with Doom3. Doom 3 PC-to-xbox was well received, Quake4 wasn't well received in general, but the PC-to-360 translation seems to have gone fairly well though some complain of frame rate issues. They never bothered me. The other games you will have seen in the Doom3 engine / xbox universe would be Prey and the upcoming QuakeWars. Wolfenstein (very ugly looking port on the xbox) was Quake3 engine so not related.CONS:- early desert levels look uninspired, boring. If you left the game early, I can see why it got such bad press.- goofy arcade shoot-`em-up game elements in which you shoot stuff and it flies up into the air. Reminds me of a boorish arcade game.PROS:- fantastic looking Doom3 engine.- once you get beyond the external desert levels, much better maps and environments begin to kick in.- variety of enemies with their own characteristics.- slight twist on the health/armor pack. You also have techs that occasionally travel with you and can fix your health and armor. the also use the health station concept that Half-Life2 uses.- good array of weapons. The weapons get upgrades which is nice. The lightning gun can hit multiple targets. I especially like the Dark Matter Gun which shoots a slow beautiful purplish-black inky deathlike projectile.- no need to consult the internet due to glitches or non-intuitive gameplay.Again, I don't know where to place the story. It's like criticizing a bad low-budget horror movie, it's almost unfair. But anyway I do like the story-twist where they make you the enemy, giving you access to enemy health packs, enemy language, etc (Prey also works this way) although the process by which this happens is too reminiscent of a cut-scene toward the end of Half-Life2. Doom3 Resurrection of Evil also ripped-off the Half-Life Gravity Gun so apparently the ID guys like Half-Life a lot. Consider it an homage.And why is this guy still only a corporal after saving the planet?It isn't Halo, it isn't trying to be. It's trying to be a good Doom3 derivative and that's exactly what it's good at.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2007"}

With the XBox 360, Quake truly steps up its attention to detail.This classic game has been around for eons. I remember the old days of Doom and Hexen - and wow, have we come far since then! We now see a very cinematic version of the FPS epic series, with cinematic style intro sequences reminiscent of Alien and other great sci-fi series.You're in essence a space marine, part of the Rhino group. Your team is shot down from the sky while landing on a hostile planet, taking out the Strogg. From that point forward, all you need to know is that you have to blow up pretty much everything that moves.I'm sure, with the never-ending sequence of sequels that come out, that people will compare this to old versions of Doom and Quake. They'll also compare it to Halo. Really, unless you want to play with old-system games for years on end, you have to find other things to play. I love Halo and Halo 2. But eventually I want to play new games, if only to try out new maps.Quake has a whole different look-and-feel than Halo does. It's a different universe, a dark, bloody one full of industrial grunge. It's more \"gritty\". And, to be honest, as much as I love Halo, I really appreciated the marines in Quake 4. They appeared to actually work as a team. My medic and techie hung out near me, healing me and giving me support. In Halo it seemed like your teammates were the traditional \"red uniformed security dudes\" from Star Trek - only around to act as cannon fodder during the current episode. In Quake 4, they were much more long lasting, if you played things well.Is this a killer app? Probably not. The graphics are rather impressive on the HD TV - but for example the sky is static. Pretty, but static. The textures down in the mines are detailed, bloody, grungy and very dark - but it gets repetitive. The gameplay is simply blasting, blasting more, blasting more and some dodging. The sound is a stream of bullet blasts.But that being said, that is all the Quake series has ever intended to be. It's a fun way to blow off steam. You have a hard day at work or school, and you come home to blast away enemies for a few hours. It's very stress-relieving. You feel like you make some progress, it's easy to save and pick up the story later on. No complex puzzles, no intricate stealth sequences. It's all about blasting away with great accuracy.If you're a FPS shooter fan, it would seem silly to sit stationary and hold your breath until you turn blue, or until Halo 3 finally emerges. Buy Quake 3, have fun blasting away at dark-and-gloomy enemies, and tune your skills. Other games will be coming out eventually for you to get that eye candy you crave.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2005"}

I love shooters, first-person or third but unfortunately I think these games as of late focus so much on multiplayer that they squander the single-player experience. Thankfully 'Halo Reach' has some excellent pacing and level designs and is easily one of the best first person shooters on the next-gen market for single player gamers!The story of Halo Reach is like a cross between Call of Duty and Republic Commando. The Covenant is attacking Reach, an earth-like planet and your squad is helping planetary forces defend themselves. The Halo stories were usually filled with a lot of non-sense and exposition, and while Reach definitely takes a more straight-forward approach with it's narrative it sort of abandon's any sense of wonder (and humor) that the previous Halo games had. Your squad mates, despite having different skills aren't that memorable or fun either. It's not a BAD story by any means, just don't expect it to be up their with Bioshock or Call of Duty 4.Thankfully the narrative in Halo Reach is just a spring-board for some outstandingly cinematic level designs and high-octance gameplay! You'll be doing your usual running and gunning which controls better than ever (though i'd still love to be able to look down the sights of EVERY weapon). Mixed in are great vehicles (some old some new), some minor stealth sections and an exciting dog-fight in space! On Heroic difficulty enemies work as a team just like you and your squad. You'll see enemies dive out of fire, try and confuse and distract snipers and even try and sneak up and outflank you. This game will really have you testing your shooting skills and making you think at the same time, at least on Heroic difficulty. I tried playing on Normal mode at first but found it too easy with enemies behaving like dumbed-down drones.Again, I know there's more to Halo Reach than the single-player campaign and I'm sure you can read other reviews to find out what people think of it but I'm purely a single-player gamer. As a single player game 'Halo Reach' is terrific and fun and average length for a single player game (took me about 12 hours on Heroic difficulty). It may not be as riveting as 'Bioshock' but this will easily satisfy the single player shooter fan (at least until 'Half-Life 3' and 'Bioshock Infinite' come out!).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2010"}

While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C.

If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Stephen J.

Instead of just telling you to look in the mine to the southeast the location of the mine will be shown on your map.  And quest objectives will be marked with a red arrow so you can find where they are easier.The character creation process is very fun even though it can be a bit overwhelming at first.  Every possible facial detail can be tweaked and adjusted.  There is also a randomize button that can be used to get a unique face without as much effort.Gameplay is fun and exciting.  A lot of the gameplay has been simplified, which has it's good sides and bad sides.  Instead of Major Minor, and miscellanious skills you just have major and minor.  Minor skills no longer affect your ability to level up. Spells are easier to cast now.  You don't have to switch from fighting stance to magic stance or vice versa.  You can hit someone with a fireball and then smack them with a sword in one motion.  Plus, you can assign spells to your D-pad and switch spells quicker.  You don't have to go to the menu every time you want to change a spell.  In morrowind spells had a tendency to fail often at until you had gotten very good with them.  But now you don't have to worry about a heal spell failing right before the minotaur brings his axe down on your head.  There doesn't seem to be quite as many spells in this game though which is not fun.  What happened to levitate?  Floating around morrowind was one of my favorite things to do in the later stages of the game.  Luckily, unlike Morrowind the terrain isn't so rough that yu have to levitate to get places.Gaining in skills gives you perks like power attacks for weapon mastery, some of which are the abilty to knock an opponet down or even paralyze them. (even though some of the power attacks are hard to pull off.)The graphics of course are excellent but also the physics and movement of the characters is fun.  Watching a bear tumble down the hill after you kill it is quite amusing.  Or kicking a loose skull on the ground and watching it bounce around.  Riding a horse around can be fun too but my horses kept getting killed off by bandits or just dissapearing after awhile.  Shadowmere, where are you?!There are a few faction quests as in the previous game but not quite as many.  For a game that is based in the heart of the empire I wonder why you can't join the imperial legion.  That's a shame.  And there are no 'great houses' to join.  Although, unlike Morrowind now you can become a combatant of the arena. (There were arena fights in Morrowind but they were occassional and somewhat random during the course of the game.)  Also, the world isn't quite as large as the world of Morrowind (although I wouldn't call it small)and it's not quite as exotic.(I miss the giant traveling bugs and volcanic ashstorms of Morrowind.)  Cyrodil seems very bland and generic( once you look past the awesome graphics) although the demonic world of Oblivion is very dark and disturbing looking which makes up for it.Although there a re a few things I don't like about this game it still is a worthy successor to Morrowind and one of the best games I've been able to play and any RPG fan will love it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2006"}

In Chrono Trigger prepare yourself to journey into the forgotten past, distant future, and even to the very End of Time.The Worlds of Past, Present and FutureIn Chrono Trigger you'll journey back to Prehistory (65,000,000 B.C.) where humans and reptiles battle to wipe each other from existence. Antiquity (12,000 B.C.) is an age where the world is divided between people whose continent is buried in snow, and the magical kingdom of Zeal, a highly advanced civilization. The Middle Ages (600 A.D.) is an era of swords and sorcery, a dark time when the armies of Fiendlord rule over the land.The Present (1000 A.D.) is the time period in which Crono, Lucca and Marle live. It is a bright and peaceful age. However, in the Future (2300 A.D.), an era of despair has taken hold with rogue machines ruling the world. After the day of the apocalypse in 1999 A.D., the prosperous civilization of humanity crumbled and the remaining people struggle to stay alive. And, finally, there remains the End of Time -- a place with no era to call its own. This confluence of time's streams transcends spatiotemporal boundaries. It is here at the gravitational center for all temporal flotsam that Spekkio -- the Master of War -- serves as your guide on time's treacherous roads.Battle Systems and gameplayThis game utilizes a revised version of the groundbreaking Active Time Battle (ATB) System. Chrono Trigger features exhilarating combat in which the clock is constantly ticking. Characters must first wait as the ATB gauges charge, and then perform an action. This makes strategic timing a crucial element in your battle plan. In addition to standard attacks, each character has an array of special Tech skills and powerful combos known as Dual and Triple Techs. Cooperate with other characters to unleash over 50 unique and devastating moves!Chrono Trigger utilizes great story-telling, interesting characters, action-packed gameplay, and the unique controls of the Nintendo DS to deliver a fun and well-rounded role-playing game on a portable platform.","reviewerName":"Classic gamer! \"Retro gamer mostly\"","summary":"A classic?","reviewText":"Ok I received this game over a year ago on Christmas, deal is I knew this game was a classic so I was excited to play it.  I really like old school RPG's, but this game is kind of tedious.  At first I was engaged when the I started playing the game, but now that I'm all of maybe 5 to 10 hours into the game (over a year later due to boredom) I wonder why am I even playing it.  Chrono has to time travel constantly and do things that have little mention as to where I am going and why.  Although the game hints at some things other's it's like why and where am I going.  Truthfully I spend more time reading what I should be doing than it takes to do it.  Even aside from that the story line is mediocre at best.  I'm sorry I wanted to like this game, but I'm starting to find it a waste of time.  I recommend instead Earthbound, Secret of Mana and/or Illusion of Gaia (be warned this game is very hard!).  (I only give this game two stars because I can tell the company tried to make it fun).","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2010"}

While this was a bit annoying, the actual game was fun to play. MGS3 doesn't fix this at all. Hideo Kojima should of learned from MGS2, but he didn't.Basically, you are in the jungle. Unlike previous Metal Gears, you don't hide behind crates. Instead, you camo yourself with the environment. This is easy to do and doesn't take long at all. Throughout the game you pick up more camos, and there are secret ones. There isn't any radar, but this is a good thing. You are now forced to use your motion detector and heartbeat sensor. You also have to look in first person constantly because the camera is practically always above you, and it is a little too close. Another stealth tactic you will learn to love is CQC. Walk up to an enemy and hold the \"O\" button. Snake will grab the person. At first this is strange because you must keep holding \"O\" or else the guy will push you and run away. If you hold \"O\" too hard you will cut his neck and kill him. Once you master holding, CQC is a blessing. You can interrogate enemies, flip them, use them as shields, snap their necks, and trip them. You can also throw your enemies to the ground then make them freeze.If you don't like stealth, this is a good action game. There are shotguns, heavy machine guns, revolvers, and even a combat knife.The story is not as far-fetched as MGS2. MGS2 had a crazy story, but at least you could enjoy it. It was so stupid that you kind of found it amusing. MGS3 has a weak story that has been done too many times before. The only redeeming quality of this game is Snake and Revolver. You meet Revolver at the start of the game, and he remains interesting throughout it.The last thing to talk about is food. There are so many different foods. I've read guides online describing hidden animals and such. Snake responds to food differently, and he can call Para-Medic to teach him about anything.Although it has a lot of cinematics and uninspired bosses, this game is good. Somehow, it manages to keep me playing. The game has some touching moments and some cool ones. It also provides in the most interesting sniper fight you will ever see in a video game. If you played the originals, pick this one up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2005"}
{"product_name":"B001D7T2VC","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"Slaying demons in post-apocalyptic Earth is a blast","reviewText":"If you're a fan of the Legend of Zelda series or the God of War series, then chances are you'll like this game as it combines the exploration and large levels of the former with the bloody action and combat of the latter. You take control of War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, as he drops down to New York City in the middle of what is supposedly the final battle between the angels of Heaven and the demons of Hell that will destroy the world of men... in other words, the Apocalypse. As he destroys both the angels and demons he encounters, War slowly begins losing his power (his overall health and magic depletes) and soon finds himself broken and beaten by a giant demon named Straga. War is then transported to the Charred Council, the supernatural mediators who try to maintain the balance between Heaven and Hell. The Council blames War for prematurely starting the Apocalypse and disrupting this balance, even though War insists that he had answered the call to take part in the battle. To prove his innocence, War offers to be sent back to Earth so he could find the ones truly responsible and bring them to vengeance... I mean, justice. The dark creature known as the Watcher (voiced by Mark Hamill and sounding A LOT like the Joker) is bonded to War and will kill him if he gets out of line or doesn't do what is required to complete his goal. By the time War returns to Earth, it's been 100 years since the war that destroyed everything and all the humans are either dead or wander the Earth as zombies. The demons won the war and are all over the place, with the remaining angels struggling to survive against the endless demonic hordes. War himself is still depowered and will slowly regain his true might as the game goes on by collecting souls from defeated enemies and using them as currency to upgrade his combat abilities by visiting the demon Vulgrim.War's combat moves are initially very limited, but once he acquires more upgrades he'll be slicing and dicing demons with his impressive regular and aerial moves and powerful weapons. War is armed with his large Chaoseater sword, but later acquires two other main weapons: a Scythe that uses wide sweeping attacks that hit enemies all around him and a Tremor Gauntlet that allows him to smash enemies around with shockwave smashes and destroy ice barriers. He'll also gain access to other sub-weapon items like the Crossblade which is bascially a large shuriken that can be thrown around like a boomerang, an oversized revolver called Mercy, the Abyssal Chain which allows him to shoot a grappling chain to zip himself to out of reach places, and the Voidwalker which lets War create portals on specific surfaces to reach other inaccessible areas. War can even make weapons out of the environment and bash his enemies around with light poles and cars. He'll be able to use powerful magic for a variety of effects, including but not limited to hardening himself into stone to increase his durability and attack power, or driving his sword into the ground to make a bunch of blades pop up around him and impale his enemies. He'll even regain access to his Chaos Form, in which he envelops himself in flames and transforms into a large, fiery demon with horns and a huge, serrated blade of fire. In this form, War can make short work of most enemies.During his quest, War will travel to many areas around the destroyed New York City: through ruined cityscapes, overgrown forests, sewers, subways, and barren deserts. Each area is rather large and full of nooks and crannies with many hidden items and collectibles, and War will have to go through pretty much every one of these spots to get the needed items and keys that will allow him to open the many locked doors he'll have to go through. All these areas function like dungeons, very much like in the Zelda series, so if you're fond of exploration, puzzles, and item hunting, then this game certainly doesn't fall short in those departments. In the more open areas, especially the desert, War will eventually be able to ride his trusted steed Ruin, a large demonic looking horse with fire emanating from its mane and hooves. Riding atop Ruin and killing enemies with the Chaoseater or Mercy is pretty fun, but I would have liked more open areas that allow War to ride Ruin more often. All the characters in this game look great. War is very cool and tough looking in his very bulky armor and red hood, and the many demonic enemies he battles all look ferocious and beastly, making it all the more enjoyable to rip them apart into bloody chunks. The angels look very cool as well in their shining armor and with their glowing wings. The boss battles are all pretty much against these very big and nasty looking demons that actually require some strategy to defeat, but most of them are only moderately challenging; even the final boss was a tad too easy.Still, the battles are fun and epic. Special mention has to go to two characters: Ulthane and Samael. Ulthane is a humanoid mountain of muscle with a Scottish accent who's about as tough as they come, and Samael is a very devilish and imposing looking demon with a personality to match who actually has a certain sense of honor, much like War. It is because of these unique and great looking characters in the game's cutscenes that you get drawn into this dark and fantastical world. The story, while certainly not lacking interesting characters or an epic sense of adventure, could have been a bit deeper and could have involved a more numerous cast of characters. The Watcher should have also had more lines, especially during gameplay when you're able to summon him for advice; he mostly repeats the same handful of normally useless lines and doesn't really prove to be very helpful. Still, as it is, this game is just lots of fun and leaves you wanting more, despite the fact that it can easily take somewhere between 20 to 30 hours to complete. The ending is pretty awesome as well, making it obvious that there will be a sequel, which I am really looking forward to. Any fan of dungeon explorers and hack'n'slashers will enjoy this game and should buy it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Can't always be everyone's game of the year but it's mine","reviewText":"Ever since the release of Final Fantasy X, each game in the series has been fairly controversial among the community from the online MMO of 11 to the \"Final Fantasy by way of Charlie's Angels\" sequel to Final Fantasy X and the complete gameplay overhaul that 12 brought, I haven't played a completely awful Final Fantasy in years yet the general opinion of each tends to be very divisive. What once was disappointing turns out to be the most underrated (8 and 9) yet what was the most influential turns out to be the worst (7 though I personally don't think so) so now we come down to 13, a game long gestating in development, first on a next-gen hardware and one that had an oddly controversial multiplatform announcement instead of a PS3 exclusive, Final Fantasy XIII is finally released. Has the wait been worth it? Again like prior entries, that depends on your tastes since this isn't one of those unbridled masterpieces that everyone's going to love and only select few will be against as evidenced by the reviews on the site but personally I'm having a great time playing, flaws and all.Story: In the city of Cocoon, the citizens live in fear of the \"l'Cie\", people that have have been touched by powerful beings known as \"fal'Cie\", ones that have a task or \"Focus\" to accomplish with certain rules in place for how to accomplish it. But these people are usually seen as enemies and are hunted down and exterminated so when a group of people become branded by the fal'Cie, it becomes a race to outrun the forces that are after them as well as figure out what exactly their task is. One of the best things about 13's story is that unlike 7 and 8 where the main character felt like it was \"their\" story, this feels more like an ensemble where everyone pulls their own weight in the story and develop and in fact, even some characters outright hate each other at first. The bone of contention online it seems is the linearity, as if these games weren't linear before but here it feels more pronounced. But the upside is that every time you pick up the controller you make progress in the story, constantly moving and not spending 3 hours just to make sure you're not steamrolled when a new area comes along.Graphics: I'll say that Uncharted 2's graphics definately impress but they never consistently stunned me. Sure it was all animated well but I'd see the jungle stage or the last level and I'd be floored but then other times I'd feel like \"eh, looks good enough\" before it floored me again, same thing with God of War 3 recently. Final Fantasy XIII, especially on a PS3, is a powerhouse. From vistas and landscapes to character modelling and detail to just the overall crispness of it all, this is one smooth and vibrant looking game. Especially considering the small load times and lack of game data on your hard drive and the fact that all this streams off the disc without barely a hitch is mighty impressive. On an Xbox 360, things look well enough but the smaller resolution, aliasing issues and lack of texture detail tends to pop up but usually you'd have to see both running side by side otherwise you wouldn't notice.Sound/Music: Like 12 before it, this soundtrack was not done by Nobuo Uematsu but a new composer, in this case it's Masasha Hamauzu, known for his dual work on Final Fantasy X, Unlimited Saga, Dirge of Cerberus and Saga Frontier 2. The soundtrack here is definately way different than before with a slight electronica/trance vibe at times to the music, the epic orchestral themes and even occasionally, a vocal theme. Missing in action is the classic Prelude (\"Crystal\") Theme, in place is a nice crescendo that builds in volume to the catchy battle theme and a Chocobo theme with lyrics? Yep though nothing replaces Odeka or Ukele de Chocobo. The voice acting has also improved and there's not a lot of characters that'll make you cringe though it was strange there's no dual language option considering Square actually hearing about the love people have for subtitles/Japanese audio but oh well.Gameplay: Oh boy, this is going to be hard. Trying to explain half of what 13 does different will be tricky but here goes. You control one character at a time with the other 2 being AI and replacing MP are ATB bars, bars that actions will use up so the more powerful the attack, the more bars it needs to use (Attack might be 1 bar whereas Blitz, an area of attack ability, requires 2) so as long as you have the bars filled up, you can use what you want which makes battles very straightforward and you no longer have to spend so much time using Ethers and Elixirs just to cure again. Another big chance is the Paradigms, essentially these function similar to Jobs from the previous game though certain characters will have a better affinity for one job over another. For instance, Lightning makes a really good Commando and Medic though she might be terrible at Synergist. Oh yeah, guess I got to explain those ones. Here's how it breaks down: Commando = melee, Medic = white mage/priest/healer, Ravager = black mage, Saboteur = enemy debuffer (DeShell, DeProtect etc), Synergist = party buffer such as Protect and Shell whereas Sentinels are basically the guards of the group, taking damage in place of another team or to provoke an enemy to attack them exclusively. A Paradigm Shift occurs when you switch roles for the members so you can have an all-out team of melee users to dish damage but since there's no healer, it prompts a shift to a group with one or two (or all, even) Medics, to get your team back on your feet and back again. It's remarkably intuitive and pretty soon you'll be switching paradigms on the fly because you know what to do and not just do whatever and hope it works.Another change...sort of, is how your summons worked, named \"Eidolons\" a la Final Fantasy IX (by the way, if you think it's pronounced \"eye-doh-lawn\", be prepared for a rude awakening like I was). They can be summoned into battle if your TP is at max and attacks alongside you but they can also go into Gestalt mode where they for lack of a better term, go into Transformers mode, and you control what attacks they use akin to 10 but the tricky part is your TP doesn't refill every battle like your HP does so you have to save your summons for when you absolutely must need them. TP, or \"technique points\" is how you do specific abilities that are independent of a class ability so for example a Ravager might be able to have Fire and Water as abilities but the \"Libra\" technique, Scan in other words, is a technique. By the way, Libra everything you see since the AI adopts that information into its programming so to speak so whereas before they used whatever attack they felt like, if the AI \"knows\" that an enemy is weak against fire, they're more often than not to always use fire. Another awesome change is the retry. Picture this: you need to level up to take down a boss but while in grinding mode, you die by a generic enemy encounter and a good hour has been wasted prompting a far restart. Not so here, here you can taken back to just before the encounter so if you got demolished, just hit Retry, spawn outside that enemy, go into your menu and reconfigure your party to what you feel is a better course of action which ties into the storyline's progress as well; there's not as much brick walls where you feel like \"screw it, I'll beat him tomorrow\".Now as far as negatives out of the way, well there is the fact that the game is noticeably linear. In prior entries, generally you moved to a specific area but the illusion of freedom was always present, meaning you couldn't actually go that way because of the story, world layout or simply because the enemies got too powerful but here you will notice how restricted your movements are and it's not until a good 20 hours into it that it opens up and the game says \"okay, run free little birdy\". Also, though this is just personal preference but the game re-introduces the Sphere Grid by way of the Crystarium, a more spiffier looking version of the Grid. Doing battles nets you CP or crystal points which you spend on the grid to advance a specific stat such as \"Strength +3\" or \"HP+20\" and while it's cool they did away with requiring a specific sphere to activate a node this time (ever run out of Ability Spheres in 10 and weren't going to level up until you found one? none of that here) but I kind of like the old Level 23 type setup where if an enemy got too hard, I got a good idea on how much levelling is required and though there isn't much need for grinding, it does suck that I can't level up a specific skill when I do need to upgrade it. But that's me.Phew, that's a lot of talk. But really this game has been in long development cycles, massive amounts of hype, fair bit of controversy concerning the linearity, the weird disdain for it being on Xbox 360 or the inclusion of Leona Lewis but honestly as a game, this one is extremely fun. Unlike 12 which was a fun game though not a terrific story, 13 tells a great tale while being insanely fun to play and that's kind of rare for the series. Doesn't matter what system, you've got to give Final Fantasy XIII a try since the love-or-hate nature people have with it reinforce the idea that you might be in love with it though everyone else isn't.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"Impetigo","summary":"Not impressed... went back to my PS3","reviewText":"I bought the original PS3 a couple months after release and loved it.  It eventually died a few years later and I promptly replaced it with a slim PS3.  I got the PS4 but was disappointed in several ways and just want to point those issues out as there are plenty of comprehensive reviews here.1. Incompatible withNyko BluWave Remote for PS3.  Just like the PS3, Sony has inexplicably decided to no include an IR sensor on the PS4.  This means that you will not be able to use Harmony remotes to control your PS4 like all your other devices.  The PS3, though, had a work around if you used a Nyco Blu-wave IR adapter plugged into the USB port.  This gave most IR functionality (except for power on and the \"PS\" button) to the PS3 and could be used with Harmony remotes.  This is basically a deal breaker for me.  TheXbox One Console - Titanfall Bundle, OTOH, apparently does have an IR sensor.2. Pay to play online.  The best feature of the PS3 over the Xbox 360 was free online play, whereas you needed to pay a subscription to play online with Xbox Live (I never could understand why people would do that, but I digress...).  I don't play much games actually anymore but this is just disappointing.3. No Bluetooth audio support.  No, you can't use standard bluetooth headsets.  What I really wanted was to be able to use bluetooth Apt-X (high audio quality codec) headphones (Beats Studio Wireless Over-Ear Headphone (Matte Black)) with the PS4 so that I could easily listen to audio wirelessly while watching movies or playing games at night.  Unfortunately, Sony has not included even basic bluetooth (e.g. a2dp) functionality to the PS4 which was even available on the PS3.4. Bad interface.  The Media Crossbar interface of the PS3 was getting long in the tooth and was not impressing too many people according to reviews I've read, but the new interface on the PS4 is almost the same but more convoluted to use and less organized.  I do not like it all.So basically, the PS4 for me is in several significant ways worse than the PS3.  The only justification would be to play games but for me that's not a big attraction and I've decided to send my PS4 back and keep my PS3, which still functions well enough for media playback in my home theater setup (although I use an Oppo for blu-ray playback) using Amazon Prime and Netflix (sadly, no HBO Go since I have Comcast for internet, but that's a story for another day...).","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2014"}

{"product_name":"B000095ZH6","reviewerName":"Review Lover \"ReviewLover\"","summary":"Really Surprising!","reviewText":"I wasn't expecting to like 'The Suffering' at all, seeing as how, to me, Survival Horror is defined by the Silent Hill and Fatal Frame series of games. Happily, 'The Suffering' is like a merry blend of the best bits of the atmosphere of those games with a free and easy (albeit flawed) control system that those games lack.The closest way I have of describing it is if you took 'Tomb Raider' and added the chills and spills of 'Resident Evil', and threw in a dash of the melancholia and psycho-horror of the Silent Hill series.Playing Torque, a man convicted of murdering his family, the action begins fairly slowly, and culminates in your hopeful escape from Abbot Penitentiary on Carnate Island. Along the way you meet some allies, slay some foes and enjoy some really genuinely scary moments.The actual game itself isn't so hot, in terms of graphics and playability. It's fairly average in both of these departments: textures and models are uncomplicated and basic (although the frame rate is good, and the backdrops stylish and eerie) and the control system, though somewhat looser than, say, Resident Evil, lacks the precision and speed of games like Tomb Raider and Metal Gear Solid. However, neither of these elements are truly bad; rather not utilised fully - but it's very frustrating sometimes to feel like you're hacking and slashing and winning due to sheer fluke.That said, the game creates excellent standards of atmosphere, thanks in no small part to a very adult script and some excellent, edge-of-your-seat shocks and vignettes. The Evil Doctor and Torque's flashbacks to when his family were murdered are really nice touches, and I defy even the most hardened Survival Horror Completist not to jump when some of the more speedy creatures make an entrance.The Prison setting, too, lends much atmosphere to the game, and Midway have included a really cool documentary on Haunted Prisons to go with the game, giving us a better sense of why an abandoned prison ought to terrify us. The length of the game is a real value-for-money thing, it's far longer than many of its contemporaries and all the better because of it.I must give a special mention to the sound: The voice acting and sound effects are among the best I have ever heard in a videogame, and coupled with a fast-paced environment and some real thought on the part of the game developers as to how we should be scared, I have to say that 'The Suffering' is a very solid, thoroughly entertaining title that, in the wake of 'Siren' and 'Fatal Frame 2', will certainly tide us over until 'Silent Hill 4' deigns to grace us with its presence.To put it simply, it's not a classic example of the power of Survival Horror, but it's an excellent title, all the same. If you can put up with some dodgy combat and slightly mundane graphics, there's a real treat in store for you with 'The Suffering'.Excellent.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2004"}

Whether you want to decorate your home, catch bugs or fish, or just chat with the characters in your village, there's always something to do. Days and seasons pass in real time, and you can visit the villages of online players -- even if they're a thousand miles away.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Animal Crossing was MADE for the Handheld","reviewText":"On the Gamecube, Animal Crossing was a hit.  It was addictive, different, and a game that anyone could get into.  Despite how grand it was on the Gamecube, you just couldn't help but admit the console was not a place for a game like Animal Crossing.  Well, Nintendo obviously knew it because they released it on the DS.  This isn't a port.  It's more of a revamp of what Animal Crossing really is.  And with it being taken on the go, it's just all out better that way.You begin the game as a human talking with Kapp'n.  He'll ask you a series of questions and depending on how you answer them determines what you'll look like.  As a human you've just moved to this new little town.  Kapp'n has helped you find a place of your own, and now you have to do what you can to repay him.  You'll be given several job tasks that you can do for this, and they'll all earn you lots of money in the long run.The task you can do are simple little task.  You're able to catch fish, run errands for townfolk and dig up fossils.  No different than what you did in the Gamecube version.  In these task there aren't very many changes.  The only noteable change is how much easier it is to identify fossils.  Other than that, the only other difference is the abundance of these items.The new task in Wild World aren't much.  You now you can maintain a garden and shoot floating presents out of the sky with a slingshot.  They're not very satisfying, and just don't make you feel like you're getting much of anything done like the other task do.Of course, no one plays Animal Crossing just to do those mundane tasks for nothing.  Aside from paying back your debt to Kapp'n and other debts that'll come along, you can go to the shop and buy items to pimp out your house!  This is, believe it or not, the most exciting feature in Animal Crossing.  It's fun to show your friends what your house is sporting.  It gives you bragging rights, and the items sold in the shops change daily, meaning you'll check in constantly.There's more to its complexity.  The game uses the DS's internal clock to move about in real time.  And yes, it does recognize holidays, and therefore a theme comes from them.  Every Saturday there is also a flea market where you can pick up lots of goodies for your house.  Again, this is what makes Animal Crossing work.One disappointment I did have with the game... no NES goodness.  One of the funnest parts of the original on Gamecube was buying an NES and playing classic games right on the spot.  You can't do that here and that's pretty sad.Like any simulator type of game, Animal Crossing has an array of characters to talk with.  It's nice to see that when you talk to other characters they don't say the same old mundane and boring things over and over.  They always have something else to say, and at times it's funny.  And just like real life, people will move in and out of town constantly.  This adds a lot to the game's value as far as being a different experience each and every time.  The game, for the most part, never gets old.Despite how fun Animal Crossing is, it's a game that should only be played in small sips.  This is because of the day to day basis in it.  It's a pain sometimes, but it also makes sure you check back everyday.  This was what killed the Gamecube version of the game.  You had to load up a game everyday and check on your town.  If you left the game unattended for too long, your town began to decay and look less appealing, becoming clustered with weeds and the like.  This alone, made the Gamecube version frustrating, and is why it is better suited for a handheld than anything else.  Since you can carry your DS with you whereever you go, you can also load it up on the go daily and take care of your daily task.  Say you go to a friends house... take your DS.  This is much better than picking up your Gamecube and going (if your friend didn't have one).The game does have touch screen controls.  You can guide your character and whatnot, but it's a whole lot easier to use the D-Pad for that kind of stuff.  It makes writing letters easier, but for other tasks like fishing and gardening, the touch screen will slow you down more than anything.  It's not really a waste of what the touch screen could do.  It's just not easy to use the touch screen.Multiplayer in Wild World is a little different.  You can still hook up with up to four people and do the methodology from the first game.  You'll just be sharing the debt in the same house this time.  Likewise, you can use the wireless DS capability to visit a friends town.  You can also go online with Nintendo wi-fi and visit someone's town.  It is kind of strange that all the residents will go indoors though.  You can easily find them and everything, but the atmosphere just feels weird.Going online sounds like a lot of fun--and it can be--but there are ridiculous restrictions.  For one, you have to have a friend code in order to visit their town.  You can't just walk in and explore anyone's town.  This is great for keeping out jerks and the people who like to do nothing but flame you online, but it also sucks because it adds no real innovation.  It limits you severely.  Why not just create a feature where you can ban those jerks?  The only interesting thing you can do is the message in a bottle in tag mode.  You write a letter or something and put it in a bottle.  The next time your friend is in tag mode, the message will wash up on shore.  It almost feels like forwarding emails or something to a friend, but it has its moments.Another bit that plagued the Gamecube verison of Animal Crossing were the graphics.  They were not up to the standard of the Gamecube, and looked like a reject N64 title.  For the Gamecube the graphics aren't acceptable.  For the Nintendo DS?  They look fantastic.  Characters still maintain that cartoony look, and the game still runs very well.  The music is nothing to get excited about, but it works.Yes, Animal Crossing was made for the handheld.  If you've spent mad hours with it on the Gamecube, get it on the DS and spend mad hours with it again.The Good+Animal Crossing belongs on the handheld+Addictive Gameplay+Brings back what made the Gamecube version good+More of those same Gamecube items in abundance+I'll just say it here, it's fun to pimp out your house+The graphics are great on the DS+Online PlayThe Bad-Online play isn't as extraordinary as they could be-The touch screen controls aren't good-The new tasks are nothing to get excited about-The music isn't much to get excited about either","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2005"}

It certainly has a borderlands feel to it and a bit of a fallout 3 look. But it falls short of being as great as either of those 2 games. I was expecting more of a open world experience but what I got was more of a go here, go back here, now go back one more time. Not much to see and do outside the main story. Graphics are amazing as they should be but it isn't everything. Overall it made me want to play borderlands 2 even more now.Online was fun a few times but I felt like it got old pretty fast.

This game went from one of the titles I anticipated most on PC to a title that I'm avoiding altogether. Why? Digital Rights Management aka DRM. Specifically the type of DRM that Electronic Arts has decided to include with this game.The DRM known as SecuROM will only punish actual customers by enforcing a totalitarian online verification. Why? Because this so called anti-piracy DRM was already 'cracked' days before the game even hit store shelves. Proof positive that enforcing this type of rigid DRM only affects legitimate customers.In addition to verifying your copy of the game every time you take it online you'll also be limited to 3 installs. That's 3 installations over the entire life of the game. Anything over that and you'll be on the phone calling EA begging for a new code.

{"product_name":"B002TDIEDG","description":"","reviewerName":"K. Groh","summary":"Unique Game Play, Great Graphics","reviewText":"This has been a very unique game to play. The premise is that the main character awakens and realizes he is dead. He then learns to interact with objects in his world (within limitations) to change the fate of events including reversing the death of other characters.I did find that the actual puzzle solving time was limited and there was tons of dialogue to weed through. Sometimes you need the dialogue to figure out the puzzle but other times there are tons of not-so-subtle hints that show or tell you exactly what you have to do.The story line is okay, humorous but a little mundane at times. The characters are funny and well animated. I especially laughed at the detective that dances like Michael and the security guard who did his little funky dance until you fixed something.Each puzzle has to be solved in 4 minutes, the amount of time to reverse fate and save a life. You have the option of replaying from the last fate reversal or the beginning of the level. Some puzzles never need a second playthrough and others need a few as you try out different objects to see which one will interact as you need it to change fate.I found the transition from dialogue to puzzles somewhat annoying as the screen displays a large graphic, &#34;Trick Time&#34; just in case you didn't know you had to solve something.Overall, it's fun and somewhat challenging. It is a little repetitive at times but a unique and interesting gaming style.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2011"}

Includes the incredible Guitar Hero SG Controller -- it looks and feels just like a real guitar. Strap it on and crank it up!","reviewerName":"D. Mok","summary":"An impeccable idea, charmingly executed.  Great fun.","reviewText":"Finally, a PS2 game that deserves five stars.  Guitar Hero is one of those high-concept games with such a great premise that many people will buy it without having seen a single screen capture.  And the cincher is, it fully lives up to its promise.Pros:- Addictive gameplay.  The customized guitar-shaped controller gives an added cute factor over other simulation games of this type.- Terrific graphics, backgrounds, and characters.  Their in-game activities and details are very endearing.- Fortunately, they didn't forget the guitar-loving gals and included two female characters you can choose from.  There's also a terrific Donnas song (\"Take It Off\") you can play along to, plus that perennial air-guitar classic, Joan Jett's \"I Love Rock and Roll\".  They could've gone even farther with the gender balance -- imagine trying to play something by Sleater-Kinney, with those twisty Carrie Brownstein guitar lines -- but at least they tried.- Good songs with diversity.  I hadn't expected to see \"Godzilla\" on here -- Donald \"Buck Dharma\" Roeser is a grossly underrated guitarist, and playing this song might make you appreciate him much more.  \"Bark at the Moon\" and \"You Got Another Thing Comin'\" are classic metal; \"Texas Flood\" and \"Crossroads\" represent the blues spectrum; \"Higher Ground\" supplies the funk; \"Stellar\" and \"No One Knows\" represent modern alternative rock.  \"Cowboys from Hell\" is an apt tribute to the late, great Dimebag Darrell, and Megadeth's crushing \"Symphony of Destruction\" is my favourite song selection.  The songs aren't their original versions (imagine the licensing fees), but they are great-sounding recreations of the recordings.- I had originally been skeptical about the SG guitar controller's ability to respond to lightning-fast notes, but it turns out to be quite sharp.- Rock-star dreams.  Who wouldn't get a kick out of this?Cons:- While there's a good diversity in the song choices, like Stevie Ray Vaughan (\"Texas Flood\"), Edgar Winter Group (\"Frankenstein\") and Queen (\"Killer Queen\"), at a certain point, it still ain't quite enough.  Given the huge pantheon of rock/blues/jazz music out there, of course there'll be omissions, and licensing problems probably added to the limitations in song choices.  No Led Zeppelin, no Nirvana or Pearl Jam, no Guns N' Roses, no AC/DC, no Allman Brothers Band, no Joe Satriani, no Van Halen, no Santana, no The Band, no Bruce Springsteen, no U2, no Neil Young and Crazy Horse, no Metallica, no Evanescence, no Aerosmith, no Living Colour, no Bon Jovi, no Dream Theater.  And where are \"Hotel California\" and \"Layla\"?  Pink Floyd's \"Comfortably Numb\"?  Eric Johnson's \"Cliffs of Dover\"?- While some of the unlockable bonus songs are fun to play -- Freezepop's \"Get Ready 2 Rokk\" is just fabulously weird, and Artillery's \"The Breaking Wheel\" is challenging, twisty fun -- some of them are trite, and some are downright annoying, included only because a certain member of the band is on the Harmonix design team.  The Acro-Brats, The Slip, Made in Mexico, Count Zero and Honest Bob and the Factory-to-Dealer Incentives are especially irritating -- bad music, repetitive and overlong.  And there's way too much skater punk-pop in general.- Having Gibson Guitars' endorsement means you get to play some genuine Gibson guitar designs.  Hey, I play one myself and I love them.  But not being able to use classic designs like the Stratocaster, the Ibanez R-type, the Telecaster, the Rickenbacker and the Jackson Rhoads is conspicuous, to say the least.- Remember to rest your hands...the SG controller has what we'd call a \"baseball bat\" neck, thicker than any electric guitar I can think of, and playing this thing can be even more tiring than playing a real guitar...this coming from a guy who plays acoustic 12-string.There are already plenty of wishlists on the web for songs that haven't been included, and I can only hope there will be a Guitar Hero 2.

It has a great many things working in its favor, and ultimately, they outweigh the negatives and justify the title's purchase (or rental, if you can't find a used copy cheap enough).First and foremost, \"Blacksite\" is the rare game with the audacity, if you will, to convey a witty satire of not only Area 51 (alongside Rachel, NV (which is much more urban in the game than in real life)), but the Iraq war (\"W.M.D.s\" that were never actually there, e.g.) and American politics in general. Without venturing too far down a particular path politically in this review, let me simply state that I found it to be quite humorous and entertaining, as a whole. Backing up this exposition is top-notch voice acting, a true \"rarity\" in terms of sci-fi videogaming indeed, as well as excellent graphics (pre-COD 4, of course) and audio (the game is a superior workout for your subwoofer). Though the town of Rachel, NV is quite exaggerated in the game in terms of scope, the inclusion of \"Little A'le'Inn\" (this is a real place, if you didn't know...and it appears to be represented perfectly in the game) as well as the \"extraterestrial highway\" sign on Route 375 makes for terrific realism as you venture forth through the desert of Nevada, and it's a ton of mindless fun.In short, while the game won't win any awards for creative gameplay, it has succeeded on many levels (most notably action), and its purchase/rental is certainly justifiable to FPS/\"X-Files\" fans (I'm one of the biggest) looking for nothing more than simple, mindless entertainment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2008"}

Sadly, they've already started releasing DLC, so planned jokes about new episodes hitting in 2013 have been thwarted.The story is fairly complex. I could spoil it here if you would like, but I would advise against it. But I will say that even spelling out the story, it doesn't make a ton of logical sense...which was a goal of the developers. So, well played men. On seond thought, even if you read a complete synopsis, there ain't much going to be much ruined as it is baffling and highly susceptible to interpretation.The game's main concept is the usage of light to equate with safety. Your most important ally is light as enemies are basically invincible until you can drive the darkness from them. You have to deal not just with enemies, but also possessed inanimate objects, such as gates.Wake is not without some talents, though. The guns feel suitably powerful, but with scarce ammo. Flare guns and flashbang grenades are the biggest weapons in the game for a reason. When you have ammo, you feel like a badass of sorts. You can avoid attacks and drop road flares to back foes off of you. But, in the end, you seldom have a ton of ammo on higher difficulty levels, so running away is not always a poor option.You have a wide array of collectibles to find, such as the manuscript pages which almost explain what is happening right then. There are others, such as thermoses, TVs, and radioes which seem to have no real purpose, outside of ambience.And ambience is something the game has in spades. The game has atmosphere down cold. It is up there with Condemned in the annals of really creepy games due to the ambience of the area. You see the Taken through the mist coming at you. You find a light in the distance and just do all you can do to reach it. It is a thrillling game and one of the few that do horror well.This is a game that had brutally high expectations and hit them. Some issues, such as the uncanny valley when looking at NPCs are there, but seem unavoidable in games. This is a game that warrants serious examination as it is a definite GOTY candidate and might be one of the most relevant titles of this console generation. Not replayable, but the game is a heck of a ride.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2010"}

To my disappointment, this title advances nothing.The graphics are last generation. Trees, for example, are mostly the old cylinder with as few sprites.The story is a rip off of \"Secret Window\", (Stephen King, for those who think this feels like a Stephen King story), and \"In the Mouth of Madness\". What is it, the more stories to steal from the more original yours is?The game is simply an old fashioned level to level, inventory resets every stage, shooter. The twist to the shooting is the flashlight nonsense, where you can shoot the bad guys until after you shine your flash light on them for a while.There is no puzzles, nothing clever. Simply shine, shoot, run, rinse, repeat.I believe this game will go episodic ASAP, as it is already designed in episodes, and, as I mentioned before, inventory doesn't carry over from episode to episode.I found this game boring. Incredibly boring. Fits of running from one light source to another through forest and other easy/boring location. Do yourself a favor and avoid this stinker.UPDATE: Having gone back and finished this title, I've added a star. It's not a bad time filler, from a discount bin.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2010"}

Hayes","summary":"Fun and Enjoyable a Great RPG experience","reviewText":"A Promise Unforgotten is the fourth entry in the niche RPG Disgaea series. It is known for its quirky and hilarious, yet heart-touching story; heavy emphasis on character and item customization and maximization; and heavily addicting gameplay that's a level grinders dream.Disgaea 4 essentially tosses out all ties to the previous entries and presents players with a fresh new story. Like Disgaea 3, Disgaea 4 is a great entry place for new and continuing players alike. There are really no references at all to the other games; nothing people will need to know to help them go through the majority of story modes. For returning players, they are treated to one character who has been in the series since Disgaea 2, however it isn't until post-game that more is done with him in any regard.In brief, Disgaea 4 revolves around Valvatorez, a vampire turned prinny (humans reincarnated as penguins to pay back their crimes from life), as he initially tries to save his penguins and attempt to restore the Netherworld to its former glory. The story leaves quite an impact and is memorable. Many of the characters introduced are given their own mini arcs and development with the hopes of players to be able to (hopefully) identify with one or two and enjoy their ride. They even receive their own themed epilogues. With its numerous epilogues, there is much to be had in replaying the 40-60-hour long story mode. I enjoyed the story and the numerous characters it involved.Presentation-wise, the story itself is carried out in either on-field display moments (character sprites moving) or via 2D character portraits that pose and have slight movements of life. Sadly, there weren't any anime cutscenes typical for this genre. But the game does offer English and Japanese voice acting. With competent and personally, non-annoying, English VA, I found it enjoyable.Gameplay-wise, the basic premise remains simple and easy. Players go through a map, position and move their units, attack opponents, end turn, and repeat. Beyond the basics, the game provides a basic tutorial on more advanced features such as geo panels and blocks, that give various bonuses when enemies and players are placed and destroyed on them. They also provide features such as fusing characters on the field to increase skills and abilities, magically changing certain characters to weapons to increase damage, and even dual-wielding them for greater damage increase.I found the tutorial to be a bit lacking, forcing me to use online guides for assistance. Most players will be forced to use online resources to fully maximize characters, but this isn't anything new for veterans of the series.The game is, in my opinion, quite overwhelming initially. There is an item world where items can be ranked up to 300 and given numerous abilities; a character world where characters can be ranked up to gain more abilities; pirates for invading one's items; and capabilities to invade other friends via online. Characters themselves can be leveled up to level 9999 for maximum damage and skills, and not to mention, can be reincarnated so one can do it again and again for even more damage and skill maximization.All of this is not necessary for completing the story, but is utilized for the tons of post-game content, all of the epilogues, and xdimension (replaying all the maps with enemies at super strength).Overall, ignoring the overwhelming aspect, Disgaea remained true to the series like others in the past. One's milage is really based on how committed they are to playing post-game and seeing all that there is. Fortunately for the casual RPG fan, the lenghty story mode and all the epilogues are worth it, and the level grinding and character maximization is not necessary.There are tons of joy to be had from the story due to its heartwarming, emotional, and at times hilarious nature. The promise of DLC to bring in characters from other Disgaea games is alive and well, and will keep the game fresh for many months to come. This JRPG is a must have.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2011"}

The first level was fun, the Starfox team chases a crazy monkey to the planet of Fortuna. Then the crazy monkey turned his space ship into a giant mechanical version of himself, very amusing and charming. But after the first level Starfox transitions from the N64 style to a weird Xbox style shooter. He jumps out of his Arwing and is told to shoot targets. Then he gets a tank called a landmaster. The Landmaster was very clunky. Even if had Nintendo focused on Arwing levels, it still has issues with voices. In Star Fox 64 slippy screamed \"Fox! NOOOOO!\" if I died. In this game all I heard was was \"Fox. No.\". Peppy didn't sound very peppy, he forgot to tell me to do a barrel roll. Pretty much all that the team did was ask for help in dull expressionless tones. If you do purchase a Star Fox game, get the original, the beta unreleased Star Fox 2 rom on PC, or Starfox 64.

This was mainly due to the fact that all the racing games I had played in the past were fairly similar and followed a formula (except for exceptional series' such as NFS and PGR.) I was very wrong to doubt this game. It is quite simply one of the best racing games I've ever played. It's not particularly involving (the level of customizability is very low and the complexities of moves and controls are few.) However it is one of the few racing games out there that let's you smash other cars to bits, leaving them in raging flames. Many of the racing modes focus on \"takedowns\" \"road rage\" and \"traffic attacks,\" creating a much more over the top, wild, crazy experience that tired gamers will find refreshing and addictive.If you are a fan of unique, excellent racing games, and own a 360, I highly reccomend you add \"Burnout Revenge\" to your collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K6DG","description":"","reviewerName":"aka TRAP","summary":"What's the point of going backwards? **SPOILERS**","reviewText":"**UPDATE** 3/19/11I just got done playing Warzone on the Botzone mode (.....wait, what?) and I just realized that it's much easier to shoot wihout aiming down the sights..so I'd give this game 3.5 stars.**END UPDATE**I finally convinced (forced) my mother to let me bring my PlayStation 3 back with me to college.  It's Sunday, March 13th, and I already had the week planned out.  Monday was for going to Gamestop to trade in some games for Killzone 3.  Tuesday was the day I received Tekken 6, my component cable, and my ethernet cable from Amazon.  And Thursday night into Friday morning, I'm already disappointed with Killzone 3.  I haven't felt this disappointed since I played Halo 3 for the first time........OK, maybe that's a bit too extreme, but unfortunately, it's close.However, somethings I liked about the game included it's campaign, though it's not as exciting as Killzone 2's, and a bit shorter/easier (Veteran took me 9 hours on KZ3, but Trooper took me the same amount of time in KZ2).  Not only is it shorter, but it seems.........rushed.  It's like they didn't take time out to fully develop the story to tell us exactly what happened after Killzone 3.  While I did enjoy the campaign, ducking in and out of cover, using (FINALLY! ) L2 to aim and R2 to fire, I couldn't help but feel that.....sometimes, none of this makes any sense.  Sure, we know why they were almost going to kill Narville, and how Sev and Rico saved him, but what happened to Natko?  Did Sev finally forgive Rico for being and idiot and shooting Garza?  No tribute to Templar for his efforts?  Anyone tell me what happened to Radec?  And it's like they all were like, \".....Visari's dead.  OK, anyway, how are we going to attack the ISA?  Well we should do.....blah blah blah\".  It's almost as if no one on Helghan really cared that Visari was killed, besides them wanting to kill his executioners.  Maybe they should hire someone from Naughty Dog to teach them how to write an amazing story.And another thing, SINCE WHEN DID VISARI HAVE A DAUGHTER?!I will say this.  Guerilla did an excellent job with making the characters show emotion (something that was beyond obviously lacking in KZ2), and the game is more colorful than the last.  But I don't understand how can the same city go from a bloodshed theme after being nuked in KZ2, to being more colorful in KZ3.  At least keep with some parts of the original theme.  And about the new colors....it's almost like they're forced upon you.  \"LOOK WHAT WE CAN DO!!  SEE IT?!  SEE IT?!!!!  Do you like it?  YOU BETTER!!! WE SPENT MOST OUR TIME ON THIS!!!\".......it shows.  I kinda liked KZ2's dark atmosphere.  Last time I checked, war isn't exactly a pretty site with lots of colors and smiles everywhere.  At least try to blend the two instead of saying \"forget KZ2, look at THIS!\"Control scheme......I don't know how many times must we tell you before you listen...maybe it should be law, but until you make it so that we may 100% customize the controls, no one will be happy.  I'd rather have L1 be Melee and R3 be crouch, but I can't thanks to Alternative and flipping the shoulder buttons.  When it comes to that aspect of gaming, I want my cake AND I want to eat it.  As I should, with no questions asked.So now that I've finished the campaign and got a feel for some of the maps while playing Botzone, it's time to hop online and see how it is!Well, how is it?................HORRIBLE!  GOD AWFUL!  BROKEN!  Makes me feel like I'm playing Modern Warfare 2 before it got worse!I'm dead serious.  For one, WHY DOES EVERYONE HAVE PROXIMITY MINES?!  Remember back in Killzone 2 how only the Sabetour got them, and couldn't abuse them?  Well now, EVERYONE has them.  Want to snipe while both being unseen and protected by a mine?  Just lay one down and watch a guy run right over it.  Yea, sure, it flashes red when you're near it, but be honest.  How many of you notice that when sprinting in the Infiltrator class?  Speaking of which, I want to know the genius that thought it would be a wonderful idea to have it so that the Infiltrator can melee without losing his cloak.  Please show me the person so I may hang them.  It is NOT a good idea.  It is a HORRIBLE idea.  Downright horrible.  So now anyone that wants to spawn-camp a team of unsuspecting players can just run around, look exactly like them, and stab them to death.  Good idea, Guerilla!Another gripe I have with online is the maps.  They are so unbalanced, it's ridiculous.  On one map in Warzone, the ISA are spawned at the lower end of the map, with the Helghast looking right at them from up top a tanker.  So not only can I already see you, I already have an amazing viewpoint to kill you, and if you're using the M82, STA14, or the sniper rifle, have fun picking people off!  If you're one of those unlucky people that get spawned on ISA, I feel sorry for you.  I really do.  But how about the one map where the ISA are spawned at a lower elevation than the Helghast?  So now, instead of the incident described above, they can crouch and be out of your view, but will shoot you dead before you even noticed what happened.  I guess Guerilla thought it was a good idea to go from balanced, fun maps in Killzone 2 to unbalanced, horrid, \"Infinity Ward did better in MW2\" maps.  Wonderful.Who was the idiot that thought it would be a good idea to have a rocket launcher as A SECONDARY WEAPON?!  IN TWO CLASSES?!  Please hang them with the other idiot that coined up the proximity mines for this game.  They deserve each other.  Oh, and to the Einstein that locked away the M82 and STA52 until later on in the game, and also removed the soldier class, and also made it so Tacticians now have Recon (remember the Spot & Mark from KZ2 that snipers had?  Yea, Tacs have it, now), just hang them all.  Matter of fact, lay them off and get smarter people working on that aspect of Killzone 3.  Those ideas were just horrendous.  It's bad enough to have a rocket launcher as a secondary and an assault rifle as a primary, but you do it to two classes.  So I understand wanting people to work for better weapons, but I'd have better luck throwing feces at my enemy than to hit them with some of the guns you get off the bat.  I can't believe it took FOUR CLOSE-RANGE shots to bring down someone......WITH A SHOTGUN!  Maybe it's just me, maybe it's lag, but I don't understand how someone can survive three shotgun shells before finally saying \"Well, time to die!\".  I also don't understand how bullets just disappear in mid-air.  One minute, I'm hitting the guy....he doesn't move, I shoot at him again, but the bullets missed.  NO ONE has moved an inch, I haven't moved my gun or my position at all, and neither has he.......so how in God's name did I miss the last five shots from the burst of the STA52SE?oh....and about Recon.  REMOVE IT! ........and Scrambler (way to steal that from MW2).  Problem solved.One more thing, why is it that someone can fully survive one burst, take another, run to you, and melee you?  Why is it that I can melee someone that's perpendicular to me?  Why does this game have so many problems online?  Why did they turn something that should have been amazing to something that we'll all forget by April when Mortal Kombat and Socom 4 come out?  Why?I almost feel like trading this game in.....I seriously do.  Pretty soon, I'll beat the campaign on Elite, and get bored with Botzone.  I hate to say it, but I wish I had gotten Black Ops instead.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVED KZ2 and hated MW2, but at least Black Ops did their online right (I would know thanks to playing in dorm rooms for hours), unlike Killzone 3, who thought \"Let's be like MW2 and let you do too much which ruins gameplay! \"I'm taking away your bananas, Guerilla.  You can't have them back unless you fixed this mess.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2011"}

As a previous owner and big time fan, I've been waiting for over a year for this game.. And after playing it a while, I was favorably impressed. At first I truly disliked this game. I felt the Sims were ugly and all looked like they had been chomping on Twinkies and had sort of fatty looking chins. After some screen tweaking, I made this somewhat more bearable. (For some reason the default install for my monitor was widened fractionally making everyone look much fatter). Even with this adjustment, the faces of sims still look pudgy and a tad baby-faced, but I've grown accustomed to it.What I like most about S3, is how automated things are. I no longer need to direct my sim to go to the bathroom, to eat dinner, or to perform various tasks. They DO them!What I don't like? I experienced some funkiness playing certain DVD's I could absolutely play before S3, came along. I can't prove it, but I believe S3, did something to my software on my computer so the drive is more particular. Second, I think the children do not have enough animations or actions revolving around them. Also, at times the facial expressions seem vacant and mannequin-esque. For instance when my adult plays with his nephew, his expression is kind of empty. Also, there are bugs that the game makers should've been aware of... Since they occurred in S2. Such as the babysitter kidnapping the baby when he/she is off shift.This is a fun game. I like it. And I play it more than my other games. I hope for an expansion sometime soon.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2009"}

This game is good, make no doubt about it... but it's not great. The problem is, having just played \"Gears of War 3\" and \"Uncharted 3\" in the last few months, the shortcomings of \"Binary Domain\" become clear. Ultimately, this title cannot quite keep pace with the darlings of the stop-and-pop action genre. At least not in terms of graphics, sound, pacing, and storytelling. However...What this game DOES do well is enable you to let off some steam by annihilating hordes of robots with an array of weapons, for which the ammunition is never lacking. It reminds me a lot of the good, old fashioned FUN that was packed into many Sega titles during the Dreamcast era, such as \"Zombie Revenge\". Sure, it's cheesy, and the dialogue between you and your squadmates is absurd, but it works quite well for those of us with a soft spot for Sega. Also noteworthy are the robots themselves... this is the type of seriously awesome robot design that Japanese artists seem to always excel at. The only games I've played with more robotic variety and slickness are \"Vanquish\" and the \"Ratchet and Clank\" series.When an injured robot ground troop was crawling toward me - utterly relentless, despite the devastation I'd wrought upon it with a dozen-plus rounds from my assault rifle - I could not help but be reminded of Arnold's Terminator, dragging itself toward the fleeing Sarah Connor. It sent a chill down my spine more than once :) \"Binary Domain\" is fun and cool. IMHO, you will enjoy it, so long as you're not expecting something on the same level of production as \"Uncharted\" or \"Gears\".","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000ZKDOV2","reviewerName":"Andariel Halo \"Disillusioned Smark\"","summary":"Potentially better than Grand Theft Auto IV!  A clone without shame","reviewText":"Name-drop time.  I had never heard of this game before the commercials, which I dismissed as a typical \"gangsta-ass\" Grand Theft Auto clone like \"True Crime: Streets of NY/LA\", which I tried and found to be utter trash.  Then came the video review by Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw, who thoroughly convinced me through the magic of getting points and money for everything from destroying and killing things to streaking naked and jumping out of flying vehicles.And so I bought the game and discovered that indeed, this is a shameless clone of Grand Theft Auto IV.  But where GTAIV disappointed some, Saints Row 2 ups the ante.For example, colors.  GTA IV is all the same shades of gray and dirty, gritty brown and gray like a real city would look if that city were run-down and perpetually so pallid that not even sunlight could brighten up the cityscape.  Saints Row 2 flushes its large world with so much color that every neighborhood looks almost like an entirely different city.In GTAIV, your character was the perpetually dreary, mopey, and fiendishly ugly Niko Bellic, who was dragged down by his fat cousin asking him out on dates that wasted gametime in between receiving tutorials on how to work anything with a keyhole or just a hole or a stick, and watching in-game TV.  In Saints Row 2, you have the ability to play male or female (with the storyline equally satiating a bloodthirsty, merciless man either English, Hispanic, or Black, or a bloodthirsty, merciless woman either White, Hispanic, or Black), with enough customization to make your character a morbidly obese acrobat with a mohawk or long dreadlocks, or a sexy slim model with bright green hair and yellowish eyes.If you're sick of looking at them, you can get plastic surgery in-game, in which you can even completely change your character's sex, race, body shape, and every customization option you had in the beginning.In comparison with GTAIV, GTAIV wins out with realism, as the ragdoll physics in Saints Row 2 are highly entertaining (and seemingly never get old) but are ultimately cartoony in how ridiculously over the top they are; examples include the Insurance Fraud activity, where you take dives and throw yourself in front of cars for money.  If you fill your adrenaline meter full enough, a speeding car can have you flying fifty feet in the air, where you can control your fall, and even bounce off the tops of other cars to go even higher, for even bigger bucks.  Another crazy example I experienced was performing a wheelie on a motorcycle at fullspeed, and ramming into the back of a pickup truck so hard, the truck flipped over and landed several yards away from me, whereas I only suffered a headwound that a jelly donut easily fixed.Yes, there is regenerating health, but I've found that even on normal mode (though even more so on Hardcore mode) this is going to be praised by the player for being a lifesaver---you take so much damage in so many missions, that without regenerating health, it would be utterly impossible to pass certain missions.Again name-dropping Yahtzee, he mentions that whereas GTAIV spent much time not encouraging, or even punishing the player for causing wanton destruction and death, the game here encourages and rewards you for it, whether it's sandbox mayhem throughout a neighborhood, or activities that gain you respect and money, such as assassinations, carjacking, jumping out of helicopters, Insurance Fraud listed above, racing, and one of the highlights of the game, spraying buildings with raw sewage.I say highlights because it's one of the most cleverly devised and hilarious activities in the game, in which not only do you cover things in sewage, but your truck is being driven by someone else, who deals out some of the best-written and most hilarious one-liners in any video game I've ever played.And just like you, they are in it for the same reason: to have fun!  For teh lulz.  To blow stuff up and laugh at society.That is what Saints Row 2 focuses on, and it succeeds wildly because of it.  Even the missions are innovative and fun enough to have me wanting to track down every one to see what happens next in the entertaining story and the variety of challenges awaiting me.With any game, though, comes the bad.  Though thankfully I can say it's not very much.- Vehicle acceleration.  There is a serious problem with almost every car that isn't a luxury sports car or a police cruiser, and that is a seemingly scatter-shot \"whenever i feel like it\" acceleration in which you can press and hold the A button to accelerate, and within several seconds, the car will come to a complete stop, despite you never lifting your finger off the button.  In the heavier cars, this results in your vehicle moving so sluggishly slow that you'd be better off ditching it, and running in search of a sports car to steal.  This is also insanely frustrating when you're supposed to be chasing someone or running from someone else, and you can't get your fat POS to do more than 20 miles per hour without smashing down on the A button so much that it becomes lodged within its hole in the controller.- \"Bonding Experience\" mission glitch.  For some people online, I've found that this only seems to happen once.  For me, this happened many times in a row, so frequently I almost killed my TV with my controller.  In this mission, the useless character Pierce succeeds in bitching his way into coming along with you on a mission to shoot down helicopters.  Since he's driving, you expect him to do so on a set path.  HOWEVER, a glitch occurs in which after the second helicopter appears, Pierce decides to do one of three things; either he rams straight into the side of a building, pulls back, and rams right into it again, continuing this until the car slides off the edge and continues on to option two, or does option two alone in which he rams straight into a powerline, then manages to slip past and ram right into ANOTHER building where he continues to perpetually ram into the building without ever escaping.  Option three consists of him coming to a total stop by the side of the road, and never starting up again, despite nothing in his way.- A seeming removal of gore after game development.  From the sort of things you end up doing, it seems like they originally intended there to be a variety of gory options which end up looking like glitches themselves.  For example: the katana, in which a special move can be delivered where you drive the sword up through your opponent's chin and have it burst out the top of their head.  While there is a quick blood-flow, the sword lodged through the head looks completely unrealistic, like an issue of clipping.  Another involves the chainsaw, which is utterly useless for regular sawing unless you come up to people and apparently saw them in half as you catch their head, and slowly grind down to their pelvis.  Except not only does the person NOT end up cut in half, but they sport absolutely no scar or cut of any kind from the chainsaw, or any bleeding outside of the blood-flow that occurs during the chainsaw.  Similarly, limbs don't come off, heads don't come off or explode, and no scars, fleshwounds, or serious injuries appear on anyone.Despite those issues, the game more than carries its own on pure entertainment value, and virtually all the buildings you can walk into are pre-loaded with the whole world so there's no need to have the game load up the inside of a store every time you walk in.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2008"}

A revamped fighting system offers up three different styles for each fighter (one includes a weapon technique). The multiple styles provide countless varieties of attacks for any given fighter.

Fatalities are also back and rich in graphic representation.New fighters join the cast of old favorites such as Sonya, Kano, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Kung Lao, Kitana, Quan Chi, Reptile, and Shang Tsung. The lavish environments surround your fighters with animated backgrounds and rich skylines. On some levels there are even breakable objects and hazards that you can interact with, such as pools of acid--the perfect landing place for a thrown opponent.In addition to regular modes of gameplay (arcade, versus, etc.), there is an option called Konquest mode. This mode allows you to learn more about fighting styles, read up on each character&#x92;s personal history, and gain Koins.

Unlike the pseudo-3-D Mortal Kombat 4, Deadly Alliance is the real deal: filled with lush backgrounds, realistic looking fighters, and buckets of blood, Deadly Alliance is the technological breakthrough that fans of the series have waited years for.  Although it has a few faults (Liu Kang is dead, the storyline is weak compared to storylines in past installments of the game), Deadly Alliance still offers loads of value.  Plenty of new fighters are introduced (Kenshi, Bo' Rai Cho, Drahmin, Frost, Hsu Hao, Li Mei, Mavado, Nitara, and Moloch), as well as bringing back old favorites (Cyrax, Jax, Johnny Cage, Kano, Kitana, Kung Lao, Quan Chi, Raiden, Reptile, Scorpion, Shang Tsung, Sonya, and Sub-Zero).  The older fighters have been given complete makeovers, and they all look phenominal (Sub-Zero's new look is a real highlight).  Each fighter has 2 different fighting styles, and one other style which includes a weapon; this feature is a welcome addition to the franchise and is pulled off almost flawlessly.  Also included besides the standard Arcade mode is the Konquest mode in which you go on various missions and earn Koins which you can use to purchase all kinds of hidden items (characters, costumes, arenas, production designs, etc.) in the Krypt.  Also included is an interesting video timeline on the history of Mortal Kombat, footage of the making of the game, and a video for Adema's &quot;Immortal&quot;.

In fact, you could make an argument for all aspects of this game taking a page from Borderlands (not really a bad thing though...Borderlands was pretty awesome IMO). The only part where it doesnt really take from that is in the way you customize your equipment, and the fact that you dont level up.The basic premise is that a meteor is inbound towards Earth, and some people are placed in stasis in the hope that sometime in the future, they can keep humanity alive. However, although there is widespread destruction after impact, not everybody dies. People gather into clans or towns, bandit groups, and so on...with some individual prospectors and the like. However, many humans become cannibals, and plenty are mutated by the radiation spread after the impact. They become problems for all humanity. Anyway, you awaken some 100+ years after impact (i dont remember the exact years, although it is part of the intro) with nano tech installed before going into stasis. So far, this allows you to jumpstart your heart if you die in battle (and kills any foes immediately around you).Anyway, the scenery is pretty cool, and the graphics are similar to Borderlands, although perhaps a bit less comic book-ish.So far, i have had quite a bit of fun, although i am only barely into the Wellspring quests presently.Update: I am now based in Subway Town. Although the battles can get a little repetitive, when you are trying to shoot a mutant that is running along the side of a wall to avoid your shotgun blast, you are reminded of just how challenging the game can be even though you have gotten 100% better. Still loads of fun.Update: Alright, finished. The overall length of the game is fairly short. I think i played for a total of ten or twelve hours. I didnt finish all the side quests available, nor did i mess around with the Wasteland Sewers DLC (yet), so i imagine you could add a couple hours to the length by simply wandering around and finishing everything available. The ending was fairly typical of Bethesda...a lot of build up to the end followed by a brief overview of the impact your actions had on the world. As always, that is the most disappointing part of pretty much every game they produce (even though Id were the primary developers i believe). You always hope they would put as much effort into the ending as they do the rest of the storyline, but alas, it just isnt to be apparently. That being said, i enjoyed the game, and for the current sub $20 pricing, it is well worth the investment. I'll probably go back to an earlier save point and finish up all the loose ends at some point, and am curious about the online aspect of the game, but that pretty much sums it up. Cool premise, fun gameplay, interesting story with a few twists and turns, pedestrian ending.Enjoy!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2011"}
{"product_name":"B008E6ZXRM","description":"","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"Old school - and that's not bad","reviewText":"Recently you may have picked up the re-release of Halo:CE for the 360 which not only includes a revamped look of the game with 5.1 sound, stereoscopic imagery etc but also the ability to instantly switch to the original in all it's ancient graphic glory. 343 Studios who handled the remake did a bang up job as they kept the purity of the gameplay but managed to up the graphics considerably.Doom 3 BFG for the 360 is not in that mold. It's effectively the old PC version running on your Xbox 360. There's no real improvement in graphics over a high-end PC of the time although the inclusion of surround sound is a nice touch. Therefore do expect some muddy textures in places and low poly characters. Since there's no real increase in graphics, given the extra power of the 360, it does mean the game easily runs at 60fps which is a nice smooth thing of beauty.The game is, as you may remember, a series of corridors with monsters that either materialize out of thin air or spring out of cupboards and shout 'boo!'. Really that's all there is. Sure there's a couple of little puzzle bits where you drop barrels into a furnace or move bridges around, but basically it's a linear trot from one area to the next with bad guys surprising you. And really that's all it needs! I'm playing through on 'Marine' difficulty and am enjoying every minute of the nostalgia the game is pouring out.Also included are all of the update level packs and of course the original Doom 1 and 2, albeit with the latter showing a sanitized version without the satanic imagery. The earlier Dooms play as they did without the ability to jump or look up or down and it still works fine. Sound on the originals, especially the music is a little subdued but it's still the same as it was.I do have three complaints one of which I feel is more serious than the others. Firstly you should not install the game disc if you intend to play Doom 1 or 2 as you simply cannot whilst it's installed on your HD. If you have an aging 360 then perhaps this might be a problem in terms of stress on the drive and noise, but really performance wise you don't lose anything. The second issue is in Doom 3. It autosaves at the worst possible time seemingly randomly and the action halts for about 4 seconds when it happens. There's plenty of elevators and areas with no action where the autosave would be preferable, but instead it seems to kick in when it's least appropriate. Gets quite annoying after a while. You have a manual save option at any time so a game-pausing auto save seems superfluous.My final complaint, and it's probably the most unacceptable is the flashlight (which you can at least now have on as you fire your weapons) does not cast real-time shadows. There's lots of environmental lighting in the game, in fact there's an NPC at the beginning that you follow and his lantern casts shadows everywhere. Yet the most important light, your own, does not. Even the original Xbox version had a kludged shadow coming off the flashlight. I cannot fathom why they left this out; there's plenty of processing power left and in terms of atmosphere you lose a lot without those ominous shadows coming off your torch. A star off for that.Other than that this is Doom 3. It's not better than Doom 3 was all those years... it's just D3 with all the trimmings on your 360 and the original 1993+ Dooms thrown in. And that's no bad thing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2012"}

This is the experience that core gamers have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Still Kept Me Waiting","reviewText":"\"Metal Gear Solid\" is a franchise that means a lot to me, on a personal level. \"Snake Eater\" is arguably my favorite game, and \"Peace Walker\" arguably my favorite portable game. I defend \"Sons of Liberty\" against critics who complain about the often bewildering plot, and I feel as if the extraordinarily long cutscenes \"Guns of the Patriots\" are entirely justifiable. And as soon as this latest release opened with Kiefer Sutherland uttering one of Snake's most memorable lines, I felt like this would be yet another game to add to my list of personal favorites. Sadly, that is not the case, and after playing through \"Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes,\" I feel taken advantage of as a consumer, despite some glimpses of sheer brilliance here and there.The very scant narrative content, which utilizing spoilers could be summarized in about 2-4 sentences, takes place after \"Peace Walker.\" Snake infiltrates a Cuban black site which houses several prisoners of war, hoping to find former allies Paz and Chico. He does so, but at a terrible cost which results in the nine-year coma that kicks off \"The Phantom Pain.\" Oh, yeah, and we get introduced to a new villain named Skull Face. That's pretty much it. No, I'm not being sarcastic. Aside from a few minor spoilers which I won't ruin, the narrative content of this game is a farce in many ways, and much like \"The Matrix Reloaded,\" ultimately an expensive commercial for the follow-up. Konami even had the gall to end the game with a teaser trailer for the next game, one that's actually shorter and less substantial than anything we've seen so far.If this comes across as me complaining, it's absolutely supposed to. Length is something that I'm not overly concerned with in games. Case in point: \"Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance\" was about four hours long, yet its content was substantial enough for me to fall in love with it and feel as it was worth the entry price of the expensive collector's edition. Yet \"Ground Zeroes,\" at thirty dollars, simply does not feel worth it from a narrative standpoint. It contains plot points we already knew were going to happen based on previous trailers, and background information on a minor locale that could be easily described in a passing sentence or two. Even going through and listening to audio logs... I mean, \"cassette tapes,\" doesn't add much to the world. This is an advertisement, pure and simple; a collection of tech demos to get players excited for \"The Phantom Pain.\" But instead of getting excited for free, players have the privilege of paying Konami to experience the feeling. It's sleazy, and as a fan, it's even enough to make me a bit angry.At least what little you do get is pretty incredible. That's right. As much as I dislike \"Ground Zeroes\" for its lack of content and inconsequential narrative, the gameplay is (no pun intended) rock solid. The new direction Kojima Productions is taking has finally won me over, still attached to fond memories of older titles. Players are invited to approach the situation in any way please, whether they want to go through non-lethally, shoot everything in sight, or even hijack enemy vehicles to go on a rampage with. Even in this tiny map, there's tons to do, several areas to explore, and dozens of ways to go through different missions. The more intuitive, open-ended combat that was introduced in \"Guns of the Patriots,\" then toyed around with in \"Peace Walker,\" feels very well-realized here, and I can comfortably say that any strategy could be adopted in completing the missions in this game.The only problem, then, is that \"Ground Zeroes\" is essentially a series of tech demos for what the new Fox Engine is capable of. There's the main mission, and then four more missions you'll receive upon completion of it (five if you collect the nine well-hidden XOF patches,) all of which can take as long or as short as you want them to. They all take place at different times during the day, and have different focal points. But quite frankly, only a few of them are much fun at all. A few others feel very cheap, such as one that's essentially an on-rails shooting segment, or one that involves blowing up anti-aircraft turrets. These missions are, by and large, very by-the-numbers affairs as far as video games are concerned, and nowhere close the level of inventiveness that one expects from the \"Metal Gear\" franchise. Also, the unlockable mission exclusive to the PS4, \"Deja Vu,\" is pretty flat, and relies solely on fan goodwill to derive any entertainment value from. Quite like the majority of this game.If you're looking for something pretty to show off to your friends on your shiny new PS4, though, this will certainly fit the bill... you know, considering you haven't already played the excellent \"Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition.\" This is definitely a beautiful game, and for the first time in series history, I feel as if the graphics do make a difference in relation to how you play. Spotlights  add beautiful glistening effects to surfaces, but they also blind you, making it more difficult to take them out, or to see if there are enemies behind them; the sunset realistically glistens off of the pavement, and as a consequence, far off enemies may not be immediately visible. On top of the practical usages of the graphics, everything is just plain gorgeous. The flora and fauna of the game are lush and vibrant (the scant bits we see of it are, anyway,) the character models carefully rendered down to the slightest details, and the various \"eye-catcher\" effects like rain drops and explosions are impressive. But while the game certainly is pretty, I just wish there were more to see here, a sentiment that, once again, applies to the rest of the experience.Another thing that applies to is the audio department. Now, as a fan of David Hayter (although I'm still not convinced he's entirely out of the picture,) I was very apprehensive about a big-name actor taking over his iconic role. Yet, the more I heard, the more I fell in love with Sutherland's rendition of the protagonist. We hear hints of sadness in his voice, the tone of a man who has seen more pain and suffering than he knows how to cope with, one who is about to boil over with explosive anger at any moment. But we don't really get to hear a lot of it, and most of the time, we hear longtime partner Miller giving him advice on his codec. That's due to the nature of the game, I suppose, considering this prologue is more about setting up the events of \"The Phantom Pain,\" and less about exploring Snake as a character. And the same principle goes for the music, really, as while what we hear is uniformly lovely, there's not much of it to go around. There are only two cutscenes, and a few different situations to experience. So, presentation-wise, what's here is nice, but there's not nearly enough.That's the problem with Kojima's latest, as much as it pains me to say. While I'm no conspiracy theorist, I would hazard to guess that this is a product Konami put out to help cover the costs of \"The Phantom Pain.\" Looking at what \"Ground Zeroes\" has to offer, and taking into consideration that the \"real\" game is going to be hundreds of times larger, I would boldly stake a claim that this is a project that the publisher, whose financial state has not been the best as of late, could simply not afford as it stood. Perhaps they urged Kojima to chop off the front end of the game, then sell it in order to build up capital for the rest, and to cover it up with claims of \"fan demand.\" Perhaps not. Ultimately, we may never know what prompted the bizarre series of events which led to us having this game plopped down onto our laps.It's irrelevant at the end of the day, though. The game is here, and is being offered up as a stand-alone release for thirty dollars. Thirty dollars that could net you countless HD collections of entire franchises, or three movie tickets (roughly,) or a Blu-Ray of a new movie. Even as a fan, I have to say that \"Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes,\" is not worth thirty dollars. It's barely worth twenty, as even at a reduced price, it's still a commercial that you're paying for, and it's still nothing that's not going to be recapped in a blip at the beginning of \"The Phantom Pain.\" What's here is very good, but there's not enough of it to justify paying full price for it.Kojima \"kept me waiting\" for this game, and unfortunately, I still am waiting... for the real \"Metal Gear Solid V\" experience.Score: 6.5","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00JQHU9RC","description":"","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"There's a reason why this game's as popular as it is.","reviewText":"I remember when Minecraft was first created a couple of years ago. Back then, and even up until recently, it didn't look that interesting to me. I'm into all kinds of different games and genres, but Minecraft just didn't pull me in when I'd see gameplay videos. Late last year, my daughter really got into it when she'd visit her friend's house, and not long after, it finally got ported to the ps3, which she immediately used a gift card on. Since then, no other game has gotten as much playtime, and I get to see her creations an an almost daily basis. She'd create dozens of worlds, all with something different and unique from one another, and while I was glad that she was playing a game where you could be so creative, I still wasn't that interested.Then I started up a file for myself and I got it.Minecraft is a game that this past console generation desperately needed. All-ages games of great quality are rare, and kids usually get the short end of the stick when it comes to games aimed at them. Unless it's Skylanders or Disney Infinity, there aren't many other options. Sure there's Rayman, Sly Cooper, Mario, Little Big Planet, the Lego games and a few others, but they're few and far between. And it just so happens that it appeals to people of all ages too. There's nothing really \"kiddy\" about it- Minecraft is a solid game worth checking out if you haven't already.There's no real story here- you start up the game and enter a randomly generated world where you get to do whatever you want. Your world could have lush forests, massive beaches, tons of rivers, or mostly be water with just a couple of small islands (as was the case when I started my first world. That one quickly got deleted). When you start out, you don't have anything, so you need to walk around and destroy things with your fists, taking the material with you in block form so you can make things out of it. Crafting is challenging and fun, and there are -tons- of things to make. You'll probably start out by making a pickaxe out of wood, mining away at stone and rock so you can make a better pickaxe that won't break as easily. Then you can break up stronger materials that make for strong homes, which keep you safe from the various monsters that come out at night.The number of things you need to make in order to make better things is overwhelming at first, but you'll quickly get the hang of it. Break up a tree to get wooden blocks, get x number of wooden blocks to make wooden planks, get x planks to make a sword and so on. Rarer materials like diamonds can make super strong swords and armor, making you a nightmare for Creepers and zombies. Making homes and buildings is a blast, and more simple than I expected. You just set down the blocks, as if you have giant Lego bricks, and insert things like a bed, stove, windows and more as you get the appropriate materials. You can even make potions to enhance your weapons and other things.Minecraft is one of those games where there's really no \"point\" to it. You do what you want. It sounds boring at first, and the easy-listening soundtrack may not help that impression, but once you start playing and see just how time consuming things can be, it becomes fun. Once I saw how long it took to make a house, a steel pickaxe and find materials I needed for other stuff, I had a whole new respect for my daughter and how much time she put into each of her worlds. When I saw just how big the worlds can be, and how deep you can go underground while mining, it really put things into perspective. And don't even get me started on the steps needed to face off against the game's \"boss\". If things get too tough in the game's main mode, Survival, there's also a Tutorial mode to help you understand things better, as well as Creative, where you can pretty much do whatever you want with unlimited resources and no worries about dying. This may take some of the fun out of the game, although if all you want to do is build a world however you want without having to spend a lot of time getting the right materials, this is the place to go. The best thing to do when you've gotten the hang of things, is to hop online and invite a friend into your world, or go to theirs. Have fun exploring the area, which I can almost guarantee will be completely different from yours, what with the number of worlds that can be generated.Visually, there's not much to say about Minecraft. it looks like an 8-bit game that got 3D treatment. That being said, it looks good for what it is, and I rarely experience slowdown. As I mentioned above, the soundtrack is on the snoozy side, with some relaxing piano tracks that loop, and there aren't many voices to be heard aside from grunts and growls.Notch, the creator of Minecraft, is pretty much rolling in cash with the success of this seemingly simple game that started out as a downloadable title for just a few bucks. Word of mouth helped the game become the phenomenon it is today, and I gotta say, he's earned it. Now, you can't go anywhere without seeing a kid in a Creeper shirt or seeing merchandise, from key chains to big foam swords and pickaxes. It reminds me a lot of when Mario really got popular in the early 90s when games weren't anywhere near as big as they are today. Perfect for people who just plain enjoy playing games or creating things, Minecraft is here to stay.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2014"}

Half (or even more than half !) the reason I bought this game ages ago is because it included a demo for Final Fantasy XII, and at the time, I was extremely excited about that game (although it ended up being a bit of a disappointment for me - check out my FF12 review if you're interested).  I knew almost nothing about this game or the Dragonquest/Dragon Warrior series before buying this game.  So, I wasn't expecting much.  So, how well did I end up liking it?  Let's just say that I got much more out of this game than I did from Final Fantasy XII...Graphics (score 8/10): If you are wondering why the character designs seem so familiar looking, it's because Akira Toriyama worked on this game, and he also did the character designs for Dragon Ball Z!  Anyway, the graphics are rendered in a sort of cell-shaded style (everything's a bit shiny and bulgy) but it's pleasing to the eye.  Everything is very vibrant, bright and colorful.  However, there is one thing I would consider to be a problem.  This game has an issue with re-using NPC character models over and over again, such that whenever you get to a new town, you might see three people with the same character model.  I have never come across another RPG that had this problem so badly, so I've dubbed this issue \"DQVIII Syndrome\".  I don't know if the designers did this as a joke (because it IS hilarious) or if they were too lazy to make more character models or what, but it's seriously noticeable.  Other than that, though, I have no complaints.Music (score 8/10):  The music is pretty good.  It's not anything that you'd probably want to buy the soundtrack for, but it's pleasant enough and fits the scenes of the game.  Next, let's talk about the voice acting.  Oh boy...  Well, I think the voice acting is quite good, but some people have complained about the developers adding just about every accent in the known world into this game.  Seriously, there's people with British accents, people with Russian accents, people with French accents, people with accents I can't even name...  I don't mind it in the least - I think it makes the game more colorful, so to speak.  Whether or not you like the accents, the actual quality of the voice acting is quite good, so no complaints there.Characters (score 8/10): Unfortunately, DQVIII's main character is a \"silent protagonist\".  I really hate games that have the old \"silent protagonist\" thing going.  Supposedly it's meant to make you identify with the character more, but I find that it makes me not care at all about the character since they have no personality.  To make matters worse, he doesn't have a default name.  This wasn't such a problem in older games that have no voice acting, but here it's just awkward.  The lines of other character's dialogue are written around this awkward problem, such that they are always calling him by a nickname (\"guv\") or just skipping over his name in the line.  The skipping over his name thing is quite irritating - every time I see a line with his name in it, I keep expecting to hear it out loud, but of course, the speaker just skips it.  It's really gets on my nerves.  Sigh, now that all that is out of the way, let's talk about the other main characters, who are actually quite awesome.  Basically, you have Yangus (the thief with the heart of gold), Jessica (the tough-as-nails buxom magic caster) and  Angelo (a charismatic playboy who is technically a monk/Templar).  They all have properly developed backstories and distinctive personalities; it's just a shame that the main character wasn't given the development of your other characters.  In contrast to the nice characterizations of MOST of your main characters, the villain, Dhoulmagus, is disappointingly one-dimensional.  He's basically just an evil dude who's got no real motivation (yes, I know he's not the \"real\" evil, but it all still amounts to a very stock villain in the end).  So, that's a little dissapointing.  Oh well.Story (score 8/10): Before I get to the actual main story itself, let's talk about the various themes present.  In the DQVIII world, there is a widespread religious belief in a \"Goddess\" and an extensive religious system of churches and cathedrals, etc.  So, religious influence is one of the present themes.  The game also addresses issues of social class, inequality and prejudice.  However, this isn't as serious as it all sounds; the game is actually quite humorous.  In fact, even the monster designs are humorous - they often sport smiley faces (my favorite enemy has to be the bunnicorn though!).  Now, all those themes are pretty much ancillary to the main plot, which is your basic \"track down an evil guy and stop him\" sort of thing.  Of course, along the way, you end up helping other random people with their problems - often for some really flimsy reasons (Oh, that girl vaguely reminds me of my daughter -  help her!).  The story of this game feels pretty old-school RPG-ish because of this.  I know that every RPG under the sun basically ends up with the same plot about chasing/stopping an evil guy at the end of the day, but they usually add some twist or difference into the story to put a fresh new feeling on it - but DQVIII really feels like an homage to old-school RPGs.  This could be good or bad depending on your perspective, but I found it charming and enjoyable.  My only real regret about the story is that they explore all these themes about whether religion is helpful or harmful, whether the aristocracy deserves to rule the people, etc., but at the end of the game it doesn't really feel like they've put a solid conclusion to any of these issues.  It's not like in Final Fantasy X (which has a definitive sweeping social change as a result of the events of the story).  DQVIII just sort of ends with you killing the bad guy, but it doesn't feel like much has changed.  Although, that may be the point of the story - maybe it's the idea that change will come gradually over the years rather than all at once.  Or maybe it's just a weak ending to an otherwise interesting story.  I really don't know...  Ultimately, though, I was entertained, and that's good enough for me!Battle System (score 8/10): The battle system is turn-based in the most traditional sense.  It's not an active time battle system like a good number of Final Fantasy games - this one has you inputting everyone's commands and then having them act once you are finished.  This feels very strategic and I like it (although I like ATB systems too).  There are plenty of nifty commands to choose from (spells and abilities and such).  One thing I really like is that everyone has a choice of weapons they can use.  In fact, whenever you level up, you get some ability points you can funnel into different weapons, improving your proficiency in that weapon and learning new abilities along the way.  This is quite nice since it gives this game some replay value!Gameplay (score 7/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  One thing I do not like about the control scheme is that it is quite different from what most RPGs on the PS2 are using.  I guess I've played too many Final Fantasy games, but I expect the Triangle button to open the menu and the O button to go back.  But, in DQVIII, the Triangle button is back and the O button opens the menu.  That takes some getting used to.  I do wish they had included an option to reconfigure the buttons to the player's choice.  That would've been nice.  I also have a number of other small annoyances concerning the gameplay that I'd like to address.  Firstly, I really wish the game didn't give you the option to quit to the title screen after every time you save.  It's not useful in any way; it only causes you to accidentally go to the title screen when you didn't mean to.  If you actually wanted to quit playing the game, you'd just get up and turn off the system, so this option serves no function except to annoy you.  Another problem has to do with the item system.  Each character can hold a limited number of items in their hand, with the rest going into a bag.  That's fine, I just wish that certain new items didn't go straight into your main character's hand (like things from the Alchemy pot).  Why can't that go into the bag?!  It's rather inconvenient.  I also wish you could see how much experience you need until the next level from the menu instead of having to talk to the person in the church.  Also, there's a bit of lag whenever you open the menu.  I'd expect that sort of thing from a PS1 era game, but this came out at the end of the PS2's lifespan.  It's not extremely bad, but it is a bit irritating.  I also wish there was a \"soft reset\" option; there's loads of times where you are grinding at the casino or some such and need to reset.  Instead of being able to do that with an series of simultaneous button presses or with an option from the menu, you have to get up and physically push the reset button on your PS2 (thus wearing out your PS2 more than necessary).  Lastly (and I'm going to feel like an idiot for saying this) there's the issue of the \"Zoom\" spell.  When you open the menu to use Zoom (it let's you return to towns you've been to previously), you see a list of the towns, right?  The problem is that it just stops after about seven places.  For the longest time I thought that you couldn't zoom anywhere else, but it turns out that you simply have to press left or right with the arrow buttons.  I feel like an idiot for not trying this sooner!  I'm still irritated at the game designers though because they give no indication that you can do this; a little arrow symbol or something would've been nice!  There's just several little things like this that are slightly annoying but they're not ultimate deal breakers or anything.  Now that I've complained endlessly, let's talk about some good things.  There's a number of minigames and sidequests which are fun.  The camera works well and has no problems.  They're nice enough to give you an option to get rid of random encounters (using the Holy Water or Holy Protection spell).  Oh, and the world feels very open and spacious, and there's little chests hidden here and there encouraging you to explore.  Furthermore, the game is very forgiving in that whenever you die, you just get sent back to the last church you were in with half your money gone instead of giving you a game over.  Hurray! Overall, the gameplay is quite serviceable, albeit with some small irritants here and there, so it gets a score of \"7\" for \"average\".Overall (score 8/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  Well, what can I say?  This game is pretty good overall.  It's especially appealing if you are a fan of older RPGs and want to recapture that old-school feeling.  I'm not particularly a fan of old-school RPGs myself, but I still enjoyed DQVIII, so it has appeal even for newer gamers.  I can't really speak about the rest of the Dragonquest series since I haven't played them, but if you are an RPG enthusiast then you should definitely add Dragonquest VIII to your gaming collection.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2010"}

You decide all of your characters attacks/whatever at the start of the round, and then then round plays out.  Unlike older game though, this game is (usually) very finely tuned.  Enemies throughout the game provide a consistent challenge, but not are not overwhelmingly difficult (as long as you plan your rounds intelligently).  This turns the relatively simple battle mechanics into genuine strategy because the choices you make actually matter; there isn't usually a best-for-all situations attack setup.  Unlike final fantasy games, you won't just be pressing the X-button  a bunch to get you through the random encounters.The game does have some nagging old-school mechanics that weren't finely tuned though.  The aforementioned random encounters are *extremely* frequent; get ready to fight a lot.  Combine this with random encounters that aren't pushovers, and its hard to play this game in less than 2-hour chunks and expect to make progress (unless you're just running through a city and managing gear/inventory).Additionally, it has the old JRPG standby of enemies having numerous attacks (some very weak, some very powerful) that they perform at random.  This means the same battle can be very easy or very very hard depending on whether they do a sort of average of their moves, or if they hammer you with multiple \"power\" attacks.  This rarely happens with random encounters, but is a big problem with boss enemies.  There have been multiple bosses that wiped my entire party out from full health to dead without me getting a turn in between.Fortunately, death is not a gameover in this game; you go back to the last place you saved and have everything you've accumulated so far (items, xp, etc) except your gold total is halved.  Early in the game you're so broke from buying items its not a big penalty, and later in the game you can find banks to store your excess cash and protect it from this (you have to go and withdraw the money before you can use it though).Also, its not possible to play this game without noting on how beautiful the graphics are for the PS2.  Even after being used to HD graphics, this game still looks great for what it is.  I'm usually not a fan of the artist's style (Dragon Ball Z), but I can't deny that the art direction in this game is top notch.One final issue: the game is too long by about 20%.  Its rare that I complain about a game's length, but the main motivation for playing this game (finely tuned encounters/strategy; not the story) wears thin past the 60 hour mark.So, to sum up, this is a game with old-school sensibilities (and problems) that is very finely tuned, challenging and beautiful to look at.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2009"}

{"product_name":"B002I0JBL4","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Duke Nukem 3D, Version 2.0","reviewText":"In a world of \"Call of Duty\", \"Battlefield\", and \"Halo\", many old-school FPS franchises have been lost in the annals of time. Attempts to recapture old franchises' glory, such as \"Doom 3\" and \"Quake 4\", produce competent results that fall short of greatness, simply because they're unable to decide to appeal to modern gamers or their original fanbase. Now, after over a decade of inactivity in the genre, Duke Nukem is back in the playing field. And unlike his 90's brethren, the lovable blowhard knows exactly who he's trying to appeal to. \"Duke Nukem Forever\" is a throwback to a simpler time in games, and that's why I love it.We meet Duke twelve years after annihilating an evil race of aliens from Earth, relaxing in a posh suite on the top floors of his own Vegas hotel and casino. Everybody is in a state of unease about a giant alien mothership docked above the city, but Duke is under strict orders to stand down because of the lack of actual hostile activity from the creatures. Standing down is something that he can't do, though, when the aliens break into his hotel and begin to abduct the women. \"Not my babes, not in my town!\", he exclaims, setting into motion his one-man assault on the hostile army. His journey will take him through fast food joints, destroyed city streets, alien hives, and Hoover Dam. In the end, he learns more about the hidden depths of who he really is.Okay, that last part's a complete lie, which is a good thing. This game, which would be rather cliche and annoying if made with a straight face, is an over-the-top circus of cheesiness, and Duke is the ringmaster amongst all of the chaos. Instead of trying to make gamers take this game down like it's serious business, they sprinkle in a healthy amount of absurd humor, stemming mainly from Duke's inflated ego, making it less cheesy and more a genuine parody. While some may say this is sloppy design, this reviewer found it a refreshing break from the typically serious FPS games we get nowadays.Which isn't to say Duke plays anything like those more straightfaced games. Much like the attitude prevalent throughout the whole affair, the gameplay is a strict adherence to 90's FPS conventions, almost to a fault. In between pumping enemies full of ammo from overpowered weapons, you'll solve simplistically irritating puzzles and engage in platforming sections that Duke's girth isn't exactly helpful with. Other critics think of this as some kind of downfall in the game's design, but it honestly isn't. To this critic, these supposed \"downfalls\" actually make the game more challenging, and more fun to play.\"Challenging\" is a key word here, because it seems to pop up a lot in other reviews. Enemies being too hard to kill, or platforming sections being too frustrating. These should really be taken as invalid arguments. In today's day and age, games will handhold you through platforming and combat segments, and only make you do quick-time events to finish off massive bosses or clear huge ravines. The slaying of Chronos in \"God of War III\" comes to mind. But not this game. While there are a few quick-time sequences, the main brunt of the game overloads you with tough enemies and frustrating jumping segments that you alone have to conquer. It's a very 90's mentality, and one that's refreshing to see in a modern game.Another thing that's very refreshing is the fact that the set designs are anything but typical. While the graphical \"power\" is admittedly rough and dated, the environments are all very interactive and inventive. Whether it's being atop Stratosphere Las Vegas while fending off aerial assaults, going through a fast food kitchen being only the size of your foot, or falling from an exploding Hoover Dam, there's a serious amount of originality present in these levels that it's forgivable if the graphics are less than stellar.Also making up for the lack of amazing graphics is the intentionally ridiculous dialogue shared among characters. While some may have made claims of this game being \"sexist\", this writer begs to differ. Both men and women are made to look like complete dolts in \"Forever\", worshiping Duke like he's some sort of god come to Earth, and making remarks that only be described as airheaded, headstrong, and ignorant. Knowing that this is a comedy game, this is supposed to be taken much like the dialogue in an average episode of \"South Park\" or \"Family Guy\", and not like it's part of some intelligent narrative. Those expecting it to be are honestly expecting too much.On the more human side of things, multiplayer is an absolute blast. Seemingly barebones at first, one creation of a match will open up a decent amount of options for you to experiment with. Maps are very fun and varied, with all of the personality and quirk present in the single player levels. Every weapon has a distinctive advantage and disadvantage, and as you play, you'll find what strategy works best for your style. Railguns are powerful, but fail at close range and slow to fire. Devastators fire off rockets at a machine gun pace, but are easy to misfire and kill yourself with. No one weapon is perfect, and that's what keeps matches from getting cheap or reliant on one weapon.This game embraces what people loved about \"Duke Nukem 3D\" and perfects it. It never tries to compete with modern FPS juggernauts, with the exception of Duke only being able to hold two weapons, and for the most part maintains it's own identity. While that identity is the furthest thing from perfect, it certainly is different from what we've grown accustomed to today. Whether \"Duke Nukem Forever\" was worth the wait or not is really up to you, in the end, but coming from somebody who has anticipated this game since he was six years old, this game was worth the 100 shelled out on the Balls of Steel edition. With plenty of replay incentives that shouldn't be spoiled, and promises of plenty of DLC updates, this game isn't going anywhere for a while.Welcome back, Duke.Score: 7.75","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"When size can matter","reviewText":"There's certain game series where I can say that I enjoy playing and find myself itching to play the next installment but I wouldn't call myself a die-hard fan of them either. It's sort of the difference between the day one buys and the ones you eventually buy down the line. I always enjoyed the Grand Theft Auto series when it made the move to 3D but I never really considered them my favorite series in gaming but since I have a Playstation 3, naturally this was on my ones to get. Seeing it all but shatter records including the massive amount of sales it sold within the first week, it certainly can raise the idea that this is one of the best video games ever. Well, it's impressive definately though the best might depend on how swept away you are by it.Story: You play as Niko Bellic, an immigrant fresh off the boat arriving in Liberty City (redesigned from the one seen in GTA3) with ideas to start living the \"American dream\", complete with money, women and success. But the dream always ends up better than reality and Niko and cousin Roman broke and living in poor conditions though through ties, connections and double-crossings, Niko can work his way up the ladder though success can also bring pain as well.Anyone who's ever played any of the previous releases will find themselves on familiar ground and the story found here is similar. You start either with nothing (here and San Andreas) or you're double-crossed forcing you to climb back up (Vice City, 3) and start taking on missions from numerous characters as you progress in making friends and new enemies. The problem is while Niko is a likable and even funny character, the supporting cast and their missions still follow the impersonal feel others had. Somebody will know somebody who will probably have more work for you and he/she will have you either kill someone or steal something or protect someone. After awhile it gets a bit too same-y and while the story is interesting, having to go on another assassin request gets kind of old.Graphics: If one were to look at 4 compared to San Andreas in terms of size, the PS2 game wins simply due to how much of it is actually in there. We have 3 cities, plus the outskirts in between each city but with the redesigned Liberty City which looks even more like New York than in 3, it's more about it being more detailed and diverse in its locations than simply a bunch of roads and buildings. The best part of the graphics I find are the lighting and the city looks quite gorgeous at night and especially moody if it's raining or a huge storm is around. There's the occasional framerate stutter and going super fast on your car creates a giant blur and pop-up issues but it's still quite a great looking game.Sound/Music: I've always loved the Grand Theft Auto series for its voice acting, mainly for how realistic it feels. While the Metal Gear Solid series is always well-done, the sheer amount of dialogue about politics, biology and the like makes it a bit too boring to hear. But here, characters talk like actual people and some are amusing in their own way. Sure Brucie basically feels like an OG Loc imitator and subtitles are all but required for Little Jacob and his friend Badman, it's still fun to hear the varied cast of characters.What I feel is a step-down is the music on the radio stations. One of the fun things about getting into a car was wondering what station it be tuned to and there's nothing like killing a crime boss with classical music blaring in a sort of \"Godfather\" moment or having a heavy rock song accompanying a high speed chase but here, I mainly tuned to the Chatterbox-esque stations and listened to hilarious skits and commercials.Gameplay: Same ideas as before. From missions to various stores like clothing, restaurants and strip joints but there is some changes and one is in the combat. While the targeting can still be improved, no longer being out in the open but instead taking on a Uncharted/Gears of War approach and being able to take cover helps though you'll occasionally be on the wrong side. My other gripe is actually choosing where you want to shoot and while sometimes you can choose who you want to shoot at, more often than that, your trigger seems to never want to leave the one guy across the way instead of the guy shooting and taking cover 10 feet to your right. There's a bit of free-aim if you lightly press R2 but it's not really as precise.I'm sure many will agree that getting chased by cops frequently got annoying in past games and it's still here and cops are still a bit too biased to you as well. On one mission, things go horribly wrong and we get surrounded by backstabbers prompting us to defend for ourselves. Only instead of the cops being called on the ones who started it, they're after your foreign butt and all but ignore the other handgun-wielding thugs. Should you be forced to be on the run, a circle will appear on your radar showing you the range of the police's reach in their wanting to arrest you so how to you drop your wanted level? Easy, outrun them and be outside their zone for a bit and poof, they forget about you. That is if you don't run smack into another police car, re-centering the circle and forcing you to outrun the new guy. Like the combat, it's a great idea but not as refined.Ditto for the cell phone which has been upgraded since San Andreas. Friends you make can be contacted and missions can pop up or they just call to make comments but the big feature is the options. Like a more enhanced girlfriend mechanic that San Andreas had where the more you date them, the more they like you, now everybody in your phone list pretty much can be taken out, whether to a restaurant or strip club or shoot some pool or take in a performance at a cabaret club. It's neat though used a bit annoyingly since you might call a girlfriend for a date while somebody else calls during the date asking you if you want to do something. Should you say no, they're a little bit upset with you. So wonderful, not only do I have to worry about making friends upset in real life, now I have to worry about Niko in a videogame being seen as an ***hole. But the phone does have messages, organizers for dates and meetings and you'll find yourself frequently consulting it.At this point, the amount of hype and success this game got seems dangerously close to overshadow the actual game itself with many finding disappointment in a game that isn't all that different from previous games and introduces new ideas that aren't fully fleshed out. However, along with Metal Gear Solid 4, it's hard to think of any other title currently on the Playstation 3 with the huge amount of attention and buzz so I'd recommend playing this though if you thought the games were starting to become a bit too formulaic then Grand Theft Auto IV might be a game that you'll admire more than fully love.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2008"}

I've already been playing Madden, THPS4 and SOCOM online for about a month and everything has worked practically flawlessly. There have been some server issues with SOCOM(great game btw) initially, but they have since been ironed out for the most part. With Madden, I've tested both BB and 56k(my cousin has 56k only)and BB seems to be lag free for the most part in my area, but 56k chugged a bit in Madden at my cousin's house using his network adaptor, but remained playable. THPS4 was smooth throughout. Setting up the Adaptor itself was pretty easy...probably took me no more than 5 minutes to install it and get up and running online. I'm sure it won't be that easy for everyone out there, but it was for me. The step by step interface was quite clean and easy to navigate and pretty helpful. There is also a little video to help you in case you're having difficulty. You'll also need just 137kb of free space on your memory card to save all your network settings. You also get a coupon to receive Twisted Metal Black: Online for FREE. All in all, I'm quite happy with my experience so far. The adaptor was easy to setup, you get a free game and comes with two playable demos, Madden2003 online and Frequency online and also a few video only demos of THPS4, Automodelista and a couple others. And all these games are free to play online. No subscription fee's or the like, whch is the best part about it.

Anyway, if you can find one, I recommend picking one up, espscially broadband users.

Each animal has a unique mode of operating, which means that the two interconnected narratives behind this game each offer their own distinctive challenges to conquer.As the armored, action-oriented scorpion, you'll string together stinging blows into deadly combo moves that culminate in cinematic finishes and decimate your opponents. Playing as the sneaky tarantula requires a little more finesse--you'll find yourself leaping from above onto your nemesis, throw out neatly aimed shots of webbing to paralyze your prey, and finishing creatures off with your devastating fangs.Wild Enemies and a Sinister Back StoryIt takes skill and composure to master the moves the scorpion and tarantula have at their disposal. And, even after you think you've got every move down, you'll find you need to learn methods, since these life-and-death struggles take place between you and a huge array of vicious, hazardous creatures, including wolf spiders, rattlesnakes, Gila Monsters, Tarantula Wasps, black widows, mantises, enemies of your own species, rats, and even humans.Beyond the immediacy of fighting for survival, this game features a story of greed and betrayal in the human world. Slowly unveiled from the disparate perspectives of the two headline creatures, this evolving storyline helps keep even advanced players engaged and guessing at the implications of their own actions.Explore Brutal, Unforgiving EnvironmentsWhichever creature you're playing as, you'll have 360-degree access to a wide range of 3D environments based in the harsh Sonoran Desert. You'll explore a gloomy maze of thorny brambles, forgotten underground tunnels filled with rusting pipes, an above ground wasteland packed with people's garbage, and even a desolate gas station. Each arena promises to challenge your skills as a hunter and a survivor in its own way, while unique angles and a sense of scale that turns small, familiar objects into major obstacles help make these environs especially prickly.","reviewerName":"PantsuPanic","summary":"A deadly mirage in the desert wastelands.","reviewText":"Deadly Creatures has a very interesting premise with highly unusual protagonists and unique gameplay.  The very creative level designs and exploration are interesting to traverse.  The excellent graphics and unnerving atmosphere are a treat.

I applaud the concept of this game entirely, but it's only half baked in execution.

Like every franchise that has spawned many sequels, there've been moments of greatness and moments when you're left thinking \"What were they thinking?\". While Mortal Kombat Armageddon won't leave thinking the latter, Armageddon isn't a moment of greatness either. With a roster of over 58 characters as well as a good number of fighting arenas spanning the entire Mortal Kombat history- think of Armageddon as a 'Best-of' if you will or, at the very least, a second Mortal Kombat Trilogy as pointed out by another reviewer. I'll admit; it's good to see some of my old favorite like Rain-Ermac-Fujin-Smoke and being able to play them in the Deadly Alliance/Deception vein. That, first and foremost, was worth plunking down the asking price for the game. That and the new stuff included in the game such as Motor Kombat, the kreate-a-fighter/kreate-a-fatality modes and the revamped Mortal Kombat Konquest mode(done quite like Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks). Yet, what chaps my hide is the fact that Boon and company decided to recycle alot of the animations from previous games and put them in this game. Come on, if you're going to give us a 'Best-of' game of sorts...give us some new animations to look at during the match, for chrissakes. Instead of seeing Scorpion spear the camera and pull it to him for the umpteenth time, you know?? Too, Wassup with this Kata thing at the end of the Kombat mode?? If you can look pass it's faults, though, Mortal Kombat Armageddon is a good game to end the series on the current-generation consoles with.After seeing screenshots of several next-generation games, I'm anxious to see what direction Midway takes with the next Mortal Kombat game. Hopefully, it will be a more realistic approach. It would also be nice to see them take the Mortal Kombat mythos into new genres(MMORPG?).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2006"}

I was a great fan of the series that followed and, thus, was very eager to get my hands on this latest installment. In a short sentence: FALLOUT-3 is A DREAM COME TRUE!It is a cRPG game in which the player can alternate between the First and Third person perspective roaming a world comparable in size with OBLIVION. The action has moved from Vault 13 and Southern California to Vault 101 and Washington, D.C. and the story brakes away from the previous bloodlines. However, the atmosphere of the original has been maintained and its scents sharpened: veterans will find it fitting like and old glove - whereas the new gamers are in store for a bag of pleasant surprises.The graphics are wonderful, the guns detailed and the environments highly interactive. Short of a screenshot, imagine what would HalfLife-2 would look if released today. And similar to HL2, FALLOUT-3 does not require an...ubercomputer to run smoothly. Once you see a NPC move though, you understand where the corners were cut.Character customization is carried out in great style using the new and improved PIP-BOY at the beginning. You exit the vault and the harsh reality of a world that barely survived annihilation slaps you on the face. Adapt or perish.The main storyline is there to be followed but FALLOUT-3 offers the greatest number of alternative choices I have ever encountered in a game! There is always a great number of paths to follow in order to achieve any goal - but every choice comes with a consequences tag. This is common feature of most classic cRPGs but in FALLOUT-3 I saw it implemented like never before. If nothing else, this sends replayability through the roof.Side-quests offer little besides distraction and experience points (XP) to be spend on character improvement. XP are gained solely by completing quests, emerging victorious from fights, finding locations, picking locks and hacking terminals - and they are not limited by the action they were earned. Leveling up is based on 7 basic attributes [Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility & Luck - acronym?;)] that, in turn, affect your (13) specific skills. Since leveling up is capped at Level-20, the game designers wanted to encourage replaying the game. On the other hand, it also means that your character will never realize its full potential (in case you are wondering why I withheld a star from FUN, that's the second half of it).The game is violent and gory but well within tasteful limits. Not so with the language - but it is tradeoff with realism. In a radioactive world, Sunday-school niceties are bound to go out the window.What deserves a special mention is V.A.T.S. (:Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System) which opens new vistas in cRPG design. It is an ingenious system which lets you pause the game and target specific body parts of your opponents. The success of your attack still depends on your skills but the end effect is cinematic and amazing (remember SWORDFISH?).After the nuclear summer of 2008 (with all the LimitedInstallation-defective EA releases), this seems like a postapocalyptic dawn indeed! BETHESDA decided to listen to the gaming community and did NOT cripple this beautiful game with any idiotic DRM scheme. Inputting a serial number and a DVD-check is more than reasonable.The publishers of FALLOUT-3 understand that there is a fine balance between &#34;protecting the product&#34; and...&#34;insulting your own customers&#34;. And they obviously view respect as the two way street that it is - and for this they deserve our support: buy this game, today.Voting with our wallets is the only argument the gaming industry cannot afford to ignore. And it is about time to cast some well deserved positive votes.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2008"}

I could sum up this game as that two word sentence and be done.  For people who aren't used to RPGs or even action RPGs probably won't have TOO much to gripe about in the game.  If you aren't used to RPGs or action RPGs this might be a good game to start with, especially if you only have the Xbox.  It's easy to get into and it's very light on most RPG aspects.  My brother bought it after playing mine and (until Halo 2) had been playing it non-stop, beating it at least 2 times in the time it took me to get 1/2 way through it.The reason it took me so long to beat the game was I lost interest.  It was at the 1/2 way point that I started to realize certain things.  My actions, while cool in the changes it had on me, didn't really do anything in the game world.  This is supposed to be a \"sandbox\" world that would react according to me.  And yes, people will run if you're evil or crowd you if you're good but there didn't feel like there was any oomph to their feelings.  They are all nameless, faceless, repeating drones who do and say the same things over and over again.  Peter Molyneux (the creator) had brainstormed publicly all that he hoped to accomplish.  He accomplished not even 1/2 of what he set out to do.Another complaint I had about the game was how linear it was.  I was expecting an open world (maybe like Morrowind but not as large and overwhelming).  Instead I was given small zones (complete with LONG load times) that had preset paths.  Not once did I feel like I was \"exploring\" the world.  I was being led down predefined paths.  In Morrowind (a game that shares some of Fable's aspirations in design but has it's own set of problems) whenever I found something, I truly felt like I found something no one had seen in years.  In Fable, where everything is laid out for you, I didn't feel that way.  I also wondered where the random events come into play.  One of the things Mr. Molyneux had discussed was how surprised he'd been by some of the events that happened that he wasn't expecting.  Random encounters on the road, little things like that.  The only \"random\" encounter I really saw was escorting a merchant through the forest.  Of course, after completing the mission I come back only to see the same merchant requesting help to do the same thing, same difficulty, same reward.The tag line for the game is \"For every choice, a consequence.\" And that tag line, in my opinion, was never truly attained.  Early in the game, you are given the appearance of consequences, but as it wears on I started realizing that my choices for good or evil didn't matter in the grand scheme of things.  Sure if you're evil you might have a different ending than if you played the good guy; but how many games are out there right now that you can do the same thing?  From the Suffering to Knights of the Old Republic I&II;, it's been done.  What I wanted to see is my decision to be evil (or good) truly weigh in on how people reacted to me.  That was the idea behind \"every choice a consequence.\"  It never stopped me from doing what I wanted to do; in fact it never made me think twice.  For instance, you could kill out an entire town and the same lifeless bots will return.  It never offers you any real consequences, just port out of town, wait 10 minutes then go back in, everything pretty much forgotten.  Also, Mr. Molyneux had suggested that if you fought guards in town, they would alert guards from nearby towns to fight and you would be a wanted man...what that translates to is wave after wave of guards, nothing more.It's also a very short, short, short game for an RPG.  Professional reviewers said it was about a 20 hour game if you do everything.  And I tried to make the game last as long as I could and it was only about 12 hours.  That also involved me not using my warp function to get to most places (unless it was a really long hike).  Like stated earlier, if you are looking for a game that gives you good and evil choices, you might as well stick with KOTOR since it will give you double or triple your gameplay.  Sadly, there's not TOO much difference between the good/evil mechanic in the two games.  They both, IMO, provide a shallow look at both sides.As for what's good in the game.  It's very easy to pick up and play which will appeal to a very broad range of players.  It's quick, doesn't take much brain power and is pretty easy.  The graphics are really well done, the trees and the forests animated very well.  Surprisingly, (with the exception of hornets, I have never seen so many hornets so often) the forests don't have much wild life...though that's probably because of the hornets.  Also, there was some weird clipping issues and graphical defects that happened once in awhile where it would appear that you were running in a HUGE sand pit.  Particle effects are nice, spells are fun to use.The best feature of the game is seeing what your character will look like.  This is what kept me going until I maxed everything out (which can happen really quickly if you know how to combo).  In fact, I really wish they would implement something like this in a MMORPG.  I haven't seen a character really turn out alike with all of my friends; that's an amazing feat.I've been pretty harsh on this game in this review.  I guess my biggest problem was it could have been so much more.  I wanted this game to rock, I wanted it to be everything Peter Molyneux said it would be.  I wanted it to be \"the best RPG ever\" (Peter Molyneux).  That said, I do hope they create a second Fable.  Maybe then it will fulfill gamers wishes.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2005"}

But SEGA decided to make a more mature game fit more for teens as they created a game that revolved around Shadow the hedgehog, the dark form of Sonic.Story-This is almost a spin-off of Sonic Heroes, as at the beginning Shadow is still trying to remember his past.  As he is thinking, though, some aliens called the Black Arms start dropping down and attacking the city.  The leader comes to Shadow talking as if he knows him, and reminding him that he promised to help them. Shadow doesn't remember this at all, but he sets forth to try to recover his memory.Gameplay-The game consists of missions that have multiple goals that are either Dark goals, Hero goals, or Neutral Goals.  For instance you start out with mission 1 and you can A.help the Black Arms kill humans B.help the humans kill the Black Arms or C.Get the chaos emeralds hidden in the city and escape.  Depending on which missions you complete, you are taken to another location to continue your story, where you choose your next mission to complete.  So, in fact, you are building your own story by choosing how you want it to play out.  The controls are rather simple, and it is easy to use.  Some people complained that when shooting at an enemy, it aims for you.  I rather liked this, for it made it easier on me!  There are a variety of weapons you can use from basic guns to sign posts to a vacuum type weapon.  Also, there are a variety of familiar faces in this game.  See, for each mission you have someone to guide you through the Dark and Hero goals.  The leader of the Black Arms usually guides you through the Dark missions while Sonic, Amy, Rouge, and more guide you through the Hero Missions.  There are checkpoints throughout the game to save on, and if/when you die, you go back to one of them.  You also collect rings in the game, as usual.  They aren't really good for anything besides getting a high score, but if hit, you lose ten of the rings you had.  If hit when you have no rings, you die.Graphics-The graphics are pretty good in this game.  They are usually very dark, but they are detailed, although you are usually whipping through the levels at a very fast speed.  The characters are designed well, but there isn't much blood, so don't expect the game to be gory, just detailed.Sound-The music is nice, but not as good as some sonic games.  It's usually very soft in the background that it's not very noticeable.  They actually all sound the same except for Circus Park which was actually a good one.  Don't get me wrong, the music isn't bad, it's just nothing to get excited about.  The voice acting is just like it is in any other Sonic game, so take that however you like.  There is a \"bad word\" or two in the game when you die, but it's not a huge deal.  The background sounds such as picking up rings and shooting are nice, as well.Fun-This is a really fun game.  It let's you kind of create the story which is nice, and the gameplay was fun, in my opinion.Length-If you want to play through everything it will take you a while.  There are 22 levels, 10 endings, and several Boss Battles.  Yes, there are 10 different endings.  Only 3 of them contain different \"bad guys\" but depending which ending you choose depends on how the story ends and who Shadow turns out to be.  After playing all missions and levels, I still enjoy going back and playing this game.This is a great third-person shooter for those who enjoy choosing their own story.  It isn't perfect because the music is kind of boring and other things, but it is a great game that takes the Sonic game, adds Shadow, and makes it a more mature game for teens.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2010"}

Hoover \"chicagojosh\"","summary":"Buy this one if you only own a Wii","reviewText":"Like pretty much every rhythm game, Guitar Hero can be insanely addictive. There's always that sense of \"oh, just one more song. Oh, just one more song. Oh, just one more song.\"The song list is incredibly deep and will keep you occupied for a nice long time. The difficulty level is a little off, though. The Medium was just a bit too easy to get through. There's definitely room to go back to top your score, but just blowing through the stages to get to the end was a bit too easy. Hard difficulty, on the other hand, lives up to it's name.An extremely nice feature is Practice Mode, which will let you take sections of any song and slow them down. I would have preferred a slider to control how much I wanted to alter the speed, as opposed to just full speed, slow, slower, and slowest, but it works well enough.An obvious thumbs down for the Wii version is the lack of downloadable content. Don't get me wrong - mastering every included song will take you awhile, but the fact that there's a definite ceiling to the number of songs you'll have access to takes away a lot from the Wii version.This is one game where one of my first concerns was simply whether or not it was lefty friendly. I think, for the most part, a left-handed person might have a bit of an advantage when it came to Guitar Hero because the \"picking\" doesn't need to be nearly as precise as when you're actually playing a guitar. Alas, I have the misfortune of actually playing the guitar, and I'm left-handed.The lefty flip option is simple enough, and the guitar strap is set up so you can easily play the guitar upside down. The only two issues I have with it are a) the whammy bar is a bit more difficult to use, so trying to actually bend notes can actually lead you to screw up, and b) the '-' button is out of reach. While tilting the guitar up activates the power-up, there are times where I'd really prefer to be able to hit the button with a free finger.While this is definitely a solid purchase, I'd only recommend it if the Wii is the only console you own. If you own an Xbox 360, then I would highly recommend going with that version.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2007"}

However, their peaceful life is soon interrupted when a series of events unfold pulling Kazuma back into the shadowy past he thought he had left behind.

Undoubtedly the best game in Sega's underrated series, Yakuza 3 packs a compelling storyline, a living, breathing, vibrant city environment, and some great action gameplay that is worth coming back to over and over again.  For those who are familiar with the Yakuza series, not much has changed gameplay wise, which is indeed a good thing.  Once again you play as Kazuma Kiryu, whose life of peace comes to an end when gangsters begin gunning for him.  What sets Yakuza 3 apart from other free-roaming types of games is the sheer freedom of things that you can do.  Ranging from confronting bullies to playing arcade games, Yakuza 3 offers hordes of replayability options.  For newcomers to the series, there are lengthy video segments from the previous games that recap past story events, and while the game's fighting engine remains practically unchanged, it still provides some meaty action moments.  The only real flaws with Yakuza 3 is the twitchy camera which can get quite annoying during combat, as well as the weapon crafting system, which feels like a throw away addition.  Small flaws aside, Yakuza 3 is a spectacular free-roaming action/adventure game that is wholeheartedly worth your time, regardless of whether or not you've played the first two games of the series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2010"}

After reading about the experiences of other players, I just had to take a look. So, I downloaded it off of Steam and started playing. Initially, it was nothing new to some classic scares you might find in a haunted house. But as the game progresses, the means of scaring the player change drastically, and have more of an effect. Amnesia would have to be, easily, one of the scariest games I have played. Let's take a look at some of the parts of the game itself:Story: The story is well hinted in the title, you have amnesia and are working to fulfill your task while remembering past experiences. The story is at times confusing, as the back story before the amnesia occurence doesn't go from beginning to end, meaning you might hear the first third of the story towards the end of the game. Some reading on wiki sites allowed me to fully grasp the story in full. Aside from that, the story does make a good play in keeping you involved.Mechanics: The physics engine is the main mechanic of the game, allowing you to move and object at the will of the mouse movement. This allows you to open a door just a crack to peek inside, or to madly slam it shut while being chased. Puzzles are used in the game and have been very well presented, making them not entirely easy, but not impossible (though some of the starting ones are easy in an obvious manner). Another interesting mechanic is the lack of combat. The only defense you have is to run and hide, which, at times, creates a sense of helplessness in the player, adding to the horror. It is a puzzle in itself to find a way to hide from a patrolling monster and avoid being seen. Also, along with health, you have a level of sanity. Lower sanity warps vision, makes the player character hear things and see things, and, overall, makes the game experience much more creepy and horrifying. Yet another puzzle: how to keep youself from going insane. This is a game has the greatest affect when the room is dark and with the headphones on, unless you got some buddies to enter the dark descent with you, which adds to the fun.Scare Factor: I don't need to stress how utterly horrifying the game can be. Many horror games apply the \"pop out from the dark\" scare, in which you get a jump and almost imediately calm down. This is implemented in Amnesia, but that is not all. They give you constant scares in which you jump from the scare from an appearing monster, but you also get a long lasting panic because the thing is still chasing you. This may not have an effect normally, but the game sets you up by putting you on edge at just the right moments, with sounds, insanity effects, and the darkness within some rooms. The game gives you a dilema to choose around. The darkness drains sanity, due to the main character's fear of the dark; however, dark spaces make for better hiding spots. Lighing torches in candles in a hallway keeps your sanity from dropping, but it just allows that route to be dangerous in the event of a chase. Worse, low sanity also makes the monsters more likely to spot you. Pressure? Plenty, but it makes the horror experience much more worth while.Sound/Music: The game soundtrack is very well composed. It provides a good ambience to the game areas and sets the mood very well. As for sound, this game provides one of the best presentation of sound effects in gaming history (at least in mine). Sounds range from bugs crawling, muffled footsteps, distant baby crying, monster sounds and many other creepy and scary effects. The creepiest I have heard is when a specific monster (with metal grafted to its skin) walks around, and you hear a distict, chilling, metalic creaking as it moves. It gets really creepy and horrifying to hear that in a cramped room.Some Cons: This is not a game for those who can't stand not taking an offensive. You don't get any weapons and hardly any defense more than to run and hide. That is more for specific taster, however. In general, the game does show some slight gramatical error, but minor and hardly noticeable. The story, as mentioned, could use a bit more work, allowing some story points to become a lot less scattered. Aside from that, it really is just the specific tastes that would make more cons.Overall, Amnesia is creepy, scary, disturbing, and horrifying in one package. And, thanks to fans, custom maps are abundant to extend the gameplay. At that point you would be at the mercy of the minds of those creators, which is why I never play a custom map, personally. With the right tools, you can also make your own map and story to creep out your friends. And, speaking of friends, I recommend having your best friend play this after you do. Since you know all the scares, it is fun to see another person experience them for the first time. Just look over their shoulder and watch them freak out!! >:D For those who want a unique, horror-game experience, Amnesia is the game to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2012"}

You get to use your Gamecube controller and have the option of using the gameboy advance as a controller. Another cool thing is you can use the e-reader with it and most accessories.CONS1. This is a big one for me: The games resolution on a TV is a bit worse than on the gameboy itself but this problem is unavoidable. You will lose a bit of clarity when stretching a screen to the size of a TV set. A picture size setting is offered which allows you to increase or decrease the size of the picture but it does not do much to help. Another setting which you can adjust is to make the game look softer or sharper, this doesn't work on most games either. What a waste, why bother including these adjustments Nintendo if they are totally useless?2. You must use a bootable cd (included) to play the games. You pop in a cd in the gamecube, insert the gameboy game and turn on the gamecube. I find it rather lame to have to use a cd to make it work. But its no big deal, I simply found it rather annoying.3. When you \"eject\" the gameboy game it literally flies out of the cartridge slot. Do not place the gamecube\\player on high shelves! Another thing I noticed is that Nintendo recommends you leave the game plugged in and not to remove it. Apparently the contacts get dirty easily (like the old 8-bit NES) and thats the reason they mention it in the manual. (Yes, they actually tell you to leave a game plugged in so the contacts inside do not get dirty). What the hell?4. The gamecube controller I found to be worse to use than the actual gameboy advance\\sp. But this is only a matter of opinion and taste. Some people might find the gamecube controller easier to use. I thought so too but it turned out to be awkward instead.Annoying little things and minor gripes when it comes down to it.

{"product_name":"B003O6CB6S","description":"","reviewerName":"Andariel Halo \"Disillusioned Smark\"","summary":"Teabagger's wet dream","reviewText":"Yes, I play COD games for the campaigns, too.  I was actually drawn in and impressed by Call of Duty 4, and even Modern Warfare 2 and World at War.  I feel so silly and nave now for thinking a few years back that maybe the series would push the envelope and be a bit more edgy by setting it in places like Israel, Sudan, or Southeast Asia and involve some people other than America and/or Britain constantly.Instead, we get this garbage bag of insanity.To get it out of the way first, the multiplayer is the same thing it's always been since COD4.  At the very least, it has female soldiers available now and I approve of this, as well as being able to customize your soldier (within reason) and upgrade them each individually.  Also, shiny graphics, much shinier than other COD games.But the campaign.  Holy hell.  At the very least, there is/was a history with the US and Russia that could conceivably justify a war between those two countries (despite it being played out), but the main bad guy in this game is &#34;all of South America&#34;The idea that South America (apparently with Venezuela at the lead) would even begin to take hostile actions against the United States, whether now or 20 minutes in the future where this game is set, goes above and beyond insanity and stupidity, even more so than the route Battlefield 4 apparently took with the US vs China.  Apart from the fact that &#34;all of South America&#34; and the US are within easy driving/sailing distance, the Venezuelan economy is inextricably tied with the United States---nearly 40% of all their exports go to the US, and more than 30% of all their imports come from the US.The idea that Venezuela would be able to overcome this massive reliance on the US to maintain its economy AND acquire a cornucopia of military hardware capable of legitimately threatening the United States within the next 20 years is FANTASY.But the game tries to justify this by claiming America has been &#34;weakened&#34; somehow, allowing &#34;all of South America&#34; to become the next superpower.  Yet despite being &#34;weakened&#34;, every other mission involves you, US soldier, deploying insanely advanced killing technology like drone strikes, remote-controlled snipers, and even a killer satellite to wipe out millions of non-white people.  Granted, this killer satellite is &#34;stolen&#34; by &#34;all of South America&#34; and used to attack American cities in the prologue, but its mere existence beforehand is just begging for some pack of buttholes to abuse it with horrifying results.  This satellite thing makes M.A.D. look tedious.Considering the high level of realism COD normally likes to take with its &#34;modern&#34; war games, this sticks out horribly as cartoon fantasy.And of course, much of the early action involves war with Mexico, with a gigantic border wall Republicans would wet themselves with delight to see being the center stage for combat.  And despite this, and occasional NPCs on your side having Hispanic last names, every character is a big burly white man.  Everyone.  Even the Big Bad turns out to be a former Ghost, in a revelation so insanely obvious that it becomes a plot hole to even treat it like a surprise.  Somehow the dirty Hispanics were able to brainwash a redblooded big burly white American guy just because his comrades couldn't save him from a life-or-death situation that would have killed them all, meaning this guy is either a massively petulant narcissist, or incredibly stupid.And another thing; I enjoyed the atmosphere of COD4 Modern Warfare, in part because the characters felt professional---they used military terminology, had very little dumb chatter, very little clich&eacute;-ridden dialogue, if any, and largely kept their cool under fire.  In Ghosts, it's the exact opposite in virtually every instance, and comes across like a bad Hollywood action flick than a military shooter.Normally I like replaying certain COD campaigns, picking up Veteran-level achievements as well, but IF I ever play Ghosts again, I will never touch this steaming pile of moronic pseudo-propaganda that is the main campaign ever again.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2014"}

{"product_name":"B000MK694E","description":"Take2 Games BioShock 21962 PC Games","reviewerName":"Ethan D Van Vorst","summary":"Who is Atlas?","reviewText":"Every once in a great while a computer game comes along and changes everything that preceeded it. Bioshock succeeds in raising the bar in absolutely *every single category* that can be stuffed into a first person shooter, something it's spiritual ancestor, System Shock 2, couldn't quite do, good as that game was. This game literally has it all; excellent plot (far beyond what I expected), gratuitous action, unbelievable beauty, and even though the game is linear overall in play, it gives you the ability to go through and play it several different ways. Bioshock takes the best facets of all the FPS games you love the most, adds to them a veritable feast of choices and looks, and puts on full afterburner. I cannot praise this game enough.As plot goes, you start the game as a man by the name of Jack (seen on a namecard on a present you're holding) and riding in an ill-fated Boeing 707 over the mid-Atlantic in 1960. Suddenly your plane plummets to the ocean below and you swim to the surface to discover that you're the sole survivor of the crash. Nearby is a lighthouse and after swimming through the burning wreckage you make your way inside it, discovering an old-style bathysphere, basically a diving bell with motors. Entering the bathysphere you begin your descent through fathoms of water and glide serenely past underwater skyscrapers covered with viewing windows and neon signs. The bathysphere takes you inside the city, which has fallen into incredible disrepair. The place is leaking water like a sieve and it seems the inhabitants of this place, called Rapture, want to kill you. Your only link to the humanity you're familiar wtih is a mysterious man named Atlas, who guides you via a radio.I kept apace of all the news releases on this game, and was a very regular visitor to the Bioshock website, scrounging even the smallest tidbits of information available. But given all of what I knew and expected about this game even I was surprised at how Bioshock surpassed my expectations.As the game continues to unfold you come into contact with nifty pseudo-magic elements, call Plasmids. One can shoot fireballs from thier fingertips, electrify pools of water (and the enemies walking through them), set traps, and much more. The game also provides a healthy, and era thematically correct lineup of weapons. No M-16's or AK-47's, but rather the tried and true Thompson sub-machine gun. An antiquated .38 pistol is probably my favorite weapon of the bunch, given the amazing flexibility it has with regards to ammo types. In addition there's the everlasting mainstay of FPS games, the shotgun, as well as a chemical jet thrower (sort of like a flamethrower), grenade launcher, and the ubiquitous sniper weapon, in this case a crossbow.As the story unfolds you discover that the source of the plasmids, and consequently of the denizens of Rapture's loss of sanity, was derived from a sea slug which imparts pure stem cells upon it's user. The inhabitants of the city began to use more and more of this substance, dubbed Adam, and eventually lost their minds. Eventually the sea slug responsible for secreting Adam became extinct and the only source of the stuff that's left is to be found on the dead corpses around the city. In a truly macabre plot twist the reacquisition of Adam is in the form of Little Sisters, young pre-pubescent girls who roam around the city, *manually* removing the stuff from the corpses and keeping it inside their own bodies. However if one wishes to \"harvest\" this Adam from Little Sisters they first must get through the walking tanks known as Big Daddy's, who are never more than 3 feet from a Little Sister. This is one of the most unique dynamics I've ever seen in an FPS and it really works.I've read some reviews here from people who beat the game in a day. I took my sweet time, not wanting to miss a single nook or cranny of Rapture, and the whole experience took me about a week. And I'm still not sure I managed to explore the whole place....it's *that* huge! The beauty of Rapture is amazing. The water effects in particular are beautiful beyond description. Standing under a cascade will result in distorted, blurry vision. It moves realistically! The game evokes an atmosphere I have *never* experienced before, not even in it's predecessor. You feel like you're in a real, functioning underwater city, with it's own unique ecology. I almost wish I could have seen Rapture when it was still functioning normally, before the advent of Adam.Like many others I had a great deal of difficulty getting Bioshock to run properly on my PC. Heck, for me it was almost an adventure in itself. Currently I run an Athlon 64 3200+ single core processor, with 1 gb of RAM and a GeForce 7600 GS with 512 on-board RAM. At the time the demo came out I was running an older ATI Radeon X800 (a card which I had absolutely no problems with, and I almost crashed my computer trying to upgrade. Suffice it to say that 2 days and a new video card later I was able to run Bioshock on my PC. I can run at high resolution for only a few minutes before the game becomes a slide-show, but even at lower resolutions the game is still incredibly beautiful. I'm upgrading my whole PC early next year and Bioshock will be the game that tests that rig out.Another issue that irked me was the *large* number of crashes to desktop that I had. I do not know if this is the fault of my underpowered PC, or some programming facet in the game itself that my computer just struggled with for some reason, but when certain sound effects activate (the electric tripwires were by far the worst offender in my case) the sound would reverberate and repeat for 10 seconds in a stuttering fashion, and then I would blink to the desktop. To make matters more irritating each time I would reboot the game I had to manually change all my settings again. My brother has the XBox 360 version and his did not experience this hiccup at all, which leads me to believe it might just be my PC and not necessarily the game.At any rate, crashes aside, I challenge anyone on Amazon to find a more beautiful and complete game than this one. It almost causes me physical pain to admit this, but Bioshock even surpasses Half-Life 2 in my book, and in my brother's too, as he admits. That's a nearly impossible feat and I've played many games that have tried to one-up HL2. *Many*. I am sad now that I have finished playing and want to start over again. I don't know if this game will have potential for a sequel or expansion pack...things were pretty well cleaned up at the end of the game, but I suppose that if someone was genius enough to come up with a plot like Bioshock does, then making a little extra couldn't be that hard.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2007"}

But I do not have time to constantly restarting playing the same old area to get to where I died previously. Camera does sucked at times.. Constantly have to adjust your camera to see your path ahead. Save points are far apart. Time is essence. With people like me who has tons of game to play, I wanna finished one game and move on to the next one. With such unjustable difficulty level, I think I would $%^#king forego this game and move on to the next one. I do not intend to kill myself with such difficulty. The creators are Gods I know. But there are a whole bunch of gamers around the world who are not God Gamers!!! Who seek a sense of completing a game because they want to experience the thrill and the excitement of a great game like Ninja Gaiden. However this I can say is definitely not worth my time playing it. When you create a game, you wanna make sure that gamers who play it can complete the game so that they will have an awesome experience and if they feel like challenging themselves to a greater difficulty level, then they may do so at there own will. Games must be created with various difficulty level in mind. If they want to reach out to mass gamers, that is just what they need to do. People like myself aren't expert at games but enjoyed playing and completing it to experience something that could not be experienced in TV, movies or elsewhere. With games it is the only hope for me to explore the sci-fi and fantasy world beyond my imagination. And yet Ninja Gaiden has failed to do so and my only advice to gamers are if you have the time to spend playing over and over again where you got killed, then by all means go ahead, if not find another game that will make you feel happy and satisfied. Because I know I am moving on, PERIOD!!! With this I rest my case.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2005"}

Unfortunately I had to return the console as it stopped working after a month of owning it. I purchased the game and borrowed an Xbox360 console from one of my friends so here's my review.Being this a sequel of a game that was a breakthrough in game play and graphics, it was supposed this would be better that the first version. While there are a lot of new features and new weapons, I still think the first one is way better than NG2.Some enhancements made are welcome and some of them were needed, the problem is that many of these changes affect directly the game in a major decrease of the level of difficulty. I recall the first NG to be a very difficult game even in easy mode (called Acolyte in NG2), NG2 on the other hand feels a very easy game compared to the previous one even when playing in `Path of the Warrior' which is next to easy. You start gathering new weapons very early in the game and if you get to master the ultimate techniques, it is quite easy to upgrade your weapons to a maximum level very early in the game, by using more powerful weapons it is of course easier to get rid of the `difficult' enemies in later levels. Another change is the auto healing system, you get into a fight with a certain level of energy, after you defeat all enemies on screen your life bar will regenerate to almost the same level of energy you had before starting to fight, which leaves all the healing items to be useless unless you are fighting a boss. Team Ninja did not think the auto healing was enough and made another change, each time you reach a save point and save, your energy bar is filled to its maximum. To me, all this auto healing system takes away the emotion and stress of seeing your life bar decrease in the middle of a fight.The graphics are definitely better than before, the stages are beautifully designed aesthetically, however, programmers failed when designing some of the levels as there are these `invisible' barriers in a lot of places that you cannot go through even though in many situations, these places behind these `barriers' are reachable by going around them. The camera movement is poorly designed and most annoying, using an ultimate technique or combo may result in a messy movement in which you may not see anything at all of what's happening on screen, I recall this being a small issue on the original game but this time the camera problem is SERIOUS. The story that was developed for this sequel is the most nonsense story I have ever seen even for a video game (in one of the stages one of the `Greater fiends' actually invites you to a Colosseum to fight him as he had been searching for a `worthy' opponent, all this as an excuse for a huge battle in the mentioned Colosseum) Fortunately, the game is filled with action and the plot only serves to set up the cinematic battles and sequences for Ryu Hayabusa.The almost perfect sceneries and all the action compensate for this game. There are very few calm moments during the game, opposite to NG in which you fought groups of ninjas/enemies and some fooled around while you were engaged in combat with one of them, in this one, all of them will be attacking you at the same time so you'd better learn some combos or rely on ultimate techniques as enemies will be all around you. Battles are intense and leave no time to catch your breath until all enemies are defeated (after you kill the boss I mentioned in the Colosseum, all the enemies watching the battle in the audience will attack you, you'd think that defeating the boss would be the end of it), in many cases you'll fight a boss and kill it only to see a cutscene that puts you into battle with another fiend immediately after that (be careful when fighting the Armadillo, when defeated make sure you block as it explodes and can kill you) . Enemies that play the role of bosses or mid bosses will appear as regular enemies in later stages... sounds difficult? Don't worry, we now have autohealing!I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the game, I actually like it very much and have been playing it like crazy, NG had unlockables and hidden items that gave extra value to replay, NG2 does not have anything at all (at least not that I'm aware of) but it's still a great game to play, stages are incredible, longer and filled with action, there are things I didn't like but there are others I just thought were great and I will not mention as I wouldn't want to spoil a few surprises.NG2 is a great game with beautiful graphics and filled with action from the very beginning, if you liked the first one like I did, you are definitely going to enjoy this one as well.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2008"}

Online play, Cloud Storage, Netflix, Internet Explorer, YouTube, ESPN and much more. People complain bought needing to pay for LIVE service, that Sony offers theirs for free. Well guess how many thousands of people had their credit card info stolen multiple times under Sony, several.

If you can't afford $3.33 a month, maybe you shouldn't be gaming at all, as games cost anywhere from $20 to $60.Review on the Amazon Card - I've only ever ordered a few cards from Amazon, which I have never had an issue with, but for those that are wondering if you should buy them here I would suggest going to Best Buy, Target or Wal-Mart to grab one if you can, faster, hassle free and that way you know it will work (unless scanned incorrectly).I've always been eager to endorse Microsoft's Xbox service and will continue to do so, a great gaming machine with great services.

They always seem to have faults that won't be fully addressed until an update to their hardware 2 or 3 years later. Nintendo seem to get it right the first time (apparently due to it's simplistic design). I'm not being biased, just stating the facts.Anyway long story short, I bought this slim PS3 to replace an older one which developed the dreaded YLOD (google it) after only 6 months. I vowed never to buy another... at least not until the price dropped significantly,  which it eventually did.For the first 4 months or so, it would freeze up (a lot) while playing games like Uncharted 1 + 2, Timeshift (ironically a game about freezing time), Infamous and Midnight Club l.a. However as of right now it seems that this has stopped, perhaps due to a software update.I'm really pissed off that they took away backward compatibility with PS2 games. My copy of God of War 2 is now completely useless. I have never owned a PS2 so I had hoped to purchase many of its games.

Beginning with the original Nintendo Entertainment System, I've always enjoyed the products Nintendo has brought to market. (I still break out my N64 every now and again to play &#34;Goldeneye&#34;, &#34;No Mercy&#34; and &#34;Star Wars&#34;). With kids of my own, I really liked the idea behind the Wii, get some motion mixed into gameplay so they aren't just sitting there using their thumbs. We had many family game nights playing &#34;Wii Sports&#34; and the Olypmics based games featuring Mario and Sonic.With that said, I was really hesitant about picking up the Wii U when it first came out. I was knee-deep in PS3 games like the &#34;Resident Evil&#34; series and &#34;Assassin's Creed&#34;, and didn't want to really shell out any more money for the latest and greatest Mario Games. To be honest, the Wii U looked like a money-grab, simply adding a big version of the GameBoy to the Wii system, and I didn't see the attraction.All of that changed the first time I played the Wii U. The touchscreen gamepad adds a whole new dimension to multi-player games, and even allows you to continue playing your game when the rest of the family would rather watch TV. I picked up this set with the Mario & Luigi game combo, and immediately got sucked back into the world of Mario, Luigi, Yoshi and Bowser. You forget just how much fun these games are if you've been away from them for awhile.I also bought the Disney Infinity game with a few of their figurines, and have really enjoyed playing all of these games with my wife and kids. It's almost become a nightly ritual where we will sit around laughing and playing Mario, or Disney for an hour or so. Even my son who spent most of his Christmas break playing &#34;Call of Duty: Ghosts&#34; on PS3, can't resist the fun and challenge of the games on the Wii U. (I've also ordered &#34;Zombie U&#34; to give a more adult title a try, and I'm really looking forward to it).And one of the best things about the Wii U, (something the PS4 and Xbox One should take note of), all of the Wii games work in the new Wii U system. Your old motion controllers work with the Wii U as well, so you won't have to keep your old Wii system hooked up if you want to play the old games you own, you can use the Wii U. Nintendo should be praised by all gamers for this decision. I've dropped a lot of money each game system, and it's great that we can simply plug &#34;Mario Party 8&#34; or &#34;Resident Evil 4&#34; or any of the older titles into the Wii U and just keep playing.Wii U also makes it easy for you to find fellow gamers online, similar to the PlayStation Network or Xbox Live. I haven't really played online as of yet, so I can't really review this portion, but what I really like with the online access, is that you can access the old Nintendo backlog of games. So if you want to give &#34;Goldeneye&#34; at try, or dig deep and go back to &#34;Mario Brothers 3&#34;, &#34;Donkey Kong Country&#34; etc. they are all available to &#34;rent&#34; or own for a small price. Basically all of the old cartridge based titles are at your fingertips.Wii U also allows you stream video services like Amazon Prime, Neflix or YouTube. In short, Wii U is a very affordable complete entertainment package in one box. Highly recommend this system and software.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2014"}

I'm really thrilled with the GameBoy Micro, with its small size and sharp screen.This super-slim design fits perfectly in your pocket or purse, something not easily said for the other GameBoy systems I own. The back-lit screen means the display is always quite crisp. The buttons are easy to use, the screen is quite easy to read. The volume can crank enough for you to understand what's going on.You get a variety of faceplate designs with each purchase, to customize it. I happen to love the pink ladybug design, but friends of mine really like the blue \"ammonite\" display. There's also basic black and other options too.You can play any GameBoy game with this system. You can NOT play old GameBoy and GameBoy color games on this. While some complain about this, heck, the game system is TINY. They simply couldn't fit all that other functionality into this tiny system. To be honest, if I want to play an ancient game, I'll play it on one of my other systems. I rarely want to do that. This micro system is just perfect for all of my modern gaming needs, to carry around with me. Heck, you could complain that this doesn't play DS games either. Well, sure, that's why I own a DS.I have a SP too - but the micro is much smaller and lighter. They are each different systems, for different reasons. It's like having an electric guitar and an acoustic guitar. Sure, they're both guitars - but there are reasons to use them in different situations. I'd use a SP at home - but I'd carry a micro with me when I travel.The Micro *comes* with a little velvet-like pouch. You stick it in the pouch, it's safe. The faceplate covers the display area too - so you can simply switch faceplates any time you run into a scratch, and get a new look too.As far as the smaller screen goes, it actually makes the display more crisp. For those of us with large screen TVs, you now how making an image larger also makes it more fuzzy. When you make an image smaller, you make it more crisp.

Max Payne 3 sometimes succeeds at feeling like a true sequel to Remedy's work, but sadly, somewhere along the way, it also feels like a Grand Theft Auto game in terms of characters and such. You'll meet many annoying and hyper characters that wouldn't feel out of place in Grand Theft Auto, but they do feel a bit out of place in Max Payne. The story itself has highs and lows, sometimes hinting at something greater while settling for something that's not on the same level as Max Payne and Max Payne 2. Some of Max's dialogue is very smart and entertaining, but a lot of the game contains dialogue from characters that feels a little out of place in the Max Payne universe. Another critique of the game's presentation is the distorted cutscenes that plague the entirety of the game and can become very annoying to sit through and watch, because there are so many cutscenes and they're quite lengthy. With all that said, the game's actual graphics and seamless nature with no loading once you're in a level is very impressive.The gameplay itself feels great when you're mastering the controls, but they can feel clunky and not very user friendly at times. This is a very mechanics heavy shooter where every button on the controller will be used.Despite my complaints, I enjoyed the combat in Max Payne 3 . My review may have focused more on the negatives than positives just because I feel they should be addressed. Remedy's Max Payne was much more impressive.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2012"}

With regards to certain topics, it should consider doing so.PROS:-Distinct soldier classes allow for a wide variety of strategies.-The support class can hold its own against enemies, unlike most support-type characters in RPGs.-The strategy game is easy to pick up, but hard to master, even for an experienced resource-manager from the glory days of RTS's.-Alien and environmental designs are interesting, especially for the latter being semi-randomized.CONS:-The sniper class is excessively overpowered, seemingly for no reason besides first-person shooter players think snipers are cool. It quickly becomes clear that the best strategy is to create a team centered around protecting and supporting a pair (trio?) of snipers.-Voice acting and plot are near-abysmal. The fake German accent of the scientist particularly grates.-Art style feels a little too quirky, ala Team Fortress 2, for an end-of-the-world scenario.-Glitches cause system crashes occasionally.BIGGEST CONCERN:As it stands, the interaction between the enemy AI and the fog-of-war system rewards a gameplay experience that is a bit too slow for my liking. Ultimately, settling in at choke points fails because you have to spot enemies for them to fight you, but running a blitzkrieg from choke point to choke point is asking for your last unit to spot some silly enemy that hid in a corner while its brothers threw themselves at you. The balance is awkward and ruins the game, because the solution is to creep forward at an absurdly slow pace of four or so tiles a turn, even when no enemies are in sight. The fog-of-war levels in Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn were harrowing because the enemies threw themselves at you as if they weren't hampered by the fog, but I'd prefer that to a slow creep.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2012"}

The first thing Sonic does is fight a monster called \"Chaos\". After beating Chaos, the camera turns to Eggman, who ominously tells himself Sonic has no idea what he is up against... the perfect start to the game. Sonic then goes off to rescue Tails from a plane crash, starting the first level. Emerald Coast was a beautifully rendered beach with a beautiful theme and HUGE 3D ACTION! The camera shifts and Sonic is suddenly is being chased by a giant whale! After that he runs through a tight cave... and then finally rescues Tails! After a happy reunion, Eggman steals Tail's Chaos Emerald and feeds it to... Chaos the monster. Congratulations, you can now play as Tails! He can fly! His levels involve racing Sonic and Eggman (Just like in Sonic R!), and thats about it. The best thing about Tails was his inspirational motto, \"I want to fly high! I shall belive in myself!\". After Tails was Knuckles, who had a totally different story. One night he was rethinking his life and why exactly he was guarding the Master Emerald, when somebody steals the Master Emerald (way to go, Knucklehead)! His levels are composed of finding the Master Emerald pieces. Knuckles wasn't nearly as good as Tails. After Knuckles comes Amy Rose, Sonic's... girlfriend. Her levels focused on platforming while avoiding a robot that decided to chase her. Maybe a 6 year old girl would find Amy and her obnoxious theme song cool, but the teenage nerd reviewing this finds Amy very annoying. Big was next... and Sega really should avoided this idea while in development. Big is a BIG \"cat\", according to the Sonic Team. He really looked like a purple bunny-bear creature. His whole goal was to find his pet frog... Froggy (what a clever name!). It was torture watching him trudge to some water in the great zones Sonic and Tails enjoyed. Twinkle Park was only a lake for Big. For Sonic it was a bumper car ride followed by intense platforming, and the great voices Sonic, Tails, Amy, E-102 Gamma, and Eggman made Big even worse. In a dumb voice Big constantly shouts \"FROGGY! WHERE ARE YA!?\".Thankfully, E102 Gamma came after Big. Gamma is a robot built by Eggman. You start out following Eggman's orders: Shoot the Sonic Doll, shoot the real Sonic, lock Amy in jail. After that, Gamma accidently sees Eggman torturing his robot rival, Beta, and starts to wonder if he should follow Eggman's rules. Like every good robot character, Gamma decides to betray Eggman and find his true destiny...*SPOILER!*Which, sadly, is exploding while sad music plays.*SPOILER OVER*Update (10/19/12): Okay, I am almost through with this game and feel like throwing up. The end is VERY intense, with the Final Egg level almost being impossible due to collision issues and camera bugs, but I got through it. Chaos actually succeeds and completely destroys the city (which is only made worse by the Dreamcast / Gamecube's jaw-dropping graphics), and the song that plays (Open Your Heart) really makes me sick.

Basically this is an anti-piracy tool (which works very well... Valve games are the LEAST pirated in the world, which is why they can offer consumers great value's such as the Orange Box).  Anyways, yes, Valve should probably disclose information about Steam on the box, however in my honest opinion, Steam is a great piece of software.  Steam allows you to access a bonus 6th game (Peggle Extreme... a great game in itself, worth another $10), plus once you activate your software on your account, you are then allowed to download it again on as many PC's as you want, and as long as you are logged in, you can play it on all those PC's (only one PC can be signed in at a time).  Additionally, Steam offers \"Xbox Live\" like features like standardized in game chat across all Steam games, achievements, and gamer profiles.  Steam is a great piece of software and should not be portrayed negatively.Next and more importantly is the game itself.  The orange Box is by far the best value gaming has ever seen.  5 games for less than the price of 1.  And each of the 5 games is a FULL game.  Best of all, if you are a huge Valve fan and already own any of the 5 included games, then when you install the game it will recgonize this and allow you to gift that particular game(s) to a friend.  I think other reviewers have covered the details of each of the games already, but if I had to rate each game individually, they would each get 5/5 stars.In closing, if you don't have this game already, stop reading reviews, and buy it now!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2008"}

The dialogue is witty, and a refreshing change of pace from the linear dialogue that Oblivion gave.  It is nice to have many different ways you can approach subject matter, and much of the subject matter touches on the modern issues many face today such as racism, homosexuality, and inter-race relations (should the real-world ever encounter alien life).Despite the dialogue, I can't say I enjoyed much else.  The story line is the same from every other console game I've seen Bioware make.  Your character eventually becomes a Jedi, I mean Spectre, and you get to travel the Milky Way saving the universe from an evil guy named Darth Revan, I mean an evil spectre.  You encounter many different enemies along the way, and you must choose whether to follow the path of the light side or dark side, oh sorry, I mean Paragon or Rebel.The combat system is supposed to be a new step for Bioware games.  I'd like it a lot more too if there wasn't massive slowdown when more than two enemies are on screen, or the occasional loading frame studder that completely disorients what I was shooting at.  If you've played shooters even seldomly on the xbox, you'll go insane with disgust about the jumpy frame rates.  The game forces you to use the pause feature frequently, not so much to figure out what Jedi power, I mean Spectre power to use, but because the combat system is too rough to be used completely as live action.The game has many frustrating parts that I didn't understand.  The long elevator rides masking the load times for areas were very frequent and boring. So many areas looked the same, forcing me to use the map feature  frequently.  A mini map would have solved me back tracking as much as I accidently did.  The Mako transport rides were the biggest frustration I've ever encountered.  I don't get why if I roll up too close on an enemy, I have no way of ever shooting them.  Getting adjusted to the sci-fi environment of the game was awkward too.  I kept getting the feeling I was being thrust into the second part of a story with no real background being developed.Bioware makes great games, but I just get the feeling they would have done a better job making Jade Empire 2 or Knights of the Old 3.  They also should release smoother copies of their game; not mask the frequent hardware problems this game has been having on crappy xboxes.  Perhaps I'm expecting too much from gaming companies to come up with something in a new format rather than a rehash with prettier graphics.  This game is great on story, and any Star Trek fanatic will have a field day with the depth, but it isn't for someone that's looking for a good gameplay experience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0017ZIIK6","reviewerName":"Brian Reaves","summary":"The best DC game to come out in years","reviewText":"Clear off your calendar if you pick this one up. This game is incredibly fun and addictive. The graphics here are amazing, and other than some strange costume changes for The Flash and Green Lantern, they're faithful to the comics. The Mortal Kombat side of things is pretty much standard as far as character build goes. There are a few minor tweaks, but you can easily see which character is which. DC has Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Flash, Captain Marvel, Joker, Catwoman, Lex Luthor, and Deathstroke. MK has Lui Kang, Scorpion, Sub Zero, Shang Zui, Kano, Jax, Sonja Blade, and Kitana. I missed seeing Johnny Cage in here, and I think Catwoman could have been scrapped for another hero like Green Arrow or Hawkman, but for the most part you can't complain about their choices.Each character has their own unique moves. It's easy to see where spending some time playing the same character will make you a formidable opponent if you take the fight online. Most of the characters have long-range attacks, and the finishing moves are spectacular!Playing in story mode is a one-player affair. First you choose which side you're playing on (MK or DC). The DC side finds Superman stopping Darkseid and accidentally opening a portal that begins to bring the two realities together with crushing results. In Story Mode, you play as each character over time, learning individual moves and getting just good enough with each before moving on to the next. Some of them have a bit of a learning curve, but for the most part the major attacks are the same button-mashing combination (but with different results for each). By far my favorite characters are The Flash and Captain Marvel. Flash has a move called \"Around the World\" that will leave your enemies spinning and unable to attack for a few precious seconds. Captain Marvel can call down the Shazam lightning on his opponents (among many other cool moves).By far this is the best DC game that's come out in years. Though the gameplay is basically the same thing between cutscenes (fight somebody), it's still a lot of fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2008"}
{"product_name":"B005EQE0YM","description":"","reviewerName":"JJ4prez","summary":"Great headset for a great price..","reviewText":"Hello all,This headset is a masterpiece in it's own way, therefore I decided to make a review about it. Remember, this is just amplified 50MM (huge for headset this price) stereo sound. This is not suppose to be surround sound or act like it in any way. When in games like Call of Duty or Battlefield 3, you will definitely notice new sounds from various things. Jets flying above you, gunfire from tunnels and subways, there are little sounds like the swooshing and ammo hitting the ground that I magically hear now when I didn't have a headset before. They sure do amplify certain sounds like running, hearing boots hits the gravel and jets afterburner above you come on.Score:Sound (FOR THE PRICE): 10/10. No interuptions that hinder sound quality. These things are loud, I can not turn them all the way up without bursting my eardrums, and I am in no way exggerating that. Also, you can always get the DSS 7.1 amp that tritton makes to hook up to these to have a 7.1 digital surround sound. The bass boost on this headset is down right phenominal. Deep bass interacts with rocket launchers or grennades quite well.Design: 8/10, They look great, the boom mic is outstanding. Not too sensitive, but picks up whispers when you need to be quiet at night. The leather at the top to rest your head is kind of cheap quality, but that's expected from a $60 headset. It's not fully movable like the more expensive types but it does have adjustable clip for bigger head sizes, and ear cuffs that move left and right. It's made out of plastic mostly, it's not the best plastic but it's not the worst.Comfort: 8/10, Again, for a cheap headset they are quite comfortable. They are realitively light and very movable for head sizes. The ear cuffs do not allow for humidity but it will get a little warm after awhile on your ears. I can go for about 3-4 hours with these before I start to actually 'feel' them on my head. I usually just rub my ears then put them right back on.Overall: 8.5/10, You cannot go wrong with these. They are virtually flawless besides a few things I would like to see in them, one of them being the concept where the voice chat gets louder on higher volume scenes in games and the other ones being putting more comfortable ear pieces on them.My only REAL complaint is that I could not use the 'play and charge' kit for the 360 with them because everytime I plugged it in the charger on top of the controller, the headset starting making this very annoying buzzing sound. I took them back to bestbuy and exchanged it out for another one. Hopefully the one I exchanged doesn't do that, but I think it's a design flaw instead of a defective unit. That's mainly why I docked a star. But other than that, if you do not use that kit, you will be 100% satisfied.Thanks for reading.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2011"}

I have to say I was hesitant at first with how much better sound these would actually produce but my worries were put to rest the moment I fired up the 360 and got to playing. I heard things that I was never able to notice before. I could clearly hear enemies footsteps coming from afar. If they were above or below me was easily distinguished and I was very pleased. Also being able to hear myself during chat was a big help also since I enjoy having the volume up during play. Playing late at night now is also not a chore. Now, with the wife sleeping I don't have to turn the volume down missing dialogue. Another plus is if you're tv itself has an l/r audio output then these can be used without the added expense of the add-on needed when using HDMI. Which also means I can use these with more than just my 360 & PC. With the audio out hooked straight to the tv, I can use these while watching tv, movies, or even playing on different systems like my PS3, Wii, and many other systems that I own. Like I said, the sound is amazing. Dialogue is crisp and clear. The bass is full sounding without giving you that distortion. Explosions and gunfire sound like i'm right in the middle of the action. So, if you're on the fence like I was don't hesitate. These are definitely the best headphones i've ever owned. I definitely don't consider myself an audiophile and I know there's even more expensive sets than these out there that may or may not be even better. But, for the money, this set of headphones will provide great audio experiences in gaming and more.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"Dan Truong","summary":"Legendary Masterpiece!","reviewText":"After 5 to 6 years of developing, Rockstar has did it again with the latest installment in the GTA franchise, Grand Theft Auto V! In my opinion, it's better than the past GTAs I've played. The graphics have improved, so has the driving, and the map is so huge. There's so much to do in this game. I don't know why some people say the story wasn't great because I thought it was very good and well written. It made me not only felt like I was watching a movie, but playing one as well. You have 3 main playable protagonists, Michael De Santa, a former bank robber who has a hard time trying to be a family man, and itching to get back in the game. Franklin Clinton, a gangsta from the hood who wants to get out of it and decide to make some real business in life. And everyone's favorite psychotic maniac and human hulk, Trevor Phillips, who lives in Blaine County and just basically insane. As you play through the story, you may feel like you're actually connecting to these characters. Well, at least 1 or 2 of them. Whether you beat the story or still progressing through it, there's still varieties of stuff to do in GTA V such as triathalons (3-part race), side missions from random strangers and freaks, buying businesses and properties, and finding collectibles. The single player will last you probably over 50 hours. If that's not enough for you, the online mode feels like its own game with the single player elements, character creations, and over 700 missions to play on solo or co-op with friends and other online players. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys open world games. If Rockstar decides to port it to next gen, I would buy it again for support. For now, this game is definitely in my book, not game of the year, but Game of the Generation! So go out there and get a copy of GTA V, or at least wait til it's ported to next gen.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2013"}

When I finally received it on Sunday (this was the first time I took SSBB out of my wii in months!), I couldn't wait to see if the game lived up to the hype.  I am glad to report that it certainly did!  The gameplay is just what you would expect from a Mario Kart game... so if you are looking for Grand Turismo, this is not the game for you!  If you are looking for hours of way fun kart racing then read on.  Here are some of my observations:Controls - I love that the wii games are giving several control options.  Initially, I tried the wii wheel control schema, and it is really well done.  However, I found that powersliding was a little more difficult using this method.  I was more comfy with the gamecube controller or the wiimote+nunchuck.  After playing for a few hours, i switched back to the wii wheel, and it was a bit easier than before, and a bit more fun.  In my opinion, the wiimote+nunchuck is by far the best control type.  Pulling off tricks is kinda tricky with the gamecube controller.Gameplay - Lots of people are griping about how the items you get from item boxes are dependant on your placement in the race.  I think it makes perfect sense and works well.  Also, many are complaining about the blue shell (which automatically wipes out the person in first place).  I admit is sucks to get hit while you are in first place, but in my experience, this only costs you about 2-3 seconds, and it has yet to cost me to lose a race (that I can remember).  I think these are really nice features to ensure that everyone has fun playing, including novices!Levels - I LOVE that they included lots of retro levels.  SNES Ghost track, N64 Bowser's Castle...  really exciting.  Also, all of the retro levels have been somewhat updated graphically... all in all the game is beautifully done.  Granted, it isn't Grand Turismo.... but again, if you are looking for those kind of graphics... you are playing the WRONG GAME on the WRONG CONSOLE! :PONLINE - WELL DONE, NINTENDO!  Brawl was OK in the online department, but so far, it seems that Mario Kart got it right!  It is 100% free to play online, and I haven't experienced any kind of lag, no trouble connecting.  Me and a friend were able to register each other in no time, and got playing right away!  One really cool feature is that there is an online rating/points system that is used to pair you with other online players with similar scores/skills.  This keeps the games a bit closer and fair.  I also love the fact that you can view people from your area (graphically represented on the map using their mii) that have similar times on various courses.  Kinda cool.  I can also compare my scores to my friends scores...which is a nice feature as long as I am ahead!  Again, I cant stress enough that the online portion  of this game is VERY well done, and is even more fun than the single player mode!  I played online the same day the game come out, so I am sure that there was way more traffic (pun intended) on that day that any other day in the future, and I had no problems connecting and experienced no lag (which is a bit more than I can say about brawl, as their online service had a rough time the first few days).Anyway, this game will receive plenty of 5-star ratings, so I wont ramble any further.  Do yourself a favor and buy the game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2008"}
{"product_name":"B004UDB9SA","description":"","reviewerName":"R. J. Gutt \"Tigercat\"","summary":"RE:ORC = FUN GAME!","reviewText":"Forget the negative reviews. Those people who played on a harder difficulty setting are dead wrong. I bought mine from BB DOTD and wow! am I glad I did!This game rocks. It is SO MUCH FUN! I played solo on Casual difficulty and had no problems! Each mission was a blast. The game is short, however, as it is intended that the player try all six characters in the campaign.Graphics are above average. The only down point about the graphics is that the Zombies kind of look bad, (they are dead anyway, so who cares?), but the rest of the game was awesome. I turned the brightness up all of the way because it is a dark game in some areas, and it looked terrific! Of course, it is not as good as, say, Dead Space or Crysis 2, but the graphics are good.Sound is ok. I thought the guns could have sounded better. They sound a little light to me. Compared to, say, Borderlands, these guns could have had more OOMPH in the sound. Overall, the sound was fine. I did lose voice from the video at the very end of the game, not certain what happened there. Perhaps I took too long to make my decision. I replayed the mission and it worked just fine.You earn experience points in the game, and each mission is graded in several areas, including enemies defeated, collectibles found, mission time and player deaths. The difficulty will also add XP. You can then purchase abilities for the characters and unlock cool new weapons. Don't think you can play this on harder difficulty settings the first time through, because you really need these upgrades!The A.I. seems to be a point of contention with other reviewers. Allied AI is just fine on Casual or even Normal difficulty. This game's harder difficulty settings were meant to be played Co-op! Not Solo! Anyone trying to go solo on Professional first time through is a fool! You need a team of capable players to tackle the higher difficulty settings. I had no problem with my A.I. teamates. They did damage and tremendously helped me through the campaign. They still died, but then so did I. One thing about the AI allies, they act as a shield in front of you so you can shoot around them, and they keep most of the numerous enemies busy by distracting them. Just don't shoot them in the back! Most of the game does not allow you to sit in cover and headshot everyone. It is a fluid battle. The cover system works well, but there are MANY enemies in most battles. Although your AI allies can distract the enemy, many enemies will still close and attack your character. The AI allies also like to use Close Quarter Combat (CQC, or melee) quite a bit, which sometimes gets them killed. In some battles, enemies just keep spawning. On the harder difficulty settings, the AI allies will most likely get chewed. And that is why there are so many bad reviews for this awesome game.You get a team of four, which includes your character. Here is a rundown of the allies:LUPO - She is the leader of the squad and is armed with an assault rifle. She has nice combat abilities to upgrade. I used her in every mission, so I do not know how she is as an AI ally.BELTWAY - He is armed with a shotgun and has grenade upgrades. He is a solid ally. As any ally, he can get overrun and die, but he is a great team member.BERTHA - The Medic. ALWAYS have her on the team! She can heal you on occasion. She will die about as often as Beltway.SPECTRE - Also armed with an assault rifle, has more firepower than Vector. Spectre has non-combat abilities, but is a good team member.VECTOR - Armed with an SMG. Has Cloaking. Loves to melee = and dies a lot because of it! Take Spectre on your team instead.FOUR EYES - AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS! NOT a good team member for the AI to control! Although she, too, has healing abilities, one of her abilities is to spray a Zombie with red stuff in an attempt to make the Zombie an ally. Works, too, except she is always getting infected and seems unable to heal herself. She dies often.Again, I cannot stress enough that the Veteran and Professional difficulties are designed only for co-op players. As the difficulty rises, enemies have more health and attack damage, and the AI Allies do not get stronger, so they will die even more often. If you stick with Casual, like I did, or maybe even Normal difficulty, the AI Allies are more than competent to hang with you. They may still die, but then so will you. Some of the battles are pretty rough.This is an excellent game. As a Zombie Hunting game goes, this was just truly awesome. Even the bosses were actually fun to defeat. It does have DLC, making the game a little longer. As it is, the game is about 6-8 hours long; Unless you play EACH character through the entire campaign. Also, there is MP for those who like that.Note: ANY character you play can have ANY weapon!Overall, Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City was a blast!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2012"}

My problem at the time was that I played too many random maps, which ended up being the same thing over and over (settlement building, army building, attack, rinse, repeat) and I got tired of it. I never even finished the Alliance campaign.In the meantime I played World of Warcraft (which is set four years after the events of Warcraft III) and then I decided to give Warcraft III another try, both to finish a game I never finished and to play through the storylines that led up to WoW. By this time I was familiar with the big characters and events, thanks to playing WoW and reading about the lore, but it was very exciting to actually play through them on my own. Part of the WoW setting is the aftermath of the invasion of the Burning Legion, so to see it all happen in Warcraft III was really quite amazing. While Warcraft I and II seem to be more straightforward (essentially dealing with the humans and the orcs battling each other), Warcraft III really expands the lore of the game world. Arthas falls, the Legion invades, the orcs travel to Kalimdor, the night elves reawaken the druids, etc. There are a lot of big events that you can play through in these four campaigns.My only complaint would be that sometimes it gets a little repetitive with the settlement building aspect. I know this is the heart of a strategy game, but completing a chapter could take as long as two hours simply because you have to build everything up, create an army, attack an enemy outpost (thereby losing many units), and then re-building the army to do it all again. However, there are many other chapters that do not involve a high degree of settlement building, and some chapters are straightforward exploration and questing. So thankfully there is a variety of play styles across the campaigns.Finally, regarding the Battle Chest product specifically: this is simply a fantastic value. It comes with separate discs for Reign of Chaos and The Frozen Throne, the original game manuals for each, as well as mini Brady game guides for each. Blizzard certainly did not skimp on the included materials for this collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2010"}

ALL the games are fun, even the first Metal Gear (which looks like PS1 graphics). This is recommended for anyone who never played Metal Gear and would like to own it. Get this collection now, don't buy them individually, it's a better value for the buck. Especially the 3rd game, which cost as much as this entire package.If your someone that is timid about shooters I'd recommend this as well. This game is so fun that you'll forget about the shooting(depending on which version) and instead wonder how to sneak around that enemy near that left wall, or perhaps lure that other enemy into a trap? This game is focused on stealth, and although you can fight enemies (which at points you have to) it's better to avoid detection.The characters are also \"realistic\", even in the PS1 version. From Snake's \"quirky\" comments and attitude, you'll enjoy the variety of personalities within each character and how they react to each-other as well. If Snake dies in the game, the characters will scream his name in desperation. Which can be a little sad.My only con is the memory card. The game did not \"read\" the memory card on the PS2 (This is the original PS2 memory card) and therefore I could not save. I turned the system off, back on, same result. I then cleaned the slot and card. Same. So then I had to reset the machine and pull the memory card out, then put it back in without the CD. Funny thing is that the system read the card itself. So I'm not sure if it was the game's fault itself, but I was finally able to save after deleting some free space and having to go up against another \"no memory\" lapse even after deleting some space before I was finally able to save.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2009"}

The planet of endless secret passageways where the Metroid are multiplying. Left alone the Metroid are harmless. But in the wrong hands they could destroy the galaxy. It's up to you to prevent the Mother Brain that controls Zebes from using the Metroid for evil purposes. But that won't be easy. You'll have to use your spacesuit to absorb valuable energy for your search to gain the use of power items like the Ice Beam, Wave Beam, High Jump Boots and Varia. If you survive, it will be you and your acquired powers against the Mother Brain.","reviewerName":"jdealy999","summary":"The original that started it all...","reviewText":"When the NES first came out in 1986, Metroid was one of the very first games to grace the public's appetite for consumption.  The graphics and euphoric soundtrack immediately got my attention.  The play control and challenge are top notch as well.As a female bounty hunter named Samus, you are responsible for exploring the planet Zebes to hunt down and destroy the evil Mother Brain.  Along the way, you will encounter many dangers, but you will find a vast amount of weaponry to help you out.  For example, when you go left of the screen from your starting point in Brinstar, you will find the Morph Ball.  You will also need to locate some Missiles, the Long Beam, and some Energy Tanks to keep going.  After that, there are 4 other words to explore:  Norfair, Kraid's Lair, Ridley's Lair, and my very personal favorite one of all -- Tourian, where those pesky Metroids are hiding!But before you CAN get to Tourian, you need to defeat the 2 mini-bosses, Kraid and Ridley.  Both of them aren't extremely hard compared to Super Metroid or Metroid:  Zero Mission, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they are so easy to defeat either.  And once you do each the Mother Brain, it's time to fire as many Missiles as you can!  Just don't forget that when you are encountering the Metroids, use the Ice Beam to freeze them up and then fire 5 Missiles to effectively kill them.So for any Metroid purist or newcomer, please do not miss out on this awesome original!  There are four ways that you can acquire it:* Buy the original 1993 NES cartridge (a yellow label with Samus's awesome suit picture)* Buy the GBA Classic Series cartridge* Unlock the original Metroid after beating Metroid:  Zero Mission on the GBA* Download the game onto your Wii or Nintendo 3DS (which is actually the least expensive option)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2013"}

It is \"grown\" from seed-like workers. All of their buildings regenerate health. They are able to create huge armies of creatures with little resources) and the protoss (an extremely advanced alien race, which uses force fields and psychic energy to power up their units).The game teaches you to manage resources, how to overcome obstacles and how to build a military base in such a way that it is both practical and defensible. Do any of these things incorrectly and your forces will be overrun. You will also need to learn how to deal with tight situations, such as when enemy infantry are suddenly dropped in the back corner of your base where you have few defenses. You have to deal with threats like this quickly before they tear your base apart.The online play is fantastic. You can have up to 8 players battling it out, in huge 4vs4 matches, everyone vs everyone or you can have say 3 human players vs 5 computer opponents (or any combination).I must have played over 2000 games online, and have become skilled in the use of all three races. I must say, however, that I still come across several players whos skill dwarfs my own. It's always challenging to play online, because there are so many skillful players.If you're just browsing for a new game to check out, this one will not disappoint you.

{"product_name":"B000GR9P76","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"A Perfect Spot for LOTR Fans","reviewText":"Pretty much every fantasy computer game that exists owes at least some of its content to the famous Lord of the Rings series by JRR Tolkein. It's no surprise that there is finally an online MMORPG based in this world.I grew up reading and loving the Lord of the Rings series. I dreamed of a world where Aragorn was by my side and we rescued the world from dangerous enemies. I would beta-test Asheron's Call, EverQuest and many other MMORPGs, always creating a ranger type character and giving it ranger-type names. These games would usually offer elves, dwarves and Lord of the Rings style situations - but it wasn't quite the same.We now finally have a game which IS in fact the Lord of the Rings universe, complete with the well-documented maps and histories of this world. You can start as a human, dwarf, elf or hobbit. Each race has a single starting spot where it learns the ins and outs of adventuring before moving on to explore the larger world.The character customization isn't as rich as in some other games on the market. Yes, you have a few hair styles, facial looks, and eyes to choose from. Depending on your 'home town', you get a selection of hair color, skin color and eye color options. I would have liked more level of detail to really make your character unique.You get the normal types of classes - rangers, fighters, magic-users, singers. Each game seems to have these, by whatever name they happen to use. You can swim through water, hike through mountains, or simply sit on a hillside and watch the flock of birds fly slowly across the gorgeous cloud-filled sky. They really did do an amazing job with the graphics here. It's well worth amping your system and graphics card up to see the highest levels they offer.You have to begin with all the usual quests - killing wild animals, fetching items. As you progress, you get to really customize the type of character you have. If you've got a musical instrument, you can play real songs you know! Fill the room full of traditional Celtic melodies!Really, when it comes down to it, every MMROPG offers the same general environment. You have a character, you learn skills, you get better at fighting / spellcasting / crafting / etc. as you go. The key is in how much you enjoy being immersed in that world, and in how much you enjoy interacting with the people you meet. I know many people who loved staying in 'older' MMORPGs, with relatively poor graphics, simply because their band of friends was there too. Back in the \"old days\" I played on DuneMUSH, an online text-based RPG set in the world of the Dune series. We had no graphics at all! What made the game so much fun was the role playing and interaction of the characters that were online.So that being said, since I love the Lord of the Rings series, I love being able to immerse myself in that world. It's like my two romance novels I wrote based on the type of characters that exist in Lord of the Rings. I adore that level of honor, compassion and moral courage. I would love to live in a world that offered that atmosphere every day. The Lord of the Rings MMORPG, details of crafting aside, gives me that opportunity - and draws in others who felt that same powerful draw of the books.If the Lord of the Rings MMORPG serves as a gathering point for people who believe in the meaning of Aragorn and Arwen, in Legolas and Gandalf, and why their characters have such a powerful impact on our lives, then that alone is a great thing as far as I'm concerned. And if I did nothing but talk for hours with those people, discussing ways to make the world a better one and to help out those less fortunate, then that would make me truly happy.If you just aren't keen on Lord of the Rings, then certainly give it a try, but you might be happier whereever your current friends are playing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2007"}

The only reason I bought it was because I was craving a new toy and saw that Gamespot rated this game a 9.5/10.  I think Gamespot/Gamespy/IGN/etc are a little easy on games these days, but a 9.5?  I figured there must be something in this game worth trying.They were right.I don't particularly care for racing games.  They just don't hold my attention.  But Burnout 3:Takedown is just downright addictive.  The controls are simple (even talked my wife into playing it with me!), but the gameplay mechanics are a perfect balance between art and science.  I won't go into the game's details, since other reviewers have already done that.  But rest assured, this game offers hours of adrenaline-pumping replayability.Battling other cars (and players online!) for position by trying to nudge them into the path of an oncoming Mack Truck, over the guardrail, or into the deep blue sea, is just as fun the 1,000th time as it was the 1st time.My only complaint is the soundtrack (just like everyone else).  It's pretty bland (and the announcer is a little irritating).  Both of these issues, though, are easily overcome.  Queue your own tunes up in the playlist and disable the 'Im too cool for this gig' announcer, and you're ready to rumble.If you don't feel like plunking down $50 for the game, at least do yourself a favor with a rental.Worst case scenario: You're out $5.Likely scenario: You'll go out and buy your own copy after renting it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2004"}

These zones are:The Air Zone- Tracks high up in the mountain and featuring lots of big jumps.The Fire Zone- Track oozing with new land and pools of lava that come from the island's resident volcano.The Water Zone- Here players will find courses laid out along the the beaches and other water sources of the island.The Earth Zone- The typical rough, rocky mud-filled off-road courses similar to the tracks found in the original game.Multiplayer ModesIn addition to the wild, anything goes singleplayer festival mode players of the originalMotorstormgame will remember and relish,Motorstorm Pacific Riftalso provides addictive multiplayer modes for both online and local play.

This one is no different and the terrain is stunning to look at when racing, but it doesn't make up for the really hard AI in the later levels and the loose controls while little rocks and bits of a fence can send the vehicle to a tumbling halt. There are different routes per track, finding the jumps can be fun, but racing along pretty much the same tracks with really unforgiving AI takes the fun away.The online multiplayer mode requires a lot of practice to learn the tracks to win. Most online players choose bikes for speed, if you'd like to beat out some online players, learn how to use the bike in all terrains.This is a game to pick up when it goes on sale, nice to have for local multiplayer, but not worth getting for single player campaign alone.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00005ME7X","description":"Originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System,Dragon  Warrior IIIis a Game Boy Color port of one of the all-time classic  role-playing games. The game reunites two of Japan's greatest RPG talents in Yuji  Horii (story and game) and Akira Toriyama (character design). Toriyama is also  known as the creator of the immensely popular Dragon Ball cartoons and comics. A  prequel to the first two games in the series,DWIIIcasts you as the  child of a great hero who must defeat an evil demon. New additions to the port  include improved graphics, new minigames, new items, and a better translation of  the original Japanese dialogue.The game starts off with a personality test that loosely determines how other  characters will react to you. Gameplay is standard RPG fare: exploring, building  experience levels, acquiring allies, gaining weapons, and ultimately going after  a large monster. There are some interesting minigames to mix things up. The  Monster Medals feature adds a collectible aspect to the game. Monsters may leave  medals behind after you defeat them. Some monsters only appear during certain  times of the day. Getting all the medals unlocks a secret dungeon. You can trade  medals via link cable to make things easier. Most RPG fans will love this game,  but those raised on modern RPGs might find its combat a bit tedious. This game  is compatible with Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance only.--Raymond M.

I remember playing Dragon Warrior 3 for the Nintendo ages ago (actually, it has been about 10 years now), and loving every gaming minute. However, time has passed, and I've grown older, so when I purchased DW3 for the Game Boy, I was skeptical as to exactly how MUCH excitement the game would actually garner from my jaded self (see some of my reviews for recent offerings of the PS2!)...Needless to say, I am impressed. The game mechanics remain the same, which is a great thing. In particular, the class system, allowing you to personalize your party however you want, is intact and better than ever. The game is chock full of side quests (including a charming little ditty where the player is treated to a game of human pachesi), and the length of the game is also impressive (and includes a bonus world, and even a bonus dungeon at the end!)...However, perhaps the most surprising and rewarding aspect of the game is the monster medal quest. Much like Pokemon, the player must try to fight as many monsters as possible. At the end of each battle, the player has a chance to collect a monster medal, a little trinket bearing the countenance of one of the creatures slayed in the last battle. These medals come in bronze, silver and gold grades, and may be traded via the gamelink cable to others. With over 150 different monsters, a player can literally be tied up for MONTHS trying to find these things. The game promises that something happens if you find over 150 different monster medals, but as of yet I don't know what this surprise is. Nonetheless, I will kill even MORE time with this little game, and though my dissertation may suffer for it, I feel it is time well spent...Buy this game! With the poor offerings of the PS2 right now, your best RPG bet is the Game Boy, and with gems like this (and the upcoming Breath of Fire and Golden Sun, as well as Legend of Zelda), you won't be disappointed! AND, they are much cheaper!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2001"}

Lethal","summary":"good gameplay & atmosphere, bad story telling","reviewText":"There are lots of lengthy reviews so I'll stick to what stands out having finished the game (NO spoilers).  There is enough variety in special powers to set it apart from earlier Bioshock games.  Personally I preferred being able to summon a murder of crows to swarm groups of enemies.  The guns are numerous but you can only carry two and some are far better than others.  I found the skylines disorienting and virtually impossible to use during battle, which is a massive problem during the final battle.Songbird is never a boss enemy at any point and only shows up a handful of times, a far lesser role than I'd expected.  Elizabeth never has to be defended, is good at not physically being in the way, and feels like a very complete character who I grew to like and care about.  There are racial overtones throughout but nothing near as bad as I expected given some reviews.  1912 was the Gilded Age and that theme is hammered on a good bit.Unfortunately the last 5% of this game left a very sour taste in my mouth.  The last battle is of a defend the fort variety where you have to take out waves of enemies before they deplete the health meter of the airship you're on.  I despise final battles that feel nothing like anything that happened during the game, and this one was so bad I almost switched to easy to get through.  It doesn't help that you're deliberately starved of ammo; more than once I was completely out and utterly helpless.  Without spoiling it, the ending is long, convoluted and makes absolutely no sense.  Even Metal Gear's plots are more cogent than this.If you buy this game, you will enjoy the ride a great deal, as I had a hard time putting it down, but the finish is so extraordinarily awful and unsatisfying that I'm knocking two stars off.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2013"}

I had for some reason played World at War first and although I loved the graphics and set pieces, I couldn't get over the over usage of grenades and the frequency at which you died and had to continually repeat the checkpoint.  I had Modern Warfare for a long time before I finally popped it in, and man is it an amazing game.Right from the beginning you are drawn in to the great plot.  I for one loved playing as an American better than a Brit, simply because the location and graphics were much better and more interactive.  The American part of the campaign was fought in a city and actually felt like you were in a war, fighting street to street.  Some of the night sequences just blew me away and I had to stop and just look around as the night sky was lit up with bullets and anti aircraft weapons, smoke billowing up from crashed helicopters or destroyed buildings.  This part of the campaign ended altogether too fast, but oh did it end with a bang, leaving me with my jaw on the floor.The British part of the campaign was more subdued, with most everything taking part in the outdoors, oftentimes involved more in the stealth operations than the all out combat of the Americans (which makes sense since one was of the Marines, and thus more combat involved, and the other of the SAS, and thus more covert operations).  I felt that the more relaxed pace kind of subdued my interest at times, until it again sped up towards the end with another sequence of events that leave you wide eyed, leaving you with a very satisfying ending to the game.Although there were times where I died a lot and grenades were everywhere (not so much as in World at War, though), I really didn't care because the graphics, plot and set pieces just blew me away.  I can't wait to pick up MW2 and see where it takes me.  A definite recommend.5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2011"}

Lerch","summary":"Great system","reviewText":"The Xbox 360 is currently the #2 best selling \"next generation\" (guess this should be the NOW generation) video game system, second only to the Wii from Nintendo.For your money, if you are purchasing a system where you wish to play nearly all the great games from this generation and HD movie viewing via Blu Ray isn't on your to-do list, this is the system to buy. Dollar for dollar, compared to the PS3, you are saving a ton of money while still being able to play most all of the must haves. The only must have games that you will be missing out on are the PS3 exclusives, not many of which exist (in my opinion only).The controller has a great feel and with a rechargeable battery, play time wirelessly is quite extensive. The only issue I have with the controller is that it doesn't come with the rechargeable battery in the box. With regular AA batteries play time is roughly 4-6 hours from my experience. You can get 3-5 times this with the rechargeable pack.The expanded hard drive space, compared to the previous Pro model 360, is 3x as large. One thing to keep in mind, this system comes with some games and videos on the drive, so when you first start the system you will have about 45 gigs of space, despite it being a 60 GB drive. Removing this content will get you up to about 52 gigs of space. The other 8 gigs, as with the previous 20 gig system, is taken up with the system software and data cache. Getting more than 52 gigs is difficult at best.That being said, for most gamers, this will be more than enough space. You will be able to save a ton of saved games and still have room for demos, movies and so on that you may want. If you are one of those people that likes to watch all kinds of digital content, then you may want to opt to purchase the Elite system for the 160 gig drive which should be more than enough for most of the content you may wish to watch. You can also plug in external hard drives and USB devices (USB memory sticks) in and watch content from there. You CANNOT save games or game content to an external drive.System differences:Arcade - 256 MB internal storage only, no hard drive, HAS HDMI output capability but HDMI cable is not included nor is the network cable. Standard Xbox AV cable is included (can do 1080p via component)Pro - 60 GB hard drive, HAS HDMI output capability but HDMI is not included, network cable included. Standard Xbox AV cable is included (can do 1080p via component)Elite - 120 GB hard drive, has HDMI cable and standard Xbox AV cable included.FOR THOSE WITH OPTICAL AUDIO CONNECTIONS -You may want to opt for the Elite if you use optical audio and want to use HDMI out. Microsoft has engineered the back of the system so that if you use the HDMI out option, the standard AV cable cannot be plugged in, which means you can't use optical output any longer. The ONLY way around this is to either hack your AV cable or purchase the over priced Xbox 360 HDMI AV pack. The cost is ~$50 and for only ~$50 more, if you purchase the Pro system, you can purchase the Elite with the larger hard drive instead.Kung Fu Panda and Lego Indiana Jones, included in this holiday bundle, currently sell for about $80 retail. That means you are getting an $80 value with this bundle for free. Whether you'll actually play the games or not, well that's a different story. If you wish to trade these games in at say, that popular haven for stolen systems and games, you're likely to only see an extremely limited amount of this $80 value given that this is 2 games in a single case that they know you are getting for \"free\" with your system.Over all I enjoy the X-Box 360's games. Some must haves for my money would be:Mass EffectGears of War 1 and 2Halo 3Call of Duty 4Fallout 3For those that think their system is too loud and too hot, the latest update to the X-Box 360's system software, the \"New Xbox Experience\" as it is called, you can copy games directly to the hard drive. You still need the game disc in the drive to start play, but the game runs entirely off the hard drive, which means the DVD-ROM barely spins up, making for a much quieter, much cooler (temperature wise) 360 experience. The only problem is that at ~8 GBs a disc, the 60 GB drive will tend to only allow 4-8 games to be installed this way. I install the games I'm playing the most to the hard drive and will delete them once I purchase games that take over from what I'm currently playing.In the end, which system you buy comes down to one thing: what do you wish to do with your system?If you wish to play games with people sitting with you physically in your house, the Wii may be the way to go (if only it weren't for all those party games)If you wish to play all the latest games over the Internet with friends, pick up the 360.If you wish to play some games but want to have the ability to watch movies in HD on discs, pick up the PS3.Or, get the best of all worlds and buy all three.**INTERESTED BUYERS NOTE**If you are looking for a system with the new \"Jasper\" motherboard/GPU, your best bet is to go into a physical store and look for the tell tale signs (systems built in late October and onward should be Jasper based; the power supply should be a 12 volt supply, giving 150 watts of power). I bought the Holiday Bundle from Amazon and ended up with the Falcon chipset (still has the older, hotter GPU).Comment Comment | Permalink","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2009"}

{"product_name":"B007XYBUBE","description":"","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"A very enjoyable brawler","reviewText":"The game would get a 3.5 from me, if that were an option. I simply didn't think it was completely deserving of a 4. It certainly succeeds on a number of fronts. If you're a huge Playstation fan, or simply want a party game for your PS3, then this will suit you well. It's pretty beginner friendly, in that (like Smash Bros.) your newcomer friends will be able to find a character and exploit some simple button presses within a few rounds. Where it differs from Smash Bros., moving more into the arena of something like the new Mortal Kombat, is the inclusion of special meters. Since there's nothing to knock players off of, almost all kills will come from using your specials. So long as you explain how these are utilized to your friends, you should be in for a good time.The arcade playthroughs end up being rather underwhelming, and they're all the game really offers up apart from multiplayer. Some characters could have done with a bit more balancing; as there are definitely characters that dominate by comparison. The game attempts to offset this by giving weaker characters more impressive specials, but (because the special meter requires hits to fill) these specials can be near-impossible to obtain. Online multiplayer also suffers from balance issues. You'll encounter plenty of matches with two brand new players going up against two heavy hitters. Lastly, the stages often play against their own appeal. There are stages from games for which there are no playable characters here, and vice versa. And some stages morph into scenes from different games halfway through matches. It simply strikes me as an odd way to approach design.But that's all the bad I can really think of. There's still plenty of good! Take the welcome changes longtime fans of Smash Bros. will likely adore. You push X to jump. No more depending on the awkwardness of pushing up to get into the air with this game. And throws are all performed using the right analog stick. Sounds strange, but feels great. Combos are easier to land here than in most fighting games I've played. The leveling of characters is pretty nifty as well; not adding or subtracting any abilities of the default character loadouts, just allowing you to make a cool player card, change your intro/outro, taunts, etc. And the specials do a great job of mixing up the on-screen action.All in all, this game may attempt to appeal to too many varied types of fighting fans to create a strong and cohesive experience for any serious fighting game fanatic. But it still offers up some serious Playstation fan service, alongside a host of unique ideas, wrapped up in a great party game. It also offers up a pretty easily obtained platinum trophy. And I would gladly purchase this item again if I needed to.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2013"}

Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

Music is pretty good, and the voice-acting is thankfully not like Resident Evil, but still nowhere near the level of MGS quality. Controls are near perfect, with the camera the only fault on here. Like any Capcom game, DMC has a good level of replay value. You can unlock a \"Easy Automatic\" difficulty, so first timers can enjoy it. But if you're a true gamer, you must play it in Normal, which is pretty tricky. Then there's Hard, which is, to say the least, hard( DUH! ), and of course, the ultimate setting, Dante Must Die, which is...well, I'll let you figure that out for yourself. Beat the last 2 difficulties and you unlock another character and unlimited Devil Trigger. What will draw people in is the action and the unlimited ammo, which is the best thing about the game, as is it would have been pretty lame to collect ammo while fighting demons. I only had a few minor problems, though. One is, while the replay value is pretty good, the game is still a little on the short side, but the difficulties should make up for that. Also, the camera can be an annoyance from time to time. The story, while decent, could be a little better. But that's just me. I highly recommend Devil May Cry to any gamer, whether you be an action, RPG, or whatever, I guarentee you will enjoy this. A 5 out of 5.

Rhodes","summary":"Legos+Star Wars=The most fun I've had with a game in years!","reviewText":"Who'd have thought that recreating episode I, II, and III with Legos would be such a fantastic idea?  The game not only presents itself really well, it plays really well too.  An innovative idea that not only looks good on paper (or the internet) but also on your Playstation 2, Gamecube and XBOX.The most astonishing thing about Lego Star Wars right off the bat is it's look and feel.  You'll play through all three Star Wars adventures using LEGO figures.  Going through the trilogy is a fun task.  Each level you're given a party.  Either play as the jedi and move things around, or play as a droid (R2-D2 type) and hover around.  You can even play as Padme and just blast everything in sight.What's even more appealing about the gameplay, is that you can switch between characters as you see fit.  If R2 isn't working out for you, switch to Anakin.  You can switch as you see fit.  The game will ensure you do this, as well.  Some puzzles you can't solve as any one character.  So if you're thinking you can just be Obi-Wan throughout the whole segment of a level you're wrong.  You'll eventually have to use someone else.You can also kill your allies any time you want.  This means you can actually umm... \"kill\" Jar Jar Binks!  You can do it all you want too.  There's no way to actually \"die\" in Lego Star Wars.  There's also no such thing as a game over.  The only penalty you get is losing all the money and goodies you collected along the way.You can also play in co-op mode with a friend.  And if you get bored you can always hack and slash at each other.  Kill your best friend and take his money, that's the way to do it in Lego Star Wars!  Since you literally have infinite lives, knock yourself out (and you can do that too).The game also has a brand sense of humor.  For example, when you dispatch an enemy the lego pieces actually shatter.  When you blow stuff up, the lego blocks get scattered around.  Even when you move things with the jedi they stack on each other as if they were legos.  It's amazing to look at and has marvelous detail to it.The game is, unfortunately, rather short.  However, this is easily made up in the replay value and the unlockables.  This game has more unlockables than gold bars in Fort Knox.  You can unlock a multitude of characters, including Darth Maul and Count Dooku.  Quickly you'll forget that you can't die, and be glad that you really can't.  Otherwise the fun would be over too soon.  Likewise, you may need an unlockable character to collect everything the game has.  If you can't reach a certain area, it may be because you haven't unlocked the right character yet.The music is also perfect.  John Williams music score sounds fantastic.  The humor in the game is great, and the look and feel is perfect.  This game may be aimed at kids, but even adults will have a lot of fun with it.  Because this game is just that: Fun.  You can battle your friends and the only penalty you'll suffer is him (or her) stealing all your money.  But hey, isn't it worth it just to kill Jar Jar?The Good+The game is just all out FUN!+Nice brand of humor+The Lego look is awesome+You can play as a multitude of characters+Switch any time you want+You can't die!  So the fun never ends+A multitude of unlockables+REALLY high replay value+You can kill any character at any time, regardless of anything.  This means if you want you can actually off Jar Jar Binks as many times as you want! (they do respawn of course)The Bad-The game is rather short-There's little, if any, challenge at all... but honestly... who cares?I can't wait for Lego Star Wars II when we get to play through the original trilogy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2006"}

But fans ofGTA IIIshould note that  whileState of Emergencycontains adult themes and extremely violent  gameplay, that's pretty much where the similarities end. WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player. In spite of these flaws, the game remains  addictive and fun. It bears repeating that gamers looking for anotherGTA  IIIwill not find it here: this game provides an arcadelike experience  that's excellent, but in a very different way.

Max Payne has a self adjusting difficulty level and introduces the new \"bullet time\", allowing you to slow down and take better control of the situation.  This game is just an endless slug fest.

It is one of the best games on the 360 but if you don't have that console you can still play it on a high-end PC. It is a strongly story driven game with film qualities on the scale of a Star Wars movie come to life. Although the method is standard cut-scene followed by exploration followed by battle sequences and boss battles, it is a lot more dynamic and the story is well beyond satisfactory. It's really first-rate.You play a space marine called Shepard (you design your own character) who has been promoted to the position of Spectre by the Council to expose an interstellar conspiracy by Saren to bring the dark apocalyptic forces of Sovereign into the universe. You command the SSV Normandy and go about trying to prevent this by engaging Geth soldiers and trying to locate beacons that will reveal more about the end times' prophecy that they are trying to avert. There is a real sense of urgency while you travel the galaxy along with some amazing animations that are on par with Manga/Anime. The final battle sequences are nothing short of dazzling.How a cut-scene works depends largely on the choices that you make. While there is a general plot there are many ways to go about it and you can choose a series of different responses when you engage different characters.  The exploration sequences usually involve either walking around some vast off-world building complex searching for clues and answers or driving in an all-terrain vehicle on a distant planet doing the same thing. At any stage you could engage the enemy and the battles are fast and furious involving robots, zombies and aliens. You usually have to find cover while you and your team (you can choose two other squad members to battle with you per each scenario) get into a shootout.  You can upgrade your skills and weapons along the way to help you. The level designs really are awesome, incredibly well made and in all fairness is up there with what George Lucas has brought to the silver screen. This really is a game for movie lovers in every sense of the word.It wouldn't surprise me if many XBOX users see this as beating HALO in terms of story and game play. If you love games, you will love this game. It is games like this that actually make something like the 360 almost worth buying except for the fact that it is available on the PC and it is. It also runs and looks every bit as good and doesn't feel like a port and that is astonishing. So put all fears aside that 360 games don't work as well as on the PC. Mass Effect proves that wrong. This is as sturdy a PC game as any and quite frankly might be one of the best games you have ever played.Pros:Amazing storyDesign is incredibleCut-scenes and animation is film qualityGreat soundtrack/music effectsA rewarding experience and a pleasure to playCons:High system specsSome minor bugs such as not being able to skip some cut scenes (but new patches are out all the time).DRM","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2009"}
{"product_name":"B003DNLDUC","description":"","reviewerName":"Grimes","summary":"War in the North","reviewText":"The Lord of the Rings: War in the North takes place concurrently with The Fellowship of the Ring. It follows an elf, a dwarf and a ranger as they attempt to impede Sauron's forces in the northern areas of Middle-Earth. The game features hack-n'-slash style combat with RPG features such as leveling up, skill trees and collecting of items. Each class (elf, dwarf, ranger) has it's own abilities. Eradan has stealth skills, Farin is adept at melee and mining for gems while Andriel specializes in magic.GraphicsGraphically, the game is great. The level design is top notch and I felt immersed in the world of Middle-Earth. Voice acting and lip movement was spot on (although not as natural as other games). The gore is realistic and the animations are great to look at. There are occasional environmental glitches but nothing to harp on about.Combat/GameplayYou are able to cycle between the main characters at checkpoints which is really great if you want to spend your play through among each character. You are able to \"give\" the other characters items from your inventory and they'll equip them even if you aren't playing as them. A good thing is that the others level up alongside you even if you're not playing as them. You can play single player (the others will be AI), you can play local co-op or your can play online co-op. There are also challenge maps which are akin to \"horde\" modes. These can be played in the aforementioned formats.Playing through the game you still keep your stats and looted items which is a boost to the replay-ability of the game. Items can be upgraded and customized for each character. The skill tree will allow you to improve your abilities and specializations. You can also increase stamina, melee, and other attributes using points earned when leveling up. This is standard RPG fare of course. The system isn't revolutionary but it is easy and fun to use.Combat wise, you use ranged and melee weapons. You can increase the power of attacks through leveling and also learn special moves. These special moves help vary the combat but it is still hack-n-slash. In a way, it is highly similar to The Two Towers and Return of the King games. Thus, if you liked that style then you should feel at home here. The enemies are varied from weak (a.k.a. Goblins) to powerful (such as trolls). The AI for enemies is generally good but there are some odd glitches (such as enemies just meandering a short distance from you without attacking). Ranged combat is standard aim and shoot.In terms of difficulty, that depends on how you level up your character. There are certain spots in the game where the difficulty spikes suddenly. One such instance is a siege in which you must stop two trolls from breaking down a gate. These are challenges that feel great to overcome. All the same, it seems that trolls are handed out freely and fighting them can get repetitive. At one point, the player faces a giant spider which is a healthy change that could have been done a bit more often in the game.There are towns (i.e. Bree) that you can shop and repair weapons. In these towns you can also get secondary quests. One such quest is to collect Athelas for a wounded ranger.SoundThe game sounds very good. It utilizes sound effects and score from the Lord of the Rings films which helps add on to the feeling of immersion. Sometimes they were a bit jarring when you recognized which parts in the films the sound effects belonged to and then saw how they were used in the game. A minor complaint but there it is.LengthThe game is 20+ hours depending on your level of exploration and how quickly you master combat and defeating the enemies. It is respectable for an RPG but some might feel that it should be longer. Keep in mind, you can play through and unlock new items and keep your old ones and stats.StoryI won't delve deep into the story but it intersects periodically with the Fellowship. It isn't an impressive plot and in many ways just seems to be present to allow you to kill Orcs. Which is fine by me since that's what I want from my Lord of the Rings games. The characters are flat but that makes them seem more like the caricatures that Tolkien used in his books. He drew inspiration from the epics which were not known for major character development.Overall, this is a standard RPG with a good system of combat. It is repetitive here and there but manages to be entertaining and a welcome relieve from disasters like Aragorn's Quest. I can't say that I whole-heartedly recommend buying it at release day price but it is at least worth a rental if you're a Lord of the Rings fan.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2011"}

People have compared it to Dragon Age, but not being too familiar with that game my first caparison would be to Borderlands without the open world aspect.  The side missions are a little more story driven (as opposed to just a bounty board) but it's a basic see an enemy and kill it type thing.  The skill tree is actually identical to Borderlands in that you choose a skill to \"open\" and then there are options as to how you want to move down that column with advancements.  We played for about 5 hours last night and I get the impression that you won't be able to fill the whole thing in one play through (just like Borderlands).I give this 5 stars because it's perfect for what I bought it for, the co-op. This is a great game for just some simple, fun hack and slash, yelling out loud (Oh S#!%, I need healed, get over here!) type stuff.  I bought this for my wife and I and I was the one last night that said we had to stop because we had to work the next day.  She told me this morning that we'll be playing it as soon as we're both home from work.5 stars for fun, tons of loot and it's a challenge.  We're playing on easy right now and it still poses a bit of a challenge (a bit).Some people seem to have their panties in a bunch because this is not an RPG on the level of Oblivion, it's not.

It also had more hype than a game should legally be entitled to, thanks to the inclusion of the Geo-Mod, a nice piece of code that allowed you to destroy environments as easily as foes.  Therefore, most gamers were able to look past its muddy graphics and underdeveloped story to enjoy it for what it was: a solid single player experience with loads of multiplayer replay value.  The sequel however, has both the name of the original to live up to, and the hundreds of other games on the PS2 market to compete with.  On both fronts, it comes up a little short, but still remains a great game, and worth at least a rental. The graphical prowess of Red Faction 2 is so much higher than that of the original title; that it's hard to believe you're actually playing its sequel.  Explosions are much more intense, textures don't look faded and drab, and the character models, while not exactly what I would call \"fluid\", are certainly leaps and bounds ahead of the almost action-figure type bodies in RF I.  It's obvious that the developers have been tweaking their skills with the PS2 a great deal, and the fruits of their labor are great. The gameplay in the single player is mixed bag of great shoot-em-up action and aching variety.  Dual weapons that can be fired independently of each other are a nice touch, as is the ability to lob grenades with a separate button, ala Halo.  However, the game balance often seems very sloppy: this is evident in the fact that you'll pick up a health kit just as often as ammo, if not more so.  You'll also find yourself using explosive weapons such as rockets, launched grenades, etc.  more often than dual uzis.  This is because while enemies can seemingly take a clip or two of standard bullets before they fall, it only takes one well placed, or even relatively close placed explosive projectile to put them out of their misery.  Add in the fact that they, on the other hand, can tear you to shreds within seconds if given a chance, and the choice becomes clear. It's hard to knock RF2 too low for this quirk, as it seems more like a design choice than a flaw, and what's more, it's one that works: you're given something like 50 explosive shells at the start of every level, and you'll find a large supply of them as you blow more fools into chunks of blood.  You rarely have to use bullets if you don't want to, and it's almost as if bullet-based weapons were viewed more as an obligation than a mechanic originally designed to be included.  This isn't a bad thing, as I had lots of fun always being the man with the rocket launcher in hand, ready to kick [butt].  Some may not enjoy such activities though, preferring \"traditional\" ballistics, so it's something that should be pointed out. Red Faction 2 is a straightforward shooter, and has more in common with Doom or even Serious Sam than it does with Goldeneye or Perfect Dark.  It does, however, sometimes go into the realm of \"awful variety\", including the all too familiar shoot-stuff from-a-helicopter level that is much less fun than an activity of that nature should be.  The only time the variety ever comes close to approaching \"fun\" status is when you take control of the battle armor.  Even then, you'll probably want to get back on foot as soon as possible. For some reason, the multiplayer and bot options from the original just aren't as attractive in the sequel.  It doesn't quite match up to the original in terms of sheer fun factor, partially thanks to the reduction in the Geo-Mod engine.  Much of the fun in the original's multiplayer game came from mutating the environments like a scene from The Matrix.  There's very little of that here, and the experience suffers as a result.  The multiplayer arenas also seem less painstakingly designed, ranging from just about average all the way down to a sloppy mess of hallways and rocket launchers.  If you're buying Red Faction for its multiplayer appeal, don't. Likewise, if you're buying Red Faction for its story, don't.  It's even more clich&eacute;d and convoluted than that of its predecessor.  But unlike the original, you probably won't care in the least about destroying the enemy dictator, nor the \"true\" enemy that eventually reveals himself about a third through the game.  However, for nonstop bullets and explosions, Red Faction delivers once again, if only for a long weekend.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2003"}

For all those vets of Medal of Honor or Call of Duty who would have loved to lay down suppressing fire or order some cover will love that angle in this game.  On top of the squad based angle there are some other alterations that set BoA apart from other shooters.For instance you have no health in the game and you really can't get shot.  Instead, the screen flashes red when you are exposed and someone is shooting at you.  This adds a tad of realism in that you aren't physically being shot and you have to react quickly before being killed.  Also, the game is sectioned out into numerous segmented maps or what I call skirmishes.  Basically you walk into an area and are faced with a set number of enemies and you need to adapt to the lay of the land.  Clear the enemies and then move on.  There are numerous ways to beat each level.  Soloing or going Rambo will rarely work unless you get really lucky.As a budget title I have found solid value for the price.  The graphics are decent for a 360 title, the music is good, the format is that of Band of Brothers, etc.  The story was a bit odd, jumping around and the tone doesn't have any continuity.  The main characters seem to always be cracking jokes at the most inopportune time, etc.  Whatever, the story is not that integral to the game.Unfortunately, there are a series of flaws, bugs, or shortcomings in the game that will significantly hurt the experience for some gamers.  Ideally I would have rated this 3.5 stars to indicated a decent title with flaws but I opted for the higher rating because I have fun playing it.  Some of the flaws are as follows.1.  The game cheats.  BAD!  What I mean by this is that the enemy AI constantly reminds you that it always knows where you are.  Not sure if this was intended or not but the developers need to work on the AI's detection ability to increase the realism of the game.  Basically, no matter whats going on in a battle, the AI will really key in on you.  I assume this is because the base engine is for a standard FPS.  It makes sense that the enemy would key in on you as you are the only one technically playing.  However, this kills the games intended strategy as well as makes things annoying.For instance, the game basically is designed for you to lay down cover fire and then move you and/or an assault team under that fire, around to a flanking position and take out the enemy.  Sometimes you can achieve this flank completely under cover.  Unfortunately, no matter how good your move, the enemy always knows you are there.  In one instance I ran completely around a house hidden and came up behind 2 enemies.  Before I even could fire they turned around 180 and shot me.  You basically just have to get used to it and hope your fire teams kill them when they expose themselves to key on you.  It's worse though when you have 6 guys firing suppression and yet a machine gun still picks on you when you are just crawling around behind cover.2.  Your aim is ATROCIOUS.  Again, not sure if this is intentional but you are the worst shot in the whole war.  The on screen cross hairs are basically more of a suggestion as to where you MAY shoot but by no means a given.  You have several aiming views, all of them unreliable.  You have the base walk around view thats just like every FPS.  This is the worst view for shooting and you will only use it when moving or strafing, etc.  Then there is the standard zoom mode which takes you to a zoomed variation of your guns site.  This is ok but some guns are abnormally large and take up so much of the screen it is hard to see.  Then you have your base aim from a cover position and a slightly zoomed version by clicking the R-stick.  These are the best zooms but you still will plant your pinpointed cross hairs on an enemy and miss more often than not.I would say they tried to make firing more realistic by reducing accuracy but sometimes it's ridiculous.  I can pull off crack head shots with a scopeless M1 at long range and then miss an entire clip at point blank.  This is no joke.  I have rounded a corner, planted my sites right on an enemy and fired off multiple shots point blank and score no hits.  On other instances you will have perfect aim on an enemy and you can watch the tracer rounds fly way off missing by a mile.When you couple this terrible aim with the enemy AI always knowing where you are and you get a frustrating experience at time.  You basically just need to be patient and keep stock of lots of ammo.  Obviously some guns are more accurate than others.  The M1 or the German rifle are my preferred guns as they miss the least.  Machine guns are awful.On top of AIM, headshots are poor.  I have shot some enemies in the head as many as 3 times before they go down.  Kind of odd.3.  Your AI is pretty dumb.  Your guys do exactly what you tell them but they are dumb about it.  They will run out into the open, stand in the line of fire, and sometimes just do nothing regardless of the order, or inexplicably stand right next to explosives as they are about to blow.  Also, they are terrible killers.  You pretty much have to kill most of the enemies.  (I understand the developers probably were worried about you becoming a spectator in the game and thus they make you do most of the work.) I have even seen some of my AI stand right in front of the enemy firing at them and missing at point blank forcing me to come in and shoot them.  (Ironically in one of these experiences, I saw 6 Allied AI standing there exposed shooting at 1 enemy also standing.  Even though I was far away, the enemy was still shooting at me even though 6 guys were standing around him.)4.  Cover is vital, crouching does nothing.  When in cover it is almost impossible for enemies to hit you even if they can see you.  (This is the same with enemies.  You will see enemies sitting there and you will shoot them with no result, just waste ammo.)  However, if you just crouch behind an object, the enemy will still hit you even if they can't see you.  There seems to be cover clipping issues.  I have even watched enemies shoot in opposite directions and still hit me.5.  Control bugs.  Sometimes you can't get into cover when switching through zooms.  Some superficial objects will block you or prevent you from shooting like scaffolding, etc.  Aiming in tight quarters is a nightmare.  Sometimes your characters head will get in the way, other times window sills won't let you see, etc.  Very unnatural.  This is due to the 3rd person angle when in cover, you are looking over a shoulder and if a wall is in the way, oh well you are blind, even if your character can see fine.  Grenade controls are awful.  The aiming target is hard to see, and again, your guy has awful aim.  Even if you can see the target way away from you, your guy will still throw them off a nearby wall and blow yourself up.  (There is no grenade warning either so you sometimes don't know when this happens)6.  Tight quarters AI is broken.  I had a very hard time moving AI through tight passageways.  They got stuck often, wouldn't follow attack orders, and were unresponsive.  I basically gave up and solo'd most of the indoor portions.  Enemies also get stuck.  More than a few times I have found enemies just standing there looking at me and I can just stand there without getting shot.That may seem like a lot of gripes but I think they are important.  While I still find value in the game as a budget title, some fans may hate these glitches/flaws.Basically if you can tolerate the bad AIM and the annoying enemy AI, you can find some fun in this game.  If you are a stickler for perfection, stay very far away.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2011"}

So I'll keep my review relatively short and to the point.The Quick Charge Kit is used in conjunction with the XBox 360 rechargeable battery for the wireless controllers. This kit comes with one rechargeable battery pack included. The packaging on the Quick Charge Kit claims that it can completely charge a depleted battery in about 2 hours, double that to charge 2 battery packs at the same time.In my experience the charging time estimates are true. Though I usually end up charging my battery packs before they're completely drained. Typically I'd say that a full charge on one battery takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 1 hour.The Quick Charge Kit comes with an AC power cord that's about 1.5m long. The unit also features 2 LED's that indicate the status of the ongoing charge. Orange/Red = charging and Green = charged.

{"product_name":"B00002STGL","description":"A first-person shooter that mixes spy and sci-fi,Perfect  Darkis both a thoroughly engrossing one-player experience and a  riotously fun multiplayer romp. Easily one of the best games of its  genre on any video game console, this long-awaited follow-up toGoldenEye 007is a must-have for Nintendo 64 owners--and a damn  good reason to be one if you're not.The futuristicPerfect Darkcasts players as Joanna Dark, a  secret agent who becomes embroiled in a sinister conspiracy involving  aliens and an evil corporation. Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy. However, the real fun here is in  the highly customizable Combat Simulator, a one-to-four-player  simultaneous-play mode that features both free-for-alls and team-based  challenges and can include up to eight Simulants, computer-controlled  combatants of varying behavior.Although Simulants make for decent adversaries or teammates, you'll want  to grab a friend--and an Expansion Pak, as only 35 percent of the game  is available without one--to fully enjoyPerfect Dark.--Joe  HonPros:One of the best first-person shooters on any video game consoleOutstanding multiplayer game with huge replay valueBevy of game options, cheats, and secret featuresExcellent training mode with challenges all of its ownCons:Graphics get ugly when playing with more than two players","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"You'd have to be in the DARK to not give this game a PERFECT","reviewText":"After Rareware made the stunning shooter game GoldenEye, gamers everywhere hung their heads in disappointment when the decision was made not to accept the offer to make Tomorrow Never Dies. But Rare, without the inherent limitations of a movie license, created something much bigger, much bolder, something that few companies could ever pull off: Perfect Dark.Joanna Dark is a futuristic secret agent who gets tangled in a plot involving a corrupt business corporation, a plan to kidnap the US President, and an alien partner named Elvis. Rare packed so much into this cartridge that it's hard to find a place to begin. Graphics are stellar, with massive levels and real lighting. All characters are motion-captured and move with realism, and the reloading animations for the weapons are some of the coolest you'll ever see (like the alien sniper rifle that absorbs its clips, or the sub-machine gun which reads ammo like a scanner). The one-player mode alone will keep a person busy for hours. Enemies have strong artifical intelligence - they don't run into your gunfire, they hold back, wait for reinforcements, or dodge and attack from another angle. Mission objectives increase as the difficulty level increases, and real stealth is required to make it through alive; in short, the only way to win is to completely immerse yourself in Joanna Dark's world, and pretend everyone is flesh-and-blood real. Aiding in this virtual reality is Dolby 5.1 surround sound, so you can hear bullets whiz by or track enemies by the sound of their voice.Then there's multiplayer mode, which is the game that never ends. Four players and up to 8 computer-controlled opponents can participate, with bucketloads of options. Custom set the various weapons you want to appear around a level, including what weapon appears where. You have portable sentry guns, sniper rifles that shoot through walls, and a guided missile launcher, to name some of the more unique weapons at your disposal. Set the timer for 1 kill, 10 kills, 1000 kills, or unlimited. Activate a \"matrix-like\" slow-mo, choose from varied arenas, set up color-coded teams, mix-and-match bodies and heads to create the perfect character. With regards to the computer-controlled opponents, you can adjust their difficulty level, so that they're either meat for you to gun down or invincible enough to make you wet your pants. This list does not even begin to touch on all the options avaliable, or the possibilities for fun when they are mixed.But wait, there's more! Other modes of play include a two-player missions mode and a counter-op mode where one player jumps between bad guys to stop the other player, ala matrix. The game's overworld is also a training center which has several tasks of its own to be completed.If you must know, the game isn't technically perfect. For one, the framerate can be pretty bad at times, but usually you'll be having too much fun to notice. The storyline, for all its hype, feels somewhat undeveloped. Finally, the expansion pak is required to unlock most of the game, but the extra money to buy the pak is well worth it. Overall, these are insignificant complaints. Sorry that this review is so long, but nothing else would've done this game justice. Your jaw will drop when you see what Rare has accomplished this time. This is a game that can proudly sit alongside your next-gen console shooters.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2002"}

I did play a little bit of Arkham City and Arkham Asylum but for some reason I had some difficulty with the HUD determining my mission destination.These Batman games are open-world games where you are free to explore Gotham but I had little interest in doing the side quests or picking random fights with thugs to potentially level up Batman.  All I really cared about was the main storyline - moving smoothly from one checkpoint to the next.  In that regard, this Batman reboot felt WAY better than the rest in that it felt more guided and linear.  I simply wasn't having the difficulties I had in prior games determining what to do next.The positives of this reboot are as follows:+  Great epic story with familiar villains such as The Joker & Bane+ Lots of gadgets to use from Batman's utility belt such as the batclaw and smoke grenades+  Feels great to dispatch thugs one by one from gargoyle perches throughout many levels of the game.  The stealth element of this game is great.  I enjoyed the tactical aspect of taking enemies out one by one without getting caught.+  Graphically, this game feels of a higher fidelity than the other games in the seriesThe negatives of this reboot are as follows:- Way too challenging at times...can be frustrating.  The boss fights are very tough indeed especially that fight with Bane for the first time on the hotel rooftop.  I think I probably fought him 15 times before I beat him.- The Batman ethos is dark and sordid...this is not a game for young children.- Navigating the map, specifically Gotham takes time and I would have preferred to just move through a linear level instead of an open world.  I'm not sure I enjoyed this.- Learning the controls takes time - you often times resort to button mashing to defeat foes.All in all I rate this game an 8/10.

The Darkness is one of the best games I have played since I got an Xbox. There is plenty of action, also the graphics are well balanced so it is not too gory but it's not the \"disappear when they die\" idea. Here is my review on this gameThis is a first-person shooter, but this game takes it to total realism. There is barely an HUD elements, no compass marker, nothing. If you want to get to where you want to go, you actually might have to ask for directions or look at the in-game maps on the streets to find your way. This adds to the realism, but it might be challenging for some gamers because the game doesn't give you much direction.The powers of the darkness really steps up in the action, with the ability to create black holes and impale enemies with a large tentacle makes you feel pretty badass. But there is a perfect balance between those powers and the old fashioned guns. This balance keeps the game interesting and awesome.The music to this game is amazing. You get the dramatic orchestral music when you are being passive, but then you get heavy metal music when you are in a gunfight. The music adapts to your situation, which is a plus. The voices are amazingly well done too, with a great voice for the \"Darkness\", the demonic voice in your head.The only downside that I see to this game is its storyline. Don't get me wrong, it is a good story, but sometimes you are just left confused on how things worked out on. If you play through it a couple of times you'll understand things better, so this is really not a big downside.The game is great, except the actual story sequence is a little short. There are sidequests that help lengthen the play time, but it might be a little short.

However, they restrict so much and promote subscription to the point that playing it isn't even fun. I feel like I am watching a sales pitch that goes on for hours rather than playing a game. You can unlock most restricted things with a direct purchase, but still get the \"subscribe now\" spam everywhere. In addition the glitches and lag are unbearable. They expect you to pay monthly for constant server lag freezups and annoying glitches?The combat is alright, but nothing new or special. It is basically the same combat system as world of warcraft. However, the actual content is more like a single player game, and it seems they just converted that to online as an excuse to charge people to play a game they already own. Flashpoints (their word for group instance) are sort of fun, but that is undermined by constant conversations, which are videos where you get 3 responses to choose from about 4-6 times per video... but have to wait on everyone to answer every step of the way even though only one counts.All in all it is a great way to waste some time without paying for anything, terrible game though.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2013"}

I was intriqued. I was looking for a good sci-fi sort of game. The Star Wars games are always such a letdown... so, I thought I'd buy this one... COME ON... for the PRICE you can't go wrong... and I DIDN'T!There is only one downside.The game is fantastic. The graphics are great. The game is fun and unique. It has a wide open environment in which you can race, explore, recover PEARLS, take pictures of various species of ANIMALS in order to make money, interact with everyone, rescue your friends and try to uncover the truth beyond unexplained events like a real investigative journalist.The game is challenging and hard at times, and always interesting. Not to mention, funny... side characters are lighthearted and entertaining.  There is a level of puzzle solving that is at times hard, sometimes completely impossible and sometimes relatively easy.Overall, the game takes you to this cool unique world that sometimes reminds me of Don Bluth's DRAGON'S LAIR (in its animation).The game is very fun and a nice change of pace. The only setback I can make note of is that the game is pretty short. Otherwise... This game is worth playing. For the low low price it is being sold, buy it.

Audio voice-overs accompany cinematic cutscenes and serve to reinforce the strong cast of characters.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Pretty good for a port and even better for an RPG","reviewText":"I still think its sad that people don't know of RPGs such as Grandia or Grandia II.  I think its even sadder that people think the only good RPG out there is Final Fantasy when Grandia II is a gem.Anyway, while the graphics lack a little (Its a port of the 1999 version on Dreamcast so I understand that), the plot/story is solid and the battle system is awesome, and character developement is very much perfect.As said, graphics are good, but for the 1000th time.  Its not the graphics but the story thats important, and not just what the story is but how it is told, and Grandia II does this very well.  While the story is something I've seen before (but then again so was FFVII and I loved that...) it was played out to its full extent.  And this time unlike most RPGs, the story focuses more on the characters rather than the enviroment that surrounds them, which helps character developement.The battle system is unique and with the exception of the first Grandia and FFX, actually requires me to use strategy and think before I act, unlike most other RPGs that forces me to see how fast I can end a battle (hence more Final Fantasy).  However, while the battle system is very good, if you exploit it, the game becomes very easy.  In fact not once did I ever see the words &quot;Game Over&quot; or ever get a single character KO'd throughout the game.The Characters actually shine with an Aura that makes them memorable characters much like in the first Grandia.  Magic animation is beautiful and not to mention that each character gets there own skills, making them more unique than before.Also, while it doesn't seem like much, I was disappointed after playing the first Grandia with how many spells were in this one.  While 40 spells is indeed a lot, the first 80 spells the first Grandia had gave me more time to tweek with my characters stats.  Not to mention that in this one everyone only has four moves.  In the first one they had 12 each.The music, while not as good as in the first Grandia, really sets the mood.  Boss fight music (especially when fighting parts of Valmar) is very good, and I find myself humming the tunes.Using moves is done by using SP and learning moves requires SC.  This is like expeirience points only more like coins to learn and raise levels of the move.Anyway, the game is extremely good and I happen to like Grandia more than Final Fantasy.  Not because of battling, but because of freedome as well.  You won't be wrong in choosing this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2002"}

Some of the voice acting was great, and funny.  I liked Dr. Schulong, but I found the exposition provided by the tapes you find to be trite at best.  I kept thinking \"He wouldn't have stopped to carve aaaahhhhhgggggg.\" Honestly why would the people in the game record their inner most thoughts and secrets?  Unlikely at best.  Compare this to HL2 where the exposition is through the environment, and I find the storytelling in HL2 to be much better accomplished.  Bioschock was too compressed, too much voice over exposition.

Just as I expected its similar to the Munchables on the wii.Gameplay: When you start the game you are placed in a training level that allows you to get used to the controls and using the Katamari. Trust me you'll need it. It took me awhile to get used to controlling the Katamari and even though i finished the game it still fills a bit akward at times. You move by tilting both anologue sticks in the same direction. The anologue sticks are gonna be used for just about everything and will take time to get used to. It can get annoying becaise as the Katamari gets bigger it gets harder to control depending on the Princes stamina. Running into objects you can't pick up causes you to loose items. The quick turn will become your best friend for levels where there are tons of huge objects. Another thing that annoyed me is when I got big I ended up getting stuck in narrow spots making navigation a b**** expecially in the city levels. After awhile I learned how to avoid these problems. It does take time to get used and some level of skills. Once used to it the controls became pretty simple.Story: The story of the game basically goes like this. You play as the Prince who is sent to earth to roll up objects in a speare like object called a Katamari. You're doing this because your father, the king of the cosmos, accidently destroyed them all (the prickXD). The big ball of objects you pick up will becaome either Stardust, a Star, or even a constellation. You're given a time limit in just about every level to pick up as many objects as you can or as many of a particular object. Its pretty straight foward. The levels I had the most trouble with, and I'm happy theres only two of them, are the Ursa Mijor and Tarus levels. I hate these levels with a passionXD You have to pick up just one of a particular object and more times than none you'll get a big katamari and end up picking up a small bull or bear making all your hard work for nothing>.&lt; You get the best score if you pick a huge version of the object, but the world is scatter with them of different sizes. If you pick up one you don't want by accident it automatically ends. That is a pain in ass.Graphics: The graphics are nothing special, but thier not bad either. Everything in the game look like toys. I wouldn't say legos, but some type of toys similar to legos. I actually enjoyed checking out the scenario. I never played anything that looked the way this game looks.Music: Whoever made this games music is evilXD If you play this game prepare to hear these tracks in your sleep! I found myself relaxed and humming to the jazzy tunes it played! I don't know japenese, but it didn't stop me from trying to sing along to the musicXDLength: The game is really, really short. You could finish it within a few hours, but theres alot of replayability if you want to find all the presents, objects, make the biggest star you can, and unlock other things. Theres also a two player mode, but i can't say much about it because I currently have noone to play it with (I'm the last child in the houseXD).It has its flaws, but Katamari Damacy is a really addicting and fun game once you get into it. Thier were even moments where I laughed because there are some amusing objects and peaple in the game you collect. the King himself served as some good comic relief too. I just wish it was longer. Its not for hardcore players but its good if you just want to sit back and casually play a game like me. I highly recommend it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2010"}

Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"An excellent side-adventure of Nintendo's beloved Plumber","reviewText":"I will start off by saying that I have always been a fan of the \"Paper Mario\" franchise. They all encompass a very unique direction for a character that by and large has stayed the same in format for the 25 years he has been around. Super Paper Mario continues in the unique vein of the first two Paper Mario (and even Super Mario RPG on the SNES, which is a clear inspiration for the whole Paper Mario series) while injecting some radical new directions of its own.First of all, this is the least RPG game in the whole Paper Mario series. Gone are the dynamic-turn based battles ofPaper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, and in are the jump-on-an-enemy-and-watch-him-go-poof of the classic Super Mario Bros. games. Heck, gone are most RPG elements period! The only RPG anything in this game are items, and the fact that after a certain amount of \"XP\" points, your characters level up and gain more health, more damage in attacks, etc. That's it. No, this is more like a classic Mario side-scrolling platformer with the Paper motif. It is mainly 2-D except for one genius addition to the game's formula, and a definite game changer, in that Mario can manipulate the reality around him and go from 2-D perspective into 3-D. What is an impenetrable wall in 2-D becomes a mere pole in 3-D that you can easily side-step. The puzzlelike quality of getting from point A to point B using the 3-D mechanic is brilliant, and the puzzles were quite excellent throughout the entire game. I was impressed. If you don't find joy in it, you have no soul.The only downside to 3-D is that the graphics become downright sparse and ugly in 3-D. In 2-D, however, the graphics are exceptionally stylish and eye catching. The artistic direction in this game is phenomenal. World 3 is done entirely using 8-bit sprites as a throwback to the classic NES system. Places like this are so fun to adventure through.This time around, you get to play as Mario, obviously, but also Bowser, Peach, and Luigi become members of your party that you can switch to on the fly. Each also has their own unique ability you will need to continue. Unfortunately, only Mario can switch to 3-D, and because that is such an essential ability to make it through most areas, you end up using Mario exclusively for most of the time. It's too bad, because the other characters are a blast to play as and it becomes impractical to constantly keep switching to Mario to get past one part and then switch back. That is my only complaint. You also get little fairy creatures that follow you called Pixls who basically give you additional powers that Mario & Co. will need to advance through some puzzles. These range from a bomb to blow away certain blocks, to a cowboy Pixl called \"Slim\" (cutesy stuff abounds in this game, seriously) who makes Mario paper thin to squeeze through super skinny pathways in the walls. The Pixls are a nice added wrinkle to the puzzles.Like in the others in the Paper series, and unlike any other Mario game outside of that, Super Paper Mario actually attempts to spin a yarn in its narrative. Is it a groundbreaking, incredible story worth buying the game alone for? No, but it is pretty cute, catchy, and achieves the goal it is supposed to. I enjoyed it, personally. One aspect that you will either love or hate with the story is that it makes the game extremely wordy. I cannot stress that enough. You will read a novel's worth, and then some, in dialogue from this game. That didn't bother me, and I rather enjoyed the dialogue myself. In fact, the characters and their words can be incredibly hilarious in a tongue-in-cheek way. Heck, one of the main bad guys is modeled after the boss fromOffice Space. Awesome. Even my wife, who thought that this was a bit too much of a \"kiddy\" game from the graphics and music, thought the characters were very cute and eventually changed her mind about SPM because of its undeniable charm.It's not all perfect though, I must point out. I must say that I really enjoyed Super Paper Mario in its own merit. However, in the context of the other Paper Mario games, I have to say I likePaper Mario: The Thousand-Year Doora lot more. I miss the dynamic turn-based battles and the audience that got involved in them. I miss the decidedly much more epic storyline and dynamic characters in 1,000 year door. I miss the unique characters like Admiral Bobbery the Bob-omb, Yoshi, and Koops that join you on your quest. Heck, I miss the MARIO elements in SPM. For some odd reason, the character design and even some of the \"dimensions\" you visit made me feel like this didn't really belong in Mario \"canon\" as most characters are not in any way related to Mario games. 1,000 door was full of classic Mario elements like koopas, bob-ombs, even the piantas fromSuper Mario Sunshineare there. In contrast, Super Paper Mario has almost no recognizable Mario elements, and as a result, felt a bit foreign to me. AND, most recognizable characters like Bowser's Koopa army, Goombas, etc, make brief appearances at that! I know Mario & the gang are supposed to be in other dimensions, but still... it felt strange. It almost makes me think ofSuper Mario Bros. 2, or \"Super Mario USA\" as it is known everywhere else, as it is a totally different game in Japan that they just stuck the Mario characters into and released it in the US. An excellent game, just like SPM is, but strange taken in context of the rest of the Mario universe. Almost through the whole game, the only characters I was comfortable with completely was Mario, Peach, Luigi, and Bowser. That's it.In fact, that is what I think best describes the game: \"An excellent game, but very strange compared to all other Mario games.\" It feels like an awesome black sheep; A totally different take that feels excitedly adventurous and a wee too liberal at the same time. Don't get me wrong, I love SPM and I give it 5-stars for a reason. Originally I was going to give this game a 4-star rating, but decided against it. I may have preferred 1,000 door as a Paper Mario game, BUT Super Paper Mario makes so many radical steps conceptually that it can hardly be considered in context of the others, as I have pointed out. In its own genre-busting world, it is amazing. Where else does a star-man turn Mario into a hulking 8-bit NES version of himself to stomp and destroy everything in his path? Where else do you get an item that makes a zombie mushroom follow you around and help you, or call a miniature army of NES versions of the character to mimic your every move and go kamikaze? Moments like this are too cool. This game oozes its own quirky charm, and it is all the better for it. Would I recommend it? Absolutely! I would give you the advice of playing this with the attitude of it being a stand-alone adventure, however, because taking it in with the other Paper Mario series in mind might skew your expectations of what is to come. Keep that in mind. Super Paper Mario is one of thee definitive Wii games to get for your library, just appreciate it for what it truly is!(Note: I would rate this game at around a 4.5 star game. However, I feel that the aggregate 3 1/2 stars is not a fair rating for Super Paper Mario, so I round it up to a 5-star game.)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2010"}

It pioneered everything we see in the genre today and there are dozens of copy cats. God of War helped pave the way for cinematic gameplay and pretty much made quick time events an everyday thing in games. God of War also has one of the best combat systems every created, as well as memorable mythology and one of the most recognized characters to date. Origins Collection puts two of the PSP's best titles on one Blu-Ray disc. These are remastered in 1080p HD and look great. While each has its own issues, this is well worth a purchase for any God of War fan.Chains of OlympusThis was the first ever portable God of War game and it blew everyone's expectations out of the water. Not only for the game itself, but the PSP. No one knew the system could pull off this great technical feat. You can read my review on Olympus for the PSP itself, and a more in-depth look, but after playing it again on the PS3 I noticed that, compared to Ghost of Sparta, it doesn't stack up. Even after playing God of War III I notice a lot of things that annoy me in Olympus.Firstly, the game lacks the huge epic set pieces of the console games, as well as a lack of bosses. Sure there are a few memorable moments in Olympus, but there are only three boss fights and they aren't that amazing. The first boss feels pretty boring compared to other first bosses in the series, and the locales are pretty generic for a God of War game. Olympus stuck to the basics of God of War and kind of played it safe. There are some interesting magic items like being able to reflect projectiles and Efreet. The combat system is almost exactly like the first game, which isn't a bad thing, but long time fans will be disappointed about this.Secondly, the game is super short. You can beat it in about 4 hours which is two long sit-downs. The story isn't as detailed or in-depth as other games in the series. Kratos is just trying to find his daughter Calliope while still seeking revenge on the Gods. Overall, Chains of Olympus is a warm-up for the more epic Ghost of Sparta.Score when released on PSP: 9Score on PS3: 8Ghost of SpartaThis is more like it. More bosses, more memorable moments, and completely different locales. There's even a whole new gameplay element here which is the Thera's Bane. Like in God of War III you have a red meter that sets your blades on fire for extra damage and makes you invincible to some attacks. Right from the start the game feels like a better, heavier God of War game than Olympus. Olympus started off kind of weak, but Sparta throws you right into the water (literally) with a pretty epic boss fight against a Scylla. The game has more puzzles, and the boss fights are pretty epic. The final boss against the God of Death, Thanatos, is pretty epic because you fight with a certain someone.The story is even more memorable because you are searching for your brother Deimos while still seeking revenge on the Gods. There are some memorable moments here that top even some of the console games in the series like giving Kind Midas a beat down. The new magic items, however, aren't as interesting as I had hoped this time around. Boreas' Wind freezes enemies, but I rarely used it. The Eye of Atlantis felt kind of weak and didn't do as much damaged as hoped even fully leveled up.Overall, Ghost of Sparta is much better with memorable moments involving more enemies, longer gameplay (about 6 hours), and more bosses. The fights system is tweaked to feel different from Olympus. The game even looks better because Sony finally unlocked the full 333Mhz of the PSP processor so Ready at Dawn was able to push the system to its full limits. Ghost of Sparta is a memorable God of War game and will probably become a fan favorite.Score when released on PSP: 8.5Score on PS3: 8.5Overall, the entire collection is excellent and well put together. I was disappointed in not seeing any extra features exclusive to this collection, but each game has a Challenge of the Gods that will keep fans busy for a while. With full trophy support for each game you are bound to have a couple dozen hours of fun here.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2012"}

It is an experience wholly unlike any to come before it, and is certain to leave gamers talking and thinking about Vincent's tribulations long after the credits have rolled.","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"The Persona Teams Hit Home","reviewText":"Out of every game this year, \"Catherine\" honestly looked to have the most promise. A psychosexual thriller with multiple outcomes, gameplay meshing elements of survival horror, platforming and puzzle games, and perhaps the most truly mature narrative seen from a game with anime stylings to come out of Japan. Coming from the developers of the legendary \"Persona\" games, one could've only expected an amazing result. However, they would've been surprised to find that \"Catherine\" is perhaps the best game of the year so far, and may end up being this critic's personal Game of the Year.Players take control of Vincent Brooks, a 32 year-old systems engineer who has been in a committed relationship with his girlfriend, Katherine, for five years. This relationship is comforting to him, a constant that needs to neither intensify nor weaken. However, when she begins to suggest the idea of marriage, the man is put in a position which he never expected to find himself in. After a night of drinking and thinking about whether or not he's ready for a commitment with his lover, a blond tart named Catherine comes and sits next to him. They begin to talk about how committed relationships are a drag, and how it's better \"not to be chained down.\" After this convo, Vincent blanks out and wakes up next to the blond in his bed the following morning. This is only the beginning, though.Catherine keeps reappearing in Vincent's life, which isn't exactly what he's hoping for, because a terrifying rumor has been going around. That rumor states that any man who cheats on his beloved is considered a sinner, forced into a terrifying nightmare, and killed in their sleep. With a rash of young men dying all over Vincent's town, and bizarre nightmares featuring various manifestations of his guilt occurring every night, the protagonist begins to, to put it bluntly, freak out. And so, the stage for the bizarre world Atlus has crafted is set, and the player is set loose to carry about how they wish.Most of the gameplay takes place in Vincent's nightmares, which play out like a warped blend of \"Silent Hill\", \"Tetris\", and \"Q*bert\". While communicating with other sinners (whose manifestations in the dreams are the likenesses of sheep), Vincent climbs a seemingly perpetual tower comprised of movable, and some immovable, blocks. While climbing, the player has to push, pull, and get rid of certain blocks in order to make a path to the top. While this initially seems like no big deal, the game keeps piling on an increasingly challenging amount of different block types. These include ice blocks, on which one step can send you flying into the abyss below without a chance grabbing onto it's ledge, trap blocks, which are rigged with spikes capable of turning you into bloody mush, and explosive blocks, which are timed charges that detonate and weaken all other blocks in their vicinity. Add on enemies such as roaming sheep and axe-wielding rams, and factor in the increasingly disturbing boss stages (these include a chainsaw-wielding baby and a knife-wielding bride, which make more since in the context of the plot), and you're looking a game which doesn't skimp on challenge. This is indicated by the fact that the original Japanese version of the game was so difficult, gamers demanded a patch to make it easier. While not impossible, don't be surprised if you spend over an hour on some of the later stages.But these stages don't affect the story's outcome. When you're not climbing for your life, you're in a makeshift church confessional in your nightmares, answering questions which align your moral compass. Initially, these queries are fairly black and white, but as the game wears on, they take on a more ambiguous tone, and the player has to sit and ponder how these questions relate to their own lives before answering them. This element alone makes for an interesting level of plot tinkering, but more than simple questions will determine how this story unfolds.Another way you'll spend your time will be in the Stray Sheep, drinking with your friends and the various other inhabitants, and texting both Catherine and Katherine. As somebody who's seen texting start off a lazy excuse for a \"go here, do this\"-type of checkpoints interface in last-gen games, I was thoroughly impressed with how robust the offerings in this game were. Each response wields a new option to pick from, and erasing your last response and replacing it with something else will offer a different option. Limited at first, the texts grow increasingly elaborate and steer the player toward one girl and away from another, or keep them in an overall neutral position. While most games make moral decisions a very easy affair, this game doesn't even hint at what one answer or another will do. Many times, my choices yielded surprising results, and I'm almost positive that anybody without latent psychic abilities will have the same type of reaction.The technical aspects of the game aren't disappointing in the least. As somebody who's been an anime fan for their entire life, this may very well be the most impressive rendering of anime-styled graphics to date. Done as Atlus' first game in full HD, each character is oozing with life, while retaining the stillness and stark colors hallmark in contemporary Japanese animation. The actual cel animation cutscenes, done by Studio 4C (\"Tweeny Witches,\" \"Animatrix,\" \"Tekkonkinkreet\"), are no less impressive, featuring crisp and fluid animation with surprisingly well-done backdrops. All-around, \"Catherine\" is a great-looking game, accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack primarily comprised of classical music remixes, and a stand-out English voice cast. Everybody is fantastic, including Troy Baker (\"Trinity Blood,\" \"Code Geass\") as the conflicted protagonist, and Michele Ruff (\"Bleach\", \"Lucky Star\") as stubborn and mature Katherine. However, a special notice must be given to the always-fantastic Laura Bailey (\"Soul Eater\", \"Fullmetal Alchemist\") as Catherine, who skates the character's thin line of cute and psychotic which such ease one would think it's a split personality.Now, many games these days are considered to be \"mature.\" \"Bulletstorm\" is \"mature\" because of rampant violence and potty humor, \"Call of Duty\" is \"mature\" because it deals with realistic scenes of war and features gritty, violent realism, and \"Dead Space\" is \"mature\" because it happens to be terrifying and brutal. But what is true maturity, really? To me, it means the ability to tell a great story without relying on overt sexuality, violence and profanity. It means delivering a story which forces it's central characters to make tough decisions and survive through the ramifications of their actions. It means never pandering to the lowest common denominator of player, and always retaining a sophisticated tone through it's narrative. While \"Catherine\"'s later moments take a bizarre turn for the supernatural and fantastic, it never loses sight of it's core message: \"What does it mean to be truly responsible?\".And that's a question that most films, books and games nowadays tend to shy away from. For it to be dealt with in a game not only makes me proud to be a gamer, but makes me proud to see one of my favorite developers show a level of maturity I never expected them to have.Good job, Atlus. You've created one of the most breathtaking experiences anybody could ever hope to have.Plot: A+Gameplay: A+Graphics: A+Sound: A+Overall: A+","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2011"}

Just use your computer to load any mp3's you have onto the card. Once you insert the card and open the game, just go over to the boom box located to the right of the storage chest on the boat. Click on it and a menu of all your songs will open. Select the one you want and it starts to play.The only down side to this game is the current price asked by some vendors. If you can't buy it used I would wait for Endless Ocean 2. One of my favorite parts of this game was the ability to explore a submerged city. Endless 2 promises more of this.

If you liked the Tomb Raider series then you might enjoy this game.  Very similar graphics, controls, (Remember the jumping and hanging on to even surfaces and then pulling yourself up?  It applies here.) and objectives.  Mix in a cheshire cat that you can call on for advice, a morbid and psychedelic world, weapons that pertain to Alice's theme - and you have American McGee's Alice.The game is entertaining at first with it's unique world but becomes boring very fast.  I enjoyed the first Tomb Raider, which was released some years earlier, more than this game. A major reason for that was because Alice doesn't require much problem solving like the Tomb Raider series does.  Everything in the game is rather straightforward and it's recommended that people who dislike animation and sequences that are nothing more than creative clips meant to point you (literally) to the next scene should avoid this game.  Unless you've got an empty schedule, the good news is that it will take some time to complete American McGee's Alice.  But as far as ground breaking games, this is a half-hearted attempt.  Even though you can find other games on the market with the same format, Alice doesn't stand out much from its competitors.  Impressive artwork is the only aspect that stands out for this game.Best to wait awhile on this one until the price drops.  Worth it at a lower price, but not now.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2001"}

It takes place in a world that floats in the clouds. There are islands of rock that float in the air, where people have made their homes and villages. To get from island to island, airships were made, using the power of the Six Moons. The Six Moons are each different colors: Red, Yellow, Purple, Blue, Green, and Silver. They represent, respectively, Fire, Electricity, Ice, Wind, Life, and \"Void\". The Moons drop moonstones, which can be used to power things, like airships and weapons. Each Moon has a continent that represents it, and the continent uses the power of the moon to their best advantage. The Nayr people live under the Red Moon, and they are a desert culture. The Valuans have established a great technological empire from the electricity of the Yellow Moon. There is a lot of unexplored space, and nobody really knows what lies beyond his or her little realms.The game opens with a small, sleek, shiny ship being chased by a giant metal Valuan battleship in a scene reminiscent of the opening from Star Wars. The person on the smaller ship is a young woman. The captain of the larger ship, Alfonse, seems to be a rich pretty-boy. He says that the girl is from the \"Silver Continent\" and orders that concussion shells be fired at the smaller ship to knock the young woman unconscious. The sailors do so, and she is taken aboard. Suddenly, the bigger ship rocks from an explosion! They're being attacked by Air Pirates! The main character, Vyse, a boy who uses two cutlasses in battle, swings down from the Crow's Nest of the pirate ship and challenges a group of soldiers. Then his best friend Aika, a girl with a boomerang, jumps over, too. They battle the soldiers, then when the rest of the pirates come, run off to search for the captain. While Vyse and Aika fight some more Valuan Soldiers, the captain gets away. The Air Pirates bring the girl (Fina) onto their ship and tell her they are Blue Rogues, who only attack armed ships, unlike the Black Pirates, who attack defenseless ships. The pirates all go back to the very creatively named Pirate Island, where they celebrate their victory. Vyse and Aika introduce Fina to all the people of the island, and then go off exploring for a day. When they come back, the island has been attacked, and the Valuan Armada has taken Fina and all the Pirates away. Then Vyse and Aika decide to go rescue their friends from the evil Valuan Empire's clutches.The graphics in this are good, as RPGs go. It is an enhanced version of an older game, so the graphics are nothing like, say, Final Fantasy 10. The sound and music are very nice, as with most RPG games. Where this game is the character, world, and gameplay design. The characters range from Vyse, the average do-gooder anime-style RPG character, to Drachma, a sailor done in the style of Captain Ahab, who lost his arm to a giant Arcwhale (a whale that swims in air) called Rhaknam. Unlike Ahab, however, Drachma was able to get a mechanical metal arm. The world in this is pretty big, though some things in it (like walls of air that prevent you from going places) don't make a lot of sense. The airships are cool, though, and you can upgrade your ship with armor and cannons, to fight in ship-to-ship battles. The overall effect of the towns, including people in them, buildings, and surroundings, are pretty neat. Also, the detail in the gameplay and battles amaze me. Unlike many RPGs, in Skies of Arcadia: Legends, characters will fight in the background (but not do any damage) while they wait for their turn. Last, there are less \"Random Encounters\" than in Final Fantasy, which means you can walk quite a bit without running into an enemy. Overall, this is an incredibly good RPG. 10/10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2012"}

Each class has it's own strengths and weaknesses, and even better, they can each stand on their own if you decide to go solo (a feature that has confounded some game designers). You have a choice between 5 color schemes, then beyond that you choose the equipment, ability development, and in general how you play.Now, I'll tackle one of the issues that some insecure gamers bring up: the sorceress and amazon are too sexualized. One look would give you this impression, but never judge a book by its cover. Sure, we've all giggled at the sorceress' run at first, but once you reach the first boss you forget all about it. The only reason people would complain is that they feel guilty or are trying to prove something. Personally? The body shape just helps me figure out the classes quickly for NPC helpers.There are sidequests, which are annoying at first and necessary later, and each has a reward. Usually some gold and skill points, but more importantly an amazing piece of art with a story. I think there are about 50 pieces of art, and each story is different. Intelligent references to old magic, sweet and charming stories, hilarious stories, and the just plain weird.
