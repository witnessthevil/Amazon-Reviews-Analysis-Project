As with all releases in theDead Risingseries, it is a survival horror game. Players take on the role of an all-new character, with equally new motivations to survive and resources to do so. These resources include new weapons, expanded weapon combination/creation possibilities, and even two-player coop functionality. The game also features a 4-player online multiplayer mode and a dramatic increase in the number of zombies that can be faced at once.","reviewerName":"Ian","summary":"Only slightly worse then a bite to the neck","reviewText":"I crawled across the blackened, ash covered ground of Hell, staggering towards the exit, my skin being torn to shreds by demons and hell hounds who relentlessly pursued me.  But I ignored them, for I was so close to escaping.  My freedom awaited as I got closer and closer to the gates.But there was only one barrier left...the devil himself.\"Hello there!\" he giggled as I finally reached the gate.  \"So, you want to leave?  Of course you can!  There's only one thing left you have to do!\"He reached behind his back and pulled out a copy of Dead Rising 2.I froze, my heart skipping a beat as I gazed upon the case, terror threatening to overwhelm me.\"Oh please, not that!\" I said.\"If you want to escape Hell, all you have to do is play Dead Rising 2!\" the devil said.  \"Why, there's some fun stuff in here, isn't there?\"\"Yes,\" I stammered, terrified.  \"I mean, the graphics are good, and it's amazing to see lots of zombies on screen on once...when I first ran through the streets, it was amazing to see all those undead monsters lurking around.\"\"Go on.\"\"And...\" I gulped, trying to catch my breath.  \"And it's great fun improvising weapons, trying out different combinations and creating the most powerful weapons, like a sledgehammer with a fire axe.\" A smile crossed my face.  \"Oh man, that was awesome.  As well as getting a kayak paddle and chainsaws to create a weapon that would put Darth Maul to shame.  That was just sweet.  Oh!  And also riding a pink girl's bicycle around and running down zombies!  I had so much fun with that!\"\"Anything else?\"\"Yeah!  It's awesome to find survivors and guide them to safety.  It's so satisfying and fulfilling to save other people's lives.  It really made me feel like I was making a difference, and having to be creative in some of them was awesome, like the time I had to carry a woman in a mermaid costume to safety, or when I had to defend a war veteran who was crippled and couldn't walk very fast, or even better, when I found two soldiers fighting for their lives and had to try and lead them to safety.  These were arguably the best moments of the game, and the most fun.\"\"That is indeed great,\" the devil said.  \"But tell me...why are you so afraid to look at it?  Is there something that you didn't like?  Like...oh...say...the boss bottles?\"\"No!\" I shouted, falling back to the hard ground.\"Oh?  You don't like them?  After all, I designed them myself!  I thought they'd be fun!\"\"They wern't fun!\" I yelled.  \"They were awful!  They were the worst boss fights I've ever endured!\"\"Oh really?  How so?\"\"They were too overpowered!  Bosses could take away half your health in a matter of seconds!  The game gave them all the advantages, and didn't give you any help!  They're so overpowered and so cheap, it's disgusting!  Like those two sluts in dresses and high heels!  They could run faster then I could, could take three times as much damage as I could, and had samurai swords!  I only had pipes to fight with, and they delt out so little damage where their swords could kill me in just a few hits!  It was atrocious!  Whoever designed these fights should be fired!\"\"Sorry, not going to happen,\" the devil said, grinning.\"Then you're a horrible game designer!\" I shouted.  \"The main game is fun, but those boss battles are atrocious in every way possible!  They're so awful, that when I got to the last boss, I just gave up, uninstalled the game, and returned it to blockbuster.  I was so sick of dealing with cheap attacks and overpowered bosses who are enormously unfair!  If you had just toned them down, then the game would be great!\"At those words, the devil grinned even more, his teeth twisting into a demonic smile of pure malevolence, the likes that would make the most hardened sinner quake with fear.\"Well now, I'm glad you said that.  Because if you want to escape Hell, all you have to do is fight all the bosses at once, without dying once.\"He tossed me the game.\"Have fun.\"As he walked away, I stared at the case in my hand.  It was laughing, mocking me, it's voice composed of all the bosses taunting me, knowing that in a matter of moments, they would be killing me over and over, giving me next to no chance to fight back, and no hope of victory.As blood poured from the case and began to drench me, I sobbed, even as I took the disk and popped it in the PS3, turning it on, even though there was no hope of escape.  Vultures came and pecked at my flesh and bones, hoping to tear me apart before I even got past the fat gimp with the chainsaw, for whom my hatred for was never ending, even as he knocked me off my feet again and again.Across all of hell, my screams of agony echoed, drifting into eternity, without end......for I was playing Dead Rising 2.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000TVT8PI","reviewerName":"Mitchell M. Tse \"mitchelltse\"","summary":"If you're buying a PS3, this is the bundle for you!","reviewText":"Since loads of people have already given excellent reviews of the Playstation 3 console, I won't bore you with any rehashing.  Instead, I'll address this Motorstorm Pack, as it compares with other various versions of PS3's you can buy.By now, the 60G model is pretty much out of stock, so I won't consider that as an option.  And for a game console, I'm not going to recommend buying it used, either.What you're left then are the following choices:1. Barebones 40G model, which sells for about 400, and comes with one controller, Spiderman 3 movie and the 5 free blue ray movies (ends in Feb 2008).2. 40G model (Item 1 above) bundled with various games and/or accessories, with corresponding price additions.3. Barebones 80G model (this item), which comes with one controller, Motorstorm game (MotorStorm, and the same 5 free blue ray movie deal.4. 80G model (Item 3 above) bundled with various games and/or accessories, with corresponding price additions.To compare the 40G and 80G model, you're paying a hundred more to get more hard drive space, PS2 emulation, WIFI, more slots, and the Motorstorm game versus the Spidey movie.  Motorstorm is actually a very good game, while most of you already have the regular version Spidey DVD, so the Motorstorm advantage is notable.  You may be thinking that saving a hundred by getting the 40G is worthwhile, but let's not kid yourself.  By the end of the year, you'll have spent a grand on your Playstation console and game purchases, so a hundred is not that significant.  Also, these features that you pass up by getting the 40G are not easy to add on separately.  Based on this, I'd recommend against Options 1 and 2.The only remaining comparisons then are between Options 3 and 4.  Option 4, the bundle option, often claims that you save money by including these other games and accessories, but one thing they DON'T mention is that these savings would be realized ONLY if you were paying full price for those games and accessories!  Most games are sold on sale on day of release, and the price only goes down.  Similarly, both the Sixaxis controller and DVD remote (which is only a convenience, since the bluetooth Sixaxis controller does operate as a remote) are often sold on sale.  Therefore, unless you really anticipate to buy the exact games and accessories that come with a bundle, and can only find them at MSRP, I'd suggesting buying the Motorstorm Pack instead of buying it in a bundle.Overall, of course, is that the Playstation 3 is definitely highly recommended!  So whatever your decision, go buy the PS3!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2008"}

It's even more amazing that the original game has managed to stay virtually unscathed in the translation, with even new additions thrown in as well.  Super Mario 64 DS begins with you controling Yoshi as you wander around the castle grounds trying to figure out what happened to Mario and where Bowser has taken the Princess and hidden the 150 stars (yes, there's more stars to collect here than before).  As you progress, you'll also be able to play as Mario, Luigi, and Wario as you further your mission to collect the stars and defeat Bowser and a host of other baddies; all of which is easier said than done.  Graphically, the game looks nearly identical to the Nintendo 64 classic, which is simply amazing.  Every stage from the original game is here as well, along with some new areas and features for good measure.  There's even some mini-games you can play using the stylus, and more you can unlock by finding stolen keys.  The only real problem with Super Mario 64 DS is that players of the original may have problems switching from the analog stick which worked so well with the original, to the directional pad of the DS.  It takes some time, but eventually you'll get used to it.

{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"The Mid 90s XBOX - Goodbye old friend, hello Project64 emulation instead.","reviewText":"For those who remember this console.- Quicker loading times than the PS1.- A 64bit graphics pipeline.- The funky controller.Games:- Banjo Kazooie(Best game)- Turok (Best graphics)- Extreme G (Fastest game)- Goldeneye (Best Multiplayer)- Blast Corps (Best puzzle game)- Pro Evolution Football (Best sports game)If you have never heard about these games go read about them and you will see why this console was important for games development.

This is one of them. Perhaps the first of its kind (most notably because of it's polygonal graphics), Star Fox transcends the limitations of the Super Nintendo to become a classic for the ages.Granted, the first stage isn't quite as lovely as I remember it being (the graphics are indeed quite simple and the draw distance is sadly quite limited), but once you get past it things really take off. The in-cockpit view is awesome, featuring one of the coolest looking targeting sights in gaming history. Your fellow wing-men will get in trouble and need bailing out. You can boost past your allies to avoid accidentally shooting them (or to keep from getting hit), or slow yourself down. Your ship can lose a wing, causing it to control awkwardly, and you can dodge enemy fire by spinning your craft.Normally I would talk about negative points, but besides the date of the graphics (and perhaps the sound capabilities of the system, if midi music bothers you) could possibly hinder this game. The gameplay is awesome, and only improves with time. There are three different routes to take (and secret levels!) which adds to replay value tremendously. And let's not forget the fact that the levels are incredibly well designed, the graphics are used to maximum effect (man that hyperspace jump is awesome looking!), and the music is some of the best in any game ever.This game is truly a classic in every way. If you love great games, you'll love Star Fox. And if you love 3D-on-rails shooters, you MUST HAVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2003"}

I bought all the DLC. For me, all Bioware games are Must-Play. But I can't make the argument that Awakening is Must-Own. It all depends on what you care about. Bioware games work on four pillars. Story World. Level-up System. Romance. Replayability. Awakening has two of the four. By 25% more Dragon Age, I expect to get 35 hours out of Awakening. Three play throughs, about 12 hours each. Warrior, mage, thief. I don't count that at as full replayability. I expect to get 6-8 play throughs for a Bioware game. Awakening doesn't let you use any of your DLC. Awakening has no romance.

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Dr. Freeman","summary":"Best of the genre?","reviewText":"Ive played some great RPG's and this one would be in my top 5 and very near the top.

Single player is classic COD style, thrilling and intense missions. The game is short though and theres not alot of replay value after youve finished it. Graphics looks nice and runs smooth even on a low end system. Overall the game has a nice look and feel to it. Those are all the positives, all the negatives to me show up on the multiplayer side. Two major problems I have are the random respawns and size of the maps. Randomly respawning (constantly) right next to a cluster of enemies is irritating. Its OK the first few times but it starts to get annoying and repetitive. Combine that with the small size of the maps and you get the run and gun style of gameplay which is complete chaos. There is no strategy involved, basically everyone is just blasting away or its a spamfest of grenades and airstrikes. So if you want to jump right into the action then COD4 is for you. But for the rest who have played the original Call of Duty/UO, you might find this title a bit lacking if you are looking for teamwork and balanced maps.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2007"}

That being said, I am no stranger to fighting games.  When I read about SC4 it sounded like it had so much promise.  What I got seemed kind of just okay.  There are really four things going for SC4: 1)Terrific graphics, 2)Large number of characters, 3)Customized Equipment, and 4) Customized Characters.  Number three is the stand out of the game.  Through purchase and acquisition there are a huge number of equipment and weapon pieces availble in the game.  They let you give your players a very respectible range of abilities.  Couple that with the ability to customize your own character down to their facial features and you get something really great and unexpected in a fighting game.  But all this seems like window dressing.  It's all very pretty but feels of little substance.  The game play is repetitive and the story is really non-existent.  There's nothing that pulls you into the game. It really seems to be an almost XBox Live geared release.  That's where the fun is had.

The first game I ever got was Super Mario World and played it hours on end day after day. Then last year my friend gave me Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island for my SNES. I found myself playing through the night. Now thankfully this game has been ported from the Super Nintendo to the Game Boy Advance. Ever since the original Mario game on the NES, the Mario games seem to keep getting better and better.In Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island you are Yoshi and you go through the levels with Baby Mario sitting on your back. If you get hit by an enemy then you lose Baby Mario and he starts to cry, but you have 10 seconds to get him back. If the timer runs down to zero, he is kidnapped and you lose a life. As Yoshi you can \"eat\" the enemies and they become eggs which you can shoot at other enemies and at bonus clouds that hold coins, stars or flowers. Every red coin that you get that is hidden throughout each stage it worth one point to your score. Each star you collect adds one second to your timer. And each flower gives you 10 points. If you collect all 5 flowers in a stage you get an extra life, similar to collecting the Yoshi coins in the first Super Mario World. You can earn up to 100 points for each level (50 for all the flowers, 30 for all the red coins, and 20 for all the stars). If you get 100 points for each level in the game, you can unlock secret levels that are really awesome!There are many great, challenging stages in this game. In all, there are 48 levels in the whole game, only half as many as Super Mario Advance 2. After you beat each stage you jump into a hoop and a light starts going around the hoop. If it lands on a flower you get to play a bonus game, if not you just advance to the next stage. It takes a while to get used to this game if you are a veteran Super Mario World  player (on GBA or SNES) because this game is so much different than it.

You are Ethan Thomas an FBI agent who is suppose to find the Match Maker a man who kills his victims by making them into manniquenns. Around 10-15 minutes you will be framed for the murder of two policemen. This is where the game gets interesting because you battle people that are on this strange drug as they say and its gone rampant throughout the city.You then have to prove that you're still a good guy by finding the criminal who killed the two policemen. You'll then face different varieties of enemies, but there aren't many though. Then you will be tasked to gather lots of evidence and try to find the Match Maker, but there is another criminal the one criminal who stole your gun and killed the two policemen, his name is Serial Killler X and trust me he is very smart making you put your brain to the test.This game will make you go to places you really wouldn't want go to, for example you go to the appleseed orchard which is probably the scariest place in the game. The game doesn't get very scary until you get to the 5th chapter then things will get scarier. The game uses very amazing graphics. The enviroments and atmosphere is incredibly scary and realistic, but the character designs aren't incredible they're kind of rubbery but they're still good. The whole game is extremely dark and if you didn't that very very handy flashlight then well....... this game would get one star. you also get a very handy taser (the reason they put it in here is probably because sometimes you might not be good at blocking so you can taser some criminal butt.)

There are so much depth and varies in this game that I have not seen since Final Fantasy.  Who care if the Game Cube version is better looking, this is still the best looking PS2 game out there.  The detail, environment, texture mapping, layout, game options are all well done.What to like:-The weapon system is more realistic.  How it work in the real world to how it is being played is much better then ever.  The scoping element was used very little in Code: Veronica, but is a main stay here.  Collecting money for upgrade from a merchant is nice.-The game-play and movement is much improved with a new graphic engine.  The over the shoulder action give the game a true 3D-element where your enemies are, but not like a window view of a 1st person shooter.-The bosses are way different; some are fast, some are slow, jumping, there are weak spots, special techniques to take them out.  Past RE, all you have to do is use the most powerful weapon and just blasts them to death, but not here.  The minions are much smarter then ever, even invisible.-The element of protecting Ashley, the key to the story give an added element to the game-play.-Intense actions that actually will raise your blood pressure, the background music is great.-Not as scary as the original game.  RE4 is design for action and the puzzle are fewer, but clever.The not so good:They took out the item chest, where you can collect and dump everything is gone.This is a 2nd or 1st person perspective game, which give me mild headache.  I have to sit as far as I can and play for a limited time.This could be good or bad, but the game is a much harder and longer game then any RE out there.  I though Code: Veronica was hard, this is about 20% more difficult.  A guide book really helps.I got the platinum edition and the only thing worth it is the metal chase.  The other items, card and mini series bio is useless.  This is a game of all action games.  Just play it to enjoy this masterpiece.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2005"}

This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"GC","summary":"Very unreal...","reviewText":"What I don't liked about the game was that you're in an unreal city.

In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use.

Footprints will be left in mud, for example, but only until it rains and then they will wash away. Lara's shirt will also get wet, and she's more likely to lose her grip if she is standing on a slippery, rain-soaked ledge. When the sun comes out, her shirt will dry and the slippery surfaces regain their friction.In Underworld, Lara also has a lot more flexibility in how she makes her way through a level, as there is often more than one way to get from here to there. She can now climb walls with texture and rocky outcroppings to reach areas she previously wouldn't have been able to access.All of these additions have been made to give the game a non-linear, open feel. Players can interactive with the environment by doing things they find to be intuitive, and the game will respond in an appropriate way. When Lara interacts with trees, for example, she will push aside leaves using either one or two hands depending on whether or not she's holding something. These details give a lifelike, immersive sensation to the game.New Melee Combat SystemUnderworld introduces a new melee combat system that requires players to strategically strike with offensive, defensive, and evasive maneuvers. Lara can now attack enemies with different punches, kicks, knees, and other acrobatic onslaughts. Items lying on the ground, such as poles that were previously walked on, can be picked up and swung at enemies. Players can also perform a greater variety of actions with weapons; for example, Lara can now hold onto a ledge with one hand and fire a gun with the other.Realistic Enemy and Animal AIThe AI in Tomb Raider: Underworld has also taken a big step forward--both enemies and animals now make independent decisions based on their surroundings, employ ambush and squad tactics when fighting, and will retreat if deemed necessary.With updated graphics and a more immersive and realistic gameplay, Tomb Raider: Underworld will have both fans and newcomers excited about the newest installment in this popular video game-pinup franchise.Tomb Raider: Underworld is loaded with a new melee combat system, various weapons, and smarter AI for both enemies and animals.","reviewerName":"J.

{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"dookerJ","summary":"True Next-Gen Gaming is Here","reviewText":"The PS4 is amazing.  Truly next-gen.  I'll break my review down into several sections:Hardware-------------Independent tech sites (generally PC and gadget benchmarking sites) have benchmarked the PS4, and suffice it to say, he hardware and design (availability of the hardware for actual game use) is exponentially greater than that of the Xbone.  Devs at the large studios are saying that the PS4, on an unoptimized A to A port of a game, is 50% faster than the Xbone.  50%, unoptimized!  We've seen this; the proof is in the pudding:COD Ghosts - PS4 1080P 60FPS, Xbone 720P ~60fpsAssassins Creed 4 - PS4 1080P, Xbone 720P (framerate varies, but is better on PS4 by all accounts, there is also a physics engine enabled that is only available on the PS4 version).PS4 has a lightweight, BSD-based OS that only uses one core of the 8 CPU cores; Xbone uses 2 cores for its large, 3-layer, bloated OS (Hypervisor, Windows, Kernel-Game).PS4's sharing and social features are superior out of the box.  Xbone, as of this review, is having problems recording and sharing video at all, but MS is promising a &#34;fix&#34;.  PS4 always records 15+ minutes in the background, which you can then save, edit, upload, share, do whatever with.  It has a separate co-processor (basically a mini-PS3 in power) which handles these background functions, so gameplay isn't ever affected.  Xbone uses its system-wide resources to do recording, which is why, on top of having a last-gen GPU, last-gen CPU, and much slower RAM (DDR3 vs GDDR5 in the PS4), the Xbone is a much slower, less graphical, poorer overall experience than the PS4.PS4 also has all the voice commands like the Xbone, but you can simply do them through the controller; no need to buy the camera accessory if you don't want to.  Whereas Xbone forces the Kinect on you to be able to use voice commands, but let's face it, actual Kinect GAMES have never been worth playing, and never will be, so the Xbone is seriously overpriced.It's worth noting that the head Xbox Exec at MS left the company prior to the console's launch, because he knew it would be a failure.  While review sites got PS4 consoles early and were able to show reviews (commenting that the graphics were on par with a high-end PC with the graphics set to &#34;high&#34;), MS did not release any to reviewers, and instead only showed their own demos, which were running on a high-end PC.  They knew their console couldn't produce the same quality of graphics and gameplay that the PS4 is capable of.Controller-------------Last generation, I had a 360, PS3, and Wii, and the 360 controller was probably my favorite.  This generation, the PS4 controller definitely takes the win.  It's much sturdier and well-built than the Xbone controller, still features motion controls (which the Xbone doesn't), and adds a new touchpad and speaker on the control.  This is great; in a game like Assassin's Creed 4 you can pinch and zoom around the world map, and it's clickable, too.  In games like Killzone, when you pick up an audio log, the audio comes out of the controller, which is really cool; it increases the feeling of immersion, as if I'm holding the actual audio log in my hands.It's also worth mentioning that DualShock 4 controllers come rechargeable as standard.  Xbone controllers, you have to spend another $30-40 for a charging kit just to get ONE rechargeable battery.  Out of the box, Xbone just gives you two AA batteries, which will go out quickly.Games-----------The generation is young, but there are already some great games out.  All the gaming sites have said the PS4 version of Assassin's Creed 4 is the &#34;definitive&#34; version, with the best graphical fidelity, and the use of the controller touchpad, etc.  Killzone: Shadow Fall is arguably the most truly &#34;next-gen&#34; game that exists as of this review, as it is the only game out that was written specifically for one console, and optimized to use its hardware in a next-gen way.  The graphics and gameplay are outstanding and immersive.  Multiplayer will suck you in for hours upon hours.  Knack is actually a pretty good game despite the mediocre reviews.  Resogun, another PS4 exclusive, is free with your PS+ account, which you'll need to play online (like XB Live), and is graphically stunning, requiring super tight timing and constant focus (don't blink!).  All the other multiplat ports are available, too&#8230;  Madden, NBA, COD, etc, and run by far the best on the PS4, given its exponentially more powerful hardware.Sony and PS4 have 20+ exclusives coming out in 2014; Xbone has about 2 (and one is a timed exclusive; it will be released on PS4 slightly later).  So it's pretty simple; with multiplats being lead SKU for PS4, and Sony always being stronger in exclusives, it's the go-to console this generation.Conclusion-------------The PS4 is the way to go if you want to get into the new generation of gaming.  Sony did their homework, and have outsold the Xbone 3 to 1 in North America, and 9999 to 1 internationally (where the xbox doesn't sell at all).  The sales numbers are in, and even the Wii U outsold the Xbone throughout Nov/Dec 2013.  PS4 has won the console war, and it deserves it.  It's a spectacular piece of hardware, and now with multiplats being developed for PS4 firstly in mind, and Sony's strong exclusives lineup, it's a no-brainer.  I have owned nearly every console since Pong, except for the Sega Genesis during the SNES/Genesis years.  It looks like that's going to be the case this generation, too, for the second time, because Xbone just doesn't bring anything to the table; it's seriously underpowered for games, and they relied solely on the Kinect/TV tuner functionality to sell it.  Cable is on its way out for a lot of people (with online streaming apps replacing TV, etc), and those who do have cable already have an interface in place (a DVR, Tivo, Google TV, etc, which aren't compatible with the Xbone, which has to be the primary tuner).PS4 = epic, next gen win!Xbone = epic, last-gen fail!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2014"}

{"product_name":"B0001ADAMO","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyable multiplayerReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Gameboy \"David\"","summary":"Pretty fun!","reviewText":"I just got this game a couple days ago and it's a blast!  I played the first six chapters in one sitting b/c I was having so much fun I couldn't put it down yet! However, I did get to a tough spot when my character changed to another gunslinger and I am not used to the way he handles yet.  But I only tried a few times with him...only to end up full of bullet holes! lol But what fun! If you are into shooters and enjoy an old western, then I suggest you give this game a try.  You get to play a number of characters throughout the game and the cutscenes are really cool to watch as the story unfolds in your quest to avenge the death of your father.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2006"}

There are some kool 'cheats' too after you collect the (30) laptops scattered throughout the campaign that have the usual cheats like infinite ammo and a wierd but funny cheat that when an enemy gets killed they explode into a pile of car tires..lol..and with the same cheat if you shoot down a chopper the sky rains Goodyears..lol. Also another perk, after beating the campaign 'Arcade' mode opens up , you now get scored on the camapaign based on performance like headshots-blowing up cars-string togeter kills,like mutiple headshots etc. You'll see a score meter that tracks your progress in 'Arcade' mode.What an awesome game the campaign alone really is worthy but its the multiplayer that seals the deal as COD4 is one of the best FPS to hit the consoles in a long time.

I grew up with Super Mario Brothers (yes I bought the original NES with the Mario/Duck Hunt combo).  I enjoyed SMB 2 (despite it not being a SMB game in Japan) and SMB 3.  When Nintendo released Super Mario World, I felt that they had reached new levels of playability, complexity, and fun.  Where the previous games had lacked depth (though SMB3 had a bit more), this game expanded the realm of the series so greatly.  They added in new worlds, the ability to traverse all of the worlds freely (once they levels were cleared) and secrets galore.  I spent a lot of time trying to clear every 'exit'.  Super Mario World 2 pushed the envelope by adding 100% clear goals (all the red coins, yoshi tokens, stars).  Now you had real motivation to replay levels and attempt to clear them with 100% of the items, striving for perfection.  It encouraged you to replay tough levels and hone your skills.  Bravo!Now New Super Mario Brothers takes elements of each of these games and puts it in a nice retro package.  The art and graphics are superb and are clearly some of the best on the DS.  The tunes are generic, but old school and clearly Mario Brothers styled.  When I first played it, my friend quipped, \"What is that you're playing?  It sounds like an old Mario game!\".Some of the mechanics are off, but I am forgiving (often you jump to squash something and the jump tends to fall short sometimes, I know it's something you get used to, but the jumping doesn't feel like Mario games in the past).What I am less forgiving about is the lack of depth.  You collect three large coins in each level which can be used to unlock doors and secrets on the map (mainly to get items or one ups).  Other than collecting these coins, there is little else to do other than clear the levels.  Some levels have secret exits (like beating the boss of world 2 in tiny form unlocks world 4 in stead of world 3).  But I found little joy in replaying the levels.There are a few fun mini-games as well, though they are nothing earth shattering.  Kind of a Mario Party sampling.Overall this is a fun game, a cross between SMB1 and SMB3 but with some elements from Super Mario World.  I actually checked it out at my local library instead of buying it (though I am a compulsive DS game buyer).  I am glad I tried before I bought.If you have funds to toss down on a DS platformer, grab one of the Castlevania titles instead, unless you are a die hard SMB fan!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0056WJA30","description":"","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"Ocarina of Death","reviewText":"Darksiders II is one of those rare sequels that so utterly surpasses the original it kind of should have been renamed something different - I felt the same with Assassin's Creed II as well. And what I mean by that is the sequels add so much more game to what was already an excellent experience that anyone who didn't enjoy the first games may deprive themselves of the follow-ups.As you may have read, DS II is a fine blend of Prince of Persia Sands of Time with the wall running and time travel and the aforementioned Assassin's Creed with parkour style climbing. Clearly though by far its biggest influence is Zelda Ocarina of Time. It has all of the great elements of its Nintendo inspiration including an Epona clone, cunning dungeon puzzle solving, and massive exploration which often involves retreading old ground as you can new skills (including a hookshot!).The graphics though are a breed apart from anything I've seen on the 360; stylized and beautiful each element has been crafted to inspire awe, from the dripping lava to the phenomenally huge panorama landscapes. There's so much subtlety in place here too that it's easy to skip over it but if you stop for a moment and just watch the little special effect touches put in place you can't help but smile and admire the effort by the developers.As with the landscapes, the game is equally massive. You won't finish this in a night - or two or even three; my first run through on normal difficulty took thirty four hours. That's without completing all the side quests or finding everything. Upon finishing the last boss I restarted a new game+ with all my stats on the newly opened 'apocalyptic' difficulty and it's such a joy to retread the reset dungeons and re-do the puzzles.I cannot begin to laud how good this game is. And yet it has everything I would normally dislike in a game, such as multiple boss battles and confusing locations and random puzzles - and yet it works. It works perfectly and it is THE game of the year and possibly the last best game I'll play on the 360 before the console's sequel comes out.I won't bother continuing my gushing. If you've been holding back because perhaps you thought the original a somewhat shallow button masher or there's other releases that you have your eye on, please don't hesitate. Developers of games like DS II deserve to be supported and you're actually doing yourself a disservice if you don't buy it right now. Go on...

It is a series of lessons that require you to read instructions and lessons, follow directions on screen, and practice your own art.The lessons are very basic and will not make you an artist overnight but they will get you to think about how you look at shapes, light, shadows, and how to create the illusion of art.I was an art major in college and I've been a graphic designer for over 20 years. I enjoyed doing this and was very surprised at how fine I could make lines and how much control I had. I use a graphics tablet all the time and have a lot of experience with doing art using a graphic pen. Using the DS stylus was a little awkward at times only because the screen is so small but if you calibrate your DS before beginning the lessons, it will help to make your strokes hit the screen where you want them to.This wasn't great and it sometimes seemed like more work than I wanted to do while chillin' out but a few art lessons with interaction for this price?

Before I bought Halo, I couldn't see what the big fuss is about, but now I do - Halo is the Real Deal, a true Classic that you will play endlessly and fondly remember years from now.  With a huge and engaging single-player mode, a worthwhile co-op mode, 16 player multiplay that's as effortless as plugging a cord, great graphics and controls that fit like a glove, Halo holds its own against any FPS game on the PC.The essense of Halo is playing with other people.  Even in the first stages of the single player game, you are fighting alongside your fellow shipmates and marines.  Your buddies call out to each other and cover one another, and so do the bad guys.  It's cool to jump into a jeep or tank and see friends climb into the turrets and hang on the sides, turning the vehicle into a moble fortress.  At the times when you truly go solo, like infiltration missions or whatnot, you really do feel alone, sometimes like you're a one-man army and sometimes like the entire world is falling apart on top of your head.The story and the setting are very cool - you crash land on a giant ring-world of an ancient dead civilization, with structures and settings that are absolutely enormous, sometimes miles across.  I liked the ramp-up in difficulty, moving from large coordinated attacks to one-man army raids and on to thrilling moments when all you can do is clear a path to run through, because you're scared to death of what's behind you.  My only complaint is that some locations are recycled too often, and it seems that I revisited everything twice.Co-op is wonderful!  Somehow Microsoft made it seem as if they customized the game for co-op mode, without losing anything by playing in single-player mode.  Most FPS co-op is frustrating, as you struggle against enemies and situations designed for 1 person, not 2.  The maps are usually too small, and the enemies and weapons are too few.  Since Halo already has other good guys fighting in the game, the 2nd player is really just adding some intelligence to one of your buddies. It's so much fun I finished the game with a friend before I ever played it alone.Once you're bored with the story, you'll find some of the best multiplay modes I've ever seen.  You can connect 4 Xboxes with 4 players each, for 16 player mayhem.  The setup is effortless (it uses 10/100 ethernet cords and hubs, the same as your computer).  Game types include deathmatch and team deathmatch, capture the flag, hot bag, king of the hill, assault, racing and rally, and on and on.  Plenty of custom options, like unlimited grenades and all-player invisiblity keep things constantly changing.  One complaint about multiplayer (my 2nd and last complaint about hte entire game) is that there aren't enough maps to play on, and most of those maps are of the boxed-in maze type.If you own an Xbox, You should own this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2004"}

{"product_name":"B000034DCF","reviewerName":"JoeAZ92","summary":"An excellent racing game that gives even recent Mario Karts a run for their money","reviewText":"Positive:+ fun!+ advanced techniques add depth to the gameplay+ great controls+ excellent adventure mode+ time trial mode is cool+ awesome tracks+ excellent music and sound effects+ lasts a long time overallNegative:- bosses have unlimited items- no crash detection when bumping other kartsCrash Bandicoot was one of the leading franchises on the PlayStation, and for good reason. A few top-notch games rightly earned him the position. After a few great 3-D platformers, Naughty Dog decided to take Crash to the racetrack in Crash Team Racing (CTR): a solid kart racer that has much more to it than your average Mario Kart.CTR is a blast to play. The controls are great and there is much to master if you want to race with the best methods. If you play as a character like Crash or Cortex, you can make it around most curves by simply turning. However, proper use of drifting can become extremely beneficial, and it is a much harder technique than in Mario Kart and takes a lot to fully master.Jumping is also a key to winning races. By pressing R1 at the top of any kind of bump, ramp, etc. you can get a boost upon hitting the ground (provided you manage to get enough air). This element is really cool and certain courses require lots of strategizing with the jumps to make shortcuts and get the most boosts possible.The weapons are also great. They are mostly modeled after basic weapons found in most racing games (homing missile, bomb that rolls in a straight line, potions and TNT to drop behind you, shield, etc.). However, you have the opportunity to upgrade your items within the race by collecting 10 fruits. This puts all items you get in an upgraded form as long as you have the fruit; it's a neat element.Believe it or not, CTR actually has a story. An alien named N. Oxide has decided that he wants to turn the world into a giant parking lot. Therefore, it's up to your character of choice to save the world from too much asphalt and a lot of white lines. You race against 7 other characters on 16 tracks and 4 fast bosses to become the world champion who gets the opportunity to challenge the alien invader. The story is played out in the Adventure mode, which is the main part of CTR that puts it above the competition.In the adventure mode, you have to win a race on all 16 tracks (thereby collecting all the trophies) and then finally face Oxide. Along the way you'll race four bosses too including the classic Ripper Roo and the Komodo dragon Joe, each of which give you a boss key allowing you to reach the next area of the game.What did I just say? Area? That's right, Naughty Dog found it impossible to stray entirely from platforming with Crash. The game actually has a pretty big world containing five areas, and you get around by driving. You enter a level on warp panels (or something of the like) and race from there. It's really neat way to do a racing game and it's much more fun than picking and choosing what to do from a menu.The Adventure mode also has extra stuff to get. You'll be about 38% done with the adventure if you quit after getting the 16 trophies; each level also has a CTR token and relic. There are also four battle courses to get CTR tokens on plus a handful of gems. So as you can see there is a lot to do in the main mode, but to be honest it's not all that difficult to complete overall. Still, it's fun to do and lasts a while, and does present a few challenges. I can almost guarantee you'll play through this mode more than once if you own the game.Almost all of the game's 16 courses are really great. They're not exactly creative for the most part, but they're extremely fun. It's hard to choose a favorite when they're all so awesome! Most of the tracks are dedicated to one specific character. Several of them have shortcuts that can be taken by jumping with perfect timing and they can be quite difficult to make, so more advanced racers can take the lead with ease (provided they're really good at getting the shortcuts, that is).Of course, there is also a regular Grand Prix mode like any other racing game. You probably won't get around to it until you've beaten the adventure but it's there. There is also a battle mode also like most other racing games as well as multiplayer (of course).The time trial mode of CTR is really good. Not only do you go for the best time possible, you can stop the clock by hitting yellow boxes with numbers on them. This adds a cool element to the time trials and makes it so that you can get huge cuts in your times.There are quite a few characters in the game. You start with eight: Crash, Cortex, Coco, Tiny, N-Gin, Dingodile, Polar, and Pura. You can later unlock the adventure's bosses too, as well as a couple other characters. The original eight characters can be used in the adventure but only one per save file and you can't change them. Weight isn't an issue in the game, but turning, speed, and acceleration are the main statistics.Graphically, CTR kept up with the times. They're really not bad at all and playing it today isn't an eyesore. The sound effects have always been a strong point in Crash games and CTR is no exception to the rule: everything from shooting a missile to getting hit by one has a great sound effect. The music is pretty good too and you'll undoubtedly agree that it's a true classic in that sense.Overall, CTR is an excellent game. It's the most solid racer I've ever played, and it adds more to the normal racing formula with a great adventure mode, a neat time trial method, and having everything else your average racer of the day should have had. I highly recommend you get this game if you have any of the PlayStations, it's one racer not to be missed.Gameplay: 9.0Graphics: 8.5Sound: 9.5Value: 9.0FINAL SCORE: 9.1/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2008"}

Laharl awakes to find that his father is dead and that he needs to claim his rightful place as Overlord of the Netherworld. Disgaea is Laharl solidifying his place and encountering new adversaries. The first thing that must be said about this game is that it is a very funny game. So much of the dialogue and character interaction is played for laughs while advancing the story.Disgaea is a strategy RPG. You have a home base (the castle) which you can wander around in. It is a smallish castle. But it is from this castle that everything in the game starts. The actual gameplay takes place on \"maps\" or \"grids\" where you set your characters and move them into the best position, turn by turn, to do the most damage to the enemies or also maneuver themselves to attack your characters. This is a turn based game and you can think of the grid as a chess board. It's a chess board with height and obstacles and environment and certain tiles have special properties (attack +50%, invincibility, etc), but that is the way the grid plays out. From the castle you can also purchase items and weapons, go to the \"Item World\" in which you can fight inside an item to increase the item's stats, or go to the Dark Assembly where you get proposals passed to open new maps or get better stuff at the stores, or create new characters.The name of the game here is fun. This is a fun game to play and I didn't notice how much time I spent playing until I checked the game clock. For those gamers who aren't sure if they would like a strategy RPG, this is probably the game to try because it is superior to the rest. For those who do like RPG and Strategy games, it doesn't get better than Disgaea. It's a game with lots to do. I spent nearly 80 hours on the game before finishing the story and there was plenty left to do. Good thing there is a \"New Game +\" mode to go back through the game and make different choices (for multiple endings) as well as working on unlocking those new maps and creating different character classes.-Joe Sherry","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2006"}

You could get the full game experience from watching Youtube \"Let's Play\" videos. I understand that some people really enjoy a relaxing interactive movie type of experience, but I think some gamers are selling themselves short by singing the praises of Beyond Two Souls. Surely a game that puts a priority on story can still have deeper gameplay than this! Beyond Two Souls might as well be a special edition movie featuring alternate endings. For what is supposed to be a $60 video game, that's not a very good deal for the consumer.All that being said, it's certainly not a one-star game as the production values are quite high. If you really need to own this game, pick it up when the price drops.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2013"}
{"product_name":"B005IMVP0O","description":"","reviewerName":"Steven J. Sprigler","summary":"This is the handheld I've been waiting for and what the PSP should have been","reviewText":"I bought both the original PSP and the Nintendo DS.  The PSP kind of faltered and even though it did okay in the long run I lost interest in it early on.  If you came to the PSP later in its life that's a good thing.  For me the PSP was a let down in its infancy because it didn't quite deliver on its promise (implied or not) that it was a PS2 in your hands.  I spent the next many years with my DS->DS Lite->DSi as my handheld of choice.Enter the Vita.  I spent quite a bit of time with it yesterday upon receiving it and this time Sony got it right.  They promised again that this would be like having a home console in your hands and for a console that hasn't yet hit it stride and doesn't have developers fully optimizing for it... the end result is pretty amazing.  Maybe I shouldn't be amazed as more and more smartphones have been doing great things graphically.  The issue with smartphone gaming though is touch control alone is maddening.  I can't play adventure or platform games without either a D-pad or an Analog control stick.  It's way too imprecise and ends up just not being fun as you can't make the game do what you really intend.The Vita solves that while giving you even more innovative control schemes by recreating home console style controls on a handheld but adding in a front and back touch interface that adds a little more depth to tired old touch controls.  This isn't the end all device and it has its flaws for sure, but I was prepared to be let down by the Vita and I was definitely impressed by what they were able to deliver.The First Edition Bundle comes with a case that is pretty nice... my only real complaint about it is there is no place to put other memory cards.  The bundle comes with a 4GB card and I bought a 16GB card.  So I fashioned a card holder out of the two plastic holders that held the cards in place in their original packaging.  Then trimmed it down so it would fit in one of the game card slots in the case.Pros:It really feels like 360/PS3 style gaming in a handheldThe OS is optimized for touch and mimics a smartphoneEven though the price is higher than a 3DS I don't feel like I didn't get my money's worth especially with the bundles Sony offeredThe launch lineup had quite a bit to offer most people and it looks like they are trying to spread big titles out in the coming yearIt really lends itself to growing and changing to provide new features and services as they upgrade the OS along the wayCons:It's a little pricier than some might want to pay for a handheld (but worth it I promise!)The OS while optimized for touch doesn't let you use the D-pad or buttons for input at all... that kind of sucksSetting up 3G on the system is a nightmare... just do it on AT&T;'s websiteOh and that brings up AT&T...; the pricing for 3G makes no sense and Sony will have to give me a better reason to pony up money each month for it as right now they haven't made it a must have feature.Some might think the battery life is a Con but at around 5 hours of actual use it's worth having such a powerful system.The screen is plastic and not glass... I have to wonder if Sony just wants to sell their own screen protectorsWhich brings us to Sony wants to sell their own memory... it's a typical Sony move but it could have been worse (I guess)One more thing to note... on the memory card front.  I actually got the 16GB card and I cringed to pay so much for what I know should really be costing me $20 tops if it was microSD memory.  I installed a PSP game, a Vita PSN game, and 3 Vita full size demos and I still have 10GB left.  I think 8 to 16GB will be fine for most people.  The 4GB seems too small for most use cases and the 32GB seems a little too large unless you really just want to go all digital download.All in all I'd say most people would be happy with the Vita.  It has a definite place between smartphone and home console that gives an excellent balance of some freedom without sacrificing what you're used to playing at home on your big screen tv. Oh and speaking of big screens... if you haven't seen a Vita in real life you will be surprised just how big it really is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001TOQ8JS","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Fantastic, Amazing game - or should I say Fabulous!","reviewText":"I just finished playing through the entire Beatles: Rock Band game on medium level. I was blown away in so many ways. We have all the various music games, many for several platforms, and this by far is our new favorite.First, of course, the music. We have always loved the Beatles and playing through this game just reminds us how amazing these guys were as musicians. There's the \"outliers\" theory that they had amassed 10,000 hours of playing time with their high intensity early years, which speaks to their superb ability to just pick up and run on any stage. Whatever it was, their harmonies are superb, their rhythms are great fun. Bob (my musician boyfriend) commented that playing along with the songs was great. Often we have to force ourselves to play through a song on other games (even songs we like) because the coded buttons just aren't enjoyable, the coders get the rhythm a bit off. Here I was dancing along while I played guitar or sang.There are 8 chapters / venues, from the Cavern up through the Apple roof-top. There are three Abbey Road studio chapters. You might think that's boring. However, it was *superb*. They might start a song in the studio, but then the visuals go off to a CUSTOM TAILORED TO THAT SONG video! The Yellow Submarine song is underwater. The Sgt Pepper's song is in the gazebo complete with 1800s cut-out people! The flower sequences are amazing. Usually in music games I ignore the backgrounds. Here I would miss notes because I was swept away by the background graphics! Whoever did these art collaborations needs to be given a bottle of Champagne. Maybe two. They were incredibly beautiful and a sheer perfect tie-in with the songs many times. I would gladly watch someone else play so I could watch the visuals.Yes the \"gig\" shows you get early are fun - period appropriate screaming fans at Shea Stadium. I have to comment that the audience at the Budokan looked completely caucasian, surely some non-causasians should have been there? Still, a minor complaint.Gameplay is as mentioned superbly fun, and not just because of the stellar music. You get real harmonies, which is a breakthrough for these main pair of products (GH and RB). Sing along in harmony with a friend, sometimes even three part harmony. If you have a mic stand you can even hook up your mic and play drums while you sing, play guitar while you sing, since there's no \"hand clapping\" or other stuff you have to do.There are a few minor complaints. I nailed 100% several times and got nothing at all. No gold stars, no visual indication. Since I like to go through and get 100% on all songs, there's no easy way to see which to replay. The between-gig navigation is a bit rough, you have to literally page through them so you can't just scan the list. Even when you're looking at a given gig you have to go \"in\" to the gig to see which specific songs to work on. I really like having a scan option so I can look through for what I want to play with.You earn photos with your stars (i.e. actual photos of the Beatles to look at) but I'd have liked something a little more fun.  More instruments? I realize they want their gigs to all be period-specific with the right instruments and clothes but it still would have been cool to give the option.Also, you are forced down their path in its completeness. You can't get past the Cavern until you play EVERY gig in it. Then you move on to the Ed Sullivan show and so on. In every case you have to play every single song. I'd really like to have the normal \"earn X stars and progress\" in case there's  a song you're really eager to get to.You do get to download additional songs if you want - so if the killer set list built into this game isn't enough, you can always get more!I want to comment in general that the equipment you have for playing any of these music games matters a LOT. We have the Ion drum kit and the wireless guitars. I highly, highly recommend getting both of these. Playing any of these music games (and especially the Beatles!) on cheap gear can really frustrate you quickly.  Spend the money to get better equipment. You'll find you play the games for months and months because they are so much fun. You'll also find that your real life dexterity and drumming skills will improve *amazingly*.Finally be sure to sit through the 10 minute long (I'm not kidding) credits. You get to unlock an encore :)Feel free to contact me with any questions at all! I have the full set list posted on my site.UPDATE: Several people have emailed me asking if this can be played single player. YES. You play single player through the entire game if you wish. Also, if you're alone in your house, you can still play multi-player with people on Live, so you can have fun four player music by going online and finding other players through the Live network.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2009"}

I hated the first game, I didn't care for the first movie, and didn't even bother watching the second movie.  I thought this would be another run of the mill disappointing licensed game.  Was I wrong or what?It turns out they didn't bother doing a rehash of the old first game.  They decided to do it right this time.  What they got was an immersive, enjoyable game where web slinging, crime fighting and cut scenes are all woven together nicely.This game takes place in Manhattan, and it's got tons of buildings to swing around, plenty of crime to fight, and plenty of enemies.  There are about 15 missions in the story.  Most missions consist of swinging to one place, fighting a boss or doing some deed, and earning \"hero points\", all the while cut scenes keep you informed.  Swinging is fun and intuitive.  The fights are pretty fun as well.  You can dodge, attack, do multiple kicks, jump, etc.  The hero points is an interesting, open ended twist.  By fighting crime, helping people, battling super villains, or delivering pizza, you can earn enough points to pass a level and buy upgrades.  The cut scenes are small and not really impressive, but they add to the game and don't overwhelm it.  There is also a lot of humor tossed in for the fun of it.A great point about this game is that you rarely have to repeat anything, and you can save almost at any point.  It removes a lot of the frustration.There are some bad points though.  Some of the upgrades are super combos where you have to press X, circle, square, look at the sun, twirl on one foot, speak the alphabet backwards in order to do something.  Okay, I'm exaggerating, but it's only fun if you like fighting games.  Also, the graphics are pretty subpar for a recent PS2 game.  With the exception of the buildings, I thought it was pretty lacking.  Also, it's linear, which means that you're stuck in one level, you really can't move on.  Finally, it gets kind of repetitive.

I was happy to find out that the people from Bizarre were working on this as Project Gotham Racing was always one of my favorite racing series (great handling, fun arcade feel to a set of amazing real cars, AND Ferraris). The game itself, I think, is good. I like the way the cars handle, I like the roads and challenges, etc. My only issue with the game itself is how short it is. I have not touched the multiplayer, but the single player I am already 60% done. Forza 4, I am not even 60% done with the events. There are only 70 races for the competition, 30 street races, 7 special events, and a few other things here and there (That's my understanding of the total based on what I've seen, but this included no actual research, so I might be missing something).The selection of cars is pretty decent, but not nearly as many as FM4. It's still a good enough selection and includes cars from every category. I've just been saving my money and using the gift cars that I've been getting along the way. I love the gift cars. That is something I miss in recent Forza games. It was fun to win a car when you won a race instead of just more credits to use as you want.That said, the three star rating above is simply for the terrible collectors edition. I am a fan of collecting games, looking through manuals, etc. I am disappointed with the trend to eliminate instruction booklets. I agree that instructions are fairly useless as they are usually in game or self explanatory, BUT, I would love to see companies at least put some art in the box. Instead, I received a promotional page that might as well just be an advertisement instead of a \"contest.\" It also came with a crappy fake festival ticket that has the DLC codes at the bottom. It's neat, but would have been cooler if they actually printed it like a real ticket instead of just like a post card. It's just a disappointing collectors edition. The plastic sleeve covers the metal box and defeats the purpose of having a different case anyway. I spent the same amount for FM4 and got a nice art box. I think it would have been a nice touch to include the soundtrack or something since there is a huge focus on the music in the game.Anyway, the season pass is a no go for me as I spent that money on Borderlands 2 DLC and have other games coming. I can't spend $130 on a game like this. If anything, the collectors should have included a season pass for the DLC or a portion of it like FM4. This game just doesn't warrant spending more than the plastic box regular version with no DLC.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00GANWVJE","description":"","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"my favorite link is back","reviewText":"I was skeptical when I found out that Nintendo was planning to release a remake, er, sequel to the all-time Super NES classic the Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past, and even more skepitcal when I read that the game was planning on using the same overworld as LTTP, but with different dungeons.  Turns out I was worrying for nothing!  This game is simply a ton of fun with a bit of a challenge to make the journey even sweeter.While I do have a few complaints, well, let me mention them right away.  We'll get those out of the way first!  This first part isn't a complaint.  Even though the dungeons are different, they share similar themes to the ones from Link to the Past.  For example most if not all of the Dark World dungeons such as Swamp Palace, Skull Woods and Turtle Rock all make a return, but the kicker is that the dungeons are now drastically different in both puzzles and layouts.  I'd say they've become more challenging now too, since I was beating myself senseless on several occasions due to a few places in each dungeon that simply left me stumped.It should be noted that even though the puzzles and layouts have changed, the theme has remained the same.  In other words, expect more or less the same enemies from LTTP to be featured in the same dungeons in this game as well as the same tricks and traps you discovered in the original game (but either located in different spots or used in an entirely different way).  To give an example- the Tower of Hera.  Remember those blue/red switches that changed the floor panels?  Now they're back, but the entire dungeon is different so they're not in the same areas as they were before.  This is the theme for the entirety of the game.One thing that honestly bugs me a little is that the dungeons are sort of crammy and feel like Link is constantly boxed-in around every turn. This is due to everything appearing much bigger on the small 3DS screen compared to the more open environments (or perhaps the TV screen) from the Super NES version.  Not sure if these dungeons actually focus more on elaborate mazes or whether the upclose shot of everything creates an illusion that you're roaming through a giant maze.  With that said however, graphically the entire game is respectable though some areas resemble LTTP's areas way too much without any noticeable changes, such as the grass, cliffs and water.  I suppose those areas can't be upgraded anymore, however.  Boss fights are more strategic this time around.  Some of them make returns such as the famous giant twirling worm from Tower of Hera, as well as the leaping octopus from Swamp Palace.  Even the Turtle Rock boss returns and now he's *insanely* fast!  Wow I almost thought this particular boss was impossible when he began to overwhelm me with his speed.To give an estimation, I'd say the light world overworld is probably 70% identical to the one from Link to the Past and the dark world only 50% the same.  I actually like picking apart the differences- sometimes you forget you're not playing the Super NES game when suddenly you arrive to an inexplicable dead-end and you get confused for a moment only to remember... it's not the same game, haha!  There's several mini games to play such as the avoid-the-chicken game, which is fun (though difficult- much harder than the game in the same area of Kakariko village where you have to chop through bushes and make it to the finish line in under, what was it, 15 seconds or so).  I'm sorry to report that the magic mirror you used to travel between light and dark worlds is gone, and is replaced by warp portals inside certain cracked wall locations.  Pretty disappointing there since it means the game's slightly lacking *complete* freedom.The music that returns comes with mixed personal feelings.  The light world overworld is more majestic and elaborate, whereas the recurring dungeon music is now significantly restrained and less threatening as a result.  However the cave music has remained exactly the same as far as I can tell.  The dark world overworld theme is almost the same, perhaps slightly less appealing.  It should be noted however that each dungeon has its own unique theme, and since only one or two dungeons use the main dungeon theme from Link to the Past, there's really not a whole lot to complain about in this regard.  I LOVE the Swamp Palace music now.I also admire how the Desert Palace is trickier and more obstacle-heavy than the one from LTTP.  Oh and can't forget the top of the mountain- it's covered in snow now!  I love its beautiful appearance!  I gotta say though, those lion enemies that roam the top of the mountain- can't remember their official name, but MAN they like to drain Link's health down to zero in a hurry!  Better avoid them as much as you can because they are a problem for many of us.  I wish the underground ice dungeon was better, though.  This time it's incredibly short and lacks any kind of threats or powerful enemies.  The very final stage is more like a series of elaborate puzzles instead of an enormous, lengthy dungeon like in Link to the Past.  Another bummer.  Gannon resembling his trickery and fighting strategy from Ocarina of Time is a shame too.  I wanted something fresh.Perhaps the biggest disappointment is that you no longer find the boomerang, ice rod, fire rod, hookshot and other items- now they're all sold in one single spot (Link's home interestingly enough, and you'll find out why later- adorable reason really).  I really miss being able to find these items in treasure chests inside the dungeons.  To me there was a magical feeling of exploring deep inside dangerous enemy-filled dungeon rooms and basically tip-toeing through narrow hallways only to finally breathe a sigh of relief when you found the item you're looking for.  That was usually a sign you're almost finished and just need the big key to face the boss.  You won't get that feeling here since all the items are in the same exact spot.  Heart container pieces are now more challenging to acquire- if you remember they were usually sitting in the open in Link to the Past so it didn't take much effort to get them.  No more!Now onto the good.  These dungeons are loaded with puzzles and traps out the wazoo!  Many traps will probably force you to die more often than you'd like, and lots of patience and careful timing in order to master them is required on your part.  I recommend taking your sweet time with these dungeons.  That's not to say they're overly challenging- just tricky and deceiving quite often.  These dungeons are certainly an increase in challenge to a surpising extent compared to the version I know and loved for over 18 years.The VERY best thing about this version is this ability you acquire early on where you can literally walk *inside* of the walls!  And as one character points out, it's VERY freaky too!  This is a frequently used item that you'll undoubtedly be using hundreds of times in both the overworld and especially in the dungeons to find all the hidden goodies you can.  It's a LOT of fun to use too!  Here's a tip- walking through the walls is a requirement quite often to progress from one side of a dungeon hallway to another (most likely leading to a hidden spot in another area).  An area you probably won't see on screen either- you'll have to walk through the walls first!And whenever you're inside a wall you're timed with a purple meter too- when the purple inside the meter gets too low, you won't be able to stay inside the wall anymore.  What all this means is that basically you'll be using this item whenever you're in a jam, to see if you can sneak inside a wall to reach a new area.  Also please note that hundreds of dungeon walls are covered in rupees and hearts that you'll probably miss unless you walk inside the walls and do some experimenting.  This item is so much fun, irresistibly fun in fact, that I highly recommend using it whenever you can.  You'll thank me!Rupees seem rare at first, but the deeper you get into the game you'll realize you're stumbling upon treasure chests that contain 100 sometimes even 300 rupees, and it's not exactly rare to find such big amounts of rupees either.  They are stingy with rupees in the beginning however.  You'll need them to rent or spend on important items as you progress through the quest.  Let me tell you, if you want to buy items (you're given the option to rent them for cheaper prices) you'll be dishing out a LOT of rupees!  We're talking in the thousands, not hundreds!  Oh and of course, the storyline is significantly deeper/bigger than the original one from Link to the Past- that's to be expected though.  More text reading has become the norm for modern Zelda games it would seem.This game is nearly a classic, but not being quite as thrilling as Link to the Past makes me lower it one star.  Plus the above mentioned problems come into play sometimes.  Who cares though- this game's awesome, and an ideal Christmas or birthday present for not only Zelda enthusiasts, but anyone who desires exploring open world adventure games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2013"}

I used the strategy guide quite a bit to figure out the puzzles:God of War III Signature Series Strategy Guide (Signature Series Guide)I am happy to say that it is NOT just hype when people talk about this game.  The first level (which involves fighting Poseidon while climbing a Titan as she scales mount Olympus) is unbelievable. The graphics are on-par with with an animated cartoon-- it barely looks like a video game most of the time.  The integrated cut scenes add to the cinematic illusion.  The level of detail in this game is amazing.In fact, the only complaints I could say about this game are those I find for the entire God of War franchize (and Dante's Inferno as far as that goes).  The timed button presses during boss fights can get a little old, and some of the puzzles are a bit non-sequitur (moving a block from point a to b always feels pretty contrived).Overall, God of War 3 is hours of enjoyment, a great story, and all-around great game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2010"}

Taking a cue from Marvel's smash Civil War mini-series, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 allows you to choose whose side you are on, and just who's on your team. Most notable about the game is the huge roster of Marvel characters at your disposal, from the usuals like Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Wolverine, and Deadpool; to the Green Goblin, Songbird, Venom, Iceman, and more besides. The game looks good, plays great, and there's voice acting that ranges from good to hideously campy, but the biggest drawback remains the fact that not much has changed from the core gameplay of the original. The only real difference is that the RPG elements have been stripped down a bit. Other than that though, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 still delivers the goods, as it warrants replayability with the branching storyline, and there's plenty of unlockables and side missions to keep you busy as well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2009"}
{"product_name":"B003H0CBYS","description":"","reviewerName":"Chance Briggs","summary":"The most fun you can have with an FPS","reviewText":"I believe that Bulletstorm wasn't so much developed as it was raised on human growth hormones and taught the English language by a group of sailors and truck drivers. It was also shown every '80s action and sci-fi movie ever made about a dozen times, given a bottle of whiskey, handed a gun and instructed to shoot anything that moves. Yes, Bulletstorm is ridiculous, but in the way that the very best guilty pleasures are. Like nearly all FPS games, this one has a paper-thin plot and one-dimensional characters, and as such the real crux of the game is the violence. Not the amount, but the inventiveness. This game succeeds in providing a great setting within which you can shoot, kick and energy leash bad guys to death in a huge numbers of ways. From a simple headshot to remotely guiding a (sometimes) human bomb into other enemies and beyond, the possibilities for being sadistic for points are awesome. The world is filled with deadly surprises with which to dispatch foes gruesomely (and stylishly), whether it's giant cacti or blast furnaces.You shouldn't go into Bulletstorm expecting a cover-to-cover affair. Sure, there are points where you have to get out of the line of fire or risk death, but for the most part it's full-bore shooting. In this sense, it's a total throwback ... almost a super-polished arcade game.Overall, this game is big, loud and most importantly fun! It's a vulgar, violent and supremely gung-ho experience obviously created by some slightly mad people who really love the genre.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2013"}

What makes Bulletstorm so fun is not only the gameplay, but the bawdy and rambunctious characters and tone of the story.  If you like games that are dour and realistic, Bulletstorm is not for you.  If you enjoy a bit of witty repartee between eviscerations and bludgeonings, make Bulletstorm you next purchase.The point system that rewards for audacious killing is somewhat similar to the game, Madworld (a terrific game).  There is a lot of fun to be had trying out new and inventive ways to slaughter the villains and mutants who seem to be constantly on the attack.  The LEASH is a fun device for hurling enenies about, and the SLIDE feature is similar to the slide mechanic in VANQUISH (another terrific game).

But not necessarily a fan of RPGs.  The idea of having long conversations with computer characters and having quests, dungeons to explore, loot to carry etc. didn't really excite me.  What I didn't know is that games I liked borrowed heavily from RPGs and had numerous similarities and light-RPG elements included in them.Presentation:Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an RPG open world sandbox game.  It gets you into the world without much in the way of menus.  The in game menu (such as items, skill trees, etc) are well designed and simple and most importantly get the job done.Storyline:Basically, you decide what your character looks like and then as you play the game more and more, you determine where he/she'll go, what they'll do, what sides they'll join, what quests they'll embark on, what jobs they'll have, and so on and so forth.  There's a lot of choice to the game which is amazing.  The only must-follow-story-line aspect is that you discover dragons are coming back to Skyrim, you are Dragonborn (meaning you have the soul of a dragon) and therefore it's your destiny to figure out what evil plot is afoot to cause these Dragons being re-birthed and why and so-on.  The storyline is not as deep and engaging as say Uncharted or Red Dead Redemption but it's not meant to be.Gameplay:This game is an RPG.  It's also one that is an extreme open-world with unending options, places to discover, quests, etc.  There are literally hundreds of side quests.  I'm about 30 hours into the game and I feel I've only scratched the surface.  You can choose as you play whether you want to become a thief/assassin type, a warrior, a wizard type or whatever.  It's really up to you.  I've chosen to be a warrior and a blacksmith.  The great thing is you can spread your investments out a little here and there to help you do other things that are helpful.  Just using a skill helps you increase it.  For instance, if you're hunting a giant and a mammoth, if you crouch and take out your bow and arrow, you'll improve your skills in archery and sneaking.  If you forge a simple dagger, you'll become better in black-smithing.  As you level up you are given the option to improve various skill sets and spend points on skill tree perks allowing you to be better and do more stuff.  It's entirely up to you as to what and who you become.Graphics:This game looks amazing.  For such an enormous, huge, amazing open-worlded game, this game simply looks incredible.  I had my doubts because I didn't want to be disappointed but this game has an incredible level of detail.  It looks gorgeous.  It's not quite as polished as Red Dead Redemption, but I the world of Skyrim is probably larger than RDR.  The characters animate well, the textures are good, and animals behave as expected.  This is one of those extremely immersive experiences.  It's one of those games that looks incredible especially at a distance.  Occasionally you'll find some funny animations with some animals or a blocky shadow or an ugly texture if you get too close.  But on a whole, this game looks good, it's meant to be taken in as a whole and the few nit-picks you can find are present in many games especially of this magnitude.Sound:This game sounds great.  The voice acting is well done.  The nature & animal sounds are appropriate and help to immerse you.  There is the occasional mis-con-strewed sound where your sword hits something and gives off no noise or you swing at a tree and it sounds like metal on on metal.  The computer characters voices are reused extensively, and since many of them have vary specific dialog, it's a wonder they didn't get different actors/actresses for various characters.Conclusion:If you like strategy, making choices, open-world sandbox games.  If you like RPGs, if you're not sure, you should check this game out.  It's an enormous world well worth the hours upon hours you'll spend in Skyrim.  I'm sure there are some action game lovers that will find this game too non-linear and therefore directionless (even though you can use markers on your map to help guide you to the next goal in anyone of the various quests you have uncompleted in your journal).  There will be others who do not want to bother with skill-trees or manage the items in their inventory.  But I enjoy even these aspects to a degree.  It's fun rummaging through your fallen foes and finding some valuable weapon you can you use or a health potent that you'll need the next time you fight a dragon.  Speaking of dragons, that's one of the crowns of this game.  Is the dragons, you'll meet them, fight them and marvel at their beauty, their chaos, their seemingly organic charm.  This game, like Red Dead Redemption really shines in that organic charm department.  It's a great game and you'd do yourself a favor to go pick it up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2011"}

Sonic tries to stop him, but the monster easily knocks him out. After regaining consciousness, Sonic finds himself in a strange dimension known as White Space, a realm where time and space end up after they have been 'erased' by being drained of color and life. Sonic rescues his sidekick, Miles \"Tails\" Prower, and as they search for their friends, they encounter versions of themselves from the past, referred to as \"Classic Sonic\" and \"Classic Tails\", who are depicted with the appearance and proportions used in concept art from the Sega Genesis era of Sonic games. As the two Tails determine that Time Eater's actions are damaging time and space itself, both Classic and \"Modern\" Sonic race through their history, restoring time to normal and rescuing their friends.After restoring the worlds and collecting all the Chaos Emeralds, they discover that the mastermind behind the now perfected Time Eater is none other than Sonic's eternal nemesis, Doctor Eggman, and his own classic self. It is revealed that while drifting through space following the events of Sonic Colors, Eggman discovered the Time Eater and decided to join forces with his past self to harness its power, complete the Time Eater Robot and erase his past defeats from history. Although the Time Eater manages to overwhelm the two Sonics, the support of their friends and the power of the Chaos Emeralds allow them to transform into their Super forms and defeat both versions of Eggman. With the Time Eater destroyed, time and space are restored and the group returns to the present and finally finishes celebrating Sonic's birthday. After the party, Classic Sonic and Classic Tails travel back to their proper time as everyone says their farewells.In a post-credits scene, both versions of Eggman find themselves stuck in White Space after the Time Eater's defeat, with seemingly no way outMusic you get to listen to or play with are from Sonic 1,Cd,2,3,Knuckles, Spinball, R, Adventure 1 & 2, Heros, Shadow the hedgehog, Advance 1,2,& 3 Sonic Rush, Riders, 06, Unleashed, Secret Rings, Black Knight, Colors, and lastly Sonic 4.There are mini games in this game to unlock boss battles.Story 5/5Gameplay 5/5Music 5/5Characters 5/5Mini Games 5/5Overal the game gets an A+ for being Sonics 20th birthday and having good games in the classic years.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2011"}

You can get some background story info from the first game but it's not necessary. Like everyone says, it's a great game so I gave it 5 stars. I can't really find any faults in it based off what the first game was. Instead it improves upon it in every way.Quick Observations:- Menu system is better than in the first game.- All the characters are well balanced and fun to play.- The game is a bit harder than the first game and the enemies a little smarter.- Enemy AI is better but nothing great.- Loot. Tons of loot!- RPG elements will bring in some players who otherwise hate first person games.- The map is OK but the minimap is a bit of a let down.- The save system is adequate... keep in mind you need to complete missions otherwise start all over.If you like a Mad Max type world with an RPG touch.

{"product_name":"B00027CXEM","reviewerName":"Darth Borg","summary":"Better than the original and superb story-telling","reviewText":"KOTOR 2 is a much darker, mature, intense, and well-developed sequel which in my opinion is superior to the original. I will say Kotor 2 is the Empire Strikes Back of the KOTOR franchise. This game at release was rather buggy and unfinished in a sense that many side-quests, character specific content was cut and the game didn't tie to the finale well. However, most of these issues have since been resolved by devoted as well as talented fans in the form of a must have mod called 'The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod'. Just google it, install the latest version and enjoy the game in the manner the developers originally intended but were rushed by Lucas Arts.You play a former jedi known as the Exile. You start with a case of amnesia not knowing what has really happened or who you really are and the whole game is a journey towards finding the truth about you and whether you will redeem yourself by becoming a Jedi or be a Dark Jedi (well there is a subtle difference b/w a Dark Jedi and Sith). You also get to recruit companions who have their own stories and some with ulterior motives that get revealed over-time. The sith have almost obliterated most of the jedi's and to complicate matters further the Sith Lords are after you too. The remaining jedi order is either friend or foe depending on your alignment. Now all of this should already sound better than some of the prequel movies. Inspite of the game age the graphics (turn everything to max), superb dialogue, and the combat system holds well even to this day. The combat is turn-based but it's quite seamless; light-sabres moves, force power, combat animations all capture the star wars feel well enough for a rpg. Also one more salient point to mention are the real star warsy looking jedi costumes ranging from what Obi-wan wore to black robes of the dark jedis and I have rarely seen any other star wars game do justice to the jedi attire like this game does. The strong plot coupled with well-developed interactive cut-scenes really help propel the game which feels like a interactive star wars movie.KOTOR 1 & 2 are prime examples of quality single-player rpg's that should never have been developed into a mmo. You just can't quite capture the epic scale and personal quality of a single player rpg within the mechanics of a mmo. Now with The Old republic mmo out there it's a shame we will never get a KOTOR 3 and will miss out on a superb star wars rpg series. I have actually played The Old Republic mmo (for my free month) and inspite of its mega-budget, interactive voice-overs, the personal story-line of each class etc. pales compared to these games and in my view does nothing more than sully this series. Imagine Kotor series as home-cooked meals and TOR mmo as a value-meal from a mass-consumption restaurant. Sad to see how profit mongering destroyed KOTOR saga and Bioware TOR is neither a hit with the mmo crowd while at the same time has also managed to successfully alienate the original Kotor rpg fan-base too.Anyways I will highly recommend KOTOR 2 to anyone who loves Star Wars and the rpg genre.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000R0PLK2","description":"Electronic Arts Inc. The Orange Box 9849 Xbox 360 Games","reviewerName":"Benjamin S. Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"Most generous amount of good swag ever!","reviewText":"Even if the orange box merely consisted of Half life 2 and its' other two episodes it \"still\" would have been a steal for the price. However on top of that gamers also get Portal and Team Fortress 2.For those unfamiliar with Portal it uses the same engine as half life and pits your mind against a diabolical computer which uses everything from deadly traps to psychological war-fare to slow your progress. Your only gadget is a gun that can make portals through solid walls and your sole goal is to get out of a giant experimental maze alive. While the environments are a bit bland in portal the \"puzzle aspect\" is fun and addictive even for people who would not normally enjoy puzzle games.Team Fortress 2 is a slapstick humorous co-op online fps which seems to burrow a lot of cheese from old spy espionage movies and action flicks. Every character has side splitting outrageous quirks as well as their own unique weapons and skills.Besides for Bio shock and Jedi academy I've never been in love with the fps genre. However valve presents each of their concepts with such flare and originality even jaded critics would be hard pressed not to like at least \"something\" the orange box offers up.Obviously my favorite game is Half Life 2. The only glaring faults with the game are that the controls are not quite so easy to learn as Bio shock's and that if you have not played the first Half Life the story has many plot holes which remain unexplained.Once you get into driving a swamp boat with a mounted gun turret around in a series of canals while blasting away at corrupt law enforcers and military helicopters or find yourself crawling around in tunnels filled with organic alien traps that want to slurp you up with their hanging tongues to devour you it is easy to appreciate the vast realistic yet nightmarish environments Half Life 2 offers up to the player.The story though obscure is also quite good. Apparently as Gordan Friedman you helped develop dimensional travel technology in a place called black mesa. Unfortunately the open doorways you and your cohorts created allowed hostile aliens to spill through. Before you knew it humanity got conquered by a hostile group of crazy tyrannical creeps from a close by neighboring reality. The human resistance which did not succumb to the demands of the enemy despot regime formed lucrative alliances with other aliens who were being enslaved by the same oppressive fraction. They all see you as a type of \"messiah\" who can bring down \"The Man\".The only thing I do not understand is since you are partly responsible for the invasion why does no one see you in a negative light? For a guy that set back human civilization you sure do get a lot of rear-kissing compliments! Besides for that oddity there is also the haughty feeling you get from Friedman. A lot of people talk to him yet Gordon never says anything in turn. You get the subtle feeling he is either mute or a bit conceited. A guy that is supposed to be a sophisticated scientist should have \"something\" to say to someone. The beautiful,brave, and capable Alyx is always at Friedman's side yet I have not seen him flirt with her yet.Now that ranting wiener fest is over there were things I enjoyed immensely about the cast in half life 2. The cast you interact with are believable, flawed, and endearing. They are akin to what your neighbors and friends would be like if they were suddenly faced with losing their families, friends, and basic human rights. The men are rightfully rugged and while the females are cute they are not that plastic unrealistic  false perfection you find in games such as Soul Calibur 4 or Sexy beach. There are no scantily clad big busted model types running around it slinky red dresses or in super short skirts and halter tops. Half life 2 proves you can make women characters \"pretty\" yet still respect them as people at the same time.Honestly I think the gravity gun is one of the best ideas ever but beyond it and your environmental adaptation suit I found the weapons to be lack luster. We've seen the incarnation of the crow bar many times as well as machine guns, assault rifles, pistols, and grenades. While Half life 2 does have a decent Selection Bio Shock had \"plasmids\" which literally gave you cool powers. But yet if you flip over the same argument Half Life 2's environments are much bigger, there are at least 2 fun scenarios where you get to pilot vehicles, and the game is much longer. My final analysis found me loving both games equally for different reasons. However as far as re-playability is concerned even Half Life 2 by itself trumps Bio shock significantly.Because of Half Life 2 and every other game within the orange box I cannot offer much of an objection. It is akin to a genie offering you grand wishes for a nickel apiece. Can any gamer honestly argue with a bargain of that magnitude?Pros+ All the games are high quality.+ Besides for Bio Shock Half Life 2 is arguably the best first person shooter out there.+ Fans of brain teasers will adore portal for its biting humor, wit, charm, and challenge.+ Team Fortress 2 was a nice addition for co-op play over X Box live. Personally it is not for me but for those that prefer co-op and socializing it is a real gem!+ A steal for the price!Cons- All the games still use a basic fps format so the variety is still limited in some aspects.- Unless you have played Half Life 1 Half Life 2 will have you scratching your head on more than one occasion.- Half Life 2's controls are a bit unique from other shooters so mild frustration may occur until you get the hang of things.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00005YTYJ","description":"WithGrand Theft Auto III, Rockstar proves that not all  developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games.  This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular  predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any  criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the  local population for their money (or weapons), make time with  prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking  more structure can embark on dozens of plot-driven missions or steal  cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and go on vigilante  missions. Grab a cab and play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi.  Take a fire truck and earn money putting out fires. The game just never  gets boring.As in real life, there are consequences for your criminality. As your  random acts of mayhem mount up, the police start hounding you,  eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you  continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily  the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are  packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every  category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump  trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically  when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific  detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic,  pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing.  Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine  different radio stations whenever you are in a car.

Perhaps the best console game ever.  Unfortunately, a few flaws here and there take away and just make it above average game at best.The worst flaw, without a doubt, is there is no map and no point of reference.  Instead of exploring a living, breathing city, you&#65533;re forced to rely on turn signals from your car.  This takes away from the fun as it forces you to drive in a linear fashion.  Worst off, you don&#65533;t know if you&#65533;re going north or south, or if you&#65533;re close to your destination or not.  Even though it&#65533;s London, I felt that I never really went to London.  Grand Theft Auto&#65533;s Liberty City, on the other hand, is still fresh in my mind.  All you do is drive through streets with old buildings, hoping to see a landmark like the Tower Bridge or Big Ben.  Unfortunately, all you do is drive down an anonymous street and turn into another anonymous street.  Why did they spend all that time re-creating London if you can&#65533;t even explore it effectively?  Such a waste.I&#65533;ve heard that in Britain, they at least got a map of London.  In the U.S., they didn&#65533;t even bother.  Granted, maybe they think we Americans are so smart that we don&#65533;t a map, or maybe they jealous of our immaculate teeth and superior highway system.  I don&#65533;t know.  Anyway, we need a map.  The turn signal alternative has got to be the worst decision in gaming history, not only is it linear, it forces you into one way streets, and doesn&#65533;t even work half the time.  When you finally do reach a destination, they don&#65533;t tell you where to go, they only give you a general area, and you have to mindlessly walk around until you find the entrance.  Not too fun when you&#65533;re being shot at by cops.Finally, the drives are very long.  They didn&#65533;t make a huge city, they just purposely set destinations from one side of the city to the other, while the turn signals would purposely lead you into wayward directions.  The amount of city space in London is about the equivalent of Liberty City, and a little bigger than Vice City.  Only with the monotony of driving does it seem bigger.There are some other problems.  Out of the 24 missions, mission 12 is ridiculously cheap and forces you to restart over and over, and mission 7 needs a lot further explanation.  For example, you&#65533;re mission is to kill this one cop.  Of course, they really meant was that you lead him into a room so you could kill him in a cut scene.  I tried for a solid hour trying to kill this guy who I later found out was invincible while outside that room.  Thanks Team Soho.There are some great points to this game.  The A.I., despite criticisms, is excellent. Traffic flows smoothly, the pedestrians are smart, and you&#65533;re side characters are somewhat intelligent.  Nothing terrible like Lance from GTA: Vice City. The controls are slightly clunky, but very intuitive.  The cut scenes, even though unskippible (thanks again Team Soho), are marginally entertaining.  The graphics are excellent.  Much better than GTA 3 or Vice City.  The indoor portion (about half the game) is by far better.  The controls are actually decent, and the indoor atmosphere (crack houses, slums, warehouses, manors) are fun and doable (except Missions 7 and 12).Finally, the second half of the game (where you play a cop instead of Mark Hammond) is really fun.  Being a cop, the police don&#65533;t harass you.  You also go to many of the same places as in the first half of the game, so you&#65533;re not a total slave to the turn signals.  Also, the missions are fun, but not annoying or frustrating.  What this means is that driving is actually not tedious, the missions enjoyable, and the cut scenes provide a nice, entertaining break.  All that being said, the second half had a flow that was amazing.  I played the second half of the game in one sitting.I still think this is a good game.  Unfortunately, after countless years of development, the blatantly stupid navigation system forces it from being the &#65533;Titanic&#65533; of video games, to the &#65533;Waterworld&#65533; of video games.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2003"}

The game plays exactly the same as COD4. If they had released this game before COD4.. it would have been GOTY. Now after playing COD4, it is really not that much fun. WWII weapons are not that responsive,  they tried to mask as much as possible. IF you are hardcore world war 2 fan this is probably the one of the best. For normal FPS fans, it doesnt have the same legs as other 08 shooters.Instead of creating a new game all they did is repaint COD4 with WWII paint and released it. Every thing is WWII replacement. Air strikes are replaced with dogs, etc. Zombie survival is not as much as fun as R2 or Gears co-op. Also the game single player mission is really short. If you have played COD games before and can play without dying; it can be finished in one sitting.Wait for it to hit bargain bins or just go back to COD4. I hope they dont ruin the COD franchise with cheap re-spins like this.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2008"}

If it has Nazis in it I want to play it. Also I enjoyed COD 4 so I hoped this would be better considering it's a World War 2 shooter. This game had decent graphics. There are times of brilliance and moments of disappointment. The game is a lot darker than COD 4. I believe this was an attempt to cover some bad textures. The online is in my opinion not as addictive as COD 4. There is though a great game mode Nazi Zombies which added a lot of replay value to this title. There is a better story in this installment, but I still have had no drive to replay the campaign yet.Presentation- The overall feel of this game is dark. The music is good; the lack of cut scenes hurt the campaign just as with COD 4. 4/5Graphics- The graphics are not as well done as COD 4. This game has darker levels to try to hide some texture details. This hurts the overall look of the game. The weapons do have some nice detail though.  4.5/5Story- The story is better done than COD 4, the characters are better developed. The end of the game is really satisfying. Although some cut scenes would have helped. 4/5Game play- It has basically the same controls as COD 4, and it has no major issues. The guns are well reproduced and even the sniper rifle scopes are reminiscent of the scopes of the time. 4.5/5Lasting Appeal- This game has a lot of replay value. The online is similar to COD 4, but in my opinion not as good. The campaign doesn't have a lot of replayability, but Nazi Zombies does. With the map packs that you can purchase zombies adds an additional 200 hours of game play. This mode is very addicting especially with some friends. 5/5Fun Factor- I had a blast with this title, whether it is online, the campaign, or my personal favorite Nazi Zombies. Zombies has added a lot of joy to my life, and my buddies as we try to formulate the best possible strategy. 5/5The Verdict- This game may have been forgotten based on its predecessor, but zombies adds a lot of replay value to this title. The campaign is also worth a play through not much more. The online is average not as good as COD 4. Zombies though will make this game a classic in the future. 4.5/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2009"}

Some parts in the game are quite hard and are very challenging. Especially some of the bosses and also the parts where you have the 'aim' the arrows using the six axis. That was a very cool, unique, and fun element which was added to the game.The reason I gave this game 5 stars is mainly based off the soundtrack and voice acting. Dont get me wrong, the game play was awesome as well, but the soundtrack was VERY nicely executed. The soundtrack is somparable to a major motion picture and the voice acting is bar none the best voice acting I have EVER seen in a video game and possibly even better than most CG movies made to date. It made the storyline very believable which really engulfed you into the game. You dont realize how big of a difference this makes until you play this game. I was kinda hoping this would raise the bar for the gaming creation community as far as really getting a games 3D models to portray accurate facial expressions and lip synching, but am still disappointed to date with even the newer releases of incredibly high budget games such as God of War 3, which is one of my favorite games of all time, but the voice acting is no where in comparison to Heavenly Sword.I borrowed this game from a friend, beat it, and had a hard time handing it back to him.

{"product_name":"B001TD6SN0","reviewerName":"humanbeldot","summary":"The story is easily eclipsed by pure entertainment","reviewText":"Dissidia: Final Fantasy is for the fans. That is obvious from the moment one places the disc in the PSP. From the characters to the worlds, the game was made for fans of the series, whether they be newcomers like me or longtime loyalists. Though RPG or action gamers may be able to pick up the game and learn it, it is easier to digest when one is familiar with the series.The story is pretty awful, there's no doubt about it. There are rumors that there are a number of canceled story arcs that nearly made it into this game, which is unfortunate, as this is really the only drawback. How did these characters all get here, and why do they not ever really question it? Apparently, it all has to do with some god of discord, Chaos, and the goddess of harmony, Cosmos, who have been at war for millennia. All the key villains and heroes of the series are here, from the infamous Cloud and Sephiroth to the not-as-well-known, but just as beloved Firion and the Emperor. Now, there is no doubt the game was crafted as though it were an old friend - pitting various villains and heroes against one another never gets old, and some of the exchanges they have with one another, dialogue-wise, is quite entertaining. The problem is, ninety-five percent of the cutscenes are horrendous to watch for one reason or another.Story aside, however, the entertainment value is high enough to overshadow it. Leveling up characters, especially the villains, becomes addicting fast. Busting up the arenas and unleashing violent combos is quite amusing. Getting backed into corners and then railed on by the sometimes-too-intelligent AI is not so pleasant, though it does not happen too often. Sending an opponent flying into the wall with one well-aimed swing of Masamune is especially satisfying. The story mode is sufficiently challenging even for veteran players; what's better is that characters being used in story mode can be leveled up outside of it using the Quick Battle function. Without a doubt, this game can easily waste your weekends, and there will be little to no guilt involved.It is unfortunate that the idea of Yuna and Seymour being in the game rather than Tidus (tee-dus? I still call him tie-dus) and Jecht. After all, most of these storylines were sufficiently closed in their original games. Cloud still moping and fighting Sephiroth is... anguishing at best, though Sephiroth probably has a better reason for it than Cloud. Tidus and Jecht had zero emotional impact, as their story has already been wrapped up, and neatly so. There was no reason for them to be fighting again: Tidus had forgiven his father and moved on.Still, the game is one of the best for the PSP, hands down, and at least worth borrowing or renting. Though the story drags and has very little impact, the sheer enjoyment one gets from playing this game for hours on end greatly overshadows any unpleasant feelings garnered from this insignificant aspect.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2010"}

Day one with Mirror of Fate was exciting.  The gameplay was a cross between the older 2D Castlevnia games and the other Lords of Shadow game.  The storyline was also interesting.  Not too many days later I stared to realize that this game was terrible.  It completely lacks the exploration/depth of the 2D Castlevania games that I loved and it reduced the things I loved about Lords of Shadow to a smaller scale.  Still desiring to explore the story I continued to play even after I started losing interest in everything else in the game.  Eventually I even lost interest in the story.  It has some cool idea but it got rather boring after awhile.  Sadly I will never complete this game.

With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story.

{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Incomplete experience","reviewText":"I'm going to apologize up front: I can't give you a typically comprehensive review of DJ Hero.  Normally, I wait until I've finished a game until I post a review, in order to give the most unbiased and objective review possible.  You shouldn't expect anything less; would you want a reviewer to post a review of a book when he or she only read the first chapter or a movie based off of a trailer?  I have DJ Hero and the turntable and I received it early as part of the Activision marketing push.  This is all grand and great, except that I find, much to my chagrin, that I'm reviewing a behemoth of a game based on a smattering of songs...three to be precise: \"I Heard it Through the Grapevine\"/\"Feel Good Inc.\" (Marvin Gaye/Gorillaz), \"Hollaback Girl\"/\"Last Night a DJ Saved My Life\" (Gwen Stefani/Indeep) and \"Boom Boom Pow\"/\"Satisfaction\" (Black Eyed Peas/Benny Benassi).  There's one final song that uses both the Guitar Hero guitar as well as the turntable for two player fun.  So I'm left with a quandary...how do I review a game in which I've only seen approximately 4% of the finished product?Very carefully, it would seem...I'm going to focus on the gameplay, since that's the one area I can comment on to some degree.  Now I'm a decent Rock Band/rhythm game player.  I can't make it all the way through expert, but I can usually hold my own for some of the songs.  DJ Hero is more complicated and, in some ways, more difficult.  There's a lot of moving pieces to keep track of.  I started out on medium, thinking that would be easy enough and I struggled.  I didn't fail (and I don't know if you can, at least in this demo version), but I consistently received two stars.  Once or twice I hit three stars...once I hit four.  Never five.The turntable is big and heavier than I was expecting.  It's comprised of two pieces.  On the right hand side, there's the rotatable turntable with the three colored buttons.  To play, much like in any other rhythm game, you hit the corresponding button when it shows up on the screen.  The difference comes in when the notes continue with little up and down arrows.  Much like strumming up and down on the guitar, these indicate flicking the record back and forth like you're scratching it, to make the songs skip, scratch or repeat.  Meanwhile, on the left hand side, there's a crossfader slider, a Euphoria button and an effects dial.  Pressing the button engages \"Euphoria,\" DJ Hero's answer to Star Power.  The dial is basically to change the sounds of the effects and I didn't get to use it that much for reasons which will be clearer later.  The slider is the one you'll use the most, since it determines the crossfading of the songs.As you can see above, each song is actually a mix of two different songs, smashed together by a specific DJ for the game.  At certain points in the songs, you'll have to switch the slider to the right, left or to the center to indicate which song you want to bleed through.  This adds a big layer of complexity to the game because not only do you have to worry about hitting the notes and scratching, but you have to also pay attention to the green and blue lines to switch the crossfader at the right moments.  You can't just watch one, either.  For example, if the green line goes to the left and then goes back to the center, if you're not paying attention to the blue line as well, you might miss the fact that the crossfader should be going all the way to the right.  It continues between the two sometimes.  After playing through the set the first time on medium, I felt flustered because I was slamming the slider constantly, screwing up and getting confused as to what side the slider should have been on.  The step up from easy to medium is more of a jump than in Rock Band/Guitar Hero.  On easy, you don't have to worry about the crossfader and you just hit notes and scratch.  The slider itself is a bit wonky.  You don't have to be perfectly in the center/left/right, but when the songs are constantly switching back and forth, it's easy to screw up.  I'm not completely content with it, but I think after more gaming it will be more natural.Adding another wrinkle to the mix is the rewind function.  You have to build up to the rewind ability and then you can trigger it to apparently rewind the song to fix errors.  Great in concept but it sucks in execution.  Unless I'm doing things incorrectly, you have to spin the record to trigger it...which means you have a spinning record that you have to somehow stop and get your fingers back on the correct keys.  My coordination apparently sucks because I end up screwing up for a few notes while I get back into the groove of things...which pretty much cancels out the use of it for me.That's pretty much all I can say about the game, though.  It's interesting and hectic; it definitely offers a different game experience than Guitar Hero/Rock Band...but I'm not sold on it. That's about all I can tell you.  As for what I can't say, let me list the ways:-can't comment on the wireless turntable; assuming it works as well as the wired-can't comment on how well-integrated the songs are.  When discussing a game that not only has songs but one of the big features is the mash-up of songs, it's virtually impossible to explain how well the songs were integrated.-can't comment on whether the gameplay holds up over the rest of the 90ish songs.-can't comment on the gameplay modes; career mode, jukebox, etc.-can't really comment on the overall fun and longevity of the product.Can't really comment on much.  Four songs aren't much to go on.  Ultimately, I have to give the game an incomplete.  I like what I see but every music game fan knows that the song list is what makes or breaks your product.  And even though the list looks strong, with a game like DJ Hero where it's more about how well smashed together the songs are instead of the individual songs, that's a decision I can't make.  Maybe when the game comes down in price I'll bite.  But in the meantime, you're stuck with a shoddy review from someone who hasn't played the entire game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2009"}

Hayes","summary":"Definitely a Game to Play","reviewText":"(Spoiler-Free)LA Noire involved an just out of the war veteran, Cole Phelps as he is getting the feeling of being in the Police Force. He is assigned numerous cases in the LAPD. The game is split into about four or so separate arcs with cases that flow into each other and take place in different divisions of LAPD, the player goes through them and as they delve deeper overarching themes weave together to form a coherent story for the entire game. There are random newspapers scattered throughout the game to show how the events tie together which is often compelling. Gameplay highlights are investigations and interviews which are fun, if the player has all the clues and can accurately guage the other characters mannerisms. The highlight is the camera effect employed by the developers, which enabled intricate detail to be given to the facial models which makes it easy to find their lying but difficult to tell if they are in doubt or telling the truth. Its pretty provacative and a highlight. Characters conducting the interviews are vivid as well.The game has third person shooter moments for just gunning down victims, in some cases there is a ton of it while in others its all but absent. There is also hand to hand combat moments too but the controls for both feel clunky but once one gets used to them they can work around the intricities of the system. If one does get stuck and fails the combat and such, the game offers them the opportunity to skip it. The highlights were interviews, driving around the city, investigations while the combat and shooting was forgettable. Story was excellent, moving, and only flawed in that some details at end game were not explained well. Music and graphics were fitting for the late 1940's Los Angeles. Just about every line was voiced as well, and many of the characters delivered amazing performances.Definitely a game to play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I098JE","description":"","reviewerName":"The Gifted One","summary":"Call of Duty: Ghosts Proves the Critics Right","reviewText":"It's 2013 and Activision/Infinity Ward has released another installment in the wildly popular Call of Duty franchise.  Now for a little background, my first experience with Call of Duty was like many others in Call of Duty 4.  That was the game that set the bar and created the model for which every Call of Duty title has been based on since 2007.  I fell in love with the multiplayer and spend several hours deeply immersed into it.  I also had a similar experience with the 2009 followup &#34;Modern Warfare 2&#34;.  Enter 2013 and &#34;Call of Duty: Ghosts&#34; and the experienced has changed but not in a good way.I'm only going to comment on the multiplayer since that's the main reason anyone purchases the Call of Duty titles.MAPSMy first day of playing Ghosts I noticed a common theme with the multiplayer.  The severe lack memorable and fun maps.  What you will quickly notice is that most of the maps in Ghosts fall into two categories.  They are either extremely large, making it difficult or time consuming to actually find enemies or the are simply too cluttered in design with tons of windows, pathways, levels, etc.  The problem with so many large maps is that makes the games much slower.  It encourages players to camp in one area and wait for opponents to come to them and discourages many of the close range and fun firefights from the older Modern CoD titles.  The pace is slow and boring.  As such you will find many of your matches ending with the time limit rather than one of the teams reaching the maximum score.  The other issue is the cluttered and confusing maps with tons of pathways and openings.  This gives the impression that the developers were indecisive in how to design some of the maps and they just play like a sloppy mess.  There are a couple of decent maps in the game such as WhiteOut but most of them are highly forgettable and inferior to the older Call of Duty titles.GAME MODESOne of the most shocking things I learned upon playing Ghosts is that Infinity Ward removed Ground War from the PS3/360 versions.  Their excuse was that these systems wouldn't be able to handle it properly (despite the fact that it was in all of their old CoD titles).  Ground War is a mode where you're allowed to play larger 8 VS 8 matches.  In a game with massive maps like Ghosts, Ground War would have gone a long way towards making it somewhat more enjoyable.  So it's a major knock that they left it out.  Another of my favorite modes &#34;Headquarters&#34; is gone.KILLSTREAKSOne of the most exciting things about the Call of Duty games has always been going on consecutive killstreaks and getting powerful rewards such as Helicopters and AC-130's to decimate your enemies.  There was nothing more frightening to the enemy team than hearing their player scream &#34;Enemy AC130 Above!!&#34; and watching everyone run for cover.  Well with Call of Duty Ghosts, Infinity Ward decided to remove all of that jazz.  Killstreaks have been greatly reduced in power, almost to the point where they don't even have a significant effect on the gameplay.  The traditional UAV has been replaced with the useless Satcom radar, the helicopter severely nerfed, and even the higher level killstreaks such as Juggernaut are pretty forgettable in this game.  In past Call of Duty titles it would not be uncommon for players to create a class equipped with Stinger missiles or some other weapon to counter enemy killstreaks. In Ghosts you may as well not even bother, in fact the Stinger missile is not even in this game because it's not needed and most killstreak rewards are non-threatening.PERKS, WEAPONS, AND GENERAL GAMEPLAYAnother thing about the Call of Duty titles that made them fun was always the perk system.  In the past players could choose up to three different perks (or benefits) to customize their players with.  Ghosts has replaced the old 3 perk system with a point system.  Certain perks cost more points than others.  This makes it more complicated than the old simple 3 perk system but that's not totally a bad thing depending on who you ask.  I prefer the simplified 3 perk system but have no major complaints against the new way it's done.Another major issue I do have with the game though is the weapons.  Major staples such as the M16, M4, P90, and RPG rocket are gone.  In this game there is a whole new slew of weapons but the problem is that you'll soon find that there are 2 or 3 Assault Rifles that trump pretty much every other weapon in the game.  This adds to the monotony of this game because you will soon find the majority of your opponents all using the same handful of weapons and you will begin to use the same ones in order to remain competitive.  Another problem is that the Claymore has been replaced with an IED which players can toss and stick on any building in any spot.  So don't be surprised to find yourself regularly killed by these at any given moment as they can literally be anywhere.The last issue I have gameplay-wise is the spawn system.  This one is easily the worst I've ever experienced.  Even worse than Modern Warfare 3.  It's extremely common in this game to get killed by the person you just killed because he respawns right behind you.  You could easily go from being 10-1 to 10-6 because the game respawns you in a terrible position.  This makes killstreaks even more difficult to achieve and just makes an already frustrating multiplayer experience even worse.  I've already sold my copy of this game as of 12/16 so there is a possibility that Infinity Ward may have released a patch to address the spawns since then.REPLAYABILITY AND FINAL THOUGHTSThe ultimate test of value when it comes to an online shooter like Call of Duty: Ghosts is how well of a job it does at getting you to come back for more.  I've sank more hours of addictive gameplay into CoD4 and Modern Warfare 2 than I can remember.  With Ghosts I'm pretty much done already and don't plan on returning.  One of the big problems with Ghosts is that there isn't much incentive for players to come back for more.  When I first played Call of Duty 4 I felt one of the most clever things Infinity Ward did was to create a leveling system that forces players to use certain weapons/perks until reaching a high enough level to unlock new ones.  What this did was make players try out new weapons or perks that they otherwise wouldn't use in order to gain enough experience to unlock other ones.  This provided for an extremely addictive experience and nothing felt better than when you finally reached a high enough level to unlock that P90 (or your favorite weapon) and new it was time to wreak havoc on your enemies.  In Ghosts, the developers have opted for a point system that they call Squad Points.  You get squad points by completing matches or accomplishing certain challenges in the game.  The major flaw in the Squad Point system is that you can go ahead and pick out one of those 2 or 3 dominant weapons, your favorite perks, and attachments right at the beginning and just go ahead and use them for the rest of the time you're playing.  This effectively takes away any incentive of playing the game to reach new levels since you already have everything you want.  Who cares about trying to level anymore when there is nothing of worth to unlock?  Also while the challenges from older Call of Duty titles do return in Ghosts, the problem is that in Ghosts you actually have to &#34;equip&#34; the challenges in order to attempt them.  This means that just because you accomplish something, doesn't mean you're going to get the reward for it unless you went into the challenges section before the match and equipped said challenge.  So for example if you happen to headshot two enemies with one sniper round but didn't have that challenge equipped, then you won't get credit for it.Overall I have to say that Ghosts is the first all around disappointing Call of Duty title I have played.  When Activision reshuffled the team at Infinity Ward following the release of Modern Warfare 2, they brought in a mostly new crew.  It's painfully obvious that this isn't the same group that was behind Call of Duty 4 and Modern Warfare 2.  The combination of the uninspired maps, slow, boring gameplay, and poor unlocking/challenge system has made for a truly hollow experience.  Some might say that the removal high power killstreaks, the old leveling/unlock system, and some smaller maps creates &#34;balance&#34;.  On the contrary, it creates boredom. The fun factor has been removed. Call of Duty: Ghosts is a hollowed out, lifeless experience, and for the first time ever I hate that I have to agree with the growing legion of gamers who criticize the Call of Duty franchise.  I put this one up on eBay and sold it already and don't miss it.  Hopefully this new Infinity Ward can go back to MW, and MW2 and figure out what made those games fun and incorporate it into their next title.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"Robert evans","summary":"Be Prepared..","reviewText":"Cause Resident Evil 4 will be knocking at your door.First Id like to clear things up.

{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

This game offers a good time without the long term commitment.  You will likely love it and spend as much time with it as you can, but in the end you'll find it just lacks substance.Tekken Tag has a very small learning curve and it won't take very long to learn how to wield at least one character well.  That being said, many of the characters are similar, and the techniques you'll use against you're opponents don't vary much between fighters.  This makes it very easy to go in and slug away at opponents regardless of who you're using.  This of course comes at the cost of the likely outcome that you'll get tired of an opponent who falls for the same tactics every time.This game truly shines in PvP however, especially in multi-tap 4 person tag mayhem.  This truly is fun, and ranks this game as my favorite way to waste a night with a handful of friends.  The PvP is better than Namco's more recent Tekken 4.In general, if you're looking for a great, relatively inexpensive game that you can share with your roomates and have a great time with, look no further than the \"Add to Shopping Cart\" button above.  If you're looking for a great single player fighting experience, I'd recommend Tekken 4 or, even better, Virtua Fighter 4 (which is beyond amazing).

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Trevor Cotton","summary":"More classic Square RPG, with Disney?","reviewText":"I know what I thought when Square first announced Kingdom Hearts, why on earth are you colaborating with Disney, it's going to be awful.

You play as Sora, who is taken away from his own world, and joins forces with Donald & Goofy (just bear with it) to defeat the heartless overunning the world.  If you are familiar with any Disney films you will recognise most of the areas and characters instantly.  Personally I dont really care for the Disney aspects, but aside from that the game plays like a dream anyway.  There is plenty to see and do outside of the main plot as well, a favourite being the colosseum, where amongst other secret bosses, Sephiroth makes an apperance.  I won't spoil plot details, but trust me this game is great, another Square classic, and I am still awaitng the sequel which is long overdue.Ignore any ideas you may have about the Disney license, if your into good RPG's just buy it, and see for yourself how great this is, classic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2005"}

Repeatedly starting a round over in the same map can get tiresome, but for the most part the gameplay is enough to keep you going.  IN my rating, the game itself deserves at least a 4 star rating.  Because you have to have the steam client to run it, however the game is, for me, dragged down to a 2.In my experience, you'll only be able to click on the counter-strike icon, get it to load, get it connected to a server and play, about 45% of the time.  The other 65% of the time, well, there are a variety of steam related problems. Steam updates are the most frequent, i think, though they don't last too long it is annoying to be told when you can or cannot play a game that you bought fair and square. Being disallowed from setting up your own server with bots because \"Steam is not connected to the internet\".  Steam's tendency to remove the game from your \"My Games\" list, deny that you own it and have installed it, then ASK YOU TO BUY IT AGAIN, is more troubling.  The fact that this has happened 4 times in the 6 months that I have owned the game is perhaps criminal. The customer support is useless, waiting 2 weeks to respond to queries because there is nothing useful in the forums.The kicker is that people who have stolen illegal copies of the game, cracked not to need steam, will be able to click the icon and play the game while you're looking for your installation disc.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2007"}

Well, regardless of where it comes oout too, the one game franchise that really stands out is Madden by Elevtronic Arts. Since its debut back in the 1980's the football franchise has been the most definitive era of sports video games to date. As for Microsoft, they put that definitive success before the their Xbox video game system, and now with their new system, could the feeling be as good for Madden there?Madden '06 for the Microsoft Xbox 360, is a wild and well-received video game that really feels like you're watch the essence and excitement of the game on television. The graphics and gameplay is very strong and bold, with each gameplay that is detail to the bone. The sound also has a definitive realistic showcase that does stand out from each of the players and the cheering from the audience. The control is very simplisic and does continue to hold off with each gameplay that is there from a blitz play to a da bomb pass. The only problem with the game is that the  controls once in a while sticks and you can miss your play when you over use it.All in all, Madden '06 is a great sports game that does live up for the Xbox 360. I just it is extremely sad that the NFL will not allow anymore traditional football games to come out that delivers the success Madden had. With that lackluster feeling, many might feel dissapointed.

I also have to say that it was kinda challenging too.  Some bosses were pretty hard.  The only thing was the last boss pulled a Mother Brain rip off if you know what mean.

The campaign goes from boring to incredibly frustrating. There is no gradual tutorial-esque feel to the beginning of the game. So you end up switching from sneaking around and hacking to running from 10 cops with no confidence or ability to get away. Also, glitch riddled and poor controls makes sneaking your way through environments with lots of enemies almost impossible. Every occasion where I tried to sneak ended with a glitch where I wouldn't go into cover or stood up for no reason alerting the enemies of my location.Too many games have enormous vision and no ability to deliver. The scope and aim of this game was noble, but it simply fails to deliver. Why? It doesn't equip you as a gamer to do all the cool things it put before you and it has control and glitch problems that make good interaction and sneaking a rarity.In addition to the game itself failing to deliver, it also has amateurish problems...1. No ability to party up when attempting to play online encryption2. Once you actually get in the game with your friends it will never, and I mean never, put you all on the same team.

Also nice is the online gameplay which for either yourself or one other with you can join online races either regionally or globally depending on which you prefer.  I had no trouble playing online with the game and saw no lagging or glitches throughout my ten races so far. If you want to see you past race triumphs and tragedies you can view them on Mario Kart t.v. which replays the highlights of your races and who you were racing against online or not.The controls are very easy to use and the little surprise you get along the track are also entertaining from blue shells to invulnerable star.  Unlike some of the racing/driving games like Forza and the like you don't feel annoyance or frustration at coming in 7th place though you do feel better when you're one of the top four.  The graphics are amazing showing the power the WiiU is capable of so for any doubters all I can is in your face!  The vehicles each character gets are unique to them as well though some do have obvious similarities.  It's great fun being able to play against those either here or somewhere around the world as you can see how you do.So for people who just got the WiiU or those who already have one and are just deciding on which game to add then look no further as this is one of the top five that is a must for any WiiU owner to have in their game collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2014"}

The beginning of SH3 isn't Silent Hill according to the director. It's a completely different town at first. But they said 'Since its Silent Hill, I guess its safe to say there will be a connection to the town.\".Now my speculation on it? The town you start out in is actually Silent Hill. The difference is that its not actually 'formed' yet. If you remember back to SH1, Silent Hill really got created when Allesa wouldn't agree to the demands of Dahlia and the member of her cult to do the ritual that rises Samael. So to get back at her they locked her in a room and set in on fire. The result was that half the town burned down, and that created Silent Hill. So what I think is that Heather is Allesas mum. You start playing as her and the game goes on a longer time period than the previous SH games till the point that Allesa is born. So we basically get to see what started SH from the beginning. The woman we've seen in the trailers, Claudia (she's the real white woman), is a younger version of Dahlia.SH3 seems like it's really going to start showing some answers to the series, and the entire plot should be very interesting.The visulas have also been vastly improved from SH2, and the monster design is extremely wicked.

{"product_name":"B004EVWYYG","description":"","reviewerName":"Tommy Sixx Morais","summary":"Either version it's a great game","reviewText":"Pokemon Black & White is essentially the same great game Pokemon has been since Red & Blue. You're still a young trainer, male or female who is just about to go on his or her very first Pokemon journey. You have to pick a Pokemon between Fire, Water and Grass elements and are given Pokeballs and a Pokedex and off you go to conquer the Unova region! Try to collect the 8 gym badges as is usual and your enemies this time are Team Plasma who wants to separate Pokemon from their trainers. The game basics have not changed much. Even the controls are the same (there is not much stylus use to be made unfortunately). Usually Pokemon versions of a game don't difference themselves much from another (like Red & Blue, Gold & Silver), there are some exclusive Pokemons in each version but they're basically the same. However, the Black & White editions changes that. Pokemon Black is focused on cities with experienced trainers while White has more of an emphasis on nature and open fields. It's really up to what YOU prefer: city or nature. Ultimately whatever version the player picks this is a great addition to the Pokemon video game franchise.The Black & White generation of Pokemon games introduces seasons, a cool new addition. Some Pokemons even change appearance according to seasons! There are some slight 3D graphics that enhance the visuals this time around although it's far from anything major. The 3D perspective for bridges and buildings looks great. There are even animations during battles, Pokemons move and look better. There are also new battle modes, the triple and rotational battles (my favorite) which are cool additions but unfortunately there are not enough of them! The Pokemon in this version are not the best I have to say. I grew up with the original generation when there was only 150 \"pocket monsters\" and was big into Pokemon up until the Gold and Silver games which were also excellent. I had the cards, books, watched the show, and even had a poster on my wall. I can safely say that some of the Pokemons in Black & White are great but there are plenty that look awful and just don't work. It looks like they lacked great ideas (I mean a candle, seriously? That's just one example) at this point but the game remains excellent.The difficulty seems to be easier for Black & White for some reason as other reviewers have noticed. I've played previous titles and looking back they all seem harder. That's not to say that Black & White don't have their challenges, each Pokemon game does but I played through this one a little quicker and I found the level of difficulty to be less harsh this time around. On the other hand this is a very fun and entertaining entry into the Pokemon gaming world and I could hardly stop myself from playing. It may not be the best Pokemon video game but it's a satisfying entry that should satisfy the old school fans and newcomers as well.The game is not as revolutionary as Nintendo would have you believe. If you're unsure, read other reviews and watch videos and then decide. I know I don't regret my purchase. I really like Pokemon White and what it offers even if it's not the perfect Pokemon title, it's a great game. Without a doubt it beats the Pearl edition that I also have. I think there is something for every Pokefans out there and I would recommend it. To me this is a 4/5.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000CQIDTC","reviewerName":"Joseph","summary":"Outstanding game","reviewText":"This is the first (hence, episode one) game in a half-life 2 (HL2) sequel serial.  The game environment is essential HL2 with sharper graphics - which was actually a great improvement.  The game play is different as the puzzles are more challenging and less \"cookie-cutter\" than HL2.  Also, the game is played in tandem.  You, of course, play as Gordon Freedman, scientist turned gun-weilding devastator (aren't they all like that though?), and the other main character is the beautifully rendered Alex.  Alex's AI is pretty decent and, when I played through the game, she didn't do anything unexpected. I really have to hand it to the guys at Valve they really know how to cater to video game nerds: attractive, AI, female companion that flirts with you in one scene and is blasting zombies in the next.  Overall the voice acting was stellar.What makes the game great, however, is it's rich storyline and immersive enviroment.  The best way to describe this game is to compare it to a violent, well-written comic book that you just do not want to end.  I really liked the game and I think that Valve implemented the new serial model extremely well.  Hopefully, one day they will be able to offer subscriptions and put out small episodes like this every few months.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2006"}

{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"ahw","summary":"Great!  But not Perfect","reviewText":"Let me be clear and start of by saying GTA is a really good game.  BUT I do think it is overrated.  It's not perfect.  A lot of game sites gave it a 10/10.  I would give it somewhere around an 8.5.  I'm just going to point out some of the flaws in this review because I think you can find GTA4's strengths in any other review, so this review will necessarily sound negative/ranting, but I did like the game.I really don't like Niko.  I think Rockstar did a horrible job of developing his character.  The most immediate pet peeve is his accent - the voice acting was terrible.  It sounds like someone mocking an eastern European accent.  But more fundamentally, the character is ultimately unconvincing because throughout the game he teeters back and forth between angst-driven man with a mission to nice, polite gentleman.  It's painful to watch conversations with other characters in the game where Niko dishes out relationship advice like one of those Dear Abby columnists.Which brings me to a related peeve: the dialogue.  It's pretty bad.  Interactions between characters feel very unnatural.  It's pretty solid at first (I'm not an expert on Jamaican dialect, but Little Jacob sounded convincing to me), but the second half of the game feels very rushed - particularly the dialogue between Niko and his primary female friend toward the end of the game.Of course poor characters + poor dialogue will almost inevitably lead to poor plot.  I guess storyline isn't the main draw for the GTA series, but I wish Rockstar put more effort into it, since it's otherwise a solid game.  I don't want to give away any spoilers, but you find out what Niko's primary motivation is a few missions into the game.  Other than a few minor hiccups here and there, there aren't any real surprises as the game more or less makes a predictable, straight bee-line toward resolution.  Most disappointing is that the game fails to really flesh out Niko's past, and subsequently the villain characters in the game are under-developed - the game never satisfyingly explains their motivations.Another issue with the plot is the ending, which I can only very vaguely describe for the sake of keeping this review spoiler-free.  It felt like Rockstar was trying to execute a sort of moral denouement in the final scenes of the game, exposing Niko's hamartia (flaw).  Unfortunately, the ending was poorly executed because the game has a hard time deciding whether it wants to moralize, or just kill people.  Ultimately, the ending simultaneously involves killing people, as well as a sort of \"winners don't do drugs!\" type message, which of course feels rather out of place for a GTA game.  Perhaps the devs wanted something to fend off Jack Thompson with.Finally, some issues with the gameplay.  The world does indeed feel much more immersive than prior iterations of the series, yet it still gets painstakingly repetitive in the second half of the game.  I really found doing the same hunt-and-kill missions over and over again to get tiresome.  Again, it feels like the devs got lazy as the first half had some innovative missions, while the second half devolves into repetitive drive to location, win gunfight against two dozen men, shake cops structure.  The second half missions absolutely fail to satisfactorily integrate the new elements of the game - for example, I had totally abandoned the \"friendship\" system as it became more of a nuisance to maintain high friendship levels, with little reward.In conclusion, I'd like to again stress that GTA4 is a really good game, and I just thought I'd point out the flaws because I think I expected a really spectacular game given the unprecedented positive reception it was given by most critics.  I think we're going to see GTA4 go the same route as GTA3 - where the first game sets up sandbox, so to speak, laying out the core game engine, with subsequent games building on top of that solid foundation and introduce some really nice gameplay elements.  It feels like the devs didn't have quite enough time to polish GTA4 in terms of plot and gameplay, but that shouldn't be a problem for the sequels that are sure to be coming out in the next few years as there is a really excellent foundation to work with.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"D. K. Malone","summary":"\"You KNOW you want a hot dog.\"","reviewText":"After all these years of ignoring GTA (thanks to being completely turned off by GTA3 a decade ago) I'm just recently finally playing the series. I started about two months ago and I've been powering through the games in order since then. I'm not finished with GTA4 yet, I'm probably at around 80% of the mandatory missions. Barring any sudden bizarre shifts in the fundamentals of the game, I think it's safe to say my current opinion will stand: GTA4 rules.(EDIT Aug 1, 2011: I completed GTA4 last night, and my opinion does indeed stand, in fact it's stronger now.)Even though I was never interested in GTA before, I was acutely aware that when GTA4 was released three years ago, a very large chunk of the fan base (or maybe they were a small but very vocal chunk) was extremely disappointed and there was a major backlash. In fact I was actually considering stopping after San Andreas and not even bothering with GTA4 due to all of the nay-saying I'd heard. After discussing it with a co-worker/friend who is a long time fan, apparently the consensus was that the series had steadily ramped its way up to the high water mark that was 2004's San Andreas, and that GTA4 was a big step backward. Granted- there is literally a lot less ground to cover in GTA4 than there was in San Andreas. There are no extended rural highway treks through forests or deserts. Like GTA3, everything takes place within Liberty City. That said, I'm pretty sure this version of the city is much larger than the GTA3 version from 10 years ago. And I've gotta say, as someone who has spent some time in NYC: they really freaking nailed it. It's a spot-on simulation of being there. The architecture, the ambient life, the weather system, everything is far beyond what was in the previous entries. This makes the PS2 GTAs seem like \"LEGO Grand Theft Auto\". At first I was taken aback by the new car physics; they seemed too realistic for their own good, getting in the way of the fun. But after a few hours of practice, I got the hang of it. I think the real issue is that they went out of their way to give some cars poor handling simply for the sake of game play variety. One thing that bothered me when I started playing was the lead character. You play as Niko Bellic, an immigrant from Serbia. At first, I seriously wondered what the hell they were thinking. His accent and nasal voice seemed over the top, so it was hard to take him seriously. Eventually, he grew on me and I've really come to like him... and his cousin Roman, their rasta friend Little Jacob, and several other characters along the way. There is actually some excellent character development in this one. Some of the best stuff comes out after going on drinking dates. In vino bonus.Which leads me to one thing I can agree with the fans is a genuine flaw: the GTA4 Social Network.Several of the NPCs in the game will become Niko's friends or love interests. In order to maintain these relationships, you need to take time out from the missions and jobs to instead do stuff with them. Go out to eat, get drunk, go bowling, play darts, etc. After you build up a strong enough relationship, you will get a \"benefit\" out the friendship. They will send you a car whenever you need one, sell you weapons at a discount, take you to any location via helicopter, remove your wanted level, etc. If you don't maintain the friendship, you lose the benefits. You build up quite a stable of friends early on, so if you want to maintain the benefits you will be juggling a lot of dates, to the point where it feels like that aspect takes up the majority of your time. You have to make time for missions in between keeping your friends happy. Thankfully none of the friendship benefits are all that crucial, and some of them are downright useless. So you won't be losing much if you let friends slide. Rockstar went out of their way to make most of these NPCs obnoxious in one way or another, as if to ask the player \"How badly do you want this idiot's friendship benefit?\" I think this aspect is a cool idea for a game that strives to be a \"life simulation\", but it probably should have been dialed back a bit. It's not a huge problem for me, but then again I'm the sort of person who never skipped traveling in Red Dead Redemption (i.e. \"Press A to skip to destination\") because that would pull me out of the game. No matter how long the journey was, I would ride my horse the whole way there. That's just how I roll.EDIT: Since writing this review, I learned that there's a way to maintain friendship benefits once they've been acquired without having to actually continue socializing with the friend. Nice.Speaking of Red Dead Redemption, that game was one of the main reasons I finally decided to try GTA after avoiding it for so many years. I loved RDR, and heard it said many times that \"it's just GTA set in the Old West\". I saw a lot of general similarities between RDR and the PS2 era GTAs, but with GTA4, it's an almost literal 1 to 1 comparison. Nearly every aspect of GTA4 was used in RDR. The only exception that comes to mind is the social network. So from my point of view, considering the order I played them in, it's almost as if GTA4 is a futuristic version of RDR.In the end all I really want to say is, don't believe the anti-hype. Backlashes are inevitable when you're dealing with huge groups of fanboys with overly emotional attachments to previous entries in a franchise. I have the benefit of a fresh perspective with no baggage or expectations. And it is with this unclouded view that I say GTA4 is a more than worthy entry in the franchise. It's a bit darker and grittier than the previous games, and definitely more down to earth and straight forward than the wild and crazy PS2 era GTAs. But it's still as AAA a game as there can be, far more refined and richer than any previous game in the series. The cynical view is that Rockstar shrunk the sandbox and took away some of the toys. My view is that Rockstar did away with some useless cruft... stripped GTA down to its bare essence. The decrease in scope is well worth the trade in increased focus and overall intensity of the experience. I recently heard an analogy that sounds pretty elitist but I more or less agree with: San Andreas was like a Michael Bay movie; GTA4 is more like a Scorsese film.EDIT: Another flaw I will acknowledge is that this game does lack mission variety compared to previous GTAs. The vast majority of the missions boil down to \"Go to this location, acquire the target, and escape.\" Usually this means literally killing one or more people. Occasionally it involves merely threatening them or destroying their property. This goes for most of the story missions, and all of the police computer missions. Then there are Brucie's and Stevie's \"steal this car for me\" missions... which obviously don't stray far from standard \"Grand Theft Auto\" game play. I can't say I really noticed this as I played the game. It was only afterward when I noticed other players complaining about it... and I can't say they're wrong. Personally, I think that GTA4's overall game play design is so polished and strong that the lack of variety in the missions isn't much of a problem. They're still fun, because the pillars supporting the entire game are fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2011"}

The day I get to hold Grand Theft Auto 4 in my hands.  It is a day that I have waited for.  I pre ordered last year and was told it was pushed back.  I didn't care really.  I have other games to play.  But today, none of those games matter.  For today I shall review \"the\" game.The gameFirst let me tell you some cool things in the game.When you are given a  mission, a yellow marker will show up on your map.  There will also be a yellow line, going from you to the mission point.  Let it be said that you do not have to flower the way of the marker.  But if you chose to, it makes getting to your next goal fast and easy.As your driving, at times 2 characters will talk.  You can see them moving to the talking.  This is just a little thing I noticed that made me feel that the designers didn't scimp out on anything.There is steam coming out the the vents on the street.  Again another little detail that makes you really want to thank the guys who made this game.In one of the first missions you have to pick up two ladies.  The voice acting is really bad for these girls.  Well, I don't know if it is bad voice acting, or the way the girls are supposed to act.  If it is not supposed to sound like that, then the voice acting for them is bad.When you are driving around the city, you get a feeling of aww.  It is so amazing to look at everything around you.  Every little detail seems to have been taken care of.  It is amazingThe controls... all I can say is WOW!  At first I was driving a car and the controls were really good.  Then I jumped out and stole an s.u.v.  This was nothing at first.  But after driving for a minute or so I realized just how awesome the car mechanics were.  You could see the car bouncing up and down from the shocks.  I just watched the car move along for a few seconds in a[...]  This will add an entire new part to the game.  Getting different cars and seeing how they react to your driving.  They drive as if you were playing a very well controlled racing game.  I give the control a 5 out of 5.You can skip through most of the cut scenes.  The ones you can not, shouldn't bother you.  It's really cool watching the story play out.  A lot of the stuff is pretty funny if you really think about what they are saying.The music seems pretty cool. This is one of the only things I thought they missed.  It would have been great if you could add custom soundtracks.  How cool would it be to fly down the highway while listening to a Willie Nelson tune?The GameThis game gets old fast.  I mean the city is HUGE.  However, its not like you can go in all the buildings.  Also, you can stand there and see the same cars pass over and over.  Kind of like Truman on the Truman show.  I mean this is just a game.  I and we have seen it before.  I would almost have given this a 3 out of 5 but it does have a lot of fun things and the graphics in the game are pretty good.  So if you think you may want this game I say go rent it.  Then if you like it buy it used and new off amazon.  You can get it for a better price there.Here is something to think about.  This is also the reason I gave this game a 4 out of 5.  If the graphics and controls in this game were not as good as they are, would this game be more than just average.  I know that  those two things add a lot to the game, but what I'm saying is, this is just like the other GTA games.  Yes you can play online now, but the online part has it's flaws.  This is a great game don't get me wrong.  But when the time comes for the next GTA to come out, what will the team do to make it stand out from this on.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2008"}

The developers know that a very high bar would be set for this one, and you can see the time and effort they poured into every last detail from the very first moment of the opening credits. It is more like a movie than a game. This \"immersive movie\" quality stays with you through every moment of gameplay.You walk down the street and the shadows dapple through the overhead bridge grid. Dusk begins to fall and the sky gets that orange golden glow, the shadows lessen.Voices show the same attention to detail. You've got a variety of languages thrown in, plus accents galore. There's the Long Island drawl, the Rastafarian's lilt, and of course the hard edge of eastern Europe.Your main character is Nico, fresh off the boat and coming in to Liberty City (i.e. New York City) to see his cousin Roman. They are eastern European and rather poor. This of course is going to change soon, as Nico moves his way up in the world.My boyfriend's from New York City so we were amused at how they kept the landscapes identical but renamed Brooklyn to Broker, Manhattan to Algonquin and so on. There was one time we were walking down the streets and had lost track of where we were. \"Looks like the Bronx\" he commented off-handedly. We zoomed out. Sure enough!I do have to say that the people on the streets of this game swear far more than the average people we pass in the real NYC though!Which brings up an important point. GTA IV went straight for the \"Mature\" rating with this one. This is clearly meant for mature gamers ages 17 and over. There are strip clubs. There are violent battles. There is more swearing than pretty much any other game out there.  Adults love this as they love the Sopranos and Scarface - but any parent getting this for a minor should know what they're getting into.But that being said, as a game for adults, this is *awesome*. There are just so many little touches that shine. You can play bowling games with your date. You can make choices between alternate choices which affect how people feel about you. When you get near a railing, you can side jump over it, smoothly. You carry a cell phone and gather contacts for use. You can visit internet cafes. You have a variety of radio stations to listen to, plus TV stations to watch.This is easily a game you can play for hundreds of hours - then go back and start over again and get another new experience by making different choices.I can't get over how gorgeous the game is, and how smoothly it plays. You grab a knife from an enemy and use it to take him down. You drive along the Hudson and watch the lights of the carnival shine. You listen to your favorite songs on the radio while the neon lights of the city drift by. You really begin to relate to the characters, to understand their personalities, to connect with them. It makes the choices you make have meaning and emotion.As much as I adore many other games - Halo, Mass Effect, etc. - I really think this is the first game that makes you feel that you are in a movie. The graphics draw you in. The voices are amazingly well done and varied. The plot draws you in, having you wonder who to trust, having you wonder what is going on with the characters.Highly recommended. I'm doing a full walkthrough for the game so feel free to ask any questions you wish!I want to add a note - some players are having trouble with understanding the dialogue. I watch a ton of international films so I didn't have any issues. However, if some of the language is too accented for you, there is a subtitles option. Just turn that on and you'll always know what they are saying.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2008"}

Armed with your headsets and controllers, it's very fun working together and the teamwork aspect gives a great sense of accomplishment and adrenaline - exactly what this game promises.The groundbreaking 'aggro' concept is a wonderful idea and I can't believe no one really thought of this before.  There are some nice player interactions as well, whether it be the 'back-to-back' maneuver, or the 'riot-shield' crawl.  Hopefully, if there is a sequel these co-op maneuvers can be expanded upon.The customization of weapons is really fun, and there is a great variety of weapons and choices to make.  However, it may take time to achieve stronger variations of weapons as upgrades are only unlocked if you have the cash, and some items in game are expensive and may take multiple run-throughs on missions to acquire enough dough.Graphics are very nice, but objects can be repetitive at times.  It's a little strange to see the same turret or bunker design over and over throughout the various levels and regions, as if all the bad guys bought from the same arms dealer.Speaking of graphics, one set back for me is the overall environment...that is it's pretty linear and some object physics don't make sense.  For example some propane tanks can explode when shot at, while others can't...not sure why.  Some large concrete buildings take damage, yet flimsy wood shacks don't.  Some cars can catch fire and blow up, others can't...you get the point.  Similarly, I am a bit disappointed that you can't jump over objects that are barely waist high.  Sure, you can duck behind them and use them for cover, but you can't jump or climb certain objects that just seem natural, and therefore limits creative strategy and game play.  CoD4 is a good example on what one can do in a game that makes sense (although that's not perfect either).In the single player campaign mode, this is where I find some faults.  First, save points and mission starts need to be overhauled.  AoT uses the very common checkpoint system, yet somehow still seems flawed if you need to leave the game.  Missions just tend blend into each other despite cut scenes, and weapon upgrade points (shopping opportunities) just seem out of place with no explanation.  Also, why are hockey masks $10,000 each?  These masks that serve no real purpose in game cost more than some weapons do....that makes no sense to me at all.  In the Xbox 260 version, you can get an achievement if you purchase all 25+ masks.  At $10k each, that's a lot of cash to unlock on achievement that has no game impact.Enemy AI isn't too bad, but in all honesty I find the enemy AI better than your CPU controlled partner.  Sometimes when you issue commands, it's as if he doesn't understand or makes foolish decisions and leaves himself open to take hits.  When in a holding pattern or up against a 'boss', your partner will tend to repeat annoying quotes over and over like \"We need to flank him.\" Yeah, I understand...I don't need to be told every 10 seconds.Overall, while the missions are intriguing and a nice modern/contemporary storyline, the game seems a little short.  There are basically 6 missions in the campaign mode and I found that only after a few hours I was already 1/2 way done.  Good thing you can replay missions and maybe try new tactics, but there isn't enough variety to keep you too interested for too long.  Solo replay ability is only needed to earn money to unlock new weapons.The missions are also very linear, meaning there is limited exploration of your surroundings which can be frustrating at times.  Why does a chair or desk impede my path here?  Why can't I open that door?  Why can't I crawl under that truck for cover?  It seems many objects in game are for dress setting only and not usable otherwise....very odd.Parents beware, while this is a 'M' rated game, there is a lot of swearing.  So much so in fact, I wonder why there isn't an option at the start of the game to turn swearing off.  This is an option in many games, and parents will be surprised on how many times the f-bomb and s-word are dropped.  The violence isn't to over the top...typical blood spattering when shot, but not uber gross.One last gripe I have is that shortly after the game was released, EA has already provided DLC content for purchase.  These co-op maps and training courses were originally intended to be included in the initial release, but I suspect wasn't completed by ship date (thus maybe why the game seems a bit short), and then EA turns around and charges for it.  IMHO, this should have been included or be downloaded for free.In finality, the game shines in co-op mode and is good for casual gamers.  Very innovative and can only get better in the sequel.  In solo mode there seem some limitations and odd AI reactions at times, but still fun.  I would have given it 4 stars if the destructible environments were more consistent, a bit longer in length, and a few tweaks to weapons upgrade/game save options throughout campaign.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2008"}

The graphics look like a game that just came out. the sound is fantastic. The tracks are loaded with shortcuts and little details (from wife fences to smash through to persistent changes to the courses like debris that gets left over and permanent route changes). The theme of the game is great and adds a lot of flavor. There's tons of car types to choose from (though you'll likely lean heavily to one type), the courses are all unique and imaginative, and there's both online and split-screen (with multiple screen split options) for multi-player.One for the agesI played this game to death and got bored. Put it on the shelf. And now a year later I pulled it out and played it again and it feels fresh all over again (I get the same feeling from GRID). Just when you think you've mastered everything and gotten bored, you can come back to this game later with a new perspective and enjoy it all over again. Granted, there are too many cars (if it had a quarter as many and just let you upgrade them it would have been better), the A.I. yo-yos and can be annoying when cars suddenly pass you at the finish line, but the power-up dynamic (drift to get power, then use it to wreck and alter the track) never gets old. You get used to the yo-yo A.I. and learn to exploit it (same your power for a RED and then use it to take out multiple cars at once; push hard on the final part of the final lap). The multi-player is fantastic locally and unbelievably fun online. And no matter how much times passes, the game is still fun to pull out and play a few events.The only real downside to this game is that the studio that made it was dissolved by Disney. So if you want more, you'll have to do what I did and buy all the excellent DLC. Because a sequel is never going to happen (oh, what might have been!).

So if you liked the first game you will probably like this one. Its kinda like the god of war games where you start off with all the powers you had in the first game.. then by some kind of thing happening you lose them all and have to start over type of deal but with new types of powers. Depending on which way you go (or if you played both of them) you can either end up with ice type powers (which seem cool) or this flammable oil type of power (maybe not as cool). After beating the game the good way I wanted to try my hand at the evil play through. If you played the first game its pretty much the same. You have even more enemies, its more difficult, and its pretty much the same story just with a few small changes cause your evil.This was pretty much the same game from the first just with a new location (similar to the last game) and a story that was interesting but not something to write home about. This is similar to the last game where you might end up forgetting about it after a you finished playing it a few months ago. I got the game for about 20 dollars or so and it was worth that. I don't think I would have paid full price. But considering this is probably going to be the last game where they show the main character its worth a pick up if you want to finish the story.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2012"}

Sue me!Anyway, on to Dark Souls, a game I hesitated to play due to its relations to Demons Souls, one of the most unforgiving of this generation. But it came down in price and received glowing reviews, so I figured I'd give it a shot. It was just as good, it not better, than its predecessor (and slightly easier).Overall:Like Demons Souls, it's a tough, intellectual RPG that requires third-party info (from any of several wiki sites); but despite occasionally frightening and frustrating difficulty, it rewards those that think and take their time. Killing those bosses feels incredibly gratifying.Loved:- Intricate and deep combat- Exploring a vast, mysterious world- Interconnectivity (outside of Anor Londo, one could travel from one corner of the map to the other without a loading screen)- Varied enemies- Complex and intelligent (sure, you can wear that super protective armor or swing that huge, destructive weapon, but is it worth the hit to stamina and agility?)- Finding new weapons/armor/items, with incredible variation among them- Thinking about it even when not playing (could be a \"con\" for some though)- So many ways to build a character and play the game (depending on the area or enemies, I modified my armor, weapons, rings, spells and strategy). And the developers put in enough to satisfy every style of play.- Incredible level design; more three-dimensional than most every other game out there- Atmosphere and look that's both creepy and beautifulHated:- Frustratingly hard at points (especially the first time facing Smough and Ornstein)- No pause button- Hardly any story to speak of- Farming souls (in order to level up or buy items)- A lot left unexplained (e.g., what is the difference between human and hollow form?, how much is each soul worth?, what is an occult/divine/chaos/enchanted weapon?), hence heavy use of its wiki sites- Death occasionally felt cheap- No forgiveness (e.g., if you remove a certain ring accidentally, it breaks, making it unusable)Recommendations for Dark Souls 2:- A story! Make us care about the world and the characters- A pause button- Two autosaves that leap-frog (in case you make a mistake, like the aforementioned ring problem)- Bleeding/poison meters for enemies- Soul weapons that are actually useful (I used two weapons for 90% of my 140 hours, and I found one within the first few hours). Shouldn't the final boss soul produce an awesome weapon in NG+?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000G7PMX2","reviewerName":"Carlos A. Ramos \"Voltaire Tempentry\"","summary":"Great concepts, not-so-great execution","reviewText":"When Red Steel was originally released as a Wii launch title back in 2006, it was second only to The Legend of Zelda in terms of hype. The game has since seen more than its fair share of critics, as only a game of such hype can. Most, such as myself, can definitely see potential in the game/series, but lack of polish and complete ideas throughout the experience brings Red Steel to only an average game.One of the most prominent features of Red Steel prior to its release was the use of the Unreal Engine \"2.5\", in which Ubisoft claimed a bridge in graphical fertility somewhere between the last and current generation of hardware. And such origins are somewhat obvious in the final (but unfinished) product. The game was, and still is, one of Wii's greatest looking games, but at the same time one of its worst. Certain areas such as some textures, effects, and gloss make the game stand out in the Wii library. Other things, such as poor character animation, models, art work (used in static cut-scenes), and textures look very poor indeed. Speaking of art work, the load screens and cut scenes look atrocious in 480p resolution (the Wii equivalent of HD). The image appears stretched and grainy. While the art images look better in low resolution, the game itself benefits from 480p greatly. Textures and detail (in both models and effects, such as explosions) look great.In November of 2006, Red Steel had wonky and poor controls. In 2010, in the light of very smooth and responsive game like the Metroid Prime 3/Trilogy and The Conduit, the controls are downright awful. The reticule itself is jumpy and a good ways away from what feels natural (by pressing the \"Home\" menu at any time, one can see just how off the Red Steel cursor is by comparing it to the Wii Menu cursor). The bounding box (an invisible area that, once passed by the cursor, moves the screen) is very wide and makes turning difficult and subtle movement impossible. The gestures fair a bit better, but there are still occasions where the game may fail to read Nunchuk swipes. Despite having technical issues, the controls are imaginatively designed, and with a few more months of polish, they could have been great.\"Boy falls for girl. Boy meets girl's father, who ends up being a part of \"X\" mafia, whose rival gang kidnaps girl. Boy must save girl.\" As hard as i tried to dislike the clich&eacute;d and predictable story, i found myself eagerly awaiting the next plot twist. The game accomplishes this level of emersion with mostly solid voice work and small twists and variations of the old clich&eacute;d story line. Yet despite my better judgment, the ending makes me want more Red Steel.Red Steel also has a multiplayer mode. This extra feels just as rushed as the rest of the game, providing few customization options, levels, or strategies. There are no bots or online play, making its unplayable for the single player.The game is one of non-stop action, its a fun ride IF, and i stress IF, you can deal with its glaring problems. Painful controls, spotty graphics, and a lack of polish prevents this game from reaching true greatness. Red Steel provides an enjoyable, dumb action thriller that will be satisfying the same way the stupid summer blockbusters are. In the end, its a solid game, with moments of greatness and moments of frustration.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2010"}

{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Gordon \"PS3/PC Gamer!\"","summary":"Mediocre sendoff with great character interaction as usual (Extended Cut Update)","reviewText":"How bad does an ending have to be in order to ruin an entire series? Yeah, its that bad. Let me clarify a few things free of spoilers. First, I'll actually review the game rather than tell you ho bad the ending is and leave. Don't worry, I have more to say than, \"it was good up until...\"*****PROS*****There is still plenty of dialogue and character development. All the characters are interesting and usually say things you'll want to listen to. While ME3 tries to appeal to a mainstream audience with MP and the combat, this remains one of those games that you shut the door and pay attention to the deep story and characters. The characters can be found all over the ship for dialogue choices. You don't have to always go to their specific location in order to speak with them. They can also be found on the Citadel whenever you dock so sometimes you'll be caught in situations rather than dialog sequences. Some characters will make you think more to yourself than the series ever has before. This really is some of the best writing to date, no matter how heart-breakingly awful the series ended.Deaths/outcomes are generally done very well. Depending on your choices and/or renegade/paragon score, some past characters can live or die. Most of mine died, but they were all masterfully killed off and one even brought me to tears. THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING.The DLC character is a wonderful addition to the series. I can't complain about having to buy him because he came with my collector's edition, but I cannot imagine not having him in the game. He's no Mordin or Thane, but he reveals the truth about the revered Protheans as well as some VERY surprising things about the council races that I'm sure you would not have otherwise known without the DLC. In other words the DLC is ESSENTIAL. As much as I like Zaeed and Kasumi, this DLC trumps them both.*****CONS*****The combat/cover system doesn't come close to the likes of Uncharted. The cover system will drive you crazy and you'll definitely roll when you wanted to snap to cover. A play through of this on insanity is going to result in a broken controller for sure. Shooting gets quite repetitive (I like shooters), and it make you wish some real space age blasters, beams, or lasers would be part of your arsenal rather than normal guns in futuristic clothing.There is only ONE HUB WORLD. ME2 had Illium, the Citadel, Tuchanka, and Omega. You even had the Shadow Broker ship. Besides the Normandy, you are limited to only the Citadel to visit. THAT SUCKS.You must procure heavy weapons on site. Gone are the days where you can simply equip the Cain, Arc Projector, Flamehrower, etc. You have to find them on the ground within a level in order to use them.In Mass Effect 3 everyone eagerly anticipated how Earth would be. It was hyped up in the trailers and I even remember interviews saying you could go to Japan, somewhere in the US, and Vancouver. FORGET ALL THAT. You only go to London. A war-torn destroyed London that is only recognizable as a human settlement because there are actual streets with road paint rather than futuristic platforms or dirt. To say that Earth was underwhelming is an understatement. It downright sucked. The fights, the location, the atmosphere; everything about it was poorly executed and made for a terrible \"final showdown.\"*****THE AWFUL (spoiler-free)*****As mentioned the ending completely ruined the entire series for me. I literally just switched my desktop background from Commander Shepard back to Big Boss (Kojima can get an ending right). Not only is it bad because it failed to satisfy me and bring closure to any of the characters we all know and love, but it rendered anything I did in the past games worthless. Had a romance with someone not on the ship? Who cares. Stopped Garrus from killing Sidonis? Who cares. Sidonis is not even in the game. Saved the Rachni queen? It was just a number on your galactic readiness.I was looking forward to closing the book on my favorite franchise in gaming history....just like you were. To find out that my choices meant nothing in a series that boasts its element of choice above anything else is heartbreaking. Half a decade of the best game I've ever played ruined by the last 15 mins? They had to stumble from perfection somewhere, but they fumbled at the one yard line in the Super Bowl.Metal Gear Solid takes back its title as the best story driven franchise. Bioware, you failed BIG TIME.*****UPDATE*****Two words: INDOCTRINATION THEORYCasey Hudson was quoted as saying he wanted and ending that we all would talk about. I am still conflicted whether the ending was lazy and a massive disappointment, or if the entire final game in the trilogy was riddled with subtleties missed by all of us who hated HATED HATED the ending. Do yourself a favor and watch the indoctrination video. It contains truly COMPELLING evidence that this is not the end......I have changed my score for the time being because of the extremely convincing arguments throughout the vid.*****UPDATE*****After playing through again on insanity, this game is MUCH MUCH easier than Mass Effect 2's insanity. It has also been announced a few weeks ago that we'll be getting a \"true\" ending this summer as DLC. I'm hoping its worthwhile but I'm not holding my breath. I have a few other complaints after the game after being somewhat of an expert on it now (I got my galactic readiness to 100% and my assets to over 7000).It seems like Bioware refused to think outside of the box. Before infiltrating the geth ship you are walking on a blown up ship with magnetic shoes. You are basically out in open space and its AWESOME. These types of moments are what I was hoping for throughout the game. I wanted Bioware to take advantage of the fact that we're in space. Throw in some zero gravity sections, or maybe even be joker for a mission piloting the Normandy. The possibilities are endless and while I still love the game, I would have like to do more than shooting.And speaking of the shooting, there is too much of an emphasis on it. I know people who get through the whole game without using their powers. In ME2, it wasn't quite a full out shooter and choosing the right squadmates made a huge difference in your play style (at least on the harder difficulties). This time, it reallydoesn't matter who you choose (except for Tali with the geth missions; it matters then). You can usually just mow everyone down with bullets ignoring powers.With everything said, I don't think its as good as ME2. The dialogue and characterization are excellent as always, but it ends on a VERY low note.***Extended Cut Update***Prior to downloading the extended cut I tried my best to beat the game and load the ending in time for Tuesday the 26th and noticed something. The shooting is extremely dull and repetitive. ME3 is a mediocre shooter plain and simple. Ending aside, I must say that the new gameplay mechanics and the extreme emphasis on shooting bores me. This resulted in me looking up the extended cut on youtube rather than shoot my way through ME3. Maybe I should change classes or something. Anyways, let's get this over with.The indoctrination theory was a clever attempt at rationalizing the ending and is now proved invalid. The endings are not changed or expanded on as much as they are EXPLAINED. We now have more closure and can see what Bioware was trying to get across. Across the internet you may find articles saying that the ending should not be tampered with as it goes against the studio's artisic vision, blah, blah, blah. Well, IT WASN'T. IT'S WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE FIRST PLACE. The ending is now complete rather than extended.Do I think the indoctrination theory is better that what Bioware tacked on to the end of the trilogy? Yes, far better in fact. Is Mass Effect 3 the stinker of the trilogy that could have used a couple more years in development? Definitely. The story, character interactions and everything were excellent, but the past crew were tacked on in missions (Jacob, Jack, Samara) and I still don't feel like my war assets affect anything at all. As for the Rachni, they may as well have never been in the series. Their buildup resulted in absolutely nothing. As you are reading this you probably can see that I think the series deserved a better sendoff. Where were the space battles, QTE's, interactions/conversations with the Reapers, Sidonis (Garrus' foe), and choices from the past (such as if I sided with the Illusive Man)? I can't think of a single way that ME3 built upon or improved on ME2.Regarding the extended cut Bioware did a wonderful job patching up the misunderstood, vague ending. They listened to the fans and did something about it for free. I will always appreciate that and feel comfort in the fact that this is not the end for Mass Effect.If Bioware decided to build on ME3's indoctrination theory I could see another game with Shepard fighting the Reapers under impossible odds and finding a way to win with EVERYONE he had in his crew. Except Thane and Legion of course. Abandoned worlds devoid of life and Shepard and crew must fight their way through guerilla style as to avoid being caught. All characters evolve further and are pushed to their mental limits because they are the last in the universe. Then the might and wisdom of the Rachni come to the rescue because of my choice back in 2008 woo-hoo! 100% wishful thinking at this point but whatever, ME3 was OK.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2012"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission. Train and equip your team to survive insurmountable odds.Explore the Galaxy- Scan planets to uncover unique secret missions in theMass Effectuniverse.Integration with OriginalMass Effect- Players of the firstMass Effectcan import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

As you progress, so do Shepard&rsquo;s abilities.Improved Dialogue Mechanic- Improved NPC conversation system where Commander Shepard can take matters into your own hands &ndash; interrupting or using force to get the answer required.","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"Again with the insanity...","reviewText":"This game extends the first entry in the Mass Effect franchise in almost every way, both the pros and the cons. It's not a startlingly attractive game, but the voice acting is just as good with all the roles being reprised, the story is still great, the combat system has been tweaked a little bit but has remained overall just as effective, and the difficulty settings are only slightly less jacked.This game, quite fortunately, doesn't require you to play through multiple times to get all the acievements. The first game nearly killed itself for me by requiring not just two but three playthroughs. Unfortunately, to get all the achievements in one shot you have to start off playing through on the idiotic Insanity setting. This can be controller-flinging-level frustrating at times, especially at low levels and during all major encounters. I'm gonna rant for a moment...The enemies on Insanity are just stupid, but it works for them. They know they have whatever ridiculous multiplier on their health and shields over your crew and so they don't take cover nearly as often. You'll spend most of the game retreating to previous fortified positions until you run into an arbitrary wall the game has erected behind you. This is because enemies will just walk straight at you, pummeling you despite the fact that you have 3 squad members returning fire on the same enemy at the same time. If the enemy stands up and starts walking at you, you might as well skip the long drawn out shove-it-your-face game over sequence (God I hate those) and just go ahead and reload because it means you're about to die. I hate games that do this crap. Difficulty settings should make enemies smarter, not stronger.A headshot is a headshot is a headshot: the hardest difficulty should make it hard to land one, but if you do it should still frickin' kill the enemy. Think of it like taking on Delta Force: they may be the most elite soldiers on the planet, but if you're drawing down on one of them and manage to pop him in the head, he's still gonna drop just as fast as the next guy. But what are the chances you'll do that? Probably not high, because they know what they're doing and will likely have you in their crosshairs before you know they're there. Delta Force won't charge you straight up because they know they're going to win. It's the other way around: they know they're going to win because they know you haven't seen them yet. The enemies should be taking cover MORE on harder difficulties, not less because they know they're practically invincible. I can't stress this point enough, because for me it murders the fun in games like this. I know the developers can code the AI to do these things because the enemies do take cover from time to time, especially when you do maanage to lay the smack down on them. So instead of making a difficulty setting that provides CHALLENGE they make difficulty settings that provide TEDIUM. You have to shoot the enemy two or three times more, even though you're aiming right at their beady little eyeballs, which you can plainly see because they're coming straight at you.Why can't they make the difficulty settings more realistic? WHY?Ugh. OK... aside from that small rant, the combat system has been improved a little. The AI is still smart, and they will use cover at the beginning of a battle to draw you into an impossible situation which is pretty cool if frustrating on higher difficulties. Rather than trading out your weapons for better equipment like in the first game, you get a handful of good weapons throughout this one that you can upgrade. Each type of weapon is good against different things, with a handful of particular weapons that have extra qualities for specific types of missions. Upgrades cost money and resources. You can get resources by scanning planets, which cost both fuel (to get there) and probes (to scan), which also cost money. Getting money in the game isn't nearly as easy as in the first one: you can find credits during missions, and you get paid at the end of each mission with an amount that seems to pretty much match what you can find, but it's never really that much and it can take two or three missions to save up for a single upgrade. You have to either buy the upgrade techs, or find them on missions and then research them which just costs resources. It's a bit tedius, but the power you get from upgrades is a really good reason to go exploring all the little systems and planets, which is neat.You squad members are only slightly less useless than in the first game. The system for issuing commands is still just as slick, but they're still just as unlikely to respond in a timely fashion if they do what you want at all. Powers recharge much faster, and are much... MUCH more useful than in the first game. You can combine powers from different squad members to make things go BOOM, which is really useful for pulling enemies out of cover, taking down their shields or health, and then killing them quickly. However, even if you have your Power Usage set to \"Always\", your supposedly elite team members rarely do the smartest thing by usefully combining their powers on their own. It's best to leave that setting on \"Manual\" so that you know that the combos will always be out of cooldown and ready for when you could use them most.This game also introduces the concept of ammo clips, but it seems only to apply to the main character. That is, you squad members appear to still have unlimited ammo, but will still need to go through the motions of changing out clips after X many shots. However, despite their unlimited ammo they won't actually unload a clip on an enemy even if it's out of cover. Just like in the first game, your so-called elite squad member will pop out of cover even when their health or shields are dangerously low, take forever to squeeze off one or two rounds even from a fully automatic weapon, and then take forever to go back into cover. Sometimes, if you tell them to take cover at specific points, they'll just stay there, and this can be frustrating if you are one or two pixels off when telling them to hide from an oncoming enemy surge that you actually need them to shoot at. So you still have to babysit your squad members and repeatedly tell them to get down and stay down while their shields and health recover or get up and frellin' shoot already.Overall, the game is a lot of fun because it switches things up a good bit from the first one while retaining a lot of the same stuff. It's got a good length that keeps you engaged. The combat is a lot of fun on easier difficulties, much more tedious on harder levels, but that's to be expected in this genre. It's a great game, with a great cast and a great story.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2012"}

Burns \"Slackjaw\"","summary":"Skyrim, A masterpiece of RPG perfection","reviewText":"There is a point at which we find ourselves experiencing something that we realize is special. An experience where you step back from a movie or a game and just wrap your head around what it took to create such an experience.  For me,  I experienced this as I was moving into my 3rd bandit encampment..I was searching around for loot and decided to shoot my fireball magic at a spider web in a corner that looked a bit concealed.  Sure enough the webs burned back and in their place was a chest, carefully hidden within a pile of various junk..  In it I found a strage sword I had not previously seen with powers that I don't understand just yet.  This is what gaming to me represents on the most basic of levels.  That sense of discovery and wonder that comes with a really good book you can't put down or simply don't want to.  Skyrim is that game for me. I played Oblivion for long hours, died a million times in Demon/Dark Souls,  cut my teeth on pretty much every final fantasy game that was released (ok not so much the latest offering) and also love to shoot some people up in matchmaking FPS type games.  My tastes go all over the board and as we own pretty much all of the systems including handhelds.. that's alot.  But this game is by far the most engrossing and complete game I have ever played.There is something to be said for games that make you prepare just to play them.  Each time I set out with the limited time I usually have to play (a father of 3 kids)  I usually start out by going into a town and buying anything I might need on my next exploration.  I carefully check my potions and equipment..  Talk to every single NPC to get any and all missions possible and then.... I set out.This is what makes this game so much fun for me.  It is truly infinite in it's ability to allow me, the gamer, to do pretty much anything I want to.  I can go and tackle a particular side quest and find that individual experience as epic as most games make you feel after completion because you can do so many things and do them in so many different ways.  The enemies are diverse, the loot is vast, the landscapes are varied and breathtaking.  The NPCs are lifelike in their daily activities.  You have to study the habits of some people to know when to interact.  It is truly the most immersive fantasy experience I have enjoyed since I rolled a 12 sided dice WAY back in the day. The sense of wonder this game creates is simply incredible.I have seen the few poor reviews and most of them were because the person buying the game was expecting something else or because they champion another game (like dark souls - people you can rate BOTH games high! You don't need to knock one down to make the other better!) If you know what Bethesda is good at and are buying that level of polish then you know what you are getting but I'm here to tell you that this game surpasses my very high hopes for it.  The graphics are simply gorgeous.  The quests are interesting and varied though there is alot of fetch quests they are interesting because of the locals and enemies that make the experiences varied.  The mythos is compelling and detailed.  Reading books are not simply time wasting but fill in lore or even better... actually help you level up.  Every action that you take (sneaking or shooting an arrow) improve your stealth numbers and your archery skills and do it with a satisfying chorus of voices celebrating your minor accomplishment. This also directly impacts your overall level and skills in that area.  What you do is reflected on every level- morality based or visually and that is simply EPIC.  The sound is emmersive and constant, the music is classical but sets the tone very nicely.There are some bugs that bother you a little but taken as a body of work Bethesda will eventually fix those and provide new reasons to continue exploring this detailed world.  It is a masterpiece pure and simple and should not be passed over. If you don't like RPGs..  Pass on it. That's pretty obvious (1 star reviews)- but if you like to build a character and love exploring a vast and beautiful land this game will likely eat up 300+ hours (from early reports).Buy it and prepare to be floored with the detail and interface. The only drag to me as has been mentioned many times is the magic/ combat interface which is a bit cumbersome but you do have time to switch as combat will pause as you do. But I do find that to be a design flaw not present in Obivion.  Not a big deal within the bigger picture and this game is easily worth every penny you put into it because of it's size and replay value.  Good or bad?  Play it again and choose the other side.  What a time to be a gamer this holiday!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2011"}

The game is actually a perfectly set difficulty that will challenge you, but won't make you tear your hair out. You play as Ryu Hayabusa who has to stop the Fiends from taking over the world with the Dark Dragon Stones. You are the last member of the Dark Dragon Clan and you must protect your lineage. While the story isn't anything special the game does sport beautiful cut scenes that were tailored for the dual screens. The graphics are also the best on the DS with beautiful pre-rendered backgrounds, high res textures and character models.You basically execute all attacks through the touch screen by slashing enemies. You can use your projectile weapons by tapping enemies. I have to report this works superbly and the controls are actually more responsive than the console games. You can use your mana power for devastating attacks but you can only use these once until you get too another save point. The save points are generously scattered throughout the short levels so things won't get too hard for you. You can do other moves such as slashing up to jump and then slashing down to do a slam attack. You get all the moves in Ninja Gaiden (Xbox) but there aren't any news ones. While all of this sounds excellent it does get old by the end of the game. However, the game has some fun boss fights to keep things interesting.You can solve puzzles by blowing out flames, lighting torches, hitting orbs etc. but nothing that will strain your brain. The is very short and you can beat it in about 6 hours. There are 13 chapters but the levels are really really short (you can beat most of them in 20 mins or so). Overall the game is really well done and any action fan needs to own this especially if you're getting ready for Ninja Gaiden II (X360).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

I am am avid RPG player (being brought up during the early Final fantasy and D&D; days) I enjoy a game that has a good story and is enjoyable to play, plus the fact you start out dead was just an enjoyable twist to the beginning.As the only successful subject brought back from the dead by the gnomes Well of Souls you are soon drawn into the conflict between the immortal Tuatha Dhahn and the mortal races (humans, elves, and gnomes).  And being dead you are not subject the Fate as other beings are so you can choose your destiny, but be aware that your choices will have consiquences for good or ill as you prepare to defeat the evil Fae and their leader Garrow.The enviroment is vibrant and alive (some would say a little cartoony, compared to Skyrim and Final Fantasy but I feel it works for this new world we are embarking on), the character creation is enjoyable (i spent my first 30 minutes of the demo just playing with the characters before making my choices) and while there are not as many races, the face development is as broad as Skyrim's.  The combat system takes one part Fable, one part Dragon Age, add a twist of Elder Scrolls and mix it well to bring a balanced fighter who can switch between melee, ranged and magic at a touch of the button.  The story shows great depth and promise, which you should expect from R.A. Salvatore and crew.  The only thing I gripe about is the conversations, where they should have used DA:2's use of actually talking with your character.Overall an enjoyable game and will really plow into it with gusto, at least until Mass Effect 3 (and i get back to Skyrim, 50 hours and still not have not choosen between Imperial or Stormcloak)  .","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00CMQTVUA","description":"","reviewerName":"Geoff Ables","summary":"Not Worth Upgrading Your Xbox 360 (Yet): Buggy, Not Many Games Yet, Virtually No Kinect/Family Games","reviewText":"We pre-ordered the Day One Xbox One from Microsoft.  I'm glad to say that we have not experienced the disk loading/playing issues that so many others are reporting.  As a frame of reference: I'm a regular user of Microsoft devices (Windows Phone, Surface tablet, Xbox 360 and now Xbox One) - so in general I like what Microsoft has to offer.  I'm also a reasonably technical guy and don't generally have much problem figuring out technology.With all of that said, I can only recommend the Xbox One for a small group of individuals at this time.One other item to note: This is not intended to compare the Xbox One to the PS4.  My guess is that the Xbox One would have roughly the same pros/cons as the PS4.  This is mostly written for those who already have a game console (particularly an Xbox 360 - but really any other console that they're happy with) and are wondering if the time is right to purchase an Xbox One.BOTTOM LINE:* If you are an avid gamer, and one or more of the very small collection of games available on the Xbox One today is something that you enjoy - then I'd recommend going ahead and purchasing this.  My understanding is that this may be particularly true for individuals who enjoy online multiplayer games.* For anyone else, you'll probably be happier sticking with your existing game console for another 6-12 months before making the leap.* If you're not a gamer, and you already have Apple products (PC, iPhone, iPad) then I think you would be far happier with an AppleTV than an Xbox One at this time.WHY DO I SAY THAT?  Glad you asked...GAMES IN GENERAL: For me, the console is still mostly about the games.  And the Xbox One  has very few of them available.  Your old Xbox 360 games won't upgrade (I'm not complaining that the old games won't upgrade, and understand why) and with only 6-12 games of any quality out there for Xbox One, the selection is frustratingly limited right now.  In my opinion there are about a half-dozen really good games that take advantage of what the Xbox One offers.  But these only cover a few very specific categories.  If you're not into shooters, race car or sports games, or if you want more than 1 or 2 options in each of these categories - then you're going to be frustrated.FAMILY/KINECT GAMES: Me?  I like strategic games (i.e. Civilization), open world games (i.e. Skyrim), block games (i.e. Minecraft), platformers (i.e. Crash Bandicoot was one that I'd liked) and, yes, the occasional shooter (i.e. Call of Duty, Halo).  As a family, we really like some of the family-oriented Kinect games (i.e. the Kinect-based sports titles).  Of all of the aforementioned categories, there is really only one game (in my opinion) of any quality on the Xbox One that fits one of those descriptions (Call of Duty: Ghosts).  And there is not a single Kinect game available yet that approaches the quality of the Kinect games available for the Xbox 360.OTHER APPS: Aside from the games, the Xbox One does offer some other compelling features - one of which is the ability to add apps to it (much as you can to a phone, iPad or Windows 8 PC).* We've actually found the Skype app to be a really nice app to have on our Xbox.  On Christmas day, we all sat in front of the TV and Skyped the rest of our family in India, California, DC and Tulsa.  If you Skype a lot and you'd like to do it with a large group sitting in front of your TV, then you may find this a compelling reason to buy.* There are a variety of other video playing apps for the device.  As an Amazon Prime member, I really like the fact that I can get to my Amazon Prime videos (no more hooking my Kindle up to my TV to watch these shows).  We're also Netflix members and can get to the Netflix videos as well.  Microsoft has their own video store that has a pretty good selection too.  We're not members of others, but there are options for Hulu, Verizon Fios and maybe some other video apps.* Snapping the NFL app up next to a football game was cool for about 15 minutes.  But it doesn't really provide any good info and was too complex for anyone in the family except for me.* None of these other apps, however, would be reason enough for me to recommend an Xbox One (assuming you have another device that already gives you access to these items - as we do).  It's convenient to have them all in one place, but not a compelling enough reason to buy this unit yet.BUGS / PERFOMANCE: There are still a lot of things about my Xbox that don't seem quite ready for prime time...* Other than games, one of the main reasons I was excited to get our Xbox One was the promise of all of our Microsoft devices working together to easily share music, video and photos.  While there has been an improvement, it is still not nearly where our AppleTV was about 5 years ago.  You can't (from what I can tell), select music, pictures or videos on your other device and &#34;send them&#34; to the Xbox One.* Sharing your collection across devices is possible, but it is &#34;hobbled&#34;.  For example, I have an Xbox music account.  When I'm logged into the Xbox using my Microsoft account, I can select all of the music that I want.  It's very nice because I can even hand-pick music that I want to play from Microsoft's library - and I don't have to pay for it (other than the monthly fee for my Xbox Music account).  However, if anyone else in my family is logged into the Xbox One as themselves, they don't have access to my music library.  They can manually login as me - but then, if I'm listening to my music on another device, it will only allow it to stream to one of the two devices at a time.  Because we could all easily just stream music, pics and video straight from our other Apple devices to our AppleTV (without having to go through a sync process and/or have a paid monthly account), we never experienced this problem with the AppleTV.- Existing music playlists don't sync quickly across devices as one would expect.  When I first create a playlist, it seems to propagate across all my devices fairly quickly.  But when I make a change to a list on one device (i.e. my Surface tablet), I waited days for it to show up on my Xbox One before finally giving up and just creating a new playlist that then synced right away.  I didn't see options for manually telling the Xbox One to sync an existing playlist.- Voice recognition leaves a LOT to be desired.  Maybe that's because I need to give it more time to &#34;train&#34; to recognize my voice.  Or maybe it requires our house to be quiet (our house is rarely quiet, with dishwashers, washing/drying machines and plenty of conversation all within earshot of the Xbox).  Many times I have to repeat the same command 2 or 3 times.  I've pretty much given up on bothering to use the voice recognition.- The same seems to largely be the same for hand gestures.  This is improved over the Xbox 360 but, in most cases, I find it easier to just use the control.- The TV app promises to eliminate the need for other remote controls.  You can plug your TV receiver (i.e. Cable TV, Satellite, etc) directly into the Xbox and train it to know what is plugged in.  There is a very cool &#34;One Guide&#34; that shows you available programming and let's you find what you want to watch - and it remembers favorites for you.  On the other hand, the OneGuide doesn't seems any easier to navigate than our regular SatTV guide, and you cannot yet give it voice commands like &#34;Show Me What Football Games are Playing&#34; or &#34;Watch Carolina Panthers&#34; - instead, it has to be something specific like &#34;Watch ESPN 2&#34; (so I am stuck navigating through all the channels to find the programming I want still).  The biggest problem, however, is that the TV app is buggy.  More than once I've tried to start it, and it has failed. Since our SatTV is now routed through our Xbox, we can't watch TV at all in these situations!  I've finally thrown up my hands and disconnected the SatTV from the Xbox and plugged it directly into our TV.  So the TV app is now useless.- The Xbox allows you to program it to power on/off all your related devices when the Xbox.  I did this when I first set it up.  It worked fairly well, but sometimes it would not work with one or more of the devices (a relatively small annoyance).  I moved the Kinect to the top of the TV and now it doesn't work on any of the other devices at all.  The best I can tell, it issues remote control orders from the Kinect and, with that device now on top of the TV, it may not have line of sight ability to access those other devices.  When we initially relocated the Kinect, we went to the Xbox settings menu and re-synced the Kinect to the room - but that had no impact on the remote controls.  So we're back to using all of our remote controls as we normally did.- Other apps seem to occasionally time out. For example, I was in the Xbox Store app and tried to open one of the games to see the description, and it locked up - I tried again and it did the same thing (but when attempting to open other game descriptions it worked fine).  As another example, I played a DVD one night; the next night we powered the Xbox on, took the first DVD out and inserted another - and it continued showing us a still shot of the first DVD until we completely powered down and restarted the device.- Microsoft has an app called Xbox One Smart Glass that enriches the Xbox experience on your Windows 8 PC/tablet or on  your Windows Phone.  This sometimes works, but I've experienced a number of &#34;can't access our Xbox right now&#34; messages on it.SUMMING IT ALL UP:The Xbox One is much too buggy (and/or difficult to use) right now to make some of the exciting new features worthwhile, and the lack of games also makes it a less compelling option as an entertainment device.  The good news is that Microsoft will (hopefully) send out software patches that address most of the worst bugs and new games will be released.  Based on the game release schedule, it looks to me like it will be at least 6 months - and perhaps 12 months - before there is a diverse range of quality games available for this device.  If Microsoft chooses to &#34;port&#34; about 12 of the better Xbox 360 games over quickly, then it would make this device much more compelling sooner.I'll plan to update this review and my rating in the coming months.  Feel free to leave a comment here if you're thinking of purchasing and want an updated perspective from me.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2013"}

Raise your children like responsible and intelligent adults and your children will grow into responsible intelligent adults themselves.  If your child can be so easily provoked to destructive or harmful behavior with a violent video game as the catalyst, I think you've got some other very big issues that need immediate attention.  Namely, your parenting, or should I say, lack thereof.  How's about you stop relying on video games and other forms of media to teach your kids the difference between right and wrong, and you get off your @$$es and do it yourself.  Stay out of America's living rooms.  If people want to buy gory games loaded with sex, drugs, violence, and profanity, that's their business. -Just like it should be your business to keep that game out of your kid's hands.  Stop policing the world and try policing your own home.  Here's a little smiley to end on:  Americans love everything about games like, oh let's say, Grand Theft Auto.  : )  We love Sex, we love violence, we love blood, we love gun fights, we love explosions, and we absolutely ADORE raw acts of senseless debauchery. Oh yeah, and Rock and Roll. - NEVER forget the Rock and Roll.  Today's games provide us with all of these things on a very entertaining vicarious level. - Your b*tching and whining is going to do a short toss from NOTHING to stop the video game industry from releasing the glorious blood-drenched games that its software teams develop each year. - You will stop nothing.  Everyone is making way too much money off of vids.  Retailers, middle men, white collar corporations, and even our dear Uncle Sammy. - All rolling in cash each year from phenomenal video game sales.  Oh yeah, did I mention that? - Americans absolutely LOVE $$$$$$ as well.  The video game industry is a multi-billion dollar a year media market cornerstone.  And guess which games sell the most?  That's right, stupid! - You guessed it! - The violent ones!  Nothing is going to stop the vid train.  Not you, not anybody.  So go hug a tree and then talk to your b@stard kids about drugs and violence.  Hey! There's an idea! -Maybe you can take all that time and energy that you put into MAVV and reinvest it into something useful and new.

Iam one of those who watch TV shows just because it is in High Def or they are showing demolitions of buildings. This is the perfect blend of the two I like, you can blow up ever thing and explosions look fantastic. Huge open world, not very strict mission sequences.Sure they have never cared about character animations, dialog or AI. Some how people totally mistook Mercenaries for a FPS. This is not a FPS game, this is a Sand box blow up everything Action game. There may not be a pre-defined class where this game fits it in. The closest is GTA with Air Strike.  You are never supposed to walk in to a compound and kill one at a time, you are supposed to bomb the whole camp to dust. Sure you can sneak  behind blah blah.. dont waste your time. If you are looking for a methodical slow duck and shoot game get some thing else.The main mission is to do any thing to make money, with the money buy bigger weapons to make your next mission easy. Make money to make more money. There are lot of waring factions who are willing to hire to do what you like most, set every thing on fire. There is some level of favor management that you have to do. It is not a good idea to job for every one; in the latter part it will be hard for to find lucrative jobs.There are few places where I read, this game is politically biased against south America. It is not !!!! a simple Hollywood B level comical story where every one is fighting for oil. They even pirates :). It is nice to have light hearted story in games. Every thing in the game is meant as pure fun, just do any thing you wish to have a good time. That is all the theme of the game.One thing I hate in the new Merc is vehicle hijacking.

I got this brand new for 45$ 15$ cheaper!Onto the review..So I have played and beat EVERY single mario game released from the NES forward, and this is by far the best side scroller out there. It's graphics are top notch and the gameplay is super fun when your alone or with your friends.A lot of people complain that the graphics could have been better, and yes they could have been. But the main focus is the gameplay experience. THAT is what people should be paying attention too. I mean back in the 80's and 90' some of the greatest games were made and their graphics were no where near they are today! *cough cough* Super Mario 64, Super Mario World...I completely understand why they updated the graphics to the point where it was more detailed but not to the point where you felt like it was real life graphics. That does not suit Mario.Anyway, there's like what 90 levels? And as usual it starts out easy, but later on.. trust me it gets tough. Haha.And there's a lot more content on it! There's challenge mode which I have yet to try but I'm sure that's gonna be fun:) it will definitely take my mario skills to the test.Here are some pros and cons!Pros:-The gameplay is great for people of any age-The graphics are top notch and beautiful-The stage design is very original-Tons of new additions, squirrel power up, baby yoshis, and so on..-Multiplayer is ridiculously funCons:-same story line (I feel like they should change things up just to surprise people(; )- same bosses, different situations.Other than those cons I can't think of anything else that I dislike.

I know that many people enjoyed it and before you accuse me of the average \"Oh, you only like generic Call of Duty games\", I'd like to say it's the exact opposite. I've played a wide variety of games and usually stick to singleplayer open-world ones, and I can definitely say that this game is just average. Nothing special or as crazy as most people claim it to be. Again, this is just my opinion and not fact, I certainly hope you'll enjoy it more than I did. But here's what I thought (no spoilers).LOCATION:Sleeping Dogs has a unique environment, I'll give you that. Aside from the regular American cities, the location is a remodeled version of Hong Kong, and it's unique to see the markets, sights, lifestyle, I'll say that. But that's about the only thing this game has going to make it stand out.COMBAT:Being in Hong Kong, it would just be wrong to not include focus on hand-to-hand combat. Which it does! I can appreciate that it tries to try something new in open world and focus on combat. While certainly it's there and is more or less solid, and more unique button mashing combos can be unlocked by leveling up and finding jade statues, the combat doesn't.. 'flow'. It doesn't feel to flow in flawlessly like games such as Batman: Arkham City. It's actually basic. Press Y to counter an enemy when he glows red. There are mainly three or four different types of enemies in hand-to-hand. They each seem to awkwardly stand there and take turns attacking you. While it it is fun for a little while, you'll soon realize it's nothing that again, 'flows'.It also has some gun combat but it's just boring and poorly done. The shooting levels are just boring. Too easy even on hard difficulties.MOVEMENT/DRIVING:While freerunning is also good, it's nothing challenging. Just press A when approaching an obstacle to vault over it, miss you trip but still make it over slower. But the driving is just awful. The camera is the most awkward I've seen and doesn't follow. Try to move it while driving, you'll have a hard time. It will fling back to the head and often seems to have a mind of its own. Cars also drive too easy.. Press a single button and you perfectly drift? Where's the challenge in that? People that like challenging racing games with unique controls won't appreciate the driving.STORY/CHARACTERS:Possibly the thing I disagree with most on. Let me sum it up like this: It's nothing special! It's really short for starters, and it's just really predictable. I saw things coming from a mile away. It never tries to take unexpected events. It only gets interesting in the end, and even then it stays predictable. Voice acting is decent, but characters are about as average as the story. While some found it amazing, I've seen enough cop movies and games and whatnot to see things coming from a mile away, and if you're in the same boat me as you will as well.SIDE ACTIVITIES:While there are a few unique ones to match the location like cock fighting, the rest are just your average side activities. Stranger meets, drug busts, etc. And if you're wondering, they're nothing special and not really interesting nor challenging. They're really repetitive and are not really fun to do.I 100% the game, so I can honestly say that this game is average. I play lots of varies games, mainly open world so I think that I can safely say so. I'd give it a 3/5.If you're a parent getting this for your kid, it's really bloody and full of gore, just so you know.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0000A09EP","description":"Join Mario and Luigi as they team up in a strange new land for an action-packed quest to retrieve Princess Peach's stolen voice.","reviewerName":"Talduras","summary":"Their most hilarious adventure yet!","reviewText":"Oh, don't get me wrong. The game is fun too (although, try not to completely consider it an RPG, since it's just a bit different than standard RPGs). But, a game that can have me laugh and also be fun is a definate plus in my book, and it even not afraid to take a few stabs at its parent franchise.The story starts of seriously enough, when Peach's voice is stolen by an evil villian named Cackletta. After that, things get humorous as Mario and Luigi rush to the castle to help Peach, and also find Bowser hesitant to kidnap her because her voice was replaced with exploding symbols. From that point on, the stage is set for what has to be Mario and Luigi's most hilarious adventure yet.Since I already mentioned story, it seems fitting that I should mention the graphics. Just like the story, the visuals are also hilariously exaggerated. The way they animate the characters is smooth and expressive, and the visual style is DEFINATELY fitting of the game's humor. Everything has a cartoony type style... except done right.  In fact, even the text boxes are in on the act, adding emphasis where needed, giving the game an extra boost to its overall presentation.  Also, the frame-rates (i.e. the fluidity of the animation) is superb, whether in battle, roaming around, or just letting some of the crazy story insue.The sound is good, overall.  The sound effects are exactly what they should be, though most of it probably won't blow your mind.  However, the voicing for some of the characters is very excellent.  There isn't any voice acting, per se, but rather general grunts, laughs, and a lot of lines that Mario and Luigi say.  Well... they don't have any \"real\" dialogue (in other words, nothing in text), but they have short spoken lines like \"Let 'sa go!\" or \"Oh yeah!\"  In fact, when Mario or Luigi are explaining anything to other characters, they use spoken dialogue that, believe it or not, sounds Italian (which is a first, as far as I can tell O_o ).Anyway, music is also excellent.  They have plenty of new tracks, but they also remix a lot of things.  Funny thing is, the remixes are so new, so different, and so natural that they seem like they were an original part of the Mario & Luigi soundtrack.Now, gameplay.  This one is interesting.  The best way I can describe the travel part (read: \"non-battle\") is somewhat like a platformer.  Oh, don't think it's anything like the Mario platformer games, though.  Think of this as a normal RPG that gives you more real-time freedom and more interesting things to do.  They have some puzzles that you even have to use some special techniques for (these are explained thoroughly as you aquire them).  This actually adds a unique flavor to the game, adding some adventure elements to it loosely akin to Legend of Zelda.Now, battles are an interesting area.  First, I should mention that any fans of RPGs will find this game rather easy.  Regardless, the battle system is so unique that it may still be fun.  Battles are turn-based, BUT there are two real-time systems that require almost precisely accurate timing.  One is the dodge system.  If an enemy attacks, you have the chance to dodge, if you press the button at the correct time, and even counter-attack if your lucky enough (assuming it's the right attack/enemy for it).  The two types you get are jump and, later on, hammer, which are actually based on attacks you can perform too (FYI, there's another set of attacks called \"hand,\" which allow Mario to do a fire attack and Luigi to do a lightning attack, but these don't have dodge moves, which makes sense).  The type of dodge you can do is automatically selected, which is a good thing because it gives you more room to focus on waiting for the right time to dodge.The other instance of real-time, or pseudo real-time, reaction in the game are the Bros. Attacks.  These use an MP style point system called Bros. Points (or BP), so if you use them too much you'll need to recover your BP with items or go back to normal attacks.  Anyway, the interesting thing about Bros. Attacks is that they require a string of correctly timed button presses, which alternates between Mario and Luigi (in battle, Mario is the A-button and Luigi is the B-button).  Pressing all the buttons at the right time will net you greater damage with the attack.  But, mess up along the way and your attack won't be as effective, though it may be hilarious to watch.Mario & Luigi is definately a well concieved game.  If you can get past how easy it may be, and the fact that it has no conventional genre definition, you'll find a fun and hilarious game waiting for you.  Plus, if you like this game you'll be overjoyed to here that a Mario & Luigi 2 is in the works for the Nintendo DS (currently slated for release in November 2005).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2005"}

{"product_name":"B002F9005O","description":"","reviewerName":"Micheal Hunt","summary":"Bejewled with a Twist","reviewText":"I've been dying to play this since the R4 i have can not emulate this, so I bought it cheap off Ebay. Now that I have it, I'm kinda disappointed I'd been hanging out so long to play it. This is not the bejeweled game, but bejeweled twist.. which in some ways, many people may prefer over the original. In the old game you would move one jewel at a time to line them up, in this version you must twist around a circle of 4 jewels to make up the matches, and even tho I prefer it the old way by being able to move one block, I can see people may like this version as it eliminates the \"no more moves\" option, plus you can move the jewels from the bottom of the grid to the top by rotating them around (if you play the game this will make sense) to where you want, as the rotate action stays in the position you rotate it to, and doesn't just spin back to the original position if it doesn't match up.The above screen shows what colors you need to match up for extra points etc.. there is also some bonus gems along the way such as lightning shots that you get when you join 5 or 6 gems in a row, and a fire gem by doing 4 or so... one blows up a few gems around you, the other shoots the lines out up and to the sides to destroy those blocks.. there is also bomb gems that you need to get rid of by matching them before the timer runs down.. there is a few others as you progress as well.Unless there is more games to unlock, I must say this lacks a lot of options. It has two standard modes of play, and neither of them seem much different then the other one.

{"product_name":"B0050SW8OS","description":"","reviewerName":"Bearcat","summary":"The bar has been raised for portable gaming with Uncharted.","reviewText":"The biggest question I usually have after buying and playing a game is....do I feel it was worth spending the money.  In the case of Uncharted Golden Abyss I would say without a doubt it was worth every dollar.  This game sets a new bar for portable gameplay.  As I started to play the game and get immersed in the experience I didn't even think about the fact that I was playing it on a handheld gaming system.  It made me forget that and just enjoy the experience.  For the first time you will feel like you are playing a console level game on a handheld.  Now don't go in thinking this is going to look just like Uncharted 3 on the PS3 because that is not the case.  But what you will get is the best looking and playing portable game I have ever seen.  Don't get me wrong there are some annoying little things that force you to use the touchscreen.  Unlocking a padlock for example, or taking a machete to bamboo....but those are small annoyances when taking into account the whole experience.  Overall I can't recommend this game highly enough.  It really is as good as everyone says it is.  Sure there are minor annoyances with some things that force you to use the touchscreen or sometimes the aiming isn't as accurate as I would like, but those things are easily forgotten because overall this game is so good.  If I had a choice between playing the new Super Mario on the 3DS or playing this on the Vita I would choose Uncharted....never thought a portable game would make me say that.  Highly recommended.Update 3/11/12:  Well I just finished the game and it is just as good as my original review stated.  It really did feel like playing through a console title to me.  Sure some of the swiping while fighting could get a little old but overall this title is top notch.  I'm not used to portable titles having just as many cutscenes as a console title.  It really is an awesome game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2012"}

Aside from the Start and Select buttons, all of the functions are analog for greater control, a wider variety of operations, and a more compelling interactive experience.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B00006HBTW","description":"It&#x92;s a pretty bold claim but for many,Mario Partyis the best multiplayer game series ever. No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Alex \"47\"","summary":"Pretty good.","reviewText":"This is an OKAY MP game.

An affordable PS3 game is always welcome and this one can be had cheaply but there are reasons.  The voice acting as others have stated is truly unlistenable, in no small part because of the vampy Makoto character but it isn't the voices that make it so bad no that honor goes to the amazingly stiff, repetitive and awfully written dialogue.  Toya will take you through little hold your hand tutorials that are 99% of the time a lesson in pressing X.  There is some good here the graphics are decent and clean if a little linear and symetrical.  Collecting the pokemonesque golems can be addictive and the grid battle turn based system can be fun in a lightly strategic way. It just feels like the game is always stopping to talk when Atsuma wants action, and throwing you into repetitive battles when you are craving a little depth to the storyline. Both of which would be fine if the storyline or battle system weren't so repetitive, and no pressing X to climb a ladder or move a platform doesn't really spruce up the gameplay.  For some reason though (masochist?)I enjoyed myself but I had to switch to the japanese language voices just to avoid the mind crushingly dull dialogue and voice work.  How a game manages to be weird and offbeat and drab at the same time is baffling but EArms pulls it off.  In the end despite some occasionally nice looking graphics and a mildly intriguing golem (monster) capturing system Enchanted Arms is going to be harder to go back to as some really FINE RPGs hit the PS3 in coming months.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2007"}

Most importantly, there is once again a heavy emphasis on exploration. The town is open, and just waiting for you to unearth it's many secrets. Silent Hill itself has never been presented better than in Downpour. Foggy streets, buildings and homes suffering from rust and neglect, and the steady flow of rain is used to great effect. The introduction of side quests is simply brilliant. It makes me wonder why they weren't a part of this series sooner. It seems like such a natural fit to me. Plus the story element associated with them are very interesting and thoughtful. Many have taken issue with the combat and uninspired enemy types. I actually enjoyed the combat, though a bit clumsy. The enemies however failed to impress. The variety is shameful, and their design is hardly scary. Aside from that, Vatra did a fantastic job with their first attempt with this franchise. This has been the most fun i've had since Silent Hill 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000X25GW2","description":"You are Travis Touchdown, a normal guy (with an otaku geek streak) who wins a Beam Katana through an online auction and uses the weapon to start a new career as a professional killer. One day, an assassin named Helter Skelter appears before Travis and the two face off in a battle. Travis emerges victorious and finds himself in the presence of Silvia Christel, a mysterious French woman who claims to be an agent with the UAA. Silvia gives Travis official rank of 11 in the organization. Now, it's up to you to become #1. No More Heroes takes place in the city of Santa Destroy, and you are free to explore the town to your liking, taking on missions large and small to collect money and purchase new weapons as you work up towards the 10 main killing contracts. Gameplay is all about using your Beam Katana (via Wii remote) to defeat enemies.","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Spectacular, the best original third-party Wii title yet","reviewText":"From the makers of Killer 7, No More Heroes is the anxiously awaited bloodbath that mature Wii owners have been praying for.  Playing as eccentric assassin Travis Touchdown, you are armed with your trusty beam katana as you set out to become the best in the business.  There is much more to the story than that though, but without giving too much away regarding the game's surprisingly deep and complex story, let's just say that things don't always go as planned for Travis.  The first thing you'll notice are undoubtedly the excellent, cell-shaded graphics that No More Heroes sports, along with the best use of the Wii motion controls to come from a third-party yet.  The game also features some GTA-inspired free roaming with Travis on a motorcycle, and while it isn't as open-ended as one would hope, the game's serious sense of style and just plain insane story and gameplay elements more than make up for it.  The game also has a somewhat jittery frame-rate that can become quite noticable when the action picks up a lot, but this is only a minor complaint thanks to the stylized, over the top action, along with flawless sound design and elements that really take advantage of what the Wii can do, despite the fact that the console isn't a technical powerhouse.  All in all, No More Heroes is the absolute best, original third-party title to debut on the Wii yet, and is an absolute essential purchase for Wii owners craving a mature-themed game that leaves a lasting impression.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2008"}
{"product_name":"B004RIACMW","description":"","reviewerName":"Evildead11","summary":"Captain Average","reviewText":"Typically, super hero based games are pretty bad.  Actually, with the exception of the Batman series, they're usually very bad.  And to be honest, I thought that a Captain America game would be among the worst.  I mean, let's face it, the movie adaptation was pretty good, but as far as super heroes go, Captain America isn't exactly the most popular.  So, when I started reading so many positive reviews for this game, I was both surprised and curious.  So, I decided to give it a shot.  Well, I got about halfway through the game and lost interest.  It just got boring.  After a while, punching, kicking and throwing a shield at Nazis just got too repetitive for me.  Not only that, but I was beating them down with complete ease (on normal difficulty).  I mean, I know Captain A is supposed to be a badass, but jeez.Now, don't get me wrong.  It's not a terrible game or anything.  It is a decent \"filler\" game while you're waiting for that new title to be released.  (I'm sure I'll end up picking it back up at some point to finish it).  At first, it can be fun to pummel Nazis.  And there are light platforming aspects that, while amazingly simple to perform, can be slightly entertaining.  The story is ok, I guess.  It's pretty basic - the Red Skull is the ultimate bad guy and you must defeat his army and eventually him.  One thing that was annoying (at least to me) was his voice.  It sounds like Chris Evans, although I'm not sure if it's actually him playing the part.  However, his speech is so vanilla that it's nauseating.  I mean, it is in line with what you might expect from that era (1940s), so I can't really rag on it that much.  I just found it a little irritating.  I guess I'm a bigger fan of the gritty Batman character.The game has average graphics and average voice acting.  The controls are ok and are pretty easy to learn.  As I stated, it's an average game that could serve as a filler until your next game.  I wouldn't spend more than $20 on ths title.Overall: 3/5","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2013"}

The jumping is insane and with the first powerboost you feel like a superhero and invulnerable to anything as pedestrian as a rapid succession of bullets, but then you are quickly humbled be the firepower of a gang hitsquad. Yes you have to take cover, yes you will probably die a few times taking on odds that are not in your favor. I found it easier just go around kicking the gang members instead of shooting them. When your strength rises to the level where you can pick up a truck and throw it a few yards, punching and kicking adversaries turns into comic slapstick what with the Havoc-ragdoll physics at work. The city-scape is amazing and has the endless feel. The city seems more South American to Eastern European. The citzens don't really interact, they aren't mindless though, they run when bullets start flying. The gangs are not too dumb, especially as you advance in stats, the gangs actually get more sophisticated and deadly weaponry to deal with your enhanced genetics. Sometimes just rushing the main bosses and smacking them down does more than ducking and shooting at them. I don't agree that this is a Saints Row knock off. The graphics are next gen and the game is geniunely fun to play especially on-line which is where the game seems to shine the most. It's definitely worth the buy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2007"}

Weapons of mass destruction, deployed with complete impunity razed the land in the blink of an eye. The dire situation forced the two opposing factions to negotiate a cease-fire and an agreement was quickly reached, but although the war may have ended, its effects remained. With the deteriorating environment, Earth's population was drastically reduced and those who survived lived a confined existence trapped in underground cities. Eventually countries joined together to form the Greater United Nations and turned their eyes skyward, to space. With the establishment of the USTA, the Universal Science and Technology Administration, man began to seek new worlds beyond the stars.AD 2087...The first year of the spacedate (SD) calendar. Thanks to the success of Professor Trillas Bachstein's warp drive experiments, mankind's dream of a spacebourne existence has inched closer to reality and the USTA secretly began to implement its SRF project, the Space Reconnaissance Force. Now it is SD 0010, and the first official SRF mission and your adventure has begun.CharactersPlayers ofStar Ocean: The Last Hopewill meet and interact with a wealth of characters from different parts of the galaxy, each with their own history and weapons of choice. Just a few of the more prominent characters to familiarize yourself with include:Edge MaverickAlthough generally possessing good judgment, this young Earthling commander of the maiden deep space voyage of the SRF ship the Calnus, can be reckless. His signature weapon is the sword.Faize Sheifa BelethA young Eldarian committed to etiquette and logic, and capable of astounding feats of engineering, Faize is always honorable of those possessing abilities he lacks. His signature weapon is the rapier.Reimi SaionjiThe kind and levelheaded navigator of the Calnus, Reimi was born in an aristocratic Saionji family and has a shared history with Edge back on Earth. Her signature weapon is the bow.Lymle Lemuri PhiOrphaned on her home planet of Lemrick long ago, Lymle is mischievous, but friendly and inexplicably retains the appearance of a young girl. Her signature weapon is the wand.Gameplay and CombatAlthough Edge Maverick is the main character inStar Ocean: The Last Hope, players will of course experience gameplay action in the form of a number of different characters and utilize the signature attacks assigned to each. The game features a real-time combat system which allows for up to four party members to remain active in battle at a time. Improvements to the game's combat system include 'Rush Mode,' where players can switch out active members of their combat groups for reserve members in real-time; 'Sight In/Sight Out' which allows for timed evasive and counter moves against enemies; and the BEAT (Battle Enhancement Attribute Type) system, through which players can change a character's fighting style at will. Other actions players will master through gameplay include piloting of the spaceship Calnus, a first in theStar Oceanseries; item creation in the form of weapons, healing items and accessories; and Private Actions (PAs), a cause and effect relationship between character in-game actions and the acquisition of new abilities and scenarios. Through the increased flexibility mastery of all these skills provides, players should be able to more easily increase their team and individual team member's combat experience and status, and so unlock more advanced combat styles and linked combinations.Key Game Features:Series prequel-Star Ocean: The Last Hopeis a prequel in the classic series, combining sci-fi and fantasy elements, spanning multiple planets and the vastness of space itself to recount the origins of the Star Ocean universe.Exciting Battles- Exhilarating combat expands upon the franchise's famous real-time battle system, including the amazing graphics and visual effects only possible on Xbox 360.Compelling Scenes- The game features breathtaking CG movies by Visual Works, the cutting-edge studio whose previous work includes cutscenes for the acclaimed Final Fantasy RPG series.","reviewerName":"DM","summary":"Disappointing","reviewText":"The good:- SO: TLH has one of the most satisfying fighting systems of all the XBox JRPGs. Simply put, Blindside never gets old. Compared to Tales of Vesperia, you have less skills, but this makes it easier to concentrate on the ones you like. Battles are also more about strategy and less about mashing buttons like in Tales or Eternal Sonata.- Battles are in real-time and enemies can be seen on screen (no Random Encounters). Lost Odyssey could have been the best RPG on 360 if only did not have Random Encounters.- Despite what game reviewers have said, the voice acting is good enough. I would put in on par with Tales of Vesperia, Lost Odyssey and Eternal Sonata. Not as good as Mass Effect though.- There are multiple difficulty settings, which make it easier for anyone to play this game. Easy is easy, so - if you never played this type of game before - fret not.- While very linear, maps (planets) are huge. Maps are easy to read, albeit when you bring the whole map on screen, you cannot scroll.The bad:- The worst thing about SO:TLH is the uncooperative camera. It moves all the time, zooms in and out by its own, making it very confusing to navigate the maps. It's so bad - you can hardly walk in a straight line, without jerking or zooming in. In battles, you are given options to have a better control over the camera, but even that doesn't work as intended.- Graphics - while not the selling point of any game - do ruin the experience here. Battleships look same or worse than KOTOR2. Planets have poor textures and have limited color palettes. Main characters look great though. Overall - the game just doesn't have the next generation polish that Mass Effect and others have. By comparison, Lost Odyssey looks gorgeous.- Story and dialogue are very poorly written (or translated??). Yes, even Eternal Sonata was childish, but the story had a soul and you could connect with it. Lost Odyssey was mature (well - most of it) and kept you interested to the end. Tales of Vesperia was witty and had great characters. SO:TLH tries to fill big shoes and just doesn't. It starts cheesy and only gets cheesier.- Game comes on 3 DVDs. Unlike Lost Odyssey that - with the 4th DVD - allowed you to return to any previous location, in SO:TLH, you will need to swap disks. Not a deal killer per se, but should have been better thought out.Bottom line:- if you do not mind turn based battles and random encounters, buy Lost Odyssey - probably best JRPG on 360.- if you like fast real-time fighting and an engaging story - get Tales of Vesperia.- if you like real-time fighting and want a more sensible story, get Eternal Sonata.- if SO is your thing, wait until it hits the bargain bin.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2009"}

The various terrains - from snow to sand to grass to concrete - are well done. The trees sway in the wind. The units leave little tracks as they move, the construction of buildings makes you really feel like you're watching an army base get built.The sound and music is well matched and makes the game feel realistic. Controls all work just the way you'd hope they would - after so many games they really have that down to a science.On the down side, the usual problems in strategy gaming exist here. pathfinding isn't always perfect, units get stuck against buildings or in chasms. The campaign missions help you learn your skills but aren't extremely challenging.Still, as with just about every game that comes out today, the built in gameplay is merely a training ground for the real challenge of multiplay. There's no way a computer could compete with the challenge posed by a real human being with experience and knowledge at the other end of the map. This game really shines in multiplayer.

I believe the correct word is ownage?Half Life 2 is maybe the best looking game ever made, no, wait, it is the best looking game ever made. But good graphics dont make good gameplay usualy, but thanks to the Havok 2.0 physics engine HL2 uses, it does. You can pick up the opressed peoples TV's and throw them out a window. Probably the greatist thing about HL2 is that physics. Being able to treat everything as \"real\" is the biggest step forward in a FPS.The multiplayer is kick ass. It comes with the new Counter-Strike and Half Life 2 dethmatch. I would have liked more game modes for Half Life 2 dethmatch but thats what it is, \"deathmatch\".

I am baffled as to why I hardly ever heard of this game, and why so many big sites gave it such mediocre scores. For a console action RPG this one beats the competition by a mile.This game is huge - unlike the short console action RPGs out there that takes 12 to 15 hours to finish. Customization is complexed and the enemies challenging. Combat is fun. Voice acting and music is very well done. There are so many options and hidden Easter eggs to keep you busy. Graphics are a bit dated but if you are not a graphics purist you're in for a heck of a ride.I am not comparing this to the PC role playing games - just the console games. I played this on the Xbox 360. After playing the Baldur's Gate DA, Champions of Norath, Oblivion, Dragon Age, Fable games... Dragon Knight Saga is easily my favorite.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0002SQ0BS","reviewerName":"OmnilimbO","summary":"Game of the Century","reviewText":"Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is the third in a series of three games (to date).  It is available for the XBOX, Play Station 2, PC, Game Cube and Game Boy Advance.  This review is in reference to the XBOX version.Those who are familiar with the Splinter Cell series have come to expect a product that is fresh, innovative and truly ahead of the pack in terms of game play, graphics and all of the more technical aspects of a video game.  Chaos Theory not only lives up to, but exceeds those expectations.  Even though we have now entered the \"Next-Gen\" era, this game still outshines most of the other games currently available.  This is because Splinter Cell games are notoriously ahead of their time and implement the most advanced techniques and technologies available, even if it means creating them from the ground up.In this third installation of the series the year is 2007. However, I'll skip the obligatory plotline info and get straight to the guts of the game.  The single player mission is of course, utterly superb in every way imaginable.  I could go on telling you about all the intricate story, unbelievably beautiful lighting and particle effects, fluid game play and such, but, perhaps the most important thing is simply that it will literally be months before you stop saying \"these graphics are insane\" or \"OMFG, this game freakin ROCKS\"!  No joke, it's that good.Also included in the package is the multiplayer mode introduced in Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow.  The graphics have been updated and look great.  A few new gadgets have been introduced: the Mercs now have a camera network at their disposal, while the spies have a heart-beat sensor and the glorious therm-optic camouflage.  A few moves have also made an appearance: the Mercs have charge and berserk abilities while the spies are now able to pull foes over railings and execute an inverted hang.  Pandora Tomorrow would be worth the price just for the MP element.  But that isn't all; once again, the bar has been raised and we are presented with something completely new and unexpected - Splinter Cell Co-Op mode.  In Co-Op you partner up with a friend via Xbox LIVE to take on computer AI throughout a number of well crafted missions for a completely new experience.  Chaos Theory is arguably the best in the series and undoubtedly the most addictive game I have EVER played - I still play it till this day.  Another classic stunner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2006"}

Alone, he defeated the demon army and imprisoned their emperor, Mundus saving the human world from damnation. Now, 2000 years later in a large American metropolis, a man named Dante, a private investigator of the supernatural, is seeking revenge for the death of his mother and brother. However, Dante comes face to face with his destiny, discovering the evil conspiracy goes back thousands of years and that the evil Mundus has arisen a new. The world is waiting, for Dante is no ordinary man...Dante is Spahda's son and with his father's sword in hand, he must enter the demon realm and avenge mankind.That is the background story to this amazing game.  This is were you pick up Dante, the half man half demon, to start the quest given to you by a demon girl named Trish.  From the open game sequence you can tell Dante is one bad mother, shut your mouth.  This game just recks of coolness that everybody must see at lest once.Enough about the background, let me tell you about the gameplay because without that...the game would suck.  The gameplay is superb.  Dante's reactions become more of an extension of your hand than just actions you make him preform.  The 1st time you do a sword to gun air combo for about 20 hits you'll know what I'm talking about.  The actions are simple and takes about 10 min to get comfertable with them.  R1 locks on target, while holding it down you can press: circle to sword and kicks, X to use your guns, and triangle to jump, back sumersault, side roll depending on the direction you press.  L1 turns Dante into demon form and allows for faster and stronger hits.  This is a stright action game with maybe 10% other.  All guns have unlimtied ammo to help keep up the pace.The graphics will be this games main selling point, and what a strong selling point it is.  All the graphics are gorgeous but the real feature to watch is the animation of Dante and other charchters.  They are simply breathtaking along with cool.  The 1st time I fought the 1st boss and started doing back flips, rolls, while shoting and slashing....my friend just looked on with his mouth wide open.  I died, he turn slow toward me and said, I quote, &quot;That was the most kick @ss thing I've ever seen.&quot;  Trust me its that good.The game is something will not get tired of in a week or will beat in a week.  The game on normal setting is hard.  With each new badguy introduced I died just looking at them and trying to figure out how they fight.  There is said to be about 10-15 hours of gameplay, don't know for sure haven't beat it, and secret missions after you beat it.  The depth of the play will also keep you going, learning witch guns/swords to use on each fight is somthing you'll also spend time doing.In the end, Capcom has given us the best looking, playing, and just flat out coolest games to play ever on any console.  Your heart races as the rock-n-roll picks up for the fight and if you die or win....your left stasfied and with a tear of happeiness in your eye.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2001"}

This amazingly cool concept game was a sort of bonus game tacked on to the already amazing Half-Life 2 game. The games took place in (nearly) completely different universes, and both were very different animals, but both were incredibly fun to play.Having purchased an Xbox for the family last year for Christmas, I knew that this was one game that I would eventually have to own.

It's a fantastic game with top-notch visuals and some of the most unique play environments you're likely to find in any game, anywhere. Though it is incredibly fun to play, I know that - as far as games go - this one will be over relatively quickly. At least there is the cooperative side of the game that I can play with my son when we finish the main story line! I would consider this game a \"must have\" if you've got an Xbox.

{"product_name":"B000FPM3HS","reviewerName":"GintaxAlvissforever","summary":"One of the Most Depressing and Chilling Games Ever Played","reviewText":"This game is just unique and by unique I mean story. I have never seen a website put together online putting the entire story together and pointing out every little thing that the game has to offer.The story takes place during the 1930s (as shown with the air ship...but I would prefer to say that it took place during WWI because of it but alas). You play as a girl named Jennifer followed by a dog named Brown as your have to survive in a mansion full of evil little kids and uncaring adults. The kids have formed a group called \"Red Crayon Aristocrats\" where they do all sorts of messed up things.Regardless, the story seems confusing unless you put the pieces together and look for things that stand out. Once you understand the characters more, the story makes even more sense. I like how on this one website, theories have been made about one of the most important scenes in the game and what happened to some of the characters. The Mermaid Princess arc is considered one of the most deeply thought out story arc and probably the most depressing one to boot given the dark implications.The gameplay is the worse part though. The gameplay is probably intentionally bad though given Jennifer isn't a fighter. If you pay attention to her, you notice that she never looks when she uses a weapon against the creatures attacking her making her miss more times than not even if she gets a clear shot from the back. This ties in with the story though. Given how cowardly Jennifer is, of course she'll be bad with combat and Brown is no fighter like Hewie in Haunting Ground. But when you finally get past the controls, most bosses end up being relatively easy. Then again, there are hardly any bosses in the game except a few and this also ties in the story according to the website online (heck the final boss isn't even a boss as explained online).Overall, this story is very sad and tragic. If it was an anime or a manga instead of a game, it would have been received better but because of bad controls, I got to knock the game down one grade.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2013"}

Orr","summary":"Seasons in Hell","reviewText":"There has been much talk about \"Heavy Rain\" as an interactive drama, as a precursor to a new type of videogame exeprience where story and character developement matter more than quick thrills. What really matters with \"Heavy Rain\", however, is that it is an exciting, beautifully made and surprisingly fluid experience that easily bears the weight of expectation.As its name implies, the game is set in a miserably wet environment. From what I recall of English literature classes, its what they call pathetic fallacy, as the weather really does reflect the dark worldview that French developer Quantic Dream have set out to portray. And for each characer, the game really is a season in hell; whether Ethan mars, who has to face the trauma every parent dreads, or the other three playabble characters, the game perfectly welds a glowering and relentlessly sordid atmosphere with the personal catastrophes that each of them must face as they deal with the mysterious serial \"Origami\" child killer.  Although reviewers have understandably been mesmerised by the games fantastically detailed graphics and character models, special mention must go to the wonderful musical score, which adds depth and seriousness to the unfolding tragedies that the player/viewer experiences.The game controls are a mix of quick time events (QTE) and a curious control system that aims to recreate simple everyday movements with the right analogue stick.  In fact, the latter is more reminiscent of guitar tablature than conventional videogame controls.  Perhaps the biggest irritation for me is the cumbersome and imprecise old-school \"Resident Evil\"-style tank controls which require the player to press the R2 button; however, this isn't a game-breaking issue because the input system for QTEs is sharp and extremely forgiving. The emphasis is always on giving players just enough choice when controlling the four characters wityhout really diverting from the main thrust of the whodunnit thriller plot.What must be mentioned is that \"Heavy Rain\" would not be succesful in creating this lovingly detailed envirnoment of any- and every-where America if the human characters were not believable types. Quantic Dream have triumphed in crafting characters that are as solid in their connection with the audience/player as they are in their high definition apperances. The obviously French origions of the voice actors (especially the acor that plays Lauren) doesn't really detract from the experience.Although the much-vaunted choice system is not always as flexible as many critics would like, the game generally achieves its dark and yet human view of the world by giving just enough choice for players to make (via dialogue options and quick time events) without deluging them in some \"Butterfly Effect\"-like system whereby the smallest decision has enormous and unforeseen consequences.  In truth, it would have been nice to have more say in the story development during the first half of the game, with a greater say given to the gamer as to how the relationship between FBI man Norman Jayden and police officer Blake developed, for exmple.The game can be completed in less than eight hours, but the branching story tree during the last part of the game and the possibility for some of the charcaters to die adds another two playthroughs for even the mildly curious player. Trophy support is very well implemented because it gives opportunity for gamers to see what available choices there are left to be made with view to another playthrough.  However, it is hard to really recommend a purchase of the game rather than an extended rental, although the addition of downloadable standalone game packs in future may change this.\"Heavy Rain\" is a fantastically accomplished hybrid of videogame and drama.  Whether the game remains a quirky novelty or becomes a template for a new breed of story-driven videogame is hard to tell. What is not is that this is one trip to the dark side that any PlayStation 3 owner must experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2010"}

This game was a surprising little hit, combining a murder mystery with game interactions and button presses. Now, 5 years later, the Quantic Dream Team has hit a home run with their newest thriller, Heavy Rain.PLOT:You take turns playing as 4 different people, tracking down a multiple murderer known as the Origami Killer. The game plays out like a psychological thriller similar to the movieSevenand the story changes with the decisions you make (or in some cases, DON'T make, wink wink). These choices affect the final outcome of the game, and there are several different endings available. I like to think of this as a Choose Your Own Adventure book matched up with Dragon's Lair, with a bit ofSawmixed in for good measure. There are some mature themes (drug use, violence, male and female nudity, etc) so this is not a game for the kiddies.GAMEPLAY:The first level of this game is the perfect tutorial. Periodically, little white boxes or circles will appear and when you copy the actions with the Right analog stick, move the SixAxis controller in the required direction, or press the correct sequence of buttons, your character moves around and performs certain actions. If you get stuck, pressing the L2 button allows your character's inner thoughts to appear which can give you some ideas on how to advance. From applying eyeliner to burping a baby, surviving a fistfight or dodging oncoming traffic, you'll feel like you're right there in the game.You can choose the level of interactivity - On the easier settings, there are only a few buttons to press and regular movements. With the difficult settings, there are more buttons to press and analog stick movements are pressure sensitive (noted by the little dotted boxes).The game is a little more fluid while using the Playstation Move controller - it's easier to navigate conversation menus, and certain actions (such as opening a door) feel more real to life.Sometimes you'll notice a split-screen effect where events are happening simultaneously: while you control a character on one side of the screen, people and their actions are unfolding on the other. This is a technique used by Brian De Palma in his movies to increase tension, and it succeeds brilliantly in Heavy Rain.GRAPHICS:This game allows for 720P output, and the graphics are breathtaking. From warehouses to run-down homes, sleazy hotels to convenience stores, studio apartments to police stations, there's a lot of detail to be seen. The facial animations are amazing - skin texture, scars, facial hair, everything looks and feels like we're watching a movie and playing a game at the same time.MUSIC:Whether it's a tension-filled moment or a dramatic pause, Heavy Rain's music reflects the environment perfectly. You'll feel like a gumshoe in a dime novel when the haunting sax melody plays, and you can practically smell the sweat on the dance floor with the pounding techno music. It's as if the game senses when we're getting excited or relaxed because the music matches the moment, every time.EXTRAS:As you progress through the game, you can unlock concept art, interviews, motion capture sessions, character readthroughs, and more. It's clear the people at Quantic Dream love what they're doing, and it shows. If you like seeing how games like this are produced, you'll unlock more content than you know what to do with.You can choose to redux certain chapters with a \"no save\" option (this is good if you're just looking to unlock a trophy) or the \"save\" option, which allows you to follow another branch of the story based on your decisions.TROPHIES:There are 57 trophies for Heavy Rain...and I won't tell you about any of them. It's kind of hard to, because almost all the trophies are hidden when you start to play. I don't want to ruin the fun for you, suffice it to say as you progress through the story, you get an idea of what unlocks the trophies, that way you can plan your next play-through.CONS:Even with all this going for it, Heavy Rain does have some flaws. The walking movements of the characters feels slow, and the facial animations don't always match. Sometimes the characters look and move like mannequins, and this was a common complaint about the game Indigo Prophecy. Heavy Rain can be finished in about 3-4 days of regular gameplay, but the replay value stays high because of the multiple endings.CONCLUSION?If you like murder mysteries, multiple endings, behind-the-scenes options, collecting trophies and beautiful gameplay animations, then Heavy Rain is right up your alley. I've finished 50% of the trophies, and I'm heading back to the PS3 right after I finish this review - it's that good.Highly recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2010"}

The subplot of this game returns to Altair's time and follows him until his death. Nice addition to play Altair as an old man. Ezio, the current game's protagonist, is wrapping up his own life as an assassin and trying to solve the mystery of the apple. I enjoyed Ezio's new love interest, Sophia, and his role as Mentor to new assassins (same as Brotherhood). I have to agree with other reviewers in that the upgrades left much to be desired. The only reason I gave this game 4 starts instead of 5 is this did indeed feel like another Brotherhood. 2 of the main upgrades, bomb making and den defense, could have been better. I liked using bombs, but most of the time forgot I had them. There weren't enough situation presented to really get me to the point where using bombs was as tactical as throwing knives or using my sword. I hated the den defense. Honestly, I preferred to let the Byzantines win and later simply kill there captain. It was much easier. The den defense was kind of annoying. The best upgrade to the game was the use of a hookblade. I used it everywhere. I loved zipline assassinations and it made climbing so much easier and quicker.Overall, this is a great game. I was simply disappointed with the upgrades and I feel the game did not reach its full potential. I just expected more. However, my disappointment did not prevent me from thoroughly enjoying this game. I will continue to play the series and already can't wait until the next edition with a new protagonist!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2012"}

Do not buy this game unless you are hooked up to xbox live.  The multiplayer is a lot of fun except the maps are starting to feel old and their matchmaking system seems very limited.  Your preferences are limited it to ranked matches or social matches, and game type(slayer, teamslayer, CTF, etc).  But when it comes to what map you want to play or what weapons, you have no choice.  Ex...you can't say, match me up with other people who want rocket launchers on this map.  There needs to be more variety.Prediction:  Over the next couple months Bungie is going to add gametypes like the one mentioned above(just rockets) to make it fresh, although they're really adding nothing new.  Just recently they up social matches from 12 players to 16 players, why wasn't it 16 players to begin with???when on the back of your game box it states you can have a max of 16 players.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2007"}

Great story telling, won't mention anything to not spoil. Combat becomes a bit repetitive that is the truth, but you are a Roman soldier, with an armor, a sword, spears, a shield and a scorpio (stationary flame arrow thrower) in some areas. Those are your weapons and you fight man to man as a Roman soldier would do, with your skills and agility to survive. In some areas you will lead a formation of soldiers all at once to penetrate some enemy areas (pretty awesome), where all protect themselves or attack at your command. Also you can unleash your rage when you have filled one of the meters and attack very fast and unchallenged for a few seconds (good for some of the boss fights). It is not button mashing, you need a strategy to attack, push, block and evade to survive. Executions are gory and brutal even still a bit repetitive too. At higher levels, if you do not execute quickly when the icon appears, your enemy will continue fighting if you miss the short window. Many times you will be outnumbered and you need those skills to stay alive. Also you have some heavy attacks that can open almost any opponent guard. The single player consists of 8 (VIII) acts or chapters, each one taking around an hour each. A bit shorter than I expected but sweet. At the end you finish with a feeling of accomplishment and an epic and big ending. I have not tried the multiplayer yet. If you have an Xbox One, then it is a recommended game. I am giving 4 out of 5 stars. From 1 to 10, it would be like an 8.5. Great original story. Recommended and enjoyable.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2013"}

Yes, true to all the above, but you can adjust darkness under video options to better your experience on older monitors. You will need to shoot almost everything to survive. Definitely repetitive gameplay, but what games aren't. YES, this game is extremely SCARY, but if you endure it's worth it. Not a hard game (Normal setting), because you'll find Health and Ammo just when your about to run dry so everything is well placed & timed. This game will psychologically get to you regardless of how tough you think you are towards getting scared. I've played and endured through all the scares offered by Resident Evil series, Alone in the Dark, and Eternal Darkness. And this game you are no lil sissy running around gunless instead well equiped to do plenty of damage as should be and knowing this I still believe it is by far the scariest game I've ever played. Replaying through the same level several times never stops the knowingly scares awaiting those areas. I tried my best to beat the game w/out any MODs to assist, but by the time I got past Delta base I was no longer able to play on. This game's setting is very dark & evil. All the scares with the freaky sound effects were getting to me. I had to MOD and found several useful MODs such as the Sentry Bot and Duct Tape ones. MOD takes all the disadvantages and switches them in your favor. Most people are just too scared to play and won't admit it. They instead say this game is too DARK  or repetitive, but they just plain too scared to continue.

The graphics are great, and the gameplay is pretty much what you'd expect from a good Doom remake.However, for a little while, I was tempted to give this game a lower rating. Why? Well, I am not quite sure. I enjoyed the game and it has super high production values. However, there is nothing in the game that really blew me away in the FarCry sort of way. Everything was pretty much the way I had expected it and had seen it before, although in a better and more professional way. There is no doubt that this is one of the best games I ever played, but for some reason, it is a great game in a disappointing way. There really are no true surprises.The game almost exclusively plays in a Mars station. The station is very nicely modeled and believable. As you get through different parts of the station, the graphical style changes slightly. However, not enough to be really obvious unless you pay close attention to the graphics. This in a way is one of the weaknesses of the game. Once you are done, you really feel like you only played a single mission and are ready for the next level, even though the game is longer than most shooters these days (by a wide margin). The game even features a few interesting and unique moments, but overall, the whole thing appears like one huge space station blur once you are done. It is hard to think of individual moments of importance beyond a few exceptions. (Although those exceptions are very very good!)The game is scary in a \"there is a monster in my closet\" sort of way. The game is very dark. It is to gaming what Event Horizon is to movies. Very dark and very scary. But of course, you always know you are playing a game. I guess games are really hard to make truely scary, but this game gets the closest to being really scary of all the games I have played. Although I can see why some players would not like the constant flashlight action.Over time, the game grew on me and I was truely sucked in and could not stop until I was done. In hindsight, I am sorry it is over and I truely enjoyed it, even though I was initially somewhat disappointed.I liked the added elements brought to the story through email and computer terminals. Some critics complain about all the reading and how it slows down the games pace, but I did enjoy it, even though I normally do not like my shooters to be interrupted by puzzles.I did experience a few bugs. Sometimes the sound shut off and I actuall had to reboot my machine. Also, some of the weapons handling is sub-optimal. Switching between the Soulcube, the flashlight, and other weapons sometimes does not work as advertised (especially after you load a game or after you watched an in-game video).Overall, I can recommend this game to anyone who has a remote interest in first person shooters.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Matthew Ivester \"Power User\"","summary":"pika..... *SMASH*  PIKA!!!","reviewText":"Frankly, one of the best (and most addictive) video games I've ever played.If you don't know (or didn't play the first Super Smash Brothers on the N64), this is a fast-paced cartoonish fighting game where you can control (and beat up) characters from Nintendo's other games (such as Mario and Luigi, Link and Zelda, Kirby, Pikachu, Samus Aran, and lesser-known ones like the Ice Climbers).  Its cute looks and deceptively simple controls (punch/kick, special move, jump, and block/throw) hide a surprisingly complex fighting game that will please players of any skill level.  It's probably too confusing and fast-paced for little kids, but I'd heartily recommend it for anyone above the age of 10 or so.There are three vastly improved single-player modes: straight fighting (much like the single-player from the first game), an \"adventure\" mode where you fight your way through various levels, and a series of fifty challenging \"event\" matches to test your skills.  There's also an endurance mode (fight up to 100 opponents in a row) and a highly entertaining home-run contest.Of course, the game is at its best with a group of people -- it supports up to 4 players duking it out at once, which is an absolute blast.  You can also play on teams, and include computer-controlled fighters of various difficulty levels.  There are dozens of characters and stages to fight on, and almost every aspect of combat can be adjusted (such as how much damage your characters do, how fast the game runs, and which items will appear during the battles).It can take some time to unlock all of the game's hidden characters and levels, and beating the single-player mode without continuing (to get to the \"real\" boss) is *tough* on the higher difficulty settings.  Its real replay value, though, is definitely in the multi-player mode.  If you don't have 4 controllers and 3 friends, you might think twice about this, but otherwise, you can't go wrong.Besides, you can whack annoying Pokemon upside the head with a baseball bat.

Being a 'fanboy' of the series I promptly ignored the reviews and bought it anyway.  The opening area, the Hospital, was spot on with the ol'Silent Hill feel.

Here is my simple review and comparison between the two:- Design wise I would say it's in the eyes of beholders. But this one is minor since gaming consoles are not like cellphones you are probably not paying too much attention to how they look. But I have to mention PS3 is really quiet, even after the trimmed down redesign, the new Xbox still makes a noticeable amount of noise.- Games: Both platforms have a lot of exclusive titles and so far I really enjoyed God of War series and Uncharted 2. I am also a RPG fan but I was disappointed by the Fable series. If you are a FPS fan you will not have any trouble with either console. there is numerous FPS tiles out there both exclusive and cross-platform for you to choose before you really get bored of endless shooting. Both systems have been released for at least five years so you will have a lot of great games to keep you busy.- Features: PS3 definitely shines with free online gameplay and blue ray support. I just don't get it with Xbox that I have already paid for the console and still paying 60 dollars for a game and why do I still have to pay for the online access? I also don't understand why it requires paid membership to access to Netflix, Facebook and Twitter. Come on Microsoft, you don't even host those contents! Speaking of Netflix, if you have DVD/Blu-Ray out with Netflix you definitely want a PS3 for its Blu-Ray support. And also a personal note, Xbox made me feel like just a gaming console, like a Wii with totally different games(OBVIOUSLY THANKS TO THE PATHETIC 4GB STORAGE! CHEAP MICROSOFT!). but PS3 is now making me using it like a real multimedia hub. I have loaded plenty of games, music and videos and it is now really fun to play, watch, and listen to.- Kinect/Move: Speaking of them I haven't invested in neither of them but obviously Kinect looks more advanced with cameras that track the motion of your body while PS Move still only tracks the controller. Kinect absolutely wins big in dancing and work-out types of games.(Now here is the part I don't understand about SONY. Come on why can't the PS Eye camera track the body motion too?). One plus goes to the Move is that based on various reviews it performs really well in FPS with the Sharpshooter.Overall I give it a 9.5/10, with 0.5 taken for the lack of track of body motion in the PS Move.

It immediately reminds me of Yakuza with all the shops and vendors barking their goods by day and the bustling HK nightlife looks awesome after dark. If you've played Batman:AA then you will easily get the feel for melee combat and once you've got enough moves it flows so smooth it looks like animation to the point you'll be running around just looking for fights. Gunplay is added and the cover system works well enough but doesnt turn the game into an FPS.There are tons of sidequests called 'favors' that allow you to up your street cred, allowing you to get more swankier gear and there are underworld missions like car robbing and armored car heists to raise money. As you gain exp you can unlock certain skills under the cop/gangster trees and by finding statues throughout the story you will find the statues needed for unlocking the MA moves. While this game doesnt have all the activities of a Yakuza game it does have one thing that would have made Yakuza better: Cars. The driving system isnt Need for Speed mechanics, but it's more than adequate for a sandbox game.Tons of features like the instant slo-mo when you blow out a rival gang's tire at high speed, or jumping from your car to another to take it over, or the bullet time when exiting a speeding car with gun drawn makes this game alot of fun. I cant believe S/E made this game.edit: Ok after 4 replays I have to say this is something that you dont see very often anymore: A polished, complete game in which all of the side-events are fun and work into the main game itself.The voicework keeps you attached to the main characters but the fun factor of the races, fight clubs,armored car heists and favor events makes it a tug of war on what you want to complete first, and the graphics makes everything look so vivid unlike a GTA game where the people and scenery just seem like cover for the story. This game really feels alive despite the sheer size of the map.I dont know what dark magics Square Enix used to make this game since they've been making crap for the past 10 yrs but I really hope this trend continues for them. Awesome game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2012"}

Engine getting stale. Where's the manual?","reviewText":"I was surprised by the quality of this game. I played this in December 2002, and it was much better than I though. Sure, the graphics engine is getting a little old, especially compared to games such as Dongeon Siege. However, I was still surprised that a game of this age looked so good.What isn't great however, is the lack of a manual. In fact, I wondered whether the contents of my box were incomplete, but apparently that is not the case. This severely limits the game. This simply isn't acceptible. If there was a manual, I would have rated this game at least one star higher than I did.That would make 4 stars, so why not 5? Well, there are some issues that keep the game from receiving a top rating (aside from the graphics). I do not like how the inventory is managed. It is very hard to see whether a weapon or armory is better than the one you currently have.Also, the path finding sometimes isn't great. All the members of your party go one way, while one of them gets lost. He/she will catch up ultimately, but it simply is annoying. Also, sometimes you try to get out the door but can't because the leading member of the party is blocked by other party members. The same happens when you try to talk to people.Addition: I now found the manual on the CD. This makes things a little better, but I still think it is a farce that a game like this doesn't ship with a printed manual.Unfortunately, the manual failed to explain some of the questions I had, and some of the oddities I couldn't figure out work just like I thought but are just a bit cumbersome. For instance, it is not a lot of fun to purchase a piece of armory for 5000 gold pieces just to figure out it is actually worse than the one you had before, forcing you to sell it again for 200 gold pieces. But I guess that's just how the old AD&D; rules were...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2002"}

{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"Mike","summary":"the bee's knees, a must own","reviewText":"This game took me by surprise, it is very easy to give this game a 5 out of 5.I have to add that I never played the first one and so when I saw this one I was skeptical at first. I mean I heard it was great, and my friends said it was great, but I was thinking \"meh, how good can it be.\" By nature I am a big xbox guy, so after watching some video reviews online I decided to add this to my collection of 3 ps3 games (little big planet, killzone 2, and infamous), and I have to say I am very glad I did. This game is awesome and I would recommend it for gamers of all types (sports, action, rpg, etc) regardless of age (not too young).The multiplayer is put together really well and it is worth it alone just for that, but the single player is the real gem.  The graphics and sound are amazing and enhance the experience as you travel all over in this game. This is the first game where I have actually payed attention to the story in a long time. The cut scenes flow in and out of the game play but are not so often it feels like you are watching a movie. There is some pretty good humor in this game and the platform sections run pretty well. There were a few times where the fighting became tedious and there was a decent amount of trial and error but nothing that really blemishes the experience. For multiplayer you have several standard death match variations and co op.In the end I would say that this is an easy 5 out of 5. If you (or a christmas/birthday gift for someone you know) has a ps3 and only uses it for movies I think that this would be the perfect game to get them.It is a mature action game (mature as in adults will like it too) which is most comparable to the Indiana Jones films.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"TheTruthHurts","summary":"Not quite the \"masterpiece\" it's proclaimed to be, but excellent nonetheless","reviewText":"4.5 StarsWell, I finally gave in and purchased an Xbox 360, after the recent price drop made it affordable (and the 65 nm process-CPU became available); let me tell you that I've been waiting anxiously to play games on this system (though, admittedly, the graphics are far outdone now by even an average graphics card), and with Resident Evil 5 being released (tentatively, of course) in March, I simply couldn't wait any longer.Having read the reviews of \"Bioshock\" on sites such as IGN and Gamespot, I knew that it would likely be my first purchase; that said, it became my second, after the boneheaded-but-beautiful \"Gears of War.\" Was \"Bioshock\" worth the $25 I spent on a used copy? Absolutely; here's why:First, the game is simply one of the best-looking I've ever seen, on any format; the attention to detail, along with the incredible artistry, make for a formidable combination that very few games can currently rival (but yes, \"Gears of War\" is still the champion in this department). With that in mind, there is something important that you must do before playing the game (at least on Xbox 360); set \"Unlock Framerate\" to \"On.\" This disables v-sync and allows the game to run at the limit of the system (which, as far as I can tell, is beyond 60 fps at least 95% of the time (vs. 30 fps with it set to \"off\")). The difference is, quite simply, feeling like you're in the world on your screen vs. feeling like you're watching a comic book/cartoon. So long as you can stand some \"tearing\" (which you won't even notice after a few minutes), it makes all the difference in the world regarding the \"experience\" of this game.Beyond the graphics lies the incredible sound; make sure you've got a 5.1 system up and running before playing this game. Sounds are accurately placed throughout the entire soundfield, and it makes a difference when you're playing the game, as you know exactly where your enemies are (especially when they're shooting at you).Thirdly, and probably most importantly, is the incredible story behind all the visual and audial magic; most mentioned, of course, is the \"moral dilemma\" one must face when choosing to \"harvest\" the little girls or save them. I personally could never bring myself to \"harvest\" (kill) one, and by the end of the game, I realized that I hadn't needed to, as the gifts of Adam (upgrade dollars) compensate (mostly, if my math is correct) for the lessened amounts received via saving the girls. Furthermore, the amounts of Adam provided if you play savior are well more than enough to purchase every worthwhile upgrade in the game (there are quite a few plasmids that are simply multiplied in strength with additional Adam, and it's mostly unnecessary). I'm sure many other reviews have gone into the allusions to Ayn Rand's philosophy, which are blantantly obvious thoughout the game, but let me state that this game does this highly effectively.However, the game isn't perfect; for one, I personally believe that much of the voice acting, which has widely been lauded by video game critics all over the internet, is at times far over-the-top and highly melodramatic (especially the yelling, screaming, and tone (when not yelling and screaming) of the splicers). Without diving into a commentary of each character, most of the main characters are voiced well (\"Fontaine\" is a bit excessive), and certainly better than the average sci-fi video game (most are hilarious). All things considered, it's good, but not \"great.\"Additionally, there was a great deal of hype regarding the aforementioned \"moral sophistication\" involved in this title; personally speaking, the only moral debate in the game that I noticed revolved around the little sisters, and for me, knowing that I would be rewarded for saving them, I simply didn't see the need to be their executioner. If the situation meant that they had to be executed in order to have any use of plasmids, then the choice would surely have been different and a true \"dilemma\" indeed.Finally, the game is simply too linear, especially if you use the \"quest arrow\" (which I strongly suggest that you turn off to make the game more interesting). At no time in this game, even with the arrow turned off, did I not know exactly where I needed to head and what to accomplish. While the world of Rapture is laid out well, and as it's enclosed (leading to the use of tunnels/walkways, etc.), this probably couldn't be avoided, I found that there simply wasn't enough of a \"discovery\" process of this world, and that it was simply laid out in front of me too often.Ultimately, however, the game does succeed, often fantastically, at sucking you into the world of \"Rapture,\" and this game is a must-own for any console/gaming PC owner, without \"debate.\" I am currently on my second go-round, having played it through the first time with the framerate locked (it really does make for a different feel altogether), and it's even more fun this time due, again, to being able to be drawn deeper into the game as a result of changing this one setting (thank God they included it; hopefully future games will follow suit). In any event, if you haven't played this game yet, you simply need to pick it up now. Here's to \"Bioshock 2: Sea of Dreams\" being less linear, having a v-synced framerate of 60 fps (though this probably won't happen as the game will need to be created to run smoothly on the PS3 (which has half the polygon capability, if you weren't aware)), and slightly more challenging to boot (we don't need the \"quest arrow\").","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2008"}

Edwards!","summary":"Phat Lewtz","reviewText":"Borderlands has so far proved to be an immensely enjoyable game delivering in many ways where Gearbox promised.  I feel it will be equally appealing to fans of shooters and dungeon crawlers alike.You start the game going through a little story intro and a bit of a bus ride.  Shortly after a bit of introduction you'll be asked to select one of the characters and exit the bus to start your adventures.  The game doesn't come right out and tell you these are your \"classes\" but for the interests of the RPG elements of the game that's what they are.  Your choices are basically between stealth/special weapons, sniper, support/healing, and tank/melee.  There unfortunately isn't a vast amount of customization in their looks available but you can alter a 3 color scheme for their outfit and customize your name almost immediately after stepping off the bus.From here you do a short and sweet tutorial which throws you right in to the action relatively quickly.  The controls are tight and will be very familiar to fans of popular FPS games such as Halo, Resistance, Gears, Unreal, and many others.  You have the ability to jump, duck, melee, shoot, toss grenades, and eventually use a class specific special ability such as placing turrets.  Aside from the general control of your character menus are easy to navigate for all of your weapons, the map is easy to read, and the HUD is simple and informative.Following the tutorial you progress the game from doing various quests.  These quests can be found on mission boards, from NPCs, and occasionally from random stuff lying around.  The quests themselves so far haven't been anything particularly noteworthy in the grand scheme of RPGs.  It's still a lot of \"kill XYZ\" \"collect a fistful of whozawhatits\" or \"go talk to random NPC\" but they have streamlined them enough to where the don't feel forced but rather serve as more of a beacon of where you should realistically be taking your character and scoring some nice exp and loot while you're at it.  Quest objectives can also be tracked and objectives are clearly marked on your compass.Outside of questing there are a decent number of monsters to kill.  I still don't really have much of an idea as to what dictates when an enemy will respawn but it seems if you wander around enough you will likely run in to something to kill.  It's typically not a mindless slaughter either, I would highly recommend trying fighting tactically much like you would in a shooter.  Until you out-gear or out-level your opponent you will find that the game can actually be quite challenging at times and reward clever use of your equipment and abilities.  The game did a great job of encouraging this too by making your enemies respond to grenades logically, implementing cover well, and of course rewarding you with devastating critical with our beloved' HEAD SHOT!Sizable amounts of experience can also be earned through completing various challenges which are like in game achievements, some of which are actually tied to achievements/trophies.  It's mostly killing various things with various weapons but early on it's a great source of experience and you can track your progress on them.Starting at level 5 you will start to acquire skill points every level.  These are used to boost various abilities of your character via a talent/skill tree.  There aren't a lot of choices and you can get quite a few of them with the number of points you wind up with but most of them are fundamentally decent options allowing for some individual diversity in how you build your character without having to over-think it.  Aside from that each level your character will get a generic health, defense, and attack boost.The weapons are pretty cool but I will state that some of the \"87 Gazillion\" claims were perhaps a bit exaggerated.  While it is true that many of the weapons can do quite a bit of unique things, the vast majority of the weapons and gear you will find are going to be slight variations of each other much like any other similar dungeon crawler such as Sacred, Titan Quest, or Diablo.  Perhaps later in the game the unique generation of weapons becomes more apparent but I could so far fairly compare this to the way the weapons were in Hellgate: London.  As for the size of the actual database and possible combination of weapons, I'm sure their claims are accurate but I can only comment from a practical standpoint of what I've seen.  In addition to weapons you also get shields which can do various things such as regen health or do elemental bursts when depleted and grenade modifications which allow your grenades to do all kinds of things such as teleport, stick to things, and bounce.Looting is probably one of my few mild gripes with this game.  You can't simply auto-loot everything in your proximity.  What the game has you doing is finding in item, hitting the loot button, and then holding it to pick up other relatively close items.  It's not game breaking annoying but the range on it isn't very great and holding the loot button to pick up a weapon will auto-equip it which is something that can be frustrating at times.The graphics will most likely be a love/hate thing for most players as they are highly stylized.  I personally love them and think they're quite well done but there are certainly realism junkies out there that won't care for the cartoon approach at all.  I will say that only decent videos of this game should be used to judge the graphics, still screenshots don't do this game any justice at all.  Graphics aside the environments are very interesting, the characters are well done albeit a bit generic, enemies are pretty decent (Tremors anybody?), and the animations are high quality.Multiplayer can be done with 2 player split screen couch co-op and online with up to four players I believe.  I haven't gone online yet but the split screen was easy enough.  Rather than scaling all of the menus down in split screen they opted to leave them full size and movable so that text wouldn't get smushed together which I thought was a pretty clever move.  What this means is both players don't have to squint to read everything thing, simply centralize it in their field of view.  Also as you do quests objectives/turn-ins will be shared meaning you don't spend your time waiting for everyone to catch up all the time.  In multiplayer you can also duel each other which I haven't tried yet.Vehicles haven't really been much more than a way to get around for me yet.  They can be customized in color and weapon outfit but my brother and I both agreed that they weren't a very good way of killing anything aside from running them over which seemed to always been an automatic kill.  For a giant vehicle mounted weapon they seem completely inferior to even the worst weapon you could collect at that relative level.  The controls are very similar (identical?) to that of a Warthog in Halo.  They'll probably take some getting used to for new players but they're relatively easy once you've figured them out.  I personally find them to be a bit floaty and awkward but at the moment I don't see myself needing clutch control out of the vehicles for combat so they are passable.The story regards something involving finding a long lost vault of alien technology.  While I'm sure it's interesting I honestly haven't paid much attention to it aside from parts of the story which I couldn't avoid.  This sort of game doesn't really bank on the story for me.That's basically it.  Quest, kill, loot, level, and become the destructive juggernaut that Pandora always needed while searching for the vault.Pros:Great implementation of shooter mechanicsLots of fun lootGood multiplayerStraight forward and simple RPG elementsGraphicsCons:GraphicsWonky loot controlsMaybe a little clich&eacute; at timesI love this game and would highly recommend it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2009"}

Broken down into five distinct open-world gameplay areas, linked on the game map, cumulatively these areas comprise a massive area, much larger than anything ever seen in previousMidnight Clubreleases and possibly larger than any existing racer to date. Within these areas, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Hollywood, Mulholland Drive and Downtown LA, players are free to engage in mission play driving them to attain and customize a wide range of authentic world-class street racing vehicles, or to simply explore the city, taking on all comers in a variety of race types as they wish. Regardless, along the way they will experience not only the visual realism of the iconic boulevards, freeways, and landmarks made famous in TV and movies, but also the realism of the living breathing LA urban experience. Here traffic backs up then clears as people go to and leave work for the day, weather systems come and go and day turns to night, then back again. All the while the race goes on. It's all part of the living, breathing LA. It's all part of theMidnight Club.The CarsMidnight Club: Los Angeleswill feature an astounding selection of vehicles in the Muscle Car, Exotics, Tuners, Motorcycle and Luxury car categories. At the time of publishing only a fraction of the total list has been announced, but a good sampling of what players can expect at launch can be seen below.

The hottest licensed cars and bikes in the world are at your disposal - kit them out, supe them up, and personalize them down to the last detail to make them all your own. Visitthe Club'sin-game garages located in Hollywood and Santa Monica and let your imagination run wild - tweaking and fine tuning through the following three different types of vehicle modifications:Performance &amp; Handling- To become a street legend, you're going to have to tune your vehicle for maximum performance. The garage offers three levels of upgrades for virtually every component on your vehicle, but it's up to you to craft the winning combination that will give you the edge on the competition.Exterior- For the Midnight Club, stunting is a habit and its clandestine Los Angeles garages have all the toys needed to ensure heads turn in this jaded town. From making sure your car is dripping in candy paint, to adding unique body kits and jaw dropping extras, the garage offers practically limitless possibilities to personalize your vehicle with aftermarket accessories and customizable options.Interior- Don't embarrass yourself by pulling up with an outrageously kitted-up car that has a 'me-too' factory interior. Not a good look! You're going to be spending a lot of time behind the wheel, so renovate and make yourself feel comfortable.Beware or Befriend the Local CompetitionThe street racing scene ofMidnight Clubis tough, but tight, meaning that everyone that you meet in expansiveLos Angelescould just as easily be an ally as an enemy. One thing is for certain though, they are all willing to throw down at the drop of a hat. Just a few of the faces you'll encounter out on the streets are:Karol, Age 45- A veteran of Moscow's underground street racing circuit, Karol moved to LA in the 1990's after the collapse of the Soviet Union. If you're looking for cars, he's your man. He owns two successful garages and claims to be able to get hold of any vehicle, no questions asked. He also sees himself as a philosopher and will bend your ear if you left him. He mostly races around Hollywood and the Beaches and his rides include a 1975 Datsun 280Z, 1969 Boss Mustang 302, 2006 Dodge Challenger and a 1971 Lamborghini Miura SV.Annie, Age 31- Annie has a rep as one of the fiercest drivers in the city. She detests posers and wannabes, is intelligent and sharp-tongued and pulls no punches when it comes to cutting the competition down to size. She has been spotted in everything from a 1983 VW Golf GTI, 2006 Pontiac Solstice, 2008 Chrysler 300C SRT-8, 2008 Audi RS4 and a 2004 Ford Shelby Cobra Concept and can usually be found hanging out near Pink's Hotdog Stand in Hollywood along with her crew.Rockstar Games Social Club: Join the CommunityBeing a Rockstar gameMidnight Club: Los Angelescomes with a huge commitment to the gaming community.

The amount of detail is astounding.  Controls are on point for an arcade racer.  My biggest gripe, a huge one may I add, is level of difficulty.  When you are racing, you have to be  very careful about how you drive.  You must be aware of obstacles or they will put in a unrecoverable situation.  I can't tell you how many times I was in 1st, about to finish the race, only to hit something and go from worst to first with no chance to ever recover.  It's enough to make you lauch the controller at your screen.  Another situation that is near impossible to escape is the police chases.  Do yourself a favor:  If the police start to chase you, just pull over and either take the ticket or let them take you to jail.  You'll save time and a lot of money.  The longer you attempt to escape, the lighter your pockets will be.  Out of the dozen times I attempted to escape, I may have made 2 clean gettaways.  For some reason,, I still like the game.

I was ready to be done with the Madden franchise after last year, but chose to give it one more run. Honestly, I am doing it solely for the GM mode, to see if I get ANY rush at all from the game. Since I have only had it a few hours, I guess I can only say that it is okay. $60 worth of okay? Only if you have money to burn.Perhaps Madden should do like many PC games and simply offer updates each year that you can download for a SIGNIFICANTLY LESS amount instead of having to shell out the money for the whole 'sh-bang' if you will. I think I may be officially done after this edition.Madden used to be THE sports game event of the year. Now...it just never seems to live up to our expectations. Maybe we just have them set too high.***24 Hours Later*** Update.So, this will probably bring the \"boo birds\" out like Philly fans on Santa, but I am actually starting to REALLY have fun with this game. As a fan of games like Roller Coaster Tycoon and Sim City, I enjoy \"management\" style games. Being the owner of the Seahawks is not something that is likely to ever happen to me...no matter how high the lottery climbs (unless one of my Zombie novels becomes a movie or TV series, but that is another story), but to wield my financial wand over my franchise is something that I personally enjoy.And for all of these folks who are just so full of hatred and anger, I say simply, stop buying it. It is a choice. I did not actually pull the trigger on the purchase until two days prior. And I was hesitant to like the game, but I won't apologize for doing so. If you want REALISM, get off your behinds and call some friends, hit a nearby park, and play the game yourself.

{"product_name":"B002I08RA0","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Frantz 2.0","summary":"Assassin's Creed Revelations","reviewText":"As the final installment of Ezio's story this game fell short of what the last two games offered. I blame this on the once again inclusion of Multiplayer into a game that is part of a series whose roots lie in Single Player and story telling. This is my least favorite entry in the series.This game is set during the events of Ezio's latter years. Ezio is getting old, and the developers did a good job of showing it. He's not as quick, walks with a limp, struggles to climb, etc. That brought some realism into the game.We also get to play a little as Altair from the first game, though more focus is on Ezio.The setting in this game kind of turned me off. It is set in Constantinople. The area here is very dirty. We saw beautiful, clean landscapes and cities in AC2 and Brotherhood. I enjoyed that. This game made me feel dirty while I played and I longed for a shower after each session.Everything stayed pretty much the same from the last two games, with little changes here and there. We got the Hookblade, which to me felt like a gimmick and was completely unnecessary. The story, which for me is what makes this series so great, is lacking in this game. It felt rushed. Like something was missing or the developers didn't really care where this games story went. Very disappointing for a AC fan.One thing I have to say is they did a good job on ending this part of Ezio's story. There is a Downloadable short film (I cant remember the name) which goes on to show how Ezio lived the rest of his days. It brings good closure to the story, which made up for the lack of story development in this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2012"}

The feel of the game is distinctly AC, no new surprises there, but there is very little in the way of hidden lore, unlocking maps or more conspiracy theory -- it is the \"straightest\" story told in the AC franchise to date in that there aren't many distractions or twists and turns, it is just a straight forward shot to get all the keys and open the big vault door.Once you do you get a bit more clarity into the grander/overarching AC story that you got hinted towards at the end of AC2 and Brotherhood (hint: Minerva) which is why this is required playing for any AC fan, but unlike the others in the franchise you'll miss the extra meaty chunks of story that were typically delivered along the way in other ACs.Multiplayer is all back exactly as it was in Brotherhood although I didn't spend much time with it (does anyone buy AC for the multiplayer?)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2012"}

Alone, or with a friend, you could tackle giant rats, undead monsters, dark elves, and even a white dragon, as you uncovered a plot against the good city of Baldur's Gate. But the ending indicated there was more adventure to come. Fans were worried that the sequel wouldn't live up to original's promise when the original design team jumped ship to work on Sony'sChampions of Norrath: Realms of EverQuest. They need not have worried;Dark Alliance 2is a worthy successor, retaining the weapons, monsters, Dungeons and Dragons action and rules, sharp graphics, responsive controls, and high adventure of its predecessor.The plot is a bit darker this time, but you're given a wider range of character classes to help face the elevated threats. There's the mighty barbarian, a dwarf rogue, a cleric, the monk (a martial artist), and a necromancer. The quest is huge and there are character-class specific side quests you can embark on--an extra incentive to play again as a different character. The level design tends to be a little too maze-like, and there's lots of boring backtracking, but the annoying jumping puzzles from the first game are gone.The biggest problem withDark Alliance 2is that it doesn't measure up to the competition. It's a 2-player game, whileDungeons & Dragons Heroes(on the Xbox) andChampions of Norrath(on the PS2 and Xbox) allow four-player play.

This game lacks any real boss fights, that made the 1st one so good and enjoyable.  There're bosses in this game, but few and far between and seem alot easier to kill, making them feel just like fillers to hold in the action fanitics.  Next is the games length.  The 1st one was around 18-20hrs, for part 2 its more around 10-12hrs, whitch is good or bad thing...just depends on how you look at it.

It is tremendous fun for a lot of reasons. There are a handful of flaws, but the goods outweigh the bads overwhelmingly.First off, the animation is fantastic. The first time you see the T-Rex coming after you, you'll stand and watch in amazement before you realize that you should be running your butt off because you're about to get eaten... and I did.Not to mention the first time you see Kong emerge from the trees and rip Anne Darrow from the vine pedastal. Awesome! And as you run after him... chasing him through the jungle and see him off in the distance moving through the trees and there's no way you can catch him... cool.There are numerous times in this game when you'll jump because the attacks are realistic, fast and ferocious. Another great thing about King Kong is the life meter... there is none. I like this. You don't have life packs or health kits... you have to be smart and run... or find a cave that the T-Rex can't get into or a rock formation.  As you get bitten or hit... you'll feel it in your remote... the music will change... you'll realize you're dieing and better fight to wield off your attacker, run or accept your fate.The bads... the dialogue or the storyline is different than the movie and it is very straight-forward and somewhat corny. Also, Anne Darrow aka Naomi Watts is WAY TOO BRAVE!! Here you are running along thinking you're supposed to be protecting her and she is running ahead of you... yelling 'come on' and running head long into a bed of monsters unarmed... then expecting you to save her... frickin' women.Finally, I've only controlled Kong once... I'm still in the middle of playing... but although the controls are cool... you can beat your chest and let out a roar, swing... swat... rip... catch and bite the heads off of bats... you can do everything you possibly want to... which is awesome! But, the game sort of had a path that Kong HAD TO GO IN... because that was the way it was written... so I kept getting stuck because it looked like I could swing or jump somewhere, but I was supposed to go somewhere else.Otherwise! This game is tremendous fun! I can't wait until I get to New York City and see what happens there!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2005"}

WOW! This game looks incredible. Every detail is painstakingly thought out; from the blades of grass to the bricks on the building, the way this game looks totally immerses you. Crank the sound up and it's like you're there.- Sound: Stunning surround sound via Dolby Digital. Sit tight, and you'll hear the enemy approaching with pinpoint accuracy. Great music/score too; fits perfectly with the game. Music intensifies as the mission progresses... perfect.- Gameplay: Perfect. This gameplay should be a model for every first person shooter. Single player game is far too short, but the online modes more than make up for this.- Weapon Selection: lots of choices from a variety of firearm categories. It's all here.- Online Layout/Concept: tons of game styles, and an excellent point/reward system. It's simple and easy to use. The points system gets you hooked fast, as your performance get you perks, such as new weapons or \"power ups\" such as improved bullet damage or invisibility on the radar. Overall, this online mode rivals Resistance: Fall of Man as the best on PS3.The Bad:- Online Mode connection issues. First I'll note that typically my online connection is great. Resistance: Fall of Man works perfectly. Call of Duty on the other hand... sometimes it takes 10 minutes to connect to a game. It's seems the Free-for-All mode takes the longest. You try connect, wait a few minutes, nothing... then exit and try again. It's very frustrating!!! Whatever system they're using for the online mode doesn't work so well. If it wasn't for this problem and the short single player mode, the game would be a perfect 10 in my book.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002MED6EO","description":"Midnight Club: Hits PS3","reviewerName":"Sigmund Freud","summary":"Challenging arcade racer with a ton of content","reviewText":"This game is closest to in terms of content is burnout paradise. Its filled with endless amount of races, every time you finish one you'll most likely get a phone call telling you there's a new race available. So you'll never have anything not to do because there not all races some of the are delivery, payback which you smash up a rivals car which might I add usually takes forever, but they're varied enough. Now how the game looks, its pretty amazing what they did the world is a living breathing L.A and all very detailed even the npc cars have enough detail to warrant just stopping to take look at their detailed car models. Soundtrack is pretty ok a couple good songs I've added to the playlist but thankfully it has custom soundtrack so its always nice to have an option to play your own music.The difficulty in this game is insane, everything you heard about this game being difficult is true. Stay away from this game if you get easily frustrated you'll cuss this game more then any other game in your collection unless you have ninja gaiden games then forget it. AI drivers in this game is brutal they'll always beat you off the starting line unless your playing it on the easiest difficulty which this will probably wont happen. There are difficulty levels but you can't beat the game just doing the easiest races sometimes you'll have to do a hard or very hard race to continue. There is a auto-difficulty adjustment, basically whenever you lose a race the game gets easier, whenever you win it gets harder.This is fine mechanic but its silly and how you'll most likely intent on loosing a race on purpose just to make it easy. Its not like you lose cash or reputation or your car unless its a pink slip race then you'll probably reset the console in frustration. So what it ends up to is the game forces you to drive perfectly without hitting anything but hitting traffic is something that will happen to you constantly if your rushing to get the lead, as hitting traffic will slow you down completely while spinning car the other way.This game in general is great, but the difficulty is whats going to turn people. I'd recommend renting it and trying out if it fits your need for a arcade racer I'd say this is one of the best just don't expect an easy one though. P.S the reward for beating the story is well worth it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2010"}
{"product_name":"B007V9QKH0","description":"","reviewerName":"Thomas Riccardi","summary":"Back to basics beat-em up!","reviewText":"Back in the glory days of the arcades the 2D beat `em up was king. From the gritty streets of Final Fight to the fantasy world of Dungeons and Dragons these games made you spend more that your weeks allowance trying to beat them. Atlus has been bringing award winning games to America and one of the latest ones seems to be a hit called Dragon's Crown. But is this a quest that you will want to undertake or should you just stay at the inn?Dragon's Crown takes place in the kingdom of Hydeland which is a fantasy realm full of monsters , magic and treasure for those bold enough to quest for it. There are a group of magic users that are questing for a very powerful artifact known only as the Dragon's Crown. If they get their hands on this crown they are going to use it for their own sinister purposes. It is up to you to go after them not only to foil their plot but to gain treasure for your very own.The gameplay of this game is similar to the old beat-em ups that you would encounter in the arcades. You can pick one of six characters to start your quest and they range from the Sorceress (magic abilities and turning enemies into frogs), Amazon (hearty female warrior that can dish out lots of damage), Elf (skilled with a bow and arrow), Dwarf (fearsome warrior that can pick up and throw enemies), Fighter (tank of the group clad in plate armor) and Wizard (has a litany of magic spells to choose from).Each of the dungeons has quests that you can complete and with the completion of each quest gives you money , gold and skill points but also unlocks some breathtaking art that was used for the game as well. As you kill monsters and complete quests your character levels up and that unlocks new skills and attacks that you can use against your foes.One of the biggest points about this game is how gorgeous it looks making the previous mentioned beat `em ups look as if they were run on a NES. Gorgeous painted graphics fill the screen as monsters lumber forward and attack you as some will grab you with claws or even snap you up in their massive jaws!Dragon's Crown is available for the PS3 and Vita and I am a big fan of beat `em ups and I want to play this game over and over.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2013"}
