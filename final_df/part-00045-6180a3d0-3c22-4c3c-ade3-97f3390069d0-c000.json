Here's my review-Graphics-The one thing I wasn't too crazy about in this game was the graphics. They're not bad by any means, in fact, the wrestlers move fast and fluid with lots of animation. However, during the entrances is the ugliest part of the game. I realize this game came out in 2001, but wow, the entrances didn't show a &#34;next gen leap&#34; at all. Square heads, flat faces, boxy hands and such rear it's ugly head.That's about as bad as the game looks (cutscenes and entrances), however, once you get into the ring, the game is beautiful. The animation is really good. I particularly was fond of when you pulled off a reversal only to suplex or clothesline an opponent who'd sell a move really good. All of the moves have impact which is missing from the new WWE games. A suplex looks like it really hurts, clotheslines or bodyslams look equally painful. Basically, any move in the game looks fantastic and the wrestlers actually look good in the ring with no slowdown.Sound-There's something I actually like about the annoying commentary found in this game. Michael Cole and Tazz's commentary are really brutal. I wonder why being that past games ike WWF warzone or WWF attitude actually had stellar commentary.The commentary sounds like every phrase is telegraphed in the sense of &#34;Perry...Saturn...is (insert)&#34;. It doesn't sound natural at all.The music is appropriate and I liked some of the theme songs like Dean Malenko's James Bond inspired song.The slams and such sound nice. There's no grunts that I hear and the weapons had dull thuds.Gameplay-First off, the one thing I hate about the control is that it doesn't support analog control. To some this is minor, but I feel a wrestling game should always support analog control.Anyway, the control is about the same as the previous smackdown being that square is reverse, triangle is run, X is to punch or kick and O is to grapple. The other buttons aren't really needed until you find yourself in a match featuring more than 2 wrestlers.I really like how smooth the control scheme is in this game and wish they still used this for modern games. The control is super responsive.The game's roster is the only gripe I had. It features- Perry Saturn, Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko, Test, Albert, Dudley Boys, Edge, Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit, Triple H, Undertaker, Kane, Big Show, Raven, The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Rikishi and such.I'm surprised this game didn't feature a better roster being that there were a good amount of wrestlers around then and this was around the invasion angle's beginning. (SDSYM has a better roster)The CAW mode really stinks to be honest. I couldn't even pick a wrestler's theme song and the options are limited.I really don't have much to say bad about the game, but it is a good game featuring a decent roster of wrestlers and some cool perks. Some things worth noting would be that it has an excellent TLC match, you can fight in the crowd...but I felt the wrestlers got up too fast. Even after hitting them with a finisher, they'd get back up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2013"}

Square Enix and Jupiter team up once again to showcaseThe World Ends With You, a trendy and vibrant gaming experience developed exclusively for the Nintendo DS. Featuring an intuitive combat system and exciting multiplayer mode,The World Ends With Youis set to immerse gamers into the modern-day culture of Japan.StoryThe story begins as Neku Sakuraba, an unsociable 15-year-old boy, unexpectedly wakes up in the Shibuya shopping district of Tokyo, Japan. While trying to piece together his rude awakening, he receives a strange text message warning him that he will cease to exist unless he accomplishes a certain mission.

You start out the game as Neku (name cannot be altered) who is given a strange \"pin\" and in the beginning you cannot attack any enemies by yourself until you have a partner who happens to be Shiki.  Neku and Shiki are part of a \"game\" where they are given missions to complete otherwise they will be erased.Playing the game (Battle): The game is pretty much controlled by the stylus though moving around can be controlled by the d-pad. When you are fighting with Neku everything is controlled by the stylus (movement and attack).  When partnered up with Shiki, you can control Shiki's attacks with the d-pad (if you are a lefty the A, B, X, Y buttons will act similar to the d-pad).  You do not however control her movements, only her attacks.  Pins are your main source for attacks.  Each pin is used by the stylus and it differs for each one.  Make sure you understand how to use each Pin (there is a hint screen that will appear to help you understand how to use the Pin).  Once Shiki becomes your partner you have to fight on both screens as Shiki will be on the top and Neku will be on the bottom.  Also, once you obtain a specific \"Pin\" you will be able to perform special attacks called \"fuse\" where you will need to sync correctly with your partner in order to charge this up.  Shiki has the difficult task as you need to match the right card to activate the skill.  If you set Shiki on Auto the chance of getting the fuse is not high, though at the same time if you set on manual you might end of losing the battle if you are not paying attention to Neku (I advise most people to leave Shiki on either \"Auto\" of \"Auto after 3 sec\" unless you are pretty comfortable controlling both Neku and Shiki to charge up the fuse).Playing the game (ranking/leveling): This game has a ranking system where the amount of damage you inflicted on your enemies and the amount of time that you took will determine your rank for that battle and how much PP points you will be awarded after each battle.  Also, whether you take any damage, get 10+ consecutive hits will also factor into the PP points as well.  PP points is what you need to raise the ranking of your pins.  Ranking are from E, D, C, B, A, and * (* being the highest and you need to get both * ranking in time and damage to get this ranking, A + * will not get you a * ranking)  You also gain Exp Points but that depends on the enemy you face and has nothing to do with the type of rank you receive at the end of the battle.  In addition, you will get base PP Points and this number is determined by the level you set in your option screen (unlike conventional RPGs where you level up and cannot alter your current level you can change your current level and bring it down all the way to level 1).  Decreasing your level means more enemy drops such as Yen (currency of the game) and more PP Points, however the battles can be more difficult and you might find yourself getting the game over screen often (I played the game on low level and found the challenge and extra enemy drops to be more rewarding and besides once you figure out which Pins to use the game isn't that hard, of course the same can't be said of boss battles).Playing the game (food): Food is a vital part of the game to raise the stats of your characters.  Each character is allowed to have 24 bytes of food each day.  Each food will have the number of bytes listed and in order to digest the food you will need to fight battles equaling the number of bytes of the food.  Reminder that your limit for 24 bytes disappears the next day (real time) and you can start the process over again.Misc: The story starts off way too quick for anyone to follow, but it does unravel itself so you'll need to play to find out what's going on.  The graphics are very good for the system and I have to say the art is done very nicely.  Soundtrack is another great feature for this game as it features J-Pop and Rock music.  Also, the battles feel refreshing since you are fully in control of the battle unlike many traditional RPGs where you choose what you want to do.So far I have to say I am impressed with this game.  It has a very interesting battle system and it takes skill to control both characters at the same time.  Also, the game takes place in Japan so those unfamiliar with the culture will get to understand a bit of Japan.  Even though I've had good things to say about the game so far that doesn't mean the game is perfect, here are a few gripes for the game.The battle system takes time to learn especially when you are controlling both Neku and Shiki.  Controlling both at the same time can take a while getting used to and many might find this a bit annoying especially when you are dealing with a group of enemies.  Activating the fuse skill is even more annoying since you need to guess the right combo to obtain the right card.  This is especially annoying when your attention is on the top and Neku is getting pummeled.  Other than that the story and setting might turn some people off especially for those who are into fantasy RPGs (e.g, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Breath of Fire, Tales of Destiny, etc.)I personally thought the game was executed very well and it definitely warrants a purchase for those who are fans of RPG.  My score remains the same as before.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2008"}

Both are independent games, but when they're linked between two Game Boy Color consoles via the separately sold Game Link cable, players can share items, uncover story elements, and unlock hidden areas in each game.Using the Harp of Ages, Link must travel through time and space to save Nayru, the eponymous prophet inOracle of Ages, who's been kidnapped by the evil sorceress Veran. By learning new melodies to play on the harp, players will travel to the past and affect changes in the present to solve the game's varied puzzles.InOracle of Seasons, players help Link embark on a quest to recover the Essences of Nature. To do so, he must first find the Rod of Seasons, a magical item that lets Link transform the landscape into the season of his choice, helping him overcome obstacles and solve puzzles. Ricky the kangaroo, Moosh the winged bear, and Dimitri the dodongo accompany Link on this adventure.","reviewerName":"J. Sherman \"The Critic\"","summary":"In Tune and On Time","reviewText":"The following refers to the downloadable version of Zelda: Oracle of Ages available on Nintendo eShop for the 3DS/2DS system.The Oracle series has made my summer the shortest on record.  I jumped straight to Ages after beating Seasons, in chronological order (Though you can play both in any order).  This time around Link finds himself in the land of Labrynna, where he must rescue the singer Nayru from the sorceress Veran.  In terms of the look, feel and gameplay, this is basically \"Zelda: Blue Version\" with 2 key differences from \"Zelda Red\".To complete certain objectives, you use the Harp of Ages to travel 400 years in the past and interact with different landscapes and characters.  You can learn up to 3 tunes to travel from past to present and back again. The second key difference from Seasons is while the former is more straightforward, Ages is more of a thinking man's game with its cryptic puzzles and infuriating mini-games, both of which can be mastered with enough stubborn effort (and an unhealthy time investment).The game also provides exclusive items like the Switch Hook, which enables the player to change positions with an object or enemy, and the Seed Shooter, which fires ricocheting seeds at hard-to-reach targets; better suited for puzzles and minor foes than boss battles.  You're also reacquainted with the Magic Ring system, your mileage with which may vary.By entering a password provided by beating either game in the series, the second title picks up where the first leaves off.  The plot from one title carries on to the next, Princess Zelda makes a surprise appearance, and Ganon shows up as the true final boss.  Plus you acquire different secrets throughout your journey which you use in Seasons to unlock extra content, whereas in Ages you just get a wooden sword and 4 hearts right off the bat.As to which of the two the player may recommend over the other, that depends on his/her taste, though Zelda Blue is definitely more challenging.  But playing this and Zelda Red provides a richer experience--and the chance to catch all 151 rings.This game is rated E for Everyone.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2013"}

I'm past the hard-cord crowd, by a few years, looking through some of the older fare in an attempt to see what good has come before.  I love the RPG genre, and as someone with absolutely no interest whatsoever in the MMO craze, I'm always eager for a good single-player RPG.  Sadly, Morrowind did not fulfill my interest.I think, most importantly, I would've been better off going into it if I had known that the intent of the game is be as open-ended as possible.  As possible as it can manage, to the point that it's difficult to say if there was a plot (I didn't last long enough in the game to find out).This, in turn, is compounded by some of the minor in-game frustrations I encountered.  A big one being that it takes forever to do anything.  This, of course, is due in part to the fact that the world you are in is absolutely massive.  Unfortunately, it's also due to the fact that the avatar moves at a rather slow pace - even when running.  And unfortunately, the \"side-quests\" are usually more of the fetch-quest fare, that have no background or plot; just minimal, plodding progression.  I've played games where it took hours to do one task and was invigorated.  When it took me hours to get one thing done in this game, I just felt 3 hours older.It also doesn't help that combat itself tends to be a frustration.  You can equip yourself with a weapon and literally sit there clicking the mouse like crazy trying to hit whatever is attacking you and there seems to be complete randomization as to whether or not you actually hit or miss - though miss greatly tends to outweigh to hit and up the frustration factor.  In general, I love real-time battle so much more than turn-based...but even real-time battle needs rules.  This game feels like its creators were too lazy to think up any.A personal, aesthetic criticism is that I'm not a fan of the first-person perspective.  True, you can play through the game third-person, but it becomes almost impossible to see your attackers in combat and so is practically useless to do so.The environment, of course, is fantastic.  The graphics aren't the prettiest, in my opinion, but they do rather fit the atmosphere of the game in an odd way.  There's a rather dour feeling to the whole experience, and everything from the absolutely outstanding soundtrack to the incredible in-game design, and the 360 degree sound alone is almost engaging enough to keep interest in the game despite its lack of immediate story presentation.Where this game really excels is the customization.  I think that and the extreme non-linear aspects are what would greatly appeal to a particular crowd of RPG fans.  There's so many different ways to alter your character - both in the initial creation, but also significantly over the course of the game.  If you run and swim enough, your athletics will increase; if you use combat more than magic, you'll become more proficient at melee combat, etc.  It really is geared toward ultimately creating a unique character that fits your style.Unfortunately, it just couldn't keep my interest.  Over 20 hours into the game, I had made little progress, and encountered not even a hint of there being a plot.  And so I just rather stopped caring and gave up.  I love side-quests as much as the next RPG fan, but I find myself more interested in the overall process if there's a bit more linearity or structure - even a side-story to add to the overall experience would've been something.This was my first foray into the Elder Scrolls saga - I have yet to try Oblivion - but it does rather dampen my interest.  I respect and understand that customization and non-linearity will appeal to some RPG fans; but for me, personally, I like there to be a little more meat on the bones.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2009"}

I really do. I love being able to do whatever I want. The game has flaws. One major flaw is crashing. The game has just closed out 50 times. It happens a lot. The game just closes out. No big deal if I remember to save a ton.The game has open-ended stuff. You can steal anything. There are tons of things to look at. There are also alot of different subfields of things. Alchemy, Quests, and tons of land to explore. The game though feels a little lonely. Morrowind doesn't have a lot of people once you look at it all. There are mods though. There is one mod at morrowind summit which drops in people all over the place. The mod requires both expansions and another mod but works well. As for the quests, fun. There are quests where you go to dungeons but there are quests where you get to do other stuff. Still, a lot of the time you will be in vast lands by yourself.Graphics are great. The water looks fantastic and there are tons of different things you can pick up but they all have their own models. Although monsters sometimes walk like idiots, they are fine.Actually, the game does have one awesome feature that you won't find in alot of other games. A construction set lets you do whatever you want. There are thousands of mods and little features people have created already. Morrowind Summit has alot. I would reccomend the predator mod which just rocks, but is big.Overall this game is fine. The loneliness and everything else can be solved with mods. -Though it can be boring when you can't walk a while without being attacked by some stupid monster like a cliff racer.- The game has it's high points and lows. I would reccomend it though over the Xbox version as the mods are exclusive to pc. There is no multiplayer, but if there were it would probably cost money.

What is possibly even more annoying is the times I actually got through a team death match just to have the game crash before my XP and unlocks were saved. On the other hand it does seem that the criticism is finding its way back to EA who has promised to not move forward with any other project until these issues are fixed.How does the actual game stack up when it isn&#8217;t crashing? In a word...amazing! The graphics are extremely sharp and the environments are rich and gorgeous. Conquest mode is where it&#8217;s at. After not being able to connect 10 or so times (likely due to server crowding) I was finally able to jump in on several Conquest matches. The scope and scale of these matches is almost too epic.

{"product_name":"B001AWIP68","reviewerName":"Bill Covington \"Chalupacabra\"","summary":"Back to 1942","reviewText":"Last year I was playing COD4 like it was going out of style, and still am.  However my time playing it has been cut a bit due to the excellent offering by Treyarch.  A lot of people bagged the game before it came out due to the setting, WWII.  This may be a big deal to some, but not to me, and if you like FPS than it shouldn't matter to you either.The game, at it's core plays eeirly similar to Modern Combat.  The controls are the same, the engine is the same, and the leveling in multiplayer is the same (well almost).Now, with the obligatory Modern Combat reference, and the mentioning of the WWII setting out of the way I can give you some pros and cons.The Pros:Graphics: Absolutely beautiful.  Some of the best water and lighting I've seen.  Some people may dis agree, but I think it is stunning.Gameplay: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  The controls are responsive, and tight.Co-Op Campaign: Something COD4 did horribly wrong, 5 does right.  Up to four players killing Nazis!  For those of you without LIVE you'll be able to play two player co-op locally.Zombie Mode: Beat the campaign and you and up to three other friends will be put in a barn to fend of wave after wave of Nazi Zombies.  One of the best parts of the game.Death Cards: You'll find these scattered throughout the game.  It's not just simple find and collect them all, they each do something to alter gameplay.  Find the first card and you'll be rewarded with a \"Exploding Headshots\".  So instead of your standard headshot, watch the head explode like a freaking watermelon.Multiplayer: Now if you have LIVE, you're gonna love it.  There are some quirks which have been mentioned.  Namely spawn points.  However, it's not enough to detour you if you enjoy competition.  Leveling up (by gaining kills) is as addictive as it was last year.Now the Cons:Campaign: The length is the only problem.  The story is passable, but it goes by way to fast (unless you play on veteran, which is recommended).  You'll get through it in about 6-10 hours depending on your skill.Vehicle Levels: This is my own personal bias, but I hate vehicle levels in shooter.  All of them.  Whether it's Gears of War, COD4 or COD5, I just can't stand them.  I think they disrupt the game.  I didn't come here to drive a tank, I came here to shoot you in the legs with a shotgun.Enemies in the campaign: Just like COD4 the enemies never stop spawning unless you reach a certain point in the level, kind of a pain.  That, and on higher difficulties there is an insane amount of gernades being thrown which makes for some frustrating moments.That's really it.  It's a great shooter, not quite as good as COD4 but it's in the same league.  This game has gotten an unfair stigma just because of the setting.  In my opinion it's unwarranted.If you liked COD4 you'll like COD5.  If you like online multiplayer, you'll like COD5.  If you like killing zombies in a barn with friends, you'll like COD5.  If you don't like the aforementioned, or you want more of a single player expierence, this probably isn't for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2009"}

Well, the load times would be a great place to start. Just like in FF Chronicles, one of the games has great load times, and the other is plagued horribly. FF6 has the worst load times I have ever experienced, even worse than all other ps1 games which have BETTER graphics and contain just as much if not MORE information ( remember Wild Arms? That game was huge, AND it had better graphics than FF6, but it's load times were very, very short, almost unnoticcable, so what the heck!?). Every time you enter a battle you are greeted with 5 + seconds of looking at a black screen, sound fun to you? I didnt think so. Every time you enter the menu you are greeted with another 5+ seconds of load time. Sure, it's only 5 seconds, but once you experience it, you will feel how long five seconds CAN feel, especially when you are used to fast-paced games (the load times are much slower than the PS1 ff's)But on to the games themselves...Final Fantasy 6- Music- 5/5, Fun 0/5, Story 5/5 Gameplay 0/5, overall-1/5 This game is a masterpiece, the greatest RPG ever released on any system. However, given the poor load times, the fun value of this game is whiped out. Seriously, it's a chore to play it. If you have a SNES system i'd dish out 30 bucks for it if you can find it on Amazon or somewhere else. The SNES version has blazing fast load times, the graphics are better, and the whole experience is so much better. I think it is a terrible idea to release a masterpiece with flaws that whipe out any fun while playing the game. Basically, when you buy this you might as well save your time and throw the FF6 disk away, or sell it towards a SNES FF3 cartridge.Final Fantasy 5- Music 5/5 Story 5/5 Gameplay 5/5 Fun 4/5 Overall 5/5 Now this is why this game is worth the price. FF5 is without a doubt a masterpiece, and the version on FF Anthology is great. The load times are pretty fast, the sound is great, and it has the Job system very much like ff Tactics. The job system is a phenomenal idea, and FF5 executes it perfectly. Some hate this game, but I think 5 is easily just as good as 9. It isn't as good as 4, 6, 7, or 8, or heck even Tactics, but you have to realize that FF games are so good that even excellent isnt good enough, and this one is a masterpiece, like most the others. FF5 is much more difficult than any other FF game, even much harder than 4, and you will have to battle quite often for long periods of time, and sometime this can be discouraging if you aren't into battling for a while, but other than that it is a good game. It starts off pretty slow, but as you progress it gets much better, so dont lose interest right away, just wait it out and see if it gets better for you. (When i first got ff Anthology i didnt care a whole lot about 5, but when i got around to progressing through it I found it was a great game)Overall, This version of FF6 might as well not even have been issued, but it is definitely worth it for FF5, and 15-20 bucks is extremely cheap for these two games, just don't expect FF6 to be as fast as the FF3 you remember playing as a kid for Super Nintendo. (Still, I dont get it. Why does FF4 in Chronicles have blazing fast load times, but FF6 is plagued...).So anyway, I highly recommend buying this game, mainly for ff5.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00005BW7Q","reviewerName":"Ted Del Prato \"technodemon\"","summary":"A great RPG...but may require some patience at times","reviewText":"Xenosaga is Namco's prequel to Xenogears, an RPG released on the original PS1 a few years ago. What sets Xenosaga apart from most traditional RPGs is it's futuristic theme and deeply philosophical story. Non-playable cut-scenes are plentiful, though perhaps at times overwhelming in length (some scenes run almost an hour without any breaks). However, story is a vital component in any RPG, so sitting through them isn't much of a chore if one keeps that in mind. Gameplay-wise, Xenosaga borrows some of the best elements of today's classic RPGs. Battles play very similar to how one might expect with standard attacks, magic, ect. Mech-type summons called A.G.W.S.s are an interesting addition as well (although not all that important in the later stages of the game). There is some conflict though...for such a linear game in terms of the path the player is forced to follow, the character and AGWS upgrade methods seem needlessly complex. It's seems there are different types of points to earn for every attribute, so it becomes easy to neglect upgrading certain aspects of your party if you're not careful. Another fault I feel needs to be addressed: Even though I know this was intended to be episode 1 of a long running series, the ending provides few answers to the storyline for the 60-70 hours of gameplay one must put in to finish it. Xenosaga is definitely an ambitious project, but those without much patience or experience regarding games of this type should probably consider a less complex RPG to start with. If complexity and a deep, meaningful storyline are what you're looking for however, by all means this is your game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2003"}

Schneider","summary":"Anothe underrated gem for this franchise","reviewText":"What an absolute masterpiece!!!  I'm a hardcore gamer.  I own every system you can think of, dating back to genesis and N.E.S.  I own over 100 360 games on disc, I have at least 65 LIVE arcade games, and a ton of DLC for the games I have.  That being said, this games stands out as another gem in my collection.  It falls between Sands of Time, and Warrior Within, chronologically.  It is also in the same lineage as the two thrones, but does not fit in to the original Prince of Persia game for 360, that one has a standalone story.  Although the first 360 entry was a very good game, with a great story of it's own, it can't hold a torch to this game.  This title is a throwback to the play style of the 3 PS2 era P.O.P. titles, and just like it's predecessors the controls are spot on.  The graphics are slightly underwhelming when compared to other titles it competes with in this era of games, but there aren't many games with such compelling fun game play.  For some reason, it hasn't had the critical acclaim that sands of time got, but I think that has to do with the fact that it's the 4th sequel in this story line, and the fifth of the P.O.P. games this decade.  So originality may not be it's strong point.  But if you are a fan of any Prince of Persia games, you'd be doing yourself a disservice to pass up this game, especially at a reduced price.  And if you haven't gotten a chance to play any prince of persia games, this is certainly a good place to start, unless you still play your PS2 or original X-box.  If that is the case, you should start with the sands of time.  Either way, this game is absolutely amazing, and I can't give it enough praise.  The only downfall is if you are new to video games, or a bit young.  The challenge isn't over the top by any means, some would even call this game easy, but it is very precise.  If you are not good at video games, you will not be good at this game.  Hope this review was helpful.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2010"}

Stathoulopoulos \"nick9155\"","summary":"Solid sequel","reviewText":"Overall, Nightfire is a solid sequel to Agent Under Fire.  If you liked that game, you'll like this outing, which has some improvements and a couple of cons.First off, the game is a little too short.  I wanted more missions, especially since some of them are vehicle missions that are generally pretty low on replay value.  The straight ahead fps missions, like infiltrating a castle and busting out, or shooting your way out of a skyscraper, are fun to replay.  You also get bonuses for getting higher scores.However, the game generally delivers solid shooter action.  It's not very difficult, though a couple of boards are tough, and admittedly, I didn't finish the game.The multiplayer is good as well, and features one of the best weapons I've seen in any fps game: a remote controlled rocket launcher with a camera.  You can literally fly rockets in first person pov around corners and chase people down.  A couple of complaints: the Q Claw, which was an awesome feature of Agent Under Fire, is practically useless in this game.  It doesn't attach to just anything, and it's slower.  A shame.  The multiplayer could also be a little tougher.  You have to tune up everyone's health and aggression in order to get a tough challenge.This game, like Agent Under Fire, captures the general spirit of the Bond films.  I usually don't really care too much about the story as long as there's a lot of shooting going on, but this one is pretty much like the movies (I think it was even written or conceived by the regular writer of the movies!)  The gadget bits are fun, too.  The EA shooters--Medal of Honor and the Bond games--resemble each other a lot and appear to be the same engine.  The Bond game mixes it up with gadgets and car chases, etc.This game would be amazing if it was rated M.  That wouldn't happen since the Bond franchise is violent but comic bookish and sanitized.  The game, especially with the remote controlled rocket, would benefit from blood and gore.Nevertheless, it's recommended if you liked Agent Under Fire.  It's too short and it's a bit easy, but the multiplayer mode if fun enough to play alone and some of the missions are good enough to replay as they're generally long.Also, using Maxwell Caulfield's voice for Bond?  Cripes.  Good thing the next game will manage to finally get Brosnan's face AND voice.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2003"}

{"product_name":"B000099T2G","reviewerName":"D.L. \"generasian\"","summary":"Fun, but short...","reviewText":"Rise to Honor seemed like a good idea.  And for the most part it is.  It flawlessly captures Jet Li's fast and flurrious fighting style, but a little more effort could have been put into the game's storyline which only serves as a backdrop to string together a series of fighting levels.  The game plays like a movie from the opening titles and credits and smoothly integrates the action from cut scenes using the in-game graphics engine. Jet Li's likeness is dead on and the other character models are also impressively rendered.  The environments are a mixed bag since they don't really offer much in terms of variety.  The buildings all look the same and the detail is so-so.  But the core of the game is the fighting.  Rather than assigning a punch or kick move to a button, the game has you utilize the right analog stick to unleash a series of combos.  By continously tapping the stick towards a bad guy, Jet Li will subdue him through a flurry of kicks and punches.  Some of these sequences are cool to watch because the action will slow down to allow you a close up of the finishing blow.  You can also utilize the environment by flinging chairs or throwing garbage cans at your opponent(s).  Yet, the action can be frustrating when surrounded by mutliple baddies since they tend to crowd around you.  This makes it harder to pull off the combos without getting nailed, because a reasonable amount of space is needed between you and the bad guys in order to finish them off.  The gun fighting levels don't really work.  By pressing the R2 button and tapping the analog stick, you can release a barrage of gunfire at a bad guy.  But the setup is awkward and in most instances you'll miss badly unless your analog stick is pointed directly at a bad guy.  This is also true in the hand to hand combat levels.  The analog stick needs to be precisely pointed at a bad guy in order to nail him.  Otherwise, you'll be kicking at air.  This is more difficult than it seems, especially when surrounded where it is harder to judge where everybody is.  A welcomed addition is the lack of save points which could have disrupted the flow of the game.  Instead, the game automatically saves during the action as signified by a blinking red dragon at the bottom left hand corner of the screen.  The game also doesn't offer much in terms of challenge.  There are unlimited continues as well as weak bosses.  Overall, it should take an average gamer about 6-8 hours to complete.  In the end, Rise to Honor is a fun game that is full of action, but short on storyline, just like a Jet Li movie.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2004"}

It may not be as deep or even as difficult as some other RPG games but it more than makes up for this with personality, a huge fully realized world, and superb pacing --- especially if you add the DLC expansions and accept the various side missions as they are offered.As for the relative lack of difficulty, I must say that I don't really find RPGs to be particularly difficult as long as proper attention is paid to leveling up and obtaining good equipment. --- so this is pretty much in line with the genre.Overall, I think it's quite excellent or at least a huge step in the right direction from the first Fable --- more personalization options, a bit more depth, better and more interesting treasure, a lot more equipment choices, and smoother character movement, would be the first adjustments that I'd make towards making an even better Fable 3.

Sanford","summary":"If you loved Assassin's Creed 2, you'll like Assassin's Creed Brotherhood","reviewText":"No spoilers ahead.I *did* love AC2, and story-wise, it's helpful to play that game before ACB. I didn't play the first AC.There are definite improvements in ACB. As usual, you get a variety of weapons, armor upgrades, and costume variations. Combat and movement seem about the same (though there are times when your character doesn't quite go the way you want, resulting in falling after a difficult ascent, or getting mobbed in combat). Building up factions, esp the Assassin's Guild, is fun and advantageous. The graphics are at least as lush and detailed, and some great views can be had by climbing tall buildings and looking around.Some folks have complained about the lack of locations; almost all of the game play takes place in the city of Rome. No more traveling between cities. Really, though, the presentation of Rome is vast and varied enough to be interesting. There are crowded city streets, large open plazas, rural areas, and some water to cross/swim. The city also has enough shops scattered about to keep you well stocked. There are places to upgrade, and loot to gather. Like AC2, there are special levels to get the special armor, and another bunch of Subject 16 puzzles to solve. I found some of the puzzles to be a little too obtuse.The main problem with ACB is that there's a little too much of it. I admit that sound ridiculous, but the end of the game is a real slog to get through, and falls into that unfortunate trap of feeling like work. One of the final levels, leading to the big confrontation, feels sloppy, rushed, and thrown together. Worse, you can only choose to ACCEPT these missions. It's like the game is trying to force you through this mediocre chapter. There are lots of great missions and chapters, though, and plenty of optional ones related to factions.MULTIPLAYER: The on-line multiplayer is just like a game in highschool or college I've played, called ASSASSIN. Everyone in the game has a contract to \"kill\" someone, but no one knows who is coming after them, so it's a game of stalk and hide. It's a great idea for a video game. Sadly, it has two major flaws. The first, common in mp games, is there are way too many players who are ranked much higher than you, and have advantages. I understand the idea of leveling up and unlocking items/talents, but it's not fun to be a noob and constantly die. There are supposedly ranked matches, but I've never been able to join one. Secondly, the games are 10 minutes long, and you cannot enter mid-game, so there's a lot of sitting around waiting for a lobby, and there don't seem to be many lobbies. It's too bad, becauase it CAN be really fun.All in all it's a good game, but I think AC2 is better, and I've had enough of Assassin's Creed for a while. I don't think I'll pick up Revelations any time soon.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2011"}

She has thwarted their dastardly efforts before. She stopped them from amassing an army of Metroids and she kept Mother Brain from retrieving the last known Metroid larva. Now she must face the Space Pirates once again in an all-new adventure.","reviewerName":"SuperGamecube64","summary":"A Prime Example of a Gamecube Classic","reviewText":"On the Nintendo 64, many of our favorite series were brought to life in 3D for the first time. Super Mario 64 wowed us with fully explorable three-dimensional levels, complete with multiple challenges in each. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time stole our hearts as one of the grandest, and most cherished stories of all time. Pokemon brought our addictive and collecting tendencies onto the big screen. But where was Metroid? You see, Nintendo wanted to make a 3D Metroid game badly. Even Yoshio Sakamoto, the series co-founder was very itnerested, but Sakamoto couldn't figure out how the player would control Samus with the N64 controller. Eventually, Shigeru Miyamoto visited with a new development team in Texas called Retro Studios. Sure, they're made a few very good Nintendo games as of today, but this was back in 1998, when they were literally unheard of. As it turned out, Retro was on board.. Nintendo decided that wanted it to be for their next system to come, the Gamecube however. At that time it didn't even have the code name \"Dolphin\"! So, they got to work, and eventually had a game that played somewhat similar to Other M, but Miyamoto intervened, scrapped all their work and changed it to a \"First Person Adventure\". Furthermore, 4 different Gamecube games were canceled entirely in order to focus on Metroid Prime. Was it worth it?The Metroid Prime trilogy takes place between Metroid (or Zero Mission) and Metroid II: Return of Samus. Samus reveives a distress signal from a frigate called Orpheon, which also happens to be a space pirate ship. She arrives to discover that the crew has been slaughtered by their own genetically modified parasites. After destroying the parasite queen, a self destruct sequence initiates. On her way back to her own ship, a large electrical surge destroys most of her suit's capabilities (naturally). It is immediately after this, that she encounters Ridley, the space pirate leader she thought she had killed on Zebes. Ridley head towards a planet called Tallon VI, and so Samus gives chase. Upon landing, she finds that Orpheon has also crash landed on this planet. after a bit of exploration, she discovers that Chozo once inhabited this planet, but a meteorite crashed, contaminating the planet with a corrosive substance called Phazon and killing them off. Samus then sets off to take down the space pirates once more, but can she survive the Phazon herself?Metroid Prime has great graphics, and effects for its time, but they have not aged well. Rough textures, low detail on certain enemies and pixelation are pretty common when you look at things up close. Despite this, the game is extremely atmospheric, mostly thanks to the music and the effects. As the game is in first person, you are actually looking out of Samus' visor, and it serves as the HUD. When you walk through steam, the visor fogs up. When an enemies explodes near you, blood may splatter onto your visor (it's all blue, or green). My personal favorite effect is when there is an explosion underwater, and the flash allows you to see Samus' reflection in the visor. Even the gun effects are great. For example, if you fire an ice shot, frost develops on the outside of the gun. The music is very atmospheric, low key, and fitting.Samus is moved using only the control stick, and the C-stick is used for changing weapons. The D-pad is sued to change visors. You may be wondering how you can aim this way, but it is relatively simple. The R trigger locks onto enemies, and the A button is fire. Alternatively, you can hold down L to free aim, but you cannot move while doing this. If you feel this will be an issue for you, you should play this game on the Wii via New Play Control if you live in Asia, or via Metroid Prime Trilogy if you live elsewhere.Despite involving a gun, and being in first person perspective, Metroid Prime is not a first person shooter. Rather, it is what Nintendo describes as a first person adventure. Combat is not at the forefront of this title, but rather puzzle solving and exploration are the main gameplay elements. Exploration is especially important, and something you will be doing a lot of. Just be sure to check your map as often as possible, or you will quickly become lost on Talon IV.Metroid Prime is a great game, and a successful translation of a 2D series into 3D. Retro did an amazing job on their first game, and went on to create 2 sequels to Metroid Prime, 2 spin offs of it, Donkey Kong Country Returns, and Mario KArt 7. They are currently working on a Wii U title that is as yet un-named, but they have called it \"A project everyone wants us to do.\"Metroid Prime is a game that sucks you in, and doesn't let you go until you hit the power button. Over the last 9 years, I have created a total of 5 different game files on Metroid Prime. I only finished one of them, which was my most recent. You see, even though I continually gave up, got stuck, or became frustrated and quit, I always came back eventually until I finally completed this grand adventure. Is the game perfect? Not nearly, but is still a Gamecube icon. Did I mention that you can get this game at most used game stores for about $3? Yeah, I said $3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2012"}

Based on their recent games, all these so-called superspies could stand to take a few lessons from newcomer Sam Fisher. His name isn't important; the important thing is that his game,Splinter Cell, comes from Tom Clancy's game studio and offers up the kind of sophistication and control you'd expect from the studio that brought gamersRainbow Six. It's all about the details. When Sam enters a dark area, he's got two options, thermal and night vision. Thermal lets him see the body heat of an enemy soldier, even through walls and doors. Shoot through cover with a high-powered weapon, and you can watch as the heat fades from the body. Not dark yet? Shoot out the lights. Need a distraction? Pick up and toss a tin can.

It is also the only game in which you get to play both Kain and Raziel.I was really excited about this game at first, hearing they had revamped the combat system, about the only thing not great from the previous games.  The actual result was only really a slight improvement.They modeled it after Devil May Cry (A game near and dear to my heart), but its execution was not good.  There are more camera issues with this game than almost any I've played previously.  Too many times did I find the camera looking at the corner of a passageway while I'm busy fighting on the other side of it.  What little control over the camera you have is useless; instead of rotating around the point of interest (ie, your character) it rotates on its own position.  So instead of swinging around the corner so i can actually see Raziel, it looks in the other direction.The style in general worked well in Devil May Cry (though I recall less camera issues in that game), but that game had an emphasis on nearly equal melee & ranged combat.  When enemies were offscreen, you could at least shoot at them.  This game has some ranged capabilities (telekenesis or TK), its not something you can use too much of.I will admit though that using Kain's TK to throw enemies off a bridge, onto a spike, or just pull them closer was suprisingly fun.That said, when the camera was working correctly, battles were slightly more interesting and frenzied than in previous games, but they also became frustrating sometimes.  Also, the game's attempts at bosses (ghosts of previous pillar gaurdians) were extremely lame.Graphics-wise, the game is pretty good.  Kain and Raziel both look great, and little things like Kain's mist-form looked suprisingly good.  The lighting/shadowing was particularly well done.Plot wise, the game is good, but nowhere near the greatness of any of the previous games (except maybe Blood omen 2).  The pacing drags, and it seems a little forumlaic.  Also, while the voice acting is top-notch as usual for this series, the dialogue seemed to suffer a bit; it was a little over the top in some places (the lines and words themselves, not the acting).The game gets better near the end, and many people will probably prefer it than to the end of the Soul Reaver games.  This one leaves off with a definite \"To be continued...\" feel, but doesn't leave you with a Cliff-Hanger or with a feeling of unfulfilment.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2005"}

I've played many of the other Wii favorites: Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Wii Sports, New Super Mario Bros., etc., but Donkey Kong Country Returns is the best game on the Wii. It's a game that is simple in concept, simple in controls, and yet it offers challenges for both new gamers and hardcore ones. This is also, by far, the best platform game on Nintendo offers, even better than the New Super Mario Bros, which I really liked.One minor complaint about the game: too often, the game becomes a one-player game. I wish the developers had allowed for a way for two players to play on the cart/flying-barrel/Rambi levels. Instead, you're essentially playing this game while your friend has to just sit and watch you play those particular levels with nothing to do. To make matters even worse, if you die, you still lose 2 lives instead of 1, as if the other player had some sort of control over whether or not they lived or died.Really my only bigger frustration, and not enough to dock it any stars.

Sprigler","summary":"Longtime gamer (since pre-NES days)","reviewText":"I've owned just about all consoles (starting with the Magnavox Odyssey2) at some point.  I transitioned from Dreamcast to playstation and eventually bought a PS2 (pretty late)... and then bought an Xbox 360 (skipped original Xbox).  It wasn't until 6 months ago I got rid of my 360 and picked up a PS3 so I could play some of the PS3 exclusives I've missed out on over the years.  Much can be said about Microsoft's Xbox Live service and their ecosystem is fairly robust... but I will say moving to the less busy more gaming focused PS3 interface was refreshing in a way.Fast forward now to November 15th and here I am with a PS4 this time around.  Possibly an Xbox One is in my future but not for a few years at least.  I try to remain objective about these things as much as I can.  I saw what Microsoft was offering and in the end I just wanted a console that focused more on gaming than other services.  The multitasking Snap stuff on the Xbox One looks neat, but I can't figure out when I'd ever really want to use it... While I appreciate voice commands and some simple motion / facial recognition stuff I also wasn't thrilled with how much the Xbox One was making Kinect part of the experience.So I ended up with a PS4 and I did pick up the PS Camera as well.  I've been very happy with my experience and despite a mild interruption with the PSN service friday during the launch rush of everyone connecting at once I've not had a single problem with the console.  I do own a Vita and being able to do remote play on the Vita has been awesome and has let me keep playing Super Motherload when my wife's show comes on TV.  The indie game support has been awesome for the PS4 and I'm really looking forward to more.  As far as the major retail releases go from what I've played (Knack and Killzone) the games look great and play great.  I'm not a huge FPS fan, but Killzone seems to play really well and offers some cool gameplay features with the zipline and OWL features.  Knack is very approachable and offers a fun platformer for those of us growing a little tired of Mario games.My wife is a Just Dance fan and she has played the first 3 games on the Wii, Just Dance 4 on the Wii U, and now Just Dance 2014 on the PS4.  She likes using the Move controller versus just using the Camera alone for motion tracking as it reminds her of the Wii versions.  She told me she enjoyed the new version a lot more than she thought she would (they added some stuff back that they took out of previous versions that she liked).  She's not a huge gamer and just wants stuff to work.  The PS4 loading time to get into the game is a lot faster than Just Dance on the Wii U which is a big deal for her as she hates waiting for games to load.  She also likes how easy it is to get logged into the system with the camera as it just finds her face and see the controller and she's ready to go.  The voice commands work well for logging in and starting the games as well and she's used that a lot as well to get Just Dance up and going.Anyway... there is a lot to enjoy on the PS4 and from what I've seen coming down the pipeline there is a whole lot more coming.  I don't think anyone who enjoys games and doesn't care as much about other services would be unhappy with the PS4.  I wholeheartedly recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2013"}

Power ups are located in various places but if you make a wrong turn it's a huge cut scene and you're on to the next part of the game.I will say that it was fun to play though, I seriously couldn't put it down but it's very basic button mashing, combos and force powers.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2011"}

The first person shooting is top notch. There's a variety of weapons that each (except for the sniper rifle and final BFG) have different ammo types. You can also build weapons and health perks using parts you find or buy in game.  Confusingly, you are asked to select a class early on without knowing how helpful each one is; and there is no way to change later.  Enemy AI is pretty good, taking cover for ranged attacks or flanking and climbing up walls for melee attacks.  Gameplay is very VERY linear. Graphics are good, but there are some issues with lighting where a particular color washes out an entire area for a few moments.The racing aspect of the game is pretty confusing. For the most part, you do not have to complete races to progress the main story of the game. Racing is divided on a couple of tracks with time-trial, non-combat, and combat racing. The \"combat\" aspect of the races is not very satisfying and winning a combat race is more a matter of luck than skill. This part of the game adds very little to the overall package, it's the weakest part in terms of gameplay and graphics, and even if you only play the racing part as little as possible you'll still have to drive around to start your FPS missions.The minigames were a little bit more thought out. There are 4 kinds: one was a dice game totally based on luck. One is a \"strumming\" game that is identical to Simmon. Then there's the collector card game. I found this one strangely compelling. You build a deck and then play against the opponent's deck - a little similar to Magic the Gathering, but much simpler. Even though this game has little strategy after building the deck I still found myself playing the heck out of it. Finally there's a five-finger-filet, (the thing with the knife Bishop does in Aliens). It's hard as hell to beat the final level and requires the twitchy reactions of a mountain-dewed up ADD kid.  The card game is the only minigame that really lets you win any money. In that sense, it does add something to the overall gameplay - as you can buy beefed up ammo and parts to build sentry bots, turrets, and similar helpful devices.The whole thing doesn't work terribly well together and the game ends very abruptly. The final level is a very repetitive design and enemies are mostly easy (relative to some of the other bosses and enemies).  I couldn't help thinking the game developers simply ran out of time/money and had to \"wrap things up\" before they were ready. This game is a great renter, but afterwards I can't see much replay value.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"blackaciddevil","summary":"Playstation Portable....","reviewText":"Looking over all my reviews, I noticed I had alot of PSP reviews but no review on the actual system itself. So, here's my review...Up until recently, I used to be a longtime Nintendo supporter as far as handhelds go. The luxury of being able to game on the go has always interested me. Unfortunately, due to the lack of good games for Nintendo's latest portable, the Nintendo DS, I became interested in Sony's Playstation Portable. So, when the PSP was bought for me as a gift for my birthday with Twisted Metal: Head-On, my efforts were put on this incredible little machine. I'm simply amazed at what it can do. Not only is it a portable gaming device but also a movie player, stores digital pictures-MP3's and alot more. You can also play multiplayer with others, and online. It is the Walkman of the 21st Century. The one thing that amazes me the most; after playing such games as TM: Head-On, NFSU: Rivals, Ridge Racer, and Wipeout Pure; is how it's able to produce almost PS2 quality graphics. The Playstation Portable has been around since March 2005 and it already has a huge list of games to play on it, with more of your favorite series planned for it(like Socom, Metal Gear Ac!d, Daxter, Grand Theft Auto)in the near future. Although I still love my Nintendo DS, I don't feel any guilt about giving alot of my support to Sony's PSP. Sure, it's an expensive handheld entertainment device, especially so in the pricing of its' games, but one well worth it. If you can afford it, do yourself a favor and get it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2005"}

It sounded great and looked good but my PC wasn't powerful enough to run it so I didn't get to play it much. A few years latter they released Daggerfall and this time I got to experience it firsthand and it blew me away; this was the experience I had been waiting for ever since I started playing roleplaying games; a completly openended gameworld where I could ropelplay exactly the kind of character I wanted. The gameworld was so vast and full of quests that I literaly lost myself in it for months. Bu the experience had some serious problems with bugs; random lockups, corrupted saves, and after awhile the gameplay became kind of stale because the quests were usualy so generic that I lost interest in it after awhile, plus I didn't want to restart the game for the third time because my savegame had become corrupted. I drifted towards the consoles for awhile. My PC was good enough to run the Infinity Engine games, and I didn't see a reason for upgrading in the near future.But then in 2002 a vertiable treasure trove of quality RPGs were released; Freedom Force, Neverwinter Nights, Arx Fatalis and the newest entry in the Elder Scrolls series. Morrowind simply became my favorite single character game of all time. It took some of the best elements of the Daggerfall, and wrapped it up in a magnificently looking setting that really hasn't been matched since for its sheer creativity and boldness. The land of the Dunmer, with its political intrigue, warring families and crumbling daedric ruins has been a mainstay in my PCs since release. I do believe other reason why it has had such a profund imapct in my life has been the TES Editor; this program has breathed life to the game for the past 8 years and it's still beign sold today.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Paul Hemenway","summary":"One of the best FPS's for XBox","reviewText":"This game is just flat out excellent.

{"product_name":"B00003E4EB","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo-Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$110 recommended retail price for a console with two controllers, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Low Price, Amazing # of titles available = great fun","reviewText":"Released in 1996, the Nintendo 64 is the oldster of the current generation of game systems. It is extremely impressive, therefore, that it has held up as well as it has. While the other games have had to come out with new consoles, requiring more money and new game purchases in most cases, the N64 has remained quite playable and current.Mario 64, one of the first games available, is still one of the best games available. Other games such as the Zelda series, Pod Racer, and Mario cart are equally as fun and give days if not months of gaming fun. The library of games available for the N64 is simply HUGE.The Nintendo 64 recently released an Expansion Pack which upgrades the graphics and speed of the machine, allowing games such as Pod Racer to show off even higher class graphics than the base system. Newer games, like Majora's Mask, require the expansion pack to play.We've owned a N64 for years and find that no matter who comes over to visit, or what the age group of the visitors, there is always a game that is vastly fun to play. There are single-player games, party games, competition games, cooperative games, thinking games, shooting games, and everything in between.For a household looking for a fun way to spend time together or to relax and have fun, the N64 is definitely worth looking into. It holds up well compared to the other consoles on the market, has a huge library of games available, and offers something for everyone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2000"}

I beat it at the lowest setting, and for being the very FIRST ninja gaiden game i've ever played, it's also the LAST one I will ever play. No matter how much this game is praised as (allegedly) being considered the, \"greatest and hardest game ever\" by many fanboys out there, I really don't think so. The designers of the game just disabled the C-stick, thereby not giving me any control of the camera during gameplay. (thanks team jinja... freekin dorks!). If I have NO CONTROL of the camera, then I can't SEE or MOVE through the game perfectly enough in order to beat your monsters.  Metroid Prime games did the same thing, (disabled the c-stick), but as least in doing so, they added a lock on feature which allowed me to strafe around the enemy and fight it.  And also, at least the fights in Metroid Prime were balanced enough in a fair but challenging way that made fighting all the monsters in that game fun. In ninja gaiden black however, the camera can't really keep up with all the crazy action that's up there on the screen. It just doesn't follow the player's movents fast enough, and I found myself moving around like a slow robotic tank around the battle field and corners as I encountered enemies.In addition to the bad camera, the gameplay is also a problem.  Many times I CLEARLY got the jump on an enemy, but the gameplay is tweeked soo much in such a bad way, the enemy wins over 75% of the time.  In these situations, the player is not rewarded for the efforts and right decisions that they made, simply because the designers stupidly tweeked the gameplay soo much that the enemy always have an unfair advantage throughout the entire game.Disabeling the c-stick made me feel like a one arm, one legg ninja fighting through the game, and because I see what the designers did to the c-stick and the game controls, I dont think the game is actually hard at all. Disabeling the c-stick doesn't make ANY game hard. It just makes them poorly designed... as this one is.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2011"}

I really appreciate a JRPG like White Knight Chronicles. In a drowning market western RPGs where choice is everything literally eat the market. Creating characters, questing, looting, all the favored past times of RPG gamers seemingly have killed storyline epic formulas of JRPGs. White Knight Chronicles is a love letter to fans of JRPG. It has the formula of the east with the exculpation of the west. Finding new armor and weapons that all change the appearance of your character, questing, and following a dynamic save the princess so you can save the world story line pull off with amazing talent. Level 5 is one of all JRPG enthusiast favorite companies. It is one of the only companies in it's field still innovating. Final Fantasy is a dying name. White Knight Chronicles will not be replacing it. However, creating and naming custom combos and following a nice story with pretty cut scenes reminds me of when the JRPG had it's glory years. PlayStation 1 era quality of detail. I love this game. I feel that the press it's received is merely due to our spoiled western mentalities used to games like Oblivion and Dragon Age where we shape story.

Not only is the Treasure concept back in the game (no idea why it was taken out in the third instalment), but it is even better because the treasures are displayed in the safehouse. Also, once all treasures in each level are collected, the arcade opens allowing you to play minigames that are slightly more advanced versions of the various ones found throughout the rest of the game. Safes are also back along with secret bottles (again, no idea why the third game removed these) and each safe has a very cool and useful item inside. That's all I'll say about that.Concerning the graphics, I was stunned at how beautiful they look on the Vita's OLED screen. Not only are the environments themselves sparkling, but the backgrounds are also quite astonishing.As far as gameplay goes, the world is much more free-roaming rather than linear. Of course, each quest requires you to go to a certain location and steal keys, reach a destination without being spotted, or any of the other various tasks that are required of you, but because there are so many collectables (including the addition of Sly Masks which will require a lot of searching or luck to locate them all) keeps you playing for even longer. The replay value on this game it moderate for the casual gamer, but for completionists like myself, it is very high.This truly is a worthy sequal to the previous three games, and if you enjoy Sly Cooper, or if you have yet to give his adventures a chance, then I would highly suggest picking up the trilogy on the PS3 and definitely Thieves in Time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2013"}

The attention to detail to not only the graphics but also the story have made this one of my absolute favorite PS3 games.We've all heard, watched or read something similar to Uncharted, most notably in Indian Jones, but the comparisons stop right there because immediately you know that Uncharted stands on its own two legs.  Not only does it stand on its own, but it forges a path through the jungles to an altogether well rounded game that is easily an industry standard.I couldn't help being fascinated with the mechanics of the game and how you move around.  I loved the attention to detail in the levels and how you had to navigate.  Add to that the almost movie quality story line that makes you feel as though you are a part of the game and you already have a great game.  But it doesn't stop there because the graphics are so great I caught myself standing there changing the camera angle just so I could look at everything.  Standing atop the castle and looking out toward the monastery was just amazing.  Add to that the uniqueness of the game, such as the jet ski, and I came away impressed.The only downside is that where you are getting 35+ hours of game play in most games you are only getting about 12.5 hours of game play in Uncharted, and I was exploring and searching everywhere.  If the game were longer I would have been extremely happy, but as is the game is still fantastic.  I can't imagine how they could improve at all on this game, but from what I hear Uncharted 2 is better!  Can't wait...5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0050SX7BQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Not as great as Heavy Rain but one of the PS3's last great games","reviewText":"Beyond: Two SoulsPosted by binarymessiah on 01/17/2014Rate ThisBeyond-Two-Souls-cover-890x1024Publisher: SCEA8.5Developer: Quantic DreamRelease Date: 10/8/2013Rating: MatureMSRP: $59.99Also Available On: PS3 ExclusivebarThe Good: Amazing story, fantastic animations and voice acting, some memorable moments, great charactersThe Bad: Not much gameplay, CIA missions are out of place, too much boring and pointless filler, many inconsistencies in scenes, some technical hiccups, endings feel cookie cutterQuantic Dream is one of those developers who tries something new and tries to innovate the game industry. They started out with Indigo Prophecy (or Fahrenheit for Europeans) and it was an interesting concept that was executed surprisingly well. Heavy Rain was the same way with a fantastic story and multiple choices that can change the ending. Using just various button presses to play the game could seem boring, but when the action picked up it got pretty intense. You had a split second to press the various buttons to make the characters flee for their lives or fight off enemies. Beyond feels like a spiritual successor to both those games, but is less interactive than the other two.You play as a girl named Jodie (Ellen Page) who has an entity named Aiden attached to her. She can control him to do anything from knock down a box to possessing someone and making them commit suicide. You bounce back and forth from her childhood to her adulthood where she&#8217;s being taken care of by a scientist named Nathan Dawkins (Willem Dafoe) and also when she&#8217;s in the CIA. This may seem confusing because the storyline is told in a random pattern, but it makes perfect sense. The story is well-balanced and easy to follow and there&#8217;s some great plot twists and changes.Like Heavy Rain you can wander around and do things, but there&#8217;s less optional interaction like in Heavy Rain. You will rarely find stuff to interact with just for the heck of it. When things start getting intense you will need to keep Jodie alive by following her movements in slow motion. The action will slow down a bit and you need to press the right analog stick in the direction that Jodie is moving. Some times this is hard to gauge due to an odd camera angle or her movements are too subtle. I never died through the game though, but slower reacting people may find the action sequences frustrating. That&#8217;s kind of where things become a problem. You will engage in a tense action sequence only to hit a chapter where you&#8217;re making dinner for Jodie&#8217;s date. There are some really dull and slow moments in Beyond and too many odd inconsistencies.Like the mentioned scene above I had to pick up clothes, cook dinner, and get Jodie ready for her date. This was slow, dull, and the inconsistencies drove me nuts. After putting dinner on the stove I wandered around (the characters control like awkward tanks) I took a shower, watched her drink some old beer, helped her pick out a dress, and the whole time (about 30 in game minutes) the food sat in the pan not being touched and it never burned. One scene towards the end has Jodie and her 3 CIA agents in North Korea tracking down a Condenser which is a rift to the Infraworld (the other side). They leave a house and do a lookout on a base but one guy is missing for about 3 scenes and it&#8217;s never explained where he went. Then he just appears out of nowhere.Controlling Aiden is also another problem because the levels are hard to navigate. The rooms and hallways all look the same and you will get lost often. Aiden controls like a no clip camera with a fisheye lens. He&#8217;s just a floating spirit attached to Jodie. Your goal is to look for blue dots to attach to and use both stick to slam stuff around, possess bodies, knock stuff over, and distract people. He&#8217;s kind of the puzzle side to the game. When I first played as Aiden he was nearly impossible to control and I almost threw up for how frustrated I got. Later on I learned to get used to it, but this could have been done better.Of course the game is all about the story and choices and there are quite a few, but in the end the choices are pretty much predefined. Depending on who you keep alive or befriend you get to choose who you stay with or a couple of other endings selections. They seem cookie cutter and your little tiny choices didn&#8217;t really make a difference. Again, more inconsistencies. Besides the choices the CIA portions were the worst and felt unnecessary for the game. It was just an excuse to add more action and close down these three condensers throughout the world. The more memorable moments were when Jodie was a kid and when Jodie had more one on one experiences with people as an adult like when she was homeless.The game does look damn good though, in fact one of the best looking games of this generation, it almost looks next-gen. The voice acting and motion capture is unlike anything we&#8217;ve seen this generation. Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe do an amazing job in their roles, but I can&#8217;t help but notice flaws due to the hardware limitations. Some facial expressions look overdone, some textures look muddy and downright ugly. There is skipping when the game is loading, but it&#8217;s all minor stuff.Overall, Beyond: Two Souls is 15 hours long, but is filled with boring scenes that are there just to extend play time. The CIA missions are boring and out of place and there are many annoying inconsistencies with events in some scenes. The game look fantastic and the acting is superb, so this is a very entertaining weekend rental and nothing more. Don&#8217;t come here looking for action because timed button presses are all you&#8217;re going to get.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2014"}

But then you have Assassin's Creed, a game you want to finish yet find yourself growing less and less amazed by the game yet you'll still play it for extended periods of time anyway. Well I love Ubisoft's Prince of Persia trilogy, this game merely gets a \"like\": too good to be awful but too flawed to be really amazing which is what the game feels like it should be.Story: You play as Altair, an assassin living in the 12th century. When Altair breaks the rules of his brotherhood, Altair is stripped of his ranks and most of his abilities (in other words, you've been \"Metroided\") and is tasked in assassinating 9 men which will help situations with Catholic and Muslim forces. But the real reason why he's being tasked will be revealed later in time...far later.Graphics: There's games with great art design then there's technologically superior games with pristine graphics and full use of lighting, shaders and the like. Compare a game like Okami to Gears of War for instance. Assassin's Creed is a game that really has both as the world is completely well designed and it does feel exactly what 1191 should feel. From the look of the towns to the large number of civilians to the amazing views you get when you climb view points as well as the character animation on Altair and this is quite a great game to watch.Sound/Music: The music in the game is serviceable by means that it works within the game but on occasion I barely notice it and prefer to hear the ambiance of the town like civilian chatter and the like. Of course then again you'll frequently hear the same voice despite being in a different street or town as the last time you hear it and while it's not as if Ubisoft can record 50 variations on the same \"thank you for saving me\" parts, hearing another person saying the whole city will hear of my sacrifice can get grating. Not to mention Altair's rather odd American accent though the rest of the cast like the actual targets are good.Gameplay: In a way the game feels like it wants to be a \"something for everyone and anyone\" kind of game. You have stealth kills which never get old, especially to those crazy lepers who keep wanting to throw me and only me everywhere or the women who follow me and give them money (which you don't make by the way). You have action when you're caught and have to fight off sometimes a dozen enemies who never seem to rush you and even take their time before they do some pose in a \"boy we're gonna get you good!\" way. And then there's the sandbox where you can take on various missions which really only resort to interrogation where you follow somebody and beat em up for info, pickpocketing people for their letters or eavesdropping on people by sitting on a bench. I admire the developers wanting to do more than one but unfortunately they just don't do all 3 in a great manner.One thing you'll find also with the game is how repetitive it is. Here's your oft-occuring formula for the game: climb down from your mountain base every single new mission, travel or zap instantly to your next time, visit the town's assassin's bureau for who to take on next, climb tall buildings to build up your map and key missions/quests to take on, do them, go back to the bureau for your go-ahead, go to target, see cutscene of their plan, kill them (and hear their go on and on about their plan and reasons for it) fight or run away from enemies as you make your way back to the bureau. That's it and this is for around 9 targets and sure some games have a noticeable similarity in how you progress but there was always at least some change-up or variety but this is just the same stuff in more than one city and nothing else.However on the other hand I still wanted to get through to the end mainly cause the game felt so interesting that even if I didn't understand the story, I at least wanted to see more of it. Randomly stabbing people is fun in a \"I swear I'm not homicidal but this is fun\" kind of way and the downloadable patch makes the framerate/freezing problems of before all-but-non-existant but still, this is a game that wants and really needs to be more than what we have.Irrelevant sidenote: google the producer Jade Raymond...the woman is gooooorgeous.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2008"}

While Okami may not be as fun as some other titles such as Zelda or Final Fantasy, it comes very close, and puts the games to shame in terms of its artistic quality.What makes Okami so special is its preservation of Ancient Japanese mythology and the Japanese culture in general through incredibly artistic graphics and an amazing ethnic-based soundtrack. Okami is the one and only game you can treat as both a piece of entertainment and a jewel.Aspects of the game:Plot-Great, especially with its historical and mythological accuracy. However, it is very predictable and not too intense. Then again, Zelda has never had a great plot either. Therefore I must say Okami's plot is about equal to the typical Zelda plot, with a little bit more creativity; it's no Final Fantasy plot though.Gameplay-Good, but no Zelda. It is just too easy. If Okami were a more difficult game (only the bosses are fun to fight), it may perhaps be the greatest Adventure game ever made. The only reason Zelda is better is because its enemies are more challenging and there are more frequent puzzles that are more engaging. However, Okami's world is a whimsical and majestic one, more fun to explore than Hyrule in Zelda.Graphics-The best ever. I'm sick and tired of games trying to have realistic graphics. I live in the real world and I hate it. Please, I need more creativity! Okami puts the other cel-shaded games to shame (Dragon Quest, Wind Waker, etc.); although I prefer cel-shaded to realism.Music-Really cool and great to listen to.

Just like any car, these can be raced, but as with their real-life cousins, players can also do things with these cars like monitor battery power as related to speed and other car usage. In addition,GT 5features over 20 courses, more than 60 variations, a new physics engine allowing for realistic damage, a new in-cockpit view, HD support, and much more.","reviewerName":"Christian","summary":"Very disappointing...ask ign","reviewText":"Ok so IGN just rated this game as the 2nd most disappointing game of the year, and I have to agree.  Let me tell you why1. While the races look like the real deal, the problem with the AI seems to be that it is way too easy to just bump and grind ahead of the track in the first corner itself. The game gets devilishly spot on with the controls as expected but that said you better try and get ahead of the pack within the first corner. Else you are pretty much on your own for the entire duration. They will stick to the racing line like glue and you can never expect anyone to break from the ordered pack.2. Weather Effects on a limited trackWhile this may not have been a major concern but the the awesome Ice and rain effects were the chief places of contention for GT 5 being the definitive vehicular and graphical experience to be had on the PS3. Well tis really limited a few tracks here and there. That said whats there is all very good.3. No Cock Pit View of the Standard non premium carsThe PSP version of Gran Turismo had it. So there is no reason why it should not have been there. Granted that it probably could not have been that detailed, but scrapping the feature all together is really not done.4. The Standard Cars don't meet the expectations as far as looks go.Well the disparity between the standard cars and the premium ones are quite a bit. For starters once you have tasted the premium cars there is no chance you will ever want to go back to the standard ones. Well apart from that check out the cock pit view of the fancied premium ones for shadow jaggies.5. Damage RealisNOT tic Damage physics came to the GT series amidst much fanfare with the GT 5. Sure the game has panel by panel destruction of premium vehicles, the standard ones never suffer from a scratch. And you know what it does ? It takes that much immersion away from the definitive and real driving simulation it tries so pain stakingly achieves. This is probably the greatest crime that GT5 is guilty of.The game is decent but no where near what we were led to believe in terms of graphics or gameplay","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2010"}

So that remains the same, although some of the boss fights are different and pretty impressive. This game is much better in terms of gameplay and map variety, ruins, snowy wastelands, and other strange locations give this game more pozas than the first. Aiming is much more spot on, the controls feel smoother, you definitely move faster, and the new jetpack is pretty cool with multiple guns. I like it much better than the Mech-bots in KZ2. So basically it feels like the first, just more variety. Campaign is short, not 5 hours like most have said, more like 8. This game or any game for that matter is not worth 60 bucks(my internet cost that much a month), i just had a lot of old games lying around and used store credit to get my copy, because I enjoy PS3 exclusives a lot. Games should be no more then 30 bucks for new(popular) titles, and about 20 for lesser, obscure titles. Companies would make just as much money because \"MORE\" people would purchase a 30 dollar game. So if you wanna drop this much go ahead, i'm just waiting for the bugs to get worked out of the multiplayer campaign. Other than that, its just Killzone 2 with more seasoning, and spice.Btw the story is pretty nonexistant, which most of the time i don't play for stories anyway.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2011"}

Bearden","summary":"God of Games","reviewText":"After playing GOW I & II, I was expecting much of the same in the third one, simply with more stunning graphics.  For those of you who have played through GOW III you can understand my jaw dragging on the floor behind me.  There was a lot of hype about GOW III as it is a large title.  I have no hesitation in admitting I believe that hype was well deserved.Everything about GOW III blows the first two out of the water.  A fully fledged onslaught of Olympus, and all things related, was the definition of epic.Graphics: Modern, beautiful, and flowing.  At no point did the graphic quality of the game ever detract from its glory.  From start to finish both cinematic and game play graphics live up to the expectations of reasonable gamers.  There will always be gamers who think every game that comes out should be of Avatar's (the movie) quality.Voice Acting: Great!  Some great names in this game for voice actors.  Rip Torn and Malcolm McDowell, just to name two.  The voice acting was never noticeably tacky or choppy.  Santa Monica did duel recording sessions with dialogue between two characters, in the same room, at the same time...it worked fantastically!Story: Epic, epic, epic, and epic.  No one can deny that Kratos is a badass and the story of his betrayal and assault on the gods of Olympus is nothing but intense.  The story does not let up and does not falter.  There were no new annoying characters that sometimes plague game sequels.Music: The music is similar to previous GOW games but much more polished and poignant.  Some of the scenes would not be done justice without the musical score behind it.  I would consider the music an integral part of GOW III as it is very balanced between fight scenes, boss fights, and running around.Controls: SEEMLESS!  There is no other way to describe the ease of playing GOW III.  The only part of the game that took me more than one try to get used to was hopping from harpy to harpy in mid air.  It was new and therefore took a bit of tinkering.  Other than that, the game felt like silk to play.  The controls never detracted from what was going on in front of me.Unlockables: The game has some GREAT unlockable videos related to the making of GOW III.  I found the videos to be extremely interesting as I never truly appreciated how many resources go into making a modern day blockbuster game.  The new challenges are fun and...well...challenging!  Chaos difficulty is just that, chaotic!  It will challenge even the most skilled GOW III player.Overall: I would actually replay GOW III to use the items found in the game and to simply experience the game all over again.  I have never considered myself a GOW fanboy but GOW III may have tipped the scale.PS: There is TONS and TONS and TONS of blood, violence, shredding, etc in GOW III, more than the previous game.  I noticed some of the low reviews complaining about the gore level.  Come on people, the game is titled \"GOD OF WAR\".  It is not about flowers and rainbows.  If you want to chop up baddies and some epic beings, you better be reading for some serious blood.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2010"}

Sme\"","summary":"Bad ending ruins the series","reviewText":"If you've never heard of the \"Mass Effect\" games you don't need to have played the previous episodes to (for the most part) figure out what is going on in this one.To sum up without laying out spoilers it takes place in a galaxy spanning civilization centered on an enormous space station called The Citadel.The first game is the discovery of this universe and the back story, that a previous galactic race called the Protheans had flourished and been extinguished in an attack by a mysterious machine race called The Reapers, who have repeated this cycle several times.The second was the set up of the plot and in some ways reminded me of Star Wars; the original episode was heroic and idealistic, the second was darker and more cynical.  The third episode is the final climax, we just need Ewoks.The gameplay is a mix of combat (much more intense than previously in the series) and role playing conversations and quests.  Supposedly your actions and decisions have an effect on the outcome, and you can import your character and their choices from previous games.Players who went through the first two games invested a lot of time in customizing this character and often became emotionally attached.  There were a lot of justifiable expectations on this third installment.Before I lay out the problems two interesting changes I found is previously you spent half or more of the game building your team; here it's not clear when your team is complete or who will be on it.  The first game had multiple weapons with varying capabilities; the second had four general classes you could improve on.  This one has five classes with multiple types you can customize.So...what did installment three do wrong?  First there's a DLC (downloadable content) episode that is already on the disk.  So you spend an extra $10 to use something that comes with the game, with more likely to come.Second is some major plot holes/bad writing.  An example is halfway through the game you have to make a choice that you only get the \"good\" option if you made a few decisions earlier that weren't clear, otherwise you have a bad/bad choice.I'd started the series on episode 2 and imported the character from that; my decisions in that game amounted to some different dialog in this game, and several of the team characters from episode 2 only made cameo appearances.And lastly is the ending.  This was the final epic battle that everything had been leading to--and yet nothing is answered, there is no happy resolution or even a satisfactory epilogue.  Matter of fact the ending is so bad that Bioware would be better off releasing an update or (heaven forbid) a DLC that does resolve the story.  As it is the finale is the equivalent of the Star Wars Trilogy ending the moment the Death Star explodes.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2012"}

I&#8217;ll tell you why it&#8217;s called Fatal Frame in a bit and you&#8217;ll be just as confused as I am as to why it&#8217;s called Zero or Project Zero. This game is a survival horror classic on the PlayStation 2 released in North America in 2002, but it was later ported to the Xbox and re-released in 2013 on the PlayStation Store as a PS2 Classic.Supposedly, the game is based off a true story according to the cover of the box. The game revolves around mostly Miku Hinasaki to search for her missing brother Mafuyu in the haunted Himuro Mansion. Mafuyu visited the mansion to look for his mentor, Junsei Takamine. Miku bravely goes into the haunted mansion and learns about the dark secrets in this mansion and realizes this was the site of a large series of gruesome murders and the spirits of the people who died there continue to haunt the place.You are inside a haunted mansion filled with ghosts and your only weapon is called the Camera Obscura which is an antique camera that can photograph ghosts or spirits and expel them. The amount of times you can photograph is limited but you will have plenty of film. There are different types of film throughout the game with different levels of strength. You can you unlock special abilities, but getting these special abilities will require spirit points which can only be gained by capturing ghosts (no, it&#8217;s not like Ghostbusters). Now this game has its scares and jumps, but what makes the game really scary is that the only way to cause the ghosts real damage and get more spirit points is to let the ghosts come as close as they can to you and photograph them up close. Doing so will give you far more spirit points and inflict greater damage. In a way, the game rewards you for being spooked.The majority of the game is seen from a third person perspective which is exactly like the older Resident Evil games on the original PlayStation and that to me is something every survival horror game should be like because you can never see what&#8217;s ahead or around corners and to me that just makes the game scarier. Whenever you look through the camera, you obviously go into a first person perspective which makes it easier to photograph the ghosts. So I understand why this game is called Fatal Frame because the camera you use to photograph the ghosts is fatal to them, but why is it called Zero in Japan and Project Zero in Europe? It&#8217;s like in Japan, Resident Evil was called Biohazard which also makes more sense because the enemies you fight in that game are organisms infected with a bio-organic virus but I never figured out why it was called Resident Evil in the rest of the world.Speaking of which, the game follows Resident Evil style of gameplay in having puzzles to solve, files to read, save points, a similar menu screen, exploring a mansion and going back to the main menu when you die. It&#8217;s exactly like Resident Evil and this in my view makes the game very memorable to me.The way your character moves is very similar to Resident Evil, you hold the Square button to run. There&#8217;s also that glitch where you tap the Square button repeatedly and you make their walking funny or weird. It doesn&#8217;t have any purpose, but it&#8217;s pretty funny.Now to continue with the ghosts, there&#8217;s usually only one in the same room with you. But believe it or not, it can be tricky to photograph them. Mainly they keep disappearing and reappearing and also due to the fact they can go through walls. This makes the game more frightening because you&#8217;re trying to capture the ghosts but at the same time trying to avoid them from hurting you. As you progress in the game, the ghosts become faster and more difficult to photograph. It is a pretty challenging game and one that probably won&#8217;t be completed in one sitting. Fortunately you can save as many times as you like so it isn&#8217;t a frustrating game.Are there any criticisms I have for this game? There are a few minor complaints I have. One: as I said, some of the ghosts are hard to photograph, but I shouldn&#8217;t really judge challenge because we all like a good challenge, unless you&#8217;re a baby. Two: the character moves kind of slow and it can be somewhat hard to avoid the faster ghosts later in the game. Three: the controls for getting up the stairs aren&#8217;t that good. If you&#8217;re off center of the stairs and end up blocked by debris on the edge in the middle or on top of the stairs, you can&#8217;t move left to get through it. Instead you have to go back down the stairs turn left off the stairs and go back up to get past the debris. But most of the time, there&#8217;s no enemies in the room when you have this problem so at least you aren&#8217;t in harm&#8217;s way. Four: the items on the ground are indicated by a flashing dot which is exactly like in Resident Evil. But sometimes the spot where you retrieve the item is very specific and it can take a few tries until you finally manage to pick up the item. But like with the stairs, there are no enemies in the room so you won&#8217;t be in any danger trying to pick up the item. Five: I did get stumped on what to do a few times. When you kill one of the main spirits, he gives you a hint on what to do. Unfortunately I forgot or didn&#8217;t figure what he said was important and I needed to use a video walkthrough on the internet to find out what I was supposed to do. And six: the first person controls are kind of hard to get used to, by default you use the left analog stick to aim and the right to move your character and I can't help but feel it should be the other way around. But you can switch it fortunately, but it should be placed like that by default.Most of the complaints I listed are somewhat minor but don&#8217;t let that fool you. This is one of the great and underrated survival horror games. It has great graphics, you play as a cute Japanese girl in a school outfit, you&#8217;re in a haunted mansion, it follows a Resident Evil style of gameplay and is just really scary. There is nothing better than that. The game might cost about $20 if you buy it in disc form on both the PS2 and Xbox. I&#8217;d highly recommend getting the version from the PlayStation Store to play on the PS3 as it&#8217;s a digital copy that will never wear out and it only costs $4.I fell in love with this game right away and if you&#8217;re a fan of survival horror, then this is a must have.FINAL RATING: 9.5 OUT OF 10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2014"}

I bought it expecting it to 'WOW' me in it's advancement, instead I was suprised how cartoony the animation, scenery, and everything else is despite having such high system requirements.The depth of gameplay is WAY better and the computer is way harder to beat, but instead of fighting wars and building civilizations, I found much of my time was wrapped up in politics and bartering with the other civilizations over necessary resources, even though I controlled over 50% of the \"earth\".I found that it was incredable hard to wage war for some reason, despite the fact that I had tanks and the civilization I was attacking had only musketeers.Overall, I'd say instead of stepping forwards, Civilization IV is a completely NEW GAME and should not be linked to Civilzation III except by genre.Despite playing Civilizations I-III, Civilization IV dissappointed me.  I WANTED it to be awsome, but it just wasn't, which is sad really, because I had such high hopes for it. =-/","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2006"}

The story is really basic (like Bowser kidnapped Princess Peach, now go get her).The graphics feel more painted than computer generated. If you get really close to another NPC in the game their appearances seem brushed which is really neat. Some laymen may mistake this for shoddy craftsmanship of graphics. It seems more deliberate to me. I wasn't really interested in this game until SyFy channel aired an episode of Face Off in which the contestants created their own characters from this game. So if you like this game and haven't seen that, look it up, it's quite cool.The game play isn't very unique or new. I'm ok with that. You can either go in full throttle and kill everyone which alerts more baddies and rats from Hell. Or you can play stealthy and carefully which is actually somewhat difficult and not kill anyone at all. It's kinda neat that you can go through the whole game without killing anyone.For those of you who base all your opinions on other games, here's my take: It reminds me of Thief and Bioshock. If you've played Bioshock then you'll be right at home in Dishonored. Without modifying the controls it's got the same basic setup at Far Cry 3 and Bioshock. I personally didn't care for the Bioshock series, but my girlfriend loved it. For some reason, in spite of all the similarities this game has to Bioshock I rather like it.The skill tree in the game is rather basic as well, but the skills are cool and fit the game like a good pair of gloves. Nothing in the skill tree seems out of place or silly. It is a little awkward swapping between skills as your hot keys get full rather quickly, but that's an interface thing I can get past. Combat in the game is like Skyrim. You get a sword in your right hand and the right trigger operates it and that is that. Your left hand is for skills and crossbows and guns. Getting used to using the skills is also a little weird but once you get used it, it flows rather nicely.To clarify this: This game is LINEAR. I knew it was linear before I got it so I wasn't as upset as when I got Crysis 3 (see my review of that game if you don't know about my feelings on linear -v- sandbox). However, in spite of the game being linear you can still wander about in parts of the world during missions as there is a lot of required exploration. So due to the way you can tackle each situation, whether it be stealthy or balls out, it makes the game feel less linear and a little more open. You have options about how you can do things and which route you can take to do it. It truly is a game of choices. [Just want to throw this in as an addendum to this part of my review: I traded in Crysis 3 for Dishonored and I couldn't be happier with that decision.]Overall, 4 stars. It has room for improvement like every other game ever made. It's not a new concept by any means. The steam punk atmosphere is also not new, but it is cool. A little over done in this game than others. Yet this game is fun to play despite the foreboding atmosphere. Not for kids either, gotta add that. Early on in the game I discovered my crossbow bolts will make a head explode like a grapefruit hit with a hollow point. And rendering people headless is also easy. The controls are familiar territory as well. They aren't clunky. If you've played any of the games I've mentioned in this review then you won't feel lost. It's just bloody good overall. Short of a five star.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000QD7BBM","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"A Day at the Fair","reviewText":"Carnival Games Wii is a collection of typical carnival games - shooting ducks, skee-ball, knocking over bottles, and even testing your love potential. It's fairly easy, mindless fun.You can customize your character - boy, girl, man, woman - with different facial looks, clothes, shoes, and so on. As you earn tickets and prizes throughout the games you unlock new decorations for your person.The games are divided up into small groups. You can toss footballs into tires, softballs into baskets, or rings over bottles. You can inflate balloons over a clown's head or toss darts at balloons. In each case the hand movements are fairly simple. Throw the ball. Toss the dart. Underhand-throw the skee-ball.There are also games that seem to be just for fun. There's a love-o-meter where all you do is hold the controller against your heart and you're told you're passionate or a cold fish.In each of the games there's a set limit. X number of darts, Y number of seconds. This can be annoying if you're playing on your own - the re-load time for the game involves buttons and waiting. But on the other hand if there are other people sharing with you, it's good to keep people in the sharing mood.Some of the games are fairly easy. The skee-ball for example you draw your arm back and throw the ball just like you would in real life. It's fun and almost addictive to keep playing and getting the ball into the hole.Other of the games are maddeningly annoying. Making the frog hop into the lilies in the pond more than once, or the wiffle-ball skitter onto the right plastic cup, seems nearly impossible. You could certainly argue that these games are just as impossible in real life :) And I suppose since there's a mix of these games in with the other actual-skill games, players can choose to attempt or not attempt these as they wish.A good side of these games is that anyone can play, and everyone can relate to them. Tossing balls at clown faces or tossing basketballs into hoops make sense to eight year olds and eighty year olds. It's a family game in a \"comfortable\" atmosphere. Non-gamers don't have to figure out boards or spacings or strange games, everything feels natural.On the down side, even though you know *what* to do in pretty much all of these games, in a number of them it's very challenging to actually do that. You try and fail to get the right amount of movement of the arm. Because you only get a few tries each time around, it can take a long, frustrating time to figure it out.So kudos for hitting on a fun theme that everyone can relate on. Some games are great fun because they are based on skill and logical thought. Some games are frustrating because they are much more like random chance. Again, though, that's true to the carnival experience.  Parents just need to guide their kids on which ones they shouldn't worry about as much.I'll give it 4/5 for a great idea and reasonable implementation.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2011"}

No matter how great some games are, they tend to get repetitive at some point, I don't remember this being the case with Mario Galaxy 2 with its amazing level designs.  At the Spike Video Game Awards for 2010, one of the judges stated that he was disappointed that this game was not nominated for game of the year, I could not agree more.)Title says it all! Best video game I have played to date (I am also an avid Xbox 360 player). I loved the first Super Mario Galaxy and the sequel improves in almost every category.  The game is tons of fun and provides a similar feeling after watching the best from Disney and Miyazaki.  You won't be able to find a game that is more fun and that has a more creative/diverse set of level designs.I had a few concerns when I first heard about this game, one of them was that it would be more of the same from the first game but after playing it for several hours and collecting a little over 100 stars, I have yet to encounter an area that is recycled.  So far everything is brand new (or at least it feels that way), I am looking forward to some of the Mario 64 remade levels that I hear are in the game.  Mario gets a new set of power ups that is nothing like anything we have seen before.  Yoshi is also introduced to the 'Galaxy' with his own set of power ups.I was initially disappointed that Nintendo took out the level selection hub from the first game but the overhead world map that is similar to Super Mario Bros. 3 and the New Super Mario Bros. creates a better paced game and makes it easier to select a level.  The only area where this game does not excel over the prequel is in the story department, story was sacrificed for a faster paced game and to make it more accessible for new comers.  My only minor complaint is that I miss the background story that they introduced in the first Galaxy which was presented as a children's storybook.The second player option is much improved.  In the first Galaxy game the second player controlled a pointer that collected star bits, shot star bits to stun opponents and helped Mario jump higher.  In this game, in addition, player 2 controls a Luma that can collect more items like coins and 1-Up mushrooms; Player 2 can attack or freeze certain enemies, and halt booby-traps.  The cooperative second player is ideal to get observers or casual players involved in the game.  The second player mode in the first Galaxy become a sort of gateway into video games for my wife who never really played them before.This game is a must have if you own a Wii!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2010"}

I prefer series in the vein of God of War, Halo or Uncharted, games that are more action and adventure based than shoot-'em-uppers.  But the hype -and trailers- surrounding CODMW3's release had me eager to try my hand at launch, and I finally gave in.  Consensus?  I'm glad I did.I was instantly impressed with the controls, game play and the graphics.  I've read some reviews that say the graphics aren't superb, but compared to a lot of the games that came out this year they're pretty realistic in my opinion.  They have a more \"real\" quality, unlike Uncharted 3, a game I love but that has a glossy, computer animated movie-like quality, whereas this game is going more for succinct in its attempt to appear as if in real life.  MW3 impressed me particularly with its intensity to feel, again, \"real,\" and it really gives you the feeling you're in a real war (as close as a game has in my experience).  Ok, so facial animations are a bit hokey, and definitely not the best out there, but character movement is really what makes this game feel so genuine in my opinion.  Running and taking cover is brilliant, and enemy AI is particularly strong (as is the comrade AI-they actually take out quite a few themselves, something that can't be said for many shooters out there).So what's disappointing?  To me, it was the confusion in shooting enemies.  Not the shooting part itself, that's been made quite easy with the help of targeting, but sometimes it feels like you just run in and shoot anything that moves, which resulted in me shooting a few of my fellow comrades and having to restart at the last checkpoint since the game doesn't allow that; yes, I can tell who's on my team when the name appears on top, but that -at least in my case- didn't happen a couple times, hence some of my comrades went down in a blaze of my glory.  Not a big deal, of course, but I think that could have been improved.  Don't hate me-remember, this is my first COD experience!Overall, CODMW3 is a great, highly enjoyable and very intense first person shooter.

Jongeling \"slice of heaven\"","summary":"Give it a fair chance","reviewText":"My first experience with the new Resident Evil genre was with the Gamecube. I had played the old Resident Evil games for many years prior. So the first thing I noticed about this game (RE Zero) was the beautiful character renderings and the artistic value to the backdrop. It is just good to look at. But don't stare too long because you might end up having to heal yourself. The sounds were fantastic and the shots from the Beretta (Rebecca) and the Colt 1911 (Billy's) were fairly realistic too.The treasure box system is replaced with a \"drop wherever\" system which can be handy if you don't want to backtrack to the creaky box. However it can get frustrating when you forget where you \"dropped\" something and at times may even be worse than the treasure box system. One may remedy this to a certain degree by picking a large room (such as the training facility hall or the cable car platform) and placing all of your items there. When you move to a completely different portion of the game (like disc 2) you may find yourself dumping your inventory completely (in a newly discovered big environment), backtracking to pick up all of your items and then dumping again and picking up the items you need in that room. This can be time consuming.Another thing they could have improved on is the ***groan*** placement of the characters to engage an object. You can be standing right in front of a statue and use a key or tool and it won't work because you're not perfectly centered. Same concept for getting on and off boxes, ladders, and elevators. The puzzles are all familiar to those acquainted with the series. Nothing too new to speak of - there's the box puzzle, the valve handle, hidden keys, lighter, a grandfather clock that needs to be set to a specific time, statues, books with key pieces in them, and crows will still crash through windows when you take a new item. The chess puzzle was interestingly new and so was the dot grid in the last half of the game. This is classic Resident Evil.The buddy system works great as you can have two characters in two different spots helping each other out and advancing the game quicker. The game teaches you to use the buddy system early on so you are acquainted with it later in the game. It makes a lot of sense to me.On easy mode the game is a walk in the park, but on Medium you should conserve your ammo and only use what you need to. Hard mode is for experienced players only - not only to the series but specifically this game. If you haven't already, go ahead and buy this game. I would recommend the Wii version if you don't want to mess around with two discs. If that doesn't matter to you the Gamecube version is easy to find and well worth the price of admission. This was one of the last true survival horror games in the RE franchise. Don't miss it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2013"}

One of the best video game series of all times. This game was released as a 2-disc GameCube exclusive.Story: While the original RE game starts with the Alpha team's story, Bravo team was sent in first but their story was never explained. The main character, Rebecca Chambers was just a helper in RE but now you get to find out what her story was and how she survived while the rest of the Bravo team did not. Bravo team is called in to investigate a series of grisly murders in the Arklay Mountains region outside of Raccoon City, same as the Alpha team later on. On the way to the scene, Bravo's helicopter malfunctions because of a sabotage and is forced to crash land in the forest. The team soon discovers an overturned military police transport truck, along with the mutilated corpses of two officers. The remaining bravo team members split up and Bravo team's field medic, Rebecca Chambers, finds a train stopped in the middle of the forest. She discovers the prisoner, Billy Coen that was being transported by the military police. The train starts moving uncontrollably. The two work together from then on, stopping the train before it crashes and discovering an underground research facility owned by Umbrella. Things aren't what they seem as they explore the facility, fighting all the creatures and insects from Umbrella's experiments. The game ends at the entrance to the mansion from the first RE game.Gameplay: Single player survivor horror. You control both Billy Coen and Rebecca Chambers, each having their own unique abilities and each needed to solve puzzles and advance the plot. The storage containers are gone from the original RE game so if you need an item and your inventory is full, you then drop an item and it is tracked on your map in case you need to go back and get it. Fighting is the same as the other RE games. You can shoot from a stationary position only. The weapons include various custom handguns, shotguns, magnums, sub-machine guns, grenade launchers, and close-combat knives. As for the characters abilities, you need to use Rebecca to mix chemicals and get into tight spaces (she is petite) while you need Billy to move large objects and use a lighter. The enemies include mutant insects, zombies, primates, and leeches.Conclusion: Controls are easy to use. Sound and graphics are both on par for GameCube quality. If you love the RE series, you will like this game. There are multiple difficulty settings and the game is quite challenging on the standard difficulty. Worth picking up if you still own a GameCube or it can be played on the Wii using a GameCube controller and memory card.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0014G98WA","description":"The only thing better than watching stylized samurai battles with Samuel L. Jackson's voice booming in your ear is controlling the character as it all happens. And now you can, with Afro Samurai for the Xbox 360. Based on the popular anime series, Afro Samurai will finally let gamers control their favorite samurai as he violently slashes through an eclectic lineup of assassins, ninjas, and robotic thugs..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }The voice acting is done by Samuel L. Jackson, who brings along his usual flair.View larger.The Focus maneuver lets you low down time and perform precision hits.View larger.The Story UnfoldsSet in a futuristic, yet feudal Japan, this story follows a samurai named Afro after his hair. Afro has set out to try and avenge his father's murder by a man named Justice. Justice murdered Afro's father to claim the 'Number One' headband, giving himself the chance to rule the worldAfro Samurai is based on the popular and stylistic anime of the same name.View larger.with powers akin to a god. The only one allowed to challenge Number One is the person with the 'Number Two' headband, but unfortunately for Afro, the current owner of the headband, anybody and everybody can, and does, challenge Number Two. But never fear, as this new title includes brand new material and background for fans of the series and newcomers alike to enjoy.Loads of Stylized ActionAfro Samurai brings gamers a balanced experienced, with stylistic combat and acrobatic platforming combined with the ability to dynamically slice and dismember enemies in unending ways. While gamers can hack and slash their way through many foes by combining heavy and light attacks with just two buttons, accomplished players will master moves like the Deep Throat Killer, where they pierce their opponent's neck and rip everything loose in a crimson splash.Players will also need to learn the Focus maneuver with its bullet-time effect. This allows the user to slow down time and designate a specific strike zone, which with the right timing and skill can allow Afro to cleave an enemy in two or slice a limb completely off. And since characters are not pre-rendered you don't just get a canned scene when you cut through your enemy, giving you endless ways and means to cut your enemies down to size. This ethos is applied game-wide, as Afro is allowed to interact with anything and everything in his environment to help him on his journey.Star-Studded Supporting CastSamuel L. Jackson reprises his role as both Afro and Ninja in the game, and the same striking art style that made the anime series so popular provides the unique look and feel across beautifully animated open environments. And for those of you who are wondering, developers Namco Bandai let Jackson ad-lib a lot, so be prepared for his branded vulgarity and the M rating it helps the game earn.Meanwhile, Ron Pearlman and Kelly Hu continue on in their roles as Justice and Okiku, while RZA of Wu-Tang Clan fame has created all new tracks for the hip-hop inspired soundtrack. And thanks to an innovative gameplay system, the enemy AI and tone of the game are affected by the beat of the musical score, for a truly immersing experience.With its visual stunning graphics, and fluid and graceful movements, Afro Samurai will provide hours of entertaining, balletic action. Add to this ground-breaking elements like health that is represented by the blood on your clothes, or your enemies', and you have a game that simply can not be passed up.Slice and dice your enemies in a glorious number of different ways.","reviewerName":"ObiWanShinobi","summary":"Almost Afro-tastic....","reviewText":"The tough part about making an Afro Samurai game would be (in my opinion) getting the art direction and gameplay to allow folks to really experience all the things that made the series so notable. Specifically, finding a graphic way to bring the series animation to what should be a super bloody hack and slash console game and have it make sense...all while retaining the unique style of the series through the characters, story, design and music.The folks that made this game, to my surprise, nailed the crap outta the hard part. Which should make this game be all kinds of super awesome and a ton of fun to play. The game retains all of the violence, RZA and Samuel L. Jackson goodness that the series had, and presents it all in a really swank and surprisingly cohesive way.However, if you've read a review of this game then you may have heard mention of the very \"brokeashell\" in-game camera. This is because (as awesome as this game is), the camera is, in fact, dysfunctional beyond belief. However, if you give this game a little bit of time you will eventually get \"used\" to the camera and stop fighting it as much as you progress through the game. But, and I'm not going to lie here, that process will drive you nuts in the first couple of stages. So with that being the case, is this game worth playing through?Yepper.And here's why. When the camera does behave and isn't whipping around for no reason, chopping up frames, and generally blocking your view of what you need to see - it does deliver some of the straight-up coolest hip-hop infused samurai action moments in the history of histories... chock full of body parts, buckets o' blood in slo-mo, and it's all To The Beat.If this game were rereleased with a functioning camera, it would be a solid 5 star game. No joke.So while it definitely sucks, the camera doesn't make this game as unplayable as some folks'll lead you to believe. The game is certainly worth your time, and I would say money... but not at full price. I am a fan (not huge, but def a fan) of the series and actually enjoyed this game.I'd say, unless you are super hardcore fan of the series, this game doesn't hold up well enough to buy new. Rent it or buy it used.In summation - If you're into the series or just into the wonderful Reeses Peanut Butter Cup of Awesomeness that is the combination of Samurai Action + Hip Hop culture, then this game is certainly worth playing, but with the whole camera issue...not exactly worth owning outright at a new price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001AWBYNE","reviewerName":"Caleb Williams","summary":"It's Great, But I Expected More","reviewText":"Off the cusp of possibly the most successful FPS to date, Call of Duty 4, there was no doubting the high expectations people would hold for the next installment. Treyarch have done something very clever as they have taken everything from the old series and enhanced on it, apart from the campaign mode that is, but I'll go into that in a minute. The graphics and basic intense working engine are increased to an epic scale which I honestly can't describe, you get close to 50 AI soldiers on the screen in the more intense battles. This year the Call of Duty series goes back to its roots with the world war 2 depictions. Some said it was a bad idea given the success of the last installment, but this was quashed when we were introduced to possibly the coolest weapon of the game, The Flamethrower. This presents a more graphical and realistic quality to it as the behaviour of the flames and the interraction with the environment only add to the experience.I mentioned about the campaign mode and feel I need to clear something up. Don't get me wrong, the campaign mode is awesome and is something quite enjoyable, but like the last installment it was way too short. I would say it could easily be completed in about 5 hours, if that. The missions are excellent and quite impactful and entertaining, but unless you're playing it on veteran difficulty, you're going to end the game feeling a little robbed. Like the last game you play through two seperate campaigns. On one side you're an American soldier entering into numerous battles with the Japanese, on the other side you're a soviet soldier retaliating against Nazi forces and eventually take Berlin.The Multiplayer features much like the old COD4 multiplayer system with its perks for excellent gameplay. Much like COD4, when you're in a multiplayer game, you're rewarded for kill streaks.3 Kills gives you Recon5 Kills gives you an artillery strike7 Kills gives you dogsDogs are particularly awesome as you can set them free to attack and kill your fellow online player.The graphics are really pushed more in this game as well, I mentioned the flamethrower but also the general gore of the game is something to smile about. Say for example you torch someone with the flamethrower, you will witness their charred remains as they lay dead on the ground. Also the use of quite powerful shotguns or even rocket launchers on your enemies blows them into tiny and satisfyingly gory pieces.Overall I would still highly recommend this game as it's certainly a franchise that will get better and better over time, especially as they push the PS3 processing power further than ever before.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2008"}

And when done right it shows what can be done for Nintendo's console. Before I bought this, I was really into Medal of Honor Heroes 2, another excellent FPS from Electronic Arts that I still play online and surprised to see people playing it online as well. Then I bought The Conduit and found it to be a fun game.The game features a single player mode and online multiplayer modes where you can play with and against other players from across the world. In the single player mode, you take control of a government agent who uncovers an alien conspiracy to take over the world, starting with the U.S. You befriend an alien being and fight through various stages against government soldiers and aliens as well as the aliens who invade Earth to take it over. You have access to numerous weapons and since the stages are rather long, the game places checkpoints so in case you lose you don't have to start at the beginning. In the online multiplayer modes, you connect online and choose from several game modes to play with other players or against them. You have access to the same weapons in the single player modes and based on your performance, you earn experience points to boost your rank.The PROS: graphics, music and sound effects are good; overall presentation immerses you into the story; Enemy A.I. is responsive and more challenging as you increase the difficulty level; weapons are cool to use and are great at blasting your enemies/online players; online multiplayer works well when it does.The CONS: story is decent but standard alien conspiracy/invasion fare so it doesn't stand out on its own; graphics get choppy when there is a lot of action resulting in considerate slowdown; online multiplayer problems lead to lots of lag and sometimes positioned me inside a wall at beginning of matches. A few times when I accessed the online mutiplayer section, it crashed my Wii. Also, hackers found ways to boost stats and cheat during online matches.Despite the flaws, The Conduit is still a good FPS that shows why the Wii is perfect for hosting these kind of games. With the sequel coming out in March 2011, you might want to rent this one to see what it's about or pick it up new or used if the price is right. I recommend checking this game out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2011"}

It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Joseph Mckinney","summary":"Challenging & Fun Action RPG","reviewText":"This game is hands-down the most challenging Action RPG I've played!

Again, I've broken the game up into categories:Graphics:  The incredible detail poured into the arenas, weapons, and characters is stunning.  While it doesn't completely dominate with its beauty in today's gaming era, it will surely impress.Sound:  A mixed bag.  First off, the music does not suit a fighting game.  Sweeping, dramatic, orchestrated tunes just don't seem to fit into the game's speedy battling.  The english characters voices are ho-hum, but not nearly as bad as other recent efforts.  Stick with the Japanese voices, people.  Sound effects, however, are amazing.  The clang of two blades clashing, the sound of Kilik's wooden staff connecting with a poor sap's head, the crack of Ivy's whip as it sings through the air.  It is indeed nice.Story:  Each character here has there own weird little back story.  Evil sword that can destroy the world, busty ninja wants to destroy it/capture it/demon pirate wants it, and so forth.  That's what makes the game so amusing, it's kinda interesting to delve into the story.  Can you find and claim the Soul Edge as your own???  Or will you be driven mad?  Make you think, huh?  Well, not really.Gameplay:  Pole vault over an enemy's head with your staff, then crack them over the head with it.  Entangle your foe with your bladed whip and slice them a new one (or two, or twelve.)  Heft a demonic sword over your head and bring it down with earth-shattering force in a wave of flame.  This game has too many memorable moments to keep track of.  You can spend weeks here experimenting with new characters, learning their moves and stances and figuring out ways to string together said moves in dozens of devilish ways.  With over twenty different characters to choose from, at least 30 or more moves for each, ten weapons for each, and a dozen modes to try out, there's a lot of replay value here.  Weapon master mode is surprisingly deep; once you finish the far-too-easy normal chapters, you can fight in several new chapters and the aneurysm-causing-frustratingly-evil extra missions.  That's another thing, a good game keeps you frustrated.  The game sometimes pulls out all the stops to keep you from progressing, leading you to many stressful-but-ultimately-rewarding moments.The Bad Stuff:  Albeit scarce, there are problems.  The frustrating moments can be bad in addition to rewarding.  Some of you will want to rip the disc out of the game and smash it to bits.  The hugely touted Link, the GC's exclusive character, is the worst in the game.  His moves are simply NOT cool, and his projectiles are the source of much of the stress I dicussed earlier.  Most importantly, the game WILL get boring if you have no one to play with.  Single-player lasts only so long.  If you have a couple of friends to play with, this game could keep you going for years.  Also, the game is addicting.  VERY.  As in you won't be able to get stuff done for days on end.So apart from a few flaws, this game is a true classic that shall endure through the ages.  The problem is that now there is very little to improve on for Soul Cali 3.  I'm sure they'll think of something.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2003"}

I've always been into PlayStation consoles but recently decided to buy some games for my stepson's Xbox 360.  I was running out of PS3 games to play and I'm putting off buying a PS4 until there's more games available.  Anyway, I've heard so much about this series that it was an easy decision to start off with this game.  I found it to have clunky controls, annoying segments where you can die way too easily, and overall just mediocre gameplay.  I did like the story and the graphics are pretty decent.  The cover system and other aspects that were somewhat pioneered by the GOW series are things that I've became accustomed to in many more recent games so since I didn't play this game before that was common, I was not surprised or awed by the features.  I've beat the game and have moved on to GOW2 which I find to be much better and smoother in almost every way.  I've gone back and played many games that were supposed to be grand for their day and have been surprised and enjoyed many of them.  This isn't one of them. I'm glad I played it just to get the experience and story but I can't say that I'll play it again.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2014"}

Although the PlayStation is no longer the fastest machine on the market, it does boast the broadest selection of software. Some of the hottest console games available today are created exclusively for the PlayStation, including several modern-day video gaming classics (Metal Gear SolidandCrash Bandicootto name a few).The Sony PlayStation truly shines with 3D-rendered action games, such asTomb RaiderandSyphon Filter. These and other 3D-based titles place players in the middle of elaborate gaming environments that take full advantage of the system's ability to render up to 360,000 polygons per second. The PlayStation also has the capability to display 16.8 million colors simultaneously and can support full-frame video playback at 30 frames per second. In addition to impressive graphics, the PlayStation also offers CD-quality sound. Each PlayStation disc has the capacity to store up to 650 MB of data--significantly more information than can be stored on cartridge-based games. As an added bonus, the PlayStation will even play your favorite music CDs (accompanied by a selection of cool graphics).Additionally, the PlayStation now comes packed with Sony's impressive dual shock controller, which allows players to feel every punch, kick, and rumble during gameplay. The controller features dual-analog thumb joysticks and round rubber grips for improved game control and comfort. Separate accessories that could enhance the PlayStation experience include an additional controller--allowing two-player action--and a memory card so players can save their progress in a game.--Brett Atwood","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"it's been nearly 15 years and the PS1 is *still* extremely awesome","reviewText":"It's VERY disappointing to me personally that people insist on moving forward when it comes to video games and quickly putting the gaming consoles of the past behind them forever.Come on, I grew up in the days of the NES when I was a child in the late 80's and early 90's.  I was forced to play the same few games over and over for *years* because there wasn't much in the way of variety back in those days.But you know what?  I wasn't angry about that.  Not at all.  This meant I learned to appreciate games for a LOT more than just a couple hours of fun.  I learned to accept video games back then for all the graphical flaws I encountered, or any kind of gameplay problem.  I learned to IGNORE all that stuff and just have fun playing the GAME and having a great time.I see kids today who look absolutely *determined* to forget about the Playstation 1 and 2 and buy whatever new video game console is cool these days.  Let me tell you something- back in the 90's, for at least four years, it was considered VERY cool to own a Playstation 1.  This is because game companies kept pumping out one wonderful game after another.Sure, there were some average games on the PS1, and plenty of crappy games as well.  But the same can be said for ANY video game console.  Why should we focus on the less than spectacular games when reviewing a video game system anyway?  It's completely pointless because ALL consoles have their share of average and terrible games.  Every single one of them.Sony's successful Playstation console was just EXCELLENT if you ask me.  Making the decision to keep the PS1 for over 12 years now and not only play the console, but keep the PS1 HOOKED UP to my TV for all these years really means the games must have been good.  And they *are* good.  REALLY good games.In addition to having a CD player built into the Playstation console for all your music needs, I have to say the CD player is actually a step above most CD players out there because the one built into the PS1 is apparently a heavy duty player that can actually play through HEAVILY scratched discs without a problem.I put in an old Stooges CD called Fun House that's almost unplayable on other CD players, but it works brilliantly in the PS1.  Honestly, the music CDs work a lot better in the PS1 than they do in an actual Sony CD player!  I had a couple Sony CD players that never played the discs right so in the trash without hesitation THOSE CD players went.How about memory cards?  You can buy a memory card for less than 5 bucks for your PS1 console.  I am totally serious about that.  What a FANTASTIC price to store your memory for your many video game adventures.  Trust me, you'll need a memory card for all the fairly long games available for the PS1.I'm also SICK TO DEATH of all these complicated video games out there today that require pressing TOO MANY buttons just to make the character perform an action that can *easily* be mastered on the Playstation 1.  No, you do NOT need extreme and precise accuracy just to shoot a guy in the arm when you can perform a similar action playing a first person shooter on the PS1, such as the Medal of Honor series.That leads us to the PS1 controller.  It's a *perfect* controller in every single way.  You can easily remember the buttons on the controller, and where they are located in critical moments so you won't make any mistakes.Most importantly, it's VERY easy to allow your fingers to reach over to another button and press it easily without any inconvenience.  I'm talking about NO problems doing so.  This... THIS is why the PS1 is a brilliant video game system.  No annoying analog sticks getting in the way of your commands.  No awkwardly placed buttons on the controller making your gaming adventure turn into a nightmare.  NONE OF THAT!All these games people criticize today for being old and unplayable such as the Silent Hill and Resident Evil series... give me a *break*.  You have to give these kind of games a chance so your brain and fingers can learn to adjust to the way they play, and I *promise* you'll learn to find that moving your character around is very easy.  It's all about giving things a chance and taking the time to understand the way they are.The Playstation 1 has MANY *extremely* good games available that are pretty affordable and definitely playable.  Sure, most of the games are slightly shorter than the games you will find on the Wii, PS3, or Xbox, but who cares?  You'll have so much fun playing them that you'll probably be back to play through them again, I guarantee it.  I must have played through Silent Hill and Castlevania: SOTN over 100 times.And no, it's NOT just RPG games that are worth playing either.  PLENTY of shooting games that you'll have a surprising amount of fun playing through, such as the Medal of Honor and Resident Evil series, Silent Hill, Dino Crisis 2, Quake II, Doom, MDK, all kinds of Mega Man games, and who knows what else.  There's just *so many games* to choose through, games that should be memorable for years and years and YEARS!  Perhaps the very best game on the Playstation is a platform/adventure game called Spyro the Dragon.  The best game EVER made maybe?Simply put- if you ignorantly write off the Playstation 1 for being old and outdated and assume that means the games are unplayable, you are flat out *wrong* in my eyes.  All this fancy digital, high def, high resolution stuff available for your televisions *just* to play a video game makes me sick to my stomach.  It means it's alright for video games to be bad because as long as they LOOK good, people will buy them anyway.  Absolutely disgusting.  Buy the PS1 and start a collection of EXCITING games.Oh, and that leads me to conclude that the coolest, neatest, greatest thing about the Playstation 1 console is that you can buy one for under 20 bucks.  20 bucks for HOURS of exciting gameplay?  Count me in!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2009"}

This game is awesome, it is a super fast paced, 3 on 3 superhero tag team tournament and boy does it keep you mesmerized.While the price of the game here on amazon may be alittle steep, I definately think that any PS2 gamer who loves fighting games should get this game.  If you play MVC2, than you go and pop in Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter afterwards, you will be absolutely bored with the latter two, as they are so slow and sluggish compared to MVC.  Sure there is no blood in MVC, and the music is absolutely horrendous, but the game play is fantastic.You get to choose from a given number of marvel and capcom heros, and you can mix and match them anyway you want for 3 on 3 combat.  As you gain points you can spend them to buy hidden characters as well as  hidden levels, and extras.  Also, they give you an awesome crew of fighters to choose from, I mean how can you go wrong with Omega Red or Akuma or Juggarnaut (I wish they made apocalypse a playable char).  Sure there are a few crummy fighters, like who cares about Ruby or Amingo, but for the most part the characters are great.I can not stress enough how awesome and how much fun this game is!

{"product_name":"B0050SZ836","description":"","reviewerName":"Moviedude","summary":"More mayhem and surprisingly more heart as well","reviewText":"Borderlands 2 picks up right where the first game left off- you are a treasure hunter roaming the wastes of space-Australia, and you must help the scattered settlements of civilized folk survive against hordes of bandits, monstrous creatures, and the robot army of an evil businessman. All of this translates to almost nonstop gun battles against vivid, colorful comic-book environments with an arsenal of millions of randomly generated guns. Borderlands 2 takes everything that made Borderlands great and amps it up to 11- more enemies, bigger levels, better guns, and crazier skills for each character class. The character progression mechanic (learn a variety of passive skills and mods to one basic active skill to unlock ever higher tiers) is the same as in BL1, but the classes (and most of their skills) are all new.Crucially, multiplayer has been strongly revised for the better this time around. Gamespy and all its lag are gone in favor of Steam servers, while there are more skills than ever to buff and heal teammates. There's also a 4-person vehicle now so your whole team can ride in style. Netplay sessions between teammates with good connections will be remarkably smooth, although all players are required to be in the same level.Special mention should go to the downloadable content- a fifth (extremely fun) class can be had for a measly 10 bucks, and a season pass for the game's 4 planned add-on packs can be had, which will cause each DLC to appear magically upon release like new magazines.So Borderlands 2 is all that and a bag of chips. But what really sets it apart, surprisingly, is character. Even the smallest sidequest is now supported with plenty of voice acting and unique elements, NPCs are much more numerous and talkative than before, and it's a genuine treat to see the player characters from the first game realized here as well-developed and entertaining cast members. For all the goofball humor of the game, parts of Borderlands are also surprisingly dark, and the sparing use of emotional bleakness makes these grim bits unexpectedly effective. If the first Borderlands was stupid good fun, this game is real quality comedy with some very effective drama.Top off all of Borderlands 2's gameplay advantages and compelling story with gobs of secrets, endgame raid bosses, and the replay value inherent in a class-driven RPG, and you have a recipe for a game that will last you a lot longer than this year's other hotly anticipated PC RPG sequel.PROS:-Bottomless content to explore-Beautiful environments (not just deserts this time) and stunningly rendered violence-Well done writing and tons of voicework-Ongoing support through (affordable) DLC-Smooth, engaging multiplayer-Unlike most ARPGs, Borderlands 2 is in no way shy about showering you in awesome gear-Challenge is satisfyingly increased over the easier first game-MORE CL4p-TPCONS:-Graphics enhancements do not seem to justify the higher requirements-Many sidequests can glitch near completion, forcing you to restart them at a later time-Driving still feels a little unintuitive-Elemental damage is stronger, and enemy resistances more specific, than ever before, meaning a great gun with no elemental damage is generally useless-Some of the new classes lack the pizzaz of the original 4-Not ENOUGH of CL4P-TPOTHER THOUGHTS:-You get some extra character customizations if there are BL1 saves on your PC when you install this one-The Golden Keys aren't just a premium club gimmick, they DO drop in-game. Save them for level 50!-This game probably has more to do than any other shooter I've ever played. There's a hidden quest that consists purely of walking from one end of the game to the other. That's it.-With guns that explode your enemies into melting gobs of goo, enemies who threaten to do downright indecent things to your face, and a storyline that's about 50% torture and backstabbing, this is not a game for kids. Which is a shame cause I still would have loved it as a 10-year-old. Possibly MORE than I do now.-If you plan to buy this, play BL1 first. It's a great game with good backstory for this one, but once you play this game you won't much want to go back.UPDATEWith some DLC under my belt, I feel comfortable talking about the new campaigns. Captain Scarlet has some genuinely beautiful level design to it, and some fun boss fights, but the story feels a little meh. Newcomers Shade and Scarlet are pretty funny though. Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage is much more solid, and features a tournament plot, an industrial setting, and tons of replayable combat events. There's a particularly fun battle with an armored blimp that stands out as well. So far it is by far the most complete DLC, featuring the most quests, side missions, and new voice acting. It channels a lot of BL1's aimless crudity, to good effect.Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt is a mixed bag. The new hub area, Hunter's Grotto, is probably the biggest single area in BL2, and the whole expansion features good art as well as some new weather and atmospheric effects. That said, the whole campaign can be beaten in around an hour. It is definitely shorter than Scarlet or Torgue, which is a shame when the new areas are so well designed. The plot is also a little thing for this being the first DLC to specifically FOLLOW the main campaign. Like all the DLC, this one introduces 2 raid bosses: a boring one who you fight in an arena and who just explodes at you nonstop, and a fun one you fight over a huge area in a vehicle (if you so choose).There is 1 DLC left in the season pass, and Gearbox has all but vowed more to come. So far all the DLC has been fun but none of it quite as outstanding or lengthy as Secret Armory.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00DC7G2W8","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Defying Gravity (And Expectations)","reviewText":"Today's gaming marketplace demands innovation. Personally, I don't innovation is entirely necessary in all aspects of game development, yet there's a large number of people crying for &#34;next-gen&#34; games like entitled children. These people want lifelike graphics that pull them into the experience, and new gameplay that's unlike anything they've ever seen before. Never mind the fact that something entirely lifelike is pretty much impossible and things that get close would dip extremely into the uncanny valley, and that if every game played in some new, crazy way, less people would feel compelled to buy them out of fear of not being able to access them as easily. Yet publishers still trot out games with all of these features... at least, you know, games that promise to have these features. The hype builds, people preorder, the game's released and it's completely ordinary, but you're so convinced that you're playing something new and &#34;next-gen&#34; that you're blind to any criticisms, and by the time you realize you've been playing almost the exact same kind of game for years, it's too bloody late and the publisher has your money lining their fat pockets. Ah, the modern game industry in a nutshell.What does this rant have to do with Nintendo's latest entry in their uniformly fun racing franchise? Actually, it has everything to with it. See, the current AAA landscape is reliant on smoke and mirrors. Pretty trailers get released at E3 or some other big gaming expo, with cherry-picked footage that's nowhere even close to indicative of what the final product is going to look like. Still, people preorder this game as soon as they see one trailer, just so they can get in on whatever arbitrary reward the publisher is going to hand their loyal little lapdogs. The sad thing is, this game isn't going be anywhere nearly as good as the hype is setting it up to be, and people are just be suckered into something ordinary that claims to be &#34;truly next-gen&#34; or &#34;groundbreaking.&#34; On the flip side, though, there are games that simply come out, are honest with what they do, and anything else they have is just icing on the already satisfying cake.One such example is &#34;Mario Kart 8.&#34; Let's face it, you've probably played an entry in this series once or twice in your life, even if you don't care much for video games. If not, you've almost certainly heard of it. And because of this familiarity, you know exactly what you're going to get. Mario, Peach and other cast members from Nintendo's biggest franchise are going to commandeer vehicles, drive around a cavalcade of colorful and wacky courses, and try to murder each other with turtle shells, bombs, and banana peels. For the franchise, that's a blessing and a curse. You immediately know what you're going to do, but once a formula gets used so many times without many changes or refinements, it can get stale. &#34;Mario Kart 7&#34; was a good game, but it was nothing great, and &#34;Mario Kart Wii,&#34; despite the inclusion of motorcycles, wasn't anything particularly amazing in my opinion. The last truly great entries, to me, were &#34;Mario Kart: Double Dash&#34; and &#34;Mario Kart DS,&#34; with the former offering up novel hooks with vehicle statistics and two racers to a kart, and the latter introducing worldwide online play to the series for the very first time.And so with this newest entry, I'm pleased to say that almost every single change that has ever been made to the series is present here. Not only that, but they've been refined to almost absolute perfection, and when you're done marveling at all of the new bells and whistles, you'll realize that this still the same wonderful cartoon racer you've been playing for years, just done exceedingly well and arguably better than it ever has been. It cannot be described in words how much fun &#34;Mario Kart 8&#34; is, but because there's not a substitute for words here, I'll try my best.Players are given 32 tracks to run amok on, half of which are new, and half of which are old courses that are so remixed they might as well be new additions as well. There's a large roster of characters, and despite the questionable usage of every Koopaling known to man, they're a pretty diverse bunch that are fun to play as. You pick a vehicle body, wheels, and a glider, and then you're good to go race. Each little modification actually does make a noticeable difference, affecting things from acceleration, handling, and traction. There are definitely some modifications where I can feel my kart or motorcycle handling differently, or speeding up more quickly, and it's really nice to see that the customization brought over from MK7 has been tweaked and handled better here. Bonus props for bringing back motorcycles and effectively balancing them this time around.The actual racing is simply the best it's ever been. Vehicles handle like a dream, the controls tight and responsive to even the slightest twitch of the thumb. Drifting feels more precise and controlled than it ever has, and varies wildly depending on which vehicle you're using. Do you want a tighter turn, or more room to adjust your kart? These are things you're going to have to ask yourself when choosing a vehicle. On top of that, the item selection is perhaps the most balanced in series history, with an item existing that can, at long last, take out the dreaded blue shell. The boomerang flower is also a nice medium ground between red and green shells, giving players three chances to knock another racer out before it flies off without returning. And while some may complain that the Bullet Bill power-up is back, I still find it a really great tool for keeping races interesting and keeping players in the top slots on their toes.Of course, there's one thing I haven't talked about yet, and that's the addition of &#34;anti-gravity&#34; gameplay. This is one of the three big changes Nintendo has made to the franchise, and it works beautifully. There's no silly gimmick or throwaway mechanics involved. Most tracks simply have sections where players will either drive on the wall, up the wall, upside down, or in some type of bizarre corkscrew motion. Many tracks have diverging paths with this feature, with some players remaining grounded while the opposition whizzes by above them. It's a new feature that I really hope will be kept for future iterations, because it makes racing so much more interesting than it has been in the past.The last two big changes come in the form of the online multiplayer and the overhauled battle mode. Firstly, the online features are a welcome change from the barebones offerings we saw in DS, Wii and 7. Everything is organized quite nicely, players can chat with a preset box of greetings, taunts and questions, and people can even host their own tournaments. Not only that, but with the MKTV feature, players can upload highlights of their races, edited however they want. Yes, the editing tools are a little scant, but they work and give players a quick, easy way to show off their skills and upload them to YouTube and the MiiVerse, which, given the diverse audience bound to be playing this game, is probably for the best.In terms of the battle mode changes, I can't help but feel a tinge of disappointment. There are no more arenas in &#34;Mario Kart 8.&#34; Instead, players are given eight racing courses from the main game to duke it out on, and the problem with that is the courses are way too big for anything less than four to five players. Clearly, this was a move designed for the online battles, which can host up to 12 players, but as the numbers thin, the battles become less about frantically hurling items and more about hoping you can find the opposition before time runs out. This feels like an incredibly lazy move, and while it doesn't damper the rest of the package, it certainly doesn't add anything to it.One questionable mode notwithstanding, &#34;Mario Kart 8&#34; feels like a complete package in the gameplay department. It's definitely not hurt by the visuals which ar,e almost indescribably beautiful. I can hear the graphics snobs screaming from a mile away about &#34;polygon counts&#34; or &#34;frames per second,&#34; but I'm going to stake whatever reputation I have on this site and say that these are some of the best graphics I've seen in any title so far on the WiiU, PS4 or XBOne, in terms of how vibrant and aesthetically pleasing they are overall. Each level is overloaded with color, all of them completely different and interesting to look at, and most of them full of some kind of life, whether it be piranha plants that shrivel up when you hit them with items, or crates that smash open, or cones that get knocked about when hit. Quite honestly, I had no idea a game on this system could be this beautiful, and it's impressed me more in the looks department than 90% of what I've seen on my PS4 or WiiU thus far.That, coupled with fantastic music, unique animations for every character, and whole other host of little A/V touches, helps bring &#34;Mario Kart 8&#34; whizzing past the finish line, doing a victory lap around its competitors. Everything here works exactly like it's supposed to, and then some. The controls are perfect, the graphics are great, the music is wonderful, the courses are fun... I could go on, but it would be easier to just say that this game is a winner in almost every department, and not even a lackluster battle mode can bring it down.This is where &#34;Mario Kart&#34; has been heading since its inception. A game that's accessible for everyone, but deep and fun enough for more veteran players. Multiplayer that can be played and enjoyed by everyone, whether it be on the couch with some friends or across the globe from each other. Something that's cute yet competitive, whimsical yet very grounded and polished. This is the absolute best the franchise has ever been in terms of mechanics and looks, and I can see this game having a lasting appeal over a decade from now, much like the classic N64 incarnation of this franchise. Simply put, &#34;Mario Kart 8&#34; is an absolute triumph for Nintendo, and one of the strongest reasons to rush out and buy a WiiU. Despite the disappointing battle mode holding it back from sheer perfection, that would be a very bogus reason indeed to pass up hopping in a kart and chucking some turtle shells at your buddies.&#34;Mario Kart 8&#34; is one of the best games of the year so far, and I suspect I'll feel the same when compiling my year-end favorites, because I hazard to say I'll still be enjoying it even then.Score: 9.75","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2014"}

MW2 can't seem to decide what kind of game it is.  For veterans of other Call of Duty and Medal of Honor games, MW2 will feel incredibly twitchy and hyper right from the beginning.  The speed and pace of the game feels more like Quake or Unreal, but you still have to aim down the iron-sight to get any sort of accuracy with your gun.  Because your movement and field of view is limited while aiming down the iron-sight, you'll find yourself spasming back and forth between aiming and running.It doesn't help that many levels are filled with enemies who seem to spawn endlessly making it impossible to \"clear\" areas before moving forward.  This was annoying in the original MW, but it's even more apparent in MW2.  In order to complete levels, you have to just run to checkpoints, regardless of how many enemies are left in the area.  On some levels (like an army base), this kind of design makes sense but on others, it just feels downright stupid.Basically, if you liked Modern Warfare and the older CoD or MoH games, don't buy MW2.  I've been a big fan of modern military shooters since the original Medal of Honor and I've enjoyed every iteration of Call of Duty until now.  Modern Warfare 2 sucks.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2011"}

Why am I a hacker?Knute: Well, here at Valve, all users are guilty of hacking until proven \"not so guilty\"; its our policy.Me: Oh, that explains \"Steam\". Well let's talk about the new game HalfLife 2 Episode One. When I finally got to play the game, it was great but..Knute: Wait a minute, you figured out how to install it? YOU ARE A HACKER!Me: No, I just realized that I had to uninstall all the Steam software that was already running on my PC first-Knute: Let me guess, you installed Steam where you wanted, not the default location?Me: Yeah, well it is my PC after all. Anyway, I was able to install Steam, then I re-installed Half-Life 2 then this game-Knute: But you still had to download the actual game, The DVD just contains just a few pieces of Episode 1. It may be your PC but the game will never really be yours, Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha! So Hacker, were you able to download and decrypt the game?Me: Yes I was eventually but it took a while. I still resent having to log onto a web server to play a single player game, this seems kind of crazy. And what about giving us gamers some clear instructions?Knute: Next you'll be asking to be treated like a customer. Clear installation instructions would be like giving you hackers free access to the source code. That is why we bury the Episode One executable in a hidden folder deep inside your PC.Me: Knute, the game also crashed a lot, many graphical glitches.Knute: That's a new game feature we call \"sucker-vision\", we updated/fixed that feature in Episode Two. Want to guess at how to get this patch now? I can't tell you directly but here is a clue:\"jhusyow848eokfjcnciej * 125 / 6\"..Me: I'll pass. Also, the game is awfully short.Knute: We here at Valve have determined that selling a game in 80 short parts for twenty bucks a piece is better than selling a game in 2 parts for 40 bucks each. But we pass that savings on to the consumer.Me: Really? How?Knute: We will be bundling the next chapter of Half-life 2 with a free retina scanner and a DNA sampler. This technology will make the game more secure and fun-fun-fun!Me: Sounds awful. Is there any way to play this single player game off-line? I just want a few hours of fun minus the aggravation.Knute: Yes, but that would be telling, Har-Har-Har!

Web slinging feels real, you can control yourself in mid-air very easily, and if there are no tall buildings around you have to come down to a level where your webs stick.Combat is fantastic. Not too simple not too hard, with amazing mid-ar combat and wall combat which is not that hard to get good at. Finally it IS Spidey. They did a MUCH better job than any of the movies or games before this of actually getting Peter Parker as spidey. It is just a fantastically fun game to play.I have a few small gripes.

I mean at first I wasn't into the plot(I started getting sucked into it as soon as I got to Disc 2)and the game aswell but after a few hours of playing I WAS HOOKED, now as I stated before I am not an RPG gamer but this game had one of those really cool anime/type plots and the turned base battles were pretty cool.  The gameplay was pretty fun and I was always excited to see were the game would take me next, the dialoug IF YOU ASK me was a little dumb, I mean just because Barret is african american every most of the things he says has to always be spelled differently and have 4 letter words?  Ok I'm done gripping.  Other then Plot and gameplay, I really liked how the materia/magic worked aswell as the summons(man they are such a treat to look at).  And I think I'm going abit too far but I thought the CG scenes(though very limited in the game)were beautiful.  As for visuals, I don't see why people are saying this games visuals are terrible this game was made back in the mid 90's!!!  I thought the visuals were great!  And the pre rendered backrounds were great aswell!  Stop complaining it's an old game!Now audio....I kid you not, after beating this game I downloaded almost every song from the game(Cosmo Canyon is by far one of my favorite songs ever played on a video game!!!).  The music is just beautiful, the song played in cosmo canyon is let alone a reason to get the game sountrack as well as the final battle with Sepheroth.  The best part about the audio is they fit perfectly well for every scenario/area/battle.  I do plan on buying this games soundtrack when I have the time..Now being my first RPG I don't know what to expect but I'll say it anways..my first time through this game was pretty long, I never went through EVERY SIDE QUEST but I did do a few cause I was a little paranoid that I'd mess up, from random battles to leveling up, Boss battles to getting to every place/land/cave that I went through to progress through this great game and my length went down to a total of 57 hours, so yes you bet your sweet keester that your first time through this game will take awhile, as it is spanning 3 discs.  Ok I'm getting tired lets just get this over withThe Good-I LOVE THE MUSIC IN THIS GAME-The CG in this game is just wonderful-Why are people complaining about visuals, they get a 9 on my book.. well for it's time atleast..-The Turn based battles were pretty fun-Omnislash.....nuff said-The Summons were a treat to see(VIVA LA BAHUMUT ZERO!)-I loved all the characters so much in this game, it's like you cared for them and really wanted them to just survive through the game, especially Red XII(My favorite Character in the game)-3 disc, more then 40 hours of gameplay and tons of stuff to do to extend the time period of the games lengthThe bad-I would...seriously, no joke, just jump out of my seat when a random battle happend, I think it's cause I had my volume very high-The random battles do get annoying-I thought leveling up did get pretty annoying and boring at parts(I was worried that I had to be in a certain level so I can be strong enough for a boss so I'd spend like 50% of the game leveling up)Other then that I really liked this game, I loved the music, visuals, story, especially the characters and the whole world/atmosphere was beautiful and there isn't anything that really botherd me except for a few boss battles...other then that this is a must own for the Playstation.

My adult self is very close to feeling that way. The game has a character who controls very well, a camera that rarely causes problems, practically no load times, and gameplay sequences that blend together very well. Naughty Dog slowly introduces the player to Jak and Daxter's world before increasing the challenge level, and even then the game is never frustrating. What the kid in me loves most of all is the smart-mouthed character, Daxter, who is just as loveable as similar characters such as Donkey in Shrek. Naughty Dog wisely includes elements that both children and adults will find appealing.The game's world is pretty to look at and stretches as far as the horizon. Visually it is very nice to look at. The screenshots, of course, look great, but they're nothing compared to seeing the game in motion. Everything comes to life. To add to that, the game moves seamlessly due to the lack of load screens that generally bog down post-cartridge game consoles.The game has a nice variety of gameplay styles. Along with the running and jumping that comes with the platformer genre, there are vehicular sections, some fun moments with the \"eco\" you can power yourself up with, some fishing, and more. Each section is well done. The eco is an important part of the game, and there are four types: green, blue, red, and yellow. Green refills your life, and in one section it plays another neat role. The blue increases your speed, triggers certain platforms, and also attracts collectible items to you. Red increases your strength and reaching distance, handy for situations with hard-to-hit little buggers. And yellow causes you to be able to fire out some yellow eco balls, and, of course, these sections are very fun and cool.The main problem I have with Jak and Daxter is it's length. I like my adventure games to be of a good length of maybe, 20 or so hours. This cuts that in half, giving you a 10-hour adventure, which is a shame. I wish it was at least three times that long. My other real problem is the occasional annoying track on the soundtrack. In some areas, the music is a bit annoying. Otherwise, though, the music is superb.This is a rare example of a game that is lots of fun without feeling the need to increase its challenge to such a high level that you're pulling your hair out. It takes some real skill to make a game like this, and I wish there were more like it. It's unfortunate that the later outings in the series turn into more serious ventures, becoming dark and broody games rather than bright and cheery ones like this. I guess that's what gamers are looking for nowadays.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0000DJX7I","description":"Praised for brilliant scripts and open-ended gameplay, vilified for unapologetic violence and mature themes,Grand Theft Autohas deservedly become one of the most popular game franchises in history. This double pack contains the full versions of bothGrand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto III: Vice City, enhanced for Xbox. Xbox gamers can rejoice that the grand king of video games--The Sopranoswith a gamepad--is finally available on the big black box.Grand Theft AutoWithGrand Theft Auto IIIRockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games. This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action. InVice Citythis is--to use a clich&#xE9; that is for once apropos--taken to a whole new level.--David StoeszPros:Open-ended gameplay; player can chose to be relatively law-abiding or engage in wanton virtual destructionVaried missionsBrilliant scripts with Hollywood voice actingRocking sound track (also available in our Music store)Xbox-enhanced graphicsCons:As theThe Sopranosof games,GTA 3draws unwanted attention from overzealous legislatorsNo multiplayer","reviewerName":"Les Paul \"Foolio\"","summary":"Good game...

Blanton","summary":"The best WW2 similator out there now!","reviewText":"I agree with everybody about the multiplayer in the game. It is simply awesome! First of all the original C of D multiplayer was simply awesome and in this game it's even better here's why:Now you can drive tanks or be the machine gunner on top just like BF1942 but driving and shooting is a lot more fun! The tanks have more fire power than BF1942 and you can shot quicker it seems?There is now deployable machine guns in this game. I have found they are great if you can find a good place with a view to set up and mowe down anyone going by but just running around on the maps and looking for people to shot can be inefective to say the least because if you do spot someone they have the advantage because they can just aim and shot you but you have to right-click to set up the gun then load in most cases and then left-click to fire so by the time you do all this your dead from a Thompson gun carring soldier.You can also shoot anti-tank weapons like a American Bazooka or the German's copy of the weapon. Which leaves tanks very vulnarable for destruction. You can also fire canons at tanks, buildings and soldiers which is fun. In all reality this is BF1942 all over again but 10X better. You can drive Jeeps to. The only thing you can't drive in the game is Airplanes but this is a ground combat game and besides BF1942 can have thier planes because even if you got one off the ground you couldn't hit anything due to going to fast or stay in the air very long without crashing into something because the controls were to hard!As mentioned by a previous reviewer, flame throwers were added and if you want to find one you will most likely have to kill the guy who is carring one. I did on the Berlin map. So make note of that.All and all, this game is awesome. Single player is in my persective is a lot harder unlike what another reviewer said. He must be some ex-millitary guy or something because I found it very challenging especially the first battle in the game. I am currently on the second mission and have no ammo in the middle of a fire fight and that's not good! Yes, single player is th e same thing as the original but why change something that's already great? Just add some new weapons and different maps and battles and go with it. I think people expect to much out of games especially expansion packs. If the orginal game was a success then the expansion must be ten times better..............wrong! You guys need to live in reality. There is nothing wrong with this game at all except it being short but it's a expansion pack! Not a entire game! Come on guys get real!Anyway, enough venting I just get tired of people wanting the moon and stars to boot out of games. Oviously they never seen the pregression of game through the years and how far they have come since the day of pong?One last line in responce to Joel's review. Joel, I had the same problem with my single player in fact I couldn't even get the game installed on my PC because of a missing game file so I returned the game to EB and got a new one and it works like a charm now! I don't know if that's what you will have to do but make sure you install the (1.4) patch for the game or it won't run at all which is the latest patch version out right now.Here I come Star Wars Battlefront!

{"product_name":"B00BGAA29M","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Filler with Love","reviewText":"Knack was one of our PS4 launch title mainly, at the time, because new consoles need games and because we trusted that the game's creative director, Mark Cerny who is also PS4's lead architect would produce something good. A couple of months later, Knack is still played in our house mainly by our 10 year old and she loves it.So, let's discuss the game's qualities and shortcomings. Knack is meant to be an early showcase of what the PS4 can do and in that respect it succeeds but not completely. It is great at demonstrating the PS4's handling of particle effects with the game's main character recreating itself out of hundreds or little pieces swirling around and the PS4 does with apparent ease something that would have for sure caused frame drops on a previous generation console. The graphics are crisp but the cartoonish theme does not allow the game to show how well PS4 handles details, shading or facial expressions. The game plays well and the controls are responsive but, again, I've never had the impression that the console's capabilities were stretched in any way.As far as the plot/story is concerned well... our 10 year old likes playing the game. Since it's always robot vs. robot, violence, destruction and enemy annihilation don't seem to bother her, especially since her previous 'big' console game was BRAVE which was a lot darker and more gruesome. She loves the fact that the PS4 makes it so easy to co-op. Me or one of her brothers can easily drop in and out of her game whenever she needs a little assistance or just for fun and that does make the game more fun.Yes, I know that many so-called professional game critics decided that Knack is one of those game it's 'safe' to constantly joke about. I doubt that they spent much time actually playing the game and I suspect that they spent a lot of time parroting each other. The fact is that, as simple and straightforward as the plot may be, the game has a lot of depth, it can be played for many, many hours and you can adjust the difficulty to match your skills and your motivation.Overall, I would say that this is not a perfect game but it CAN be fun, especially for someone new to console gaming. Actually finishing the game and getting all the trophies may feel like a chore because there's so much to do but I'm sure that there would be people complaining if the game was shorter. We had most fun when playing co-op. Knack may not be the bestest PS4 game so far but it's a good, challenging and fun game, especially if you buy it for your pre-teen kids.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2014"}

Blending unique gameplay, humorous characters and interactions, and the aforementioned graphics,Munch's Oddyseesimply feels unlike any other game in the 2001 console gaming lineup. Players control two characters in the game: Munch, a wheelchair-bound hero, and Abe, a character some gamers will recognize from previous Oddworld games. Their goal is to find and free the Mudokon queen, keeper of the remaining eggs of an endangered species.Both characters feature unique talents that, via a tag-team style of play, propel the player through the game. For instance, Abe can climb and jump to reach new areas, as well as temporarily possess an enemy's soul via a chant. The web-footed Munch can swim to new areas and, when on the roll in his wheelchair, use his sonar plug to control machinery remotely. Saving an entire race also requires a coordinated effort on everyone's part. To get the job done quickly, players can deliver verbal commands to kinsmen. They'll gladly greet you (in a witty manner), then gang up on a mean-spirited enemy or accomplish difficult tasks for you. As with the rest of the game world, the finely detailed characters and environments, as well as a refreshing charm, draw you into an experience with the quality of a Pixar film.

This also shows you how easy it is to interact with other characters in the game as you manuever around as either Abe or Munch. The graphics are what you would expect from Xbox, Amazing.

For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City.

Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience.

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs.

When I first purchased this game I didn't know what to expect but once I started to play I cannot stop playing...very addicting. I agree with the previous reviews, the game is short(about 8-10 hours of game play), but that shouldn't deter you to buy this game.By the way, one of the viewers was complaining a loud popping noise, he must have purchased a bad game disc, because I hear no popping or any other distortions coming from my game.I'm impressed with the sound and graphics from this game: music builds up the anticipation and the graphics gives great detail. Actually, I felt I was at the movies, because when you go on to these missions to achieve your objective you don't know what you're going to encounter. For example, at one level you're in Northern California and out of nowhere you see a invisible alien (know as chameleons) grab one of your comrades and tear him apart; therefore an errie sound builds up and all you can hear are giant footsteps running around you, which it's trying to target you at the right moment, but all you need to to do is shoot it with a single shot...With that said, if the creators of Resistance 2 decide to make Resistance 3, I hope they add co-op campaign, I feel it's missing a huge component along with the short play time.I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys FPS(First-Person Shooter) games, or those wants this to be their first FPS.FYI, there is NO online lag: you can play online with up to 60 players and you won't experience any lag.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2009"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"J. Urban \"U2fan4ever76\"","summary":"Resistance 2 - Better Than The Original","reviewText":"This is one of those few games that lived up to the hype for me. This game not only freshened up the graphics with some great textures and settings, but also gave quite a bit of diverse locations to fight the Chimeran invaders. Most of the negative reviews are from the typical Xbox fanboys who have too much time on their hands and post on PS3 boards and reviews. It's not a perfect game, but it is a thoroughly enjoyable one.I played the first Resistance and found myself immersed in a shooter that I wished had never ended--it was that addicting. Resistance 2 was more of the same and many complain it lacks new features, and I say why mess with a formula that works. The graphics are better, the settings are better, the enemies are better and more clever, and the storyline better.The shift in moving the game to the U.S. was much needed. Now there are lush forests, big sprawling cities, etc., and the muted colors of the old game are few and far between. This is one sharp-looking game.The variety of weapons is much the same with a few new ones throw in (or updated versions of old ones). As with most shooters, you find your favorites and stick with them or use ones you know work most effective against certain enemy-types.The music and sound effects are all big-budget sci-fi movie-type and the story is good enough to keep you wondering what is going to happen next. (I will say the ending is abrupt and leaves one shaking their head, but then again, so do a lot of movies these days.)If I had to nitpick, it would be that some of the weapons are not that accurate, even when you are clearly targeting the enemy. (In particular, the Auger is supposed to allow you to see through solid material and target yellowish glows that represent the enemy; it is hit or miss most of the time, as to you seeing the enemy.) Also, the squad AI is really not there. Most times it seems like it's just you against the whole Chimeran army even with them by your side. Also, it is rather short at about 12hrs if you take your time. And like I mentioned above, the ending will leave some with a bad taste in their mouth.The trophies are plenty and 30-50% seem to be able to be obtained in the single player campaign and the others in co-op and multi-player.Overall, this is not an over-hyped game at all. It is what a sequel should be: an improvement over the original and one that keeps the elements that made the original so enjoyable.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2009"}

The storyline is too limited unlike the previous Halos. The gameplay is way too short, getting thru the first three game levels in 32hrs. Legendary will take forever.Weapon choices are limited where ammo becomes a clutch in top level. What I found to be disturbing were the numerous pay to use downloads. To buy the game at the previous selling price is a no go and waiting for a price drop was a no-brainer.I enjoyed playing thru the first 3 levels but it became so repetitive and boring, that I went back to ME3 with the addition of Omega download, became more challenging.IMHO, I was genuinely disappointed with the game as compared to the earlier Halos, though the graphics were superior, but that's it.

To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story.

In retrospect, ME2 has a much different feel that ME1. The sequel felt much darker and more chilling.Mass Effect 2 basically starts with a major twist and doesn't end there.  Players will encounter twists, turns, betrayals, and hard choices.  One thing you know about the ME series is that your choices MATTER.  If you kill or save a certain race or person, there will be repercussion for this in the next game.  I love that.As usual Bioware made each character a believable person, the voice acting was incredible, great replay value, and the storyline/dialogue was marvelous.  The gameplay was enjoyable and BW fixed the texture bugs of ME1.  Combat was fast paced and dramatic.I did, however, find the mineral scanning system somewhat boring and tedious.  After scanning the planet after five minutes, my finger holding down the trigger button begins to feel a surge of pain.  Please Bioware, if you must keep the scanner do speed up the process.  Besides that and little, minor bugs nothing else displeased me.Please, newcomers to this series, play the first game and then this one. I want you all to see the beauty of these games and the one arriving so soon.  As for those who have played ME2 and haven't got any DLC, I recommend \"The Shadow Broker's Lair\" and \"Arrival\". Both are crucial, and quite fun dare I say, to the story of ME3.Mass Effect 2 made the list of greatest games I have ever played and overall secured my rabid fangirlism of Bioware.  For being the wonderful game that it is, I declare ME2 deserving 5 out of 5 shining stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2012"}

I'm a completionist, and take great joy in scouring the game's world to find everything.  Somebody who wants to zip through as fast as possible, or anyone in between, will gave just as much fun.  The game rewards everything you try, and punishes nothing.For groups, the game reveals yet another layer of genius.  Play with skilled friends and it may become a race for collectibles or even to stay alive.  Play with children and you're in for a room full of laughter - a toddler is in heaven &#34;helping out&#34; on the gamepad, and a platforming novice will still be able to fumble through the levels, always having the option to float past a tricky part.  There are no lives, no continues, no game-overs.  If everybody messes up at once, you restart nearby.

There are two soccer goals and a bouncy ball.  Everybody pick a side and go!  It's silly, it's mayhem, and it's everything good about video games.This is something every single Wii U owner should have.

{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"Benjamin M. Cady \"Ben\"","summary":"About as great as everyone is making it out to be","reviewText":"There is this epic RPG set in space that was released about 5 years ago and I'm fairly ecstatic to have experienced this game.  The game is none other than Mass Effect on Xbox 360, a console which has infuriated me at times, while making me enamored with some of gamings finest experiences.  Moving on from the console it appears on (which is marginally important) the game itself is certainly an interesting one.  The player assumes the role of Commander Shepard and chooses the various aspects of the character (ranging from appearance and attributes to his/her background).  There are 6 classes that all range from the standard \"warrior\" type to the \"magic\" (or in this case biotic) type with a few in between.Now that you have chosen your attributes,  you will take on the role of Commander Shepard and he or she will begin the story.  The plot is standard in that it essentially involves a traitor to a counsel and the alliance at large.  The plot is propelled by the sense that the alliance largely disdains humanity and will not take the Commander very seriously, so one must do what it takes to gather the evidence that this being will eventually do his best to ally himself with those that will rule the universe and destroy life as it is currently known.  It should also be noted that one's choices in the form of dialogue within the  game dictate certain events and how the game ends, something to encourage multiple playthroughs.  Now that you've got a decent conception of the plot (guy lies, one person notices and does his best to call him out and one group of beings wants nothing more than anything and everything that is comprised of organic matter to be obliterated) let's talk about the combat, oh, the combat!The combat is dictated in part by what class one chooses for his/her playthrough of the game.  There are soldiers, vanguards (almost like a soldier but with some biotic abilities), Adepts (think mage), egineers (hackers), infiltrators (hackers and soldiers), and sentinals (mages and hackers).  All of the various abilities one has are accessed by a pressing a button that brings a wheel on screen; if the ability isn't mapped, one can map it, if you don't want to, there is the option to simply use a given ability.  This is simple and breezy, it accompanies the shooting mechanics quite nicely, at that.  The combat is extremely responsive and the amount of detail that goes into crafting and upgrading one's character is easy and joyous.  On a side note, it would behoove the player to invest in skills they find to be relevant, as upgrades tend to be a blast (sometimes quite literally).  This is the apotheosis of the action RPG.The above elements coalesce into a fun and enriching experience.  The tales of intrigue, romance (if you so choose to engage in this, of course) and betrayal are all present and accounted for in this shooting space RPG romp.  The graphics for the time are great, the music perfectly fits the tone and the game really makes the player care about the universe of said game. Games like this ask one thing of the player, and that is to enjoy it, and that I've done.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2012"}

No Multiplayer :(","reviewText":"I'll admit, I like a game that is grounded in realism but I like the occasional break from reality to delve into the realm of exaggeration.  The television commercial of Pure portrayed exactly that with overly ridiculous stunts being done in the air at unbelievable heights.  Needless to say, such physics would not work (well) in reality.Then again, WHO CARES?!Like Burnout, it's fun to jump into action that is clearly unrealistic just for the sole purpose of doing things you can never do in real life.  For the sake of single-player, Pure achieves this.  Half the time you're doing beyond believable jumps to achieve \"Vertigo Trip\" while doing nice tricks at the same time.That's about it game play wise.  The controls handle fairly well as the vehicles seem to react realistically.  It's probably the only part of the game that is realistic... that and the scenery.  The aesthetics are absolutely beautiful.  The scenery really sticks out during jumps.However, the real downside is the multiplayer... there is none.  In order to play with more than one person, you have to go online.  This means no playing with friends at one location.  This, to put it mildly, sucks.  Most people do not buy racing games to play online.  Hell, there's still a large enough number of gamers who do not play online.  I was furious when I discovered that I could not play with my buddies when they're over, especially since I'm the only one in my group of friends who own a PS3.All in all, Pure is a great single-player game but that's about it.  Not having an off-line multiplayer is a serious ding in my book.  I'm all about video games bringing the friends together, not forcing them to play in other locations necessitating we NOT play together.The game is only worth it if you don't mind playing alone or with a bunch of kids online.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2008"}

Griffith","summary":"Mediocre and boring collection of rip-offs","reviewText":"Well, I totally agree with GameSpot review (75/100), and only because the game is big. Unfortunately I belong to a a group of RPG gamers who value a good story, great characters, and a living world, and not just good combat.First of all, the huge net of narrow corridors and wider openings with a gratuitous amount of invisible walls do not make an open world. But it would be not a big deal if a story were good. Well, it is not. It is not too bad either, just very generic and uninspiring.Second, after playing for 10 hours I still do not give a damn about any event in the game. Probably it is because NPCs are nothing more but answering machines, with zero personalities and any lack of emotions, with dialogues being wooden and boring beyond belief. As if this game has been made by robots, or a kind of computer-generated product, with no humans involved.Third, man, it is such a rip-off!!! Practically everything was in other games, but made way better. It makes me wonder why, for example, Divinity 2 DKS, which is a similar game in many respects, but with a real personality, really good characters, humor and charm, was not very successful financially, and in the reviews, but KOA is praised left and right.Combat is good, but without a good story for me it does not matter. May be I am too old already to be happy just with a mindless hack and slash.Alchemy, crafting, and such are OK, but without a good story is is kinda pointless. Overall KOA is a huge disappointment for me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00002CF9M","description":"InDiablo II, players return to a world of dark fantasy. As one of five distinct character types, players explore the world ofDiablo II, journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed. Diablo, lord of terror and youngest of the three prime evils, awakes from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo takes control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within. The hero doesn't realize that his selfless act will not only ensure Diablo's victory, but will also irrevocably damn his soul for all time.","reviewerName":"mike","summary":"nothing tops this","reviewText":"there have been many trys by different developers to copy the play style of diablo 2.  they are no doubt good but they are NOT diablo 2.  diablo 2 has the best story, fun factor, sound, cinematics, addictiveness and replayability.  i stopped playing this a long time ago because i was hooked on starcraft but i am going to start a new character tonight just to see how fun this game is again.  my previous barbarian only got up to lvl 46.  i've been playin WoW and have a lvl 60 alliance human paladin but there is not nearly as much loot as there is in diablo 2, thus making many characters look the same.

When the city roads need repair it can be done automatically. The menus are easier to understand. Another big plus is that the 2d detail is rather meticulous. Looks as if real buildings were used for most buildings that will be built in your city. Cool touches such as the ability to destroy the city or drive a car for mini missions.There are a few Cons in this game as well. To build and maintain a good city it will require some time, so if you don't want a game that can take huge amount of time from your life, this may not be for you.

When a power-hungry tyrant messes with Venezuela's oil supply he sparks an invasion that turns the country into a war zone. But for you, international crisis is all upside: You are a mercenary, and you profit from chaos. You are not a soldier. You don't have to play by anyone's rules. You have your own code: you will fulfill the terms of the contract, no matter what. If you see it, you can buy it, steal it, or blow the living crap out of it.

I was a little apprehensive about the negative reviews but once I started playing I was instantly hooked. They complained of glitches, but there really ain't any more than your average video game.Since I only had the Gamecube out of the last generation consoles I never got to play the first Mercenaries game, but it matters not. This is a stand alone sequel. You play as one of three characters (I chose Marcus Nilsson) hired and betrayed by a Venezuelan leader called Solano. The rest of the game is your hunt to find and kill Solano, working for various factions in order to gain info and supplies.The missions are all of the hunt/kill/rescue/deliver variety.I found some of them to be rather difficult but I never had to retry more than five times, so that ought to give you an idea of the overall difficulty. There are plenty of trophies too, but, annoyingly, a lot of them are rewarded for online play, which I am not really interested in.There are loads of guns and explosives and vehicles for you to experiment with, and almost everything in the entire gaming environment is destructible.

Play your cards right and you could even be running everything as the next--and most powerful--Don.A story about family, respect, and loyalty,The Godfatherbook by Mario Puzo and film by Paramount Pictures serve as inspiration for the game, as you join the Corleone family and earn respect through loyalty and fear while you rise through the ranks to become Don in a living, 1945-1955 New York. The Godfather video game will put you at the center of action in one of history&#146;s most revered cinematic masterpieces, allowing you to create yourself in the game, and then choose your path as you rise from lowly outsider to envied and feared Don.Featuring non-linear action-adventure gameplay,The Godfatherwill offer gamers countless choices for solving the family&#146;s problems with brutal violence, skillful diplomacy, or a cunning mixture of both.

The targeting system is flawed but a little better than GTA's and the little map in the corner shows the actual street name not to look like another clone. If you like GTA, you might like this.

With true-to-life race car steering, shifting, braking and acceleration, your game gets so real you may want to buckle up.","reviewerName":"Dat Hong","summary":"Fantastic Product, must have for racing games!","reviewText":"This is a well made sturdy feeling racing wheel made by Logitech.  The wheel is approximately 11 inches with a rubber overmold rim and has 900 degrees of rotation.  The steering wheel has excellent force feedback and really lets you feel every bump, crash, and turn you make.  It has a dial (the red thing on the wheel) that allows you to adjust your brakes, traction control, and damper performance on the fly.The wheel connects to the PS3's usb port and requires you to plug it in to a wall outlet to power it.  You'll be amazed the first time you power this thing up and the wheel spins by itself.  Heck, there's even a horn button for you to push!I tried this steering wheel with GT5 Prologue and Formula 1, and I must say it makes the games more realistic than they already are.  Having force feedback really makes a difference when playing driving games as you can feel the road and the turns.  Both GT5 and F1 have force feedback enabled.The wheel itself has all the PS3 buttons so you can scroll thru menu's easily, and even includes paddle shifters so you never have to take your hand off the wheel.  Although the wheel and its components are well made, the pedals feel cheap and light.  The built in carpet grip system works wonderfully when used and helps prevent sliding around.One other benefit of playing racing games with a wheel is that the casual gamer friend or relative who just can't seem to use analog sticks and buttons on a regular hand controller can easily sit down and start racing.There are clamps that allow you to connect the wheel to a table so that you can drive aggressively without worrying about the wheel flying out of your hand when turning.  It is highly recommended that you clamp this thing down to a table!For the price, this is an excellent choice.  I highly recommend this racing wheel.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2008"}

I really enjoyed the campaign. There are total of 5 acts, 6-15 missions in each act. Smooth movement and hacking gives this game a nice & refreshing feeling.9/10Driving: Not the strongest point of the game! 70% of the game is mainly focused on the hacking & stealth. Driving takes time to get use to, but after you learn how to drift cars, you can't stop driving. However, the damage to the cars are terrible. You go full speed to an incoming car, and just bounce back with little to no damage. Each car handles differently, and even sounds different, I like that! Biggest down side, there is no way to store cars or repair them, not even a simple color change :-( Big mistake 6/10Voice acting/music/sounds/ characters: Perfect 10/10 voice acting of aiden pearce reminds me of Sam Fisher and Max Payne + jack bauerSide missions: After I was done with the game, I kinda lost interest. Simply because there is nothing for you to explore. Every side mission and hidden things are shown on the map. You just choose one and the GPS will get you there. There are tons of side missions to do, but they get really boring and repetitive after a while. For example, Criminal Convoy missions are just simply following a car and taking it out, or Gang hideout is just taking bunch of gangs and taking down the main objective.... they all get really boring after the 10th time. Other hidden things that you can do involve hacking cameras and spying on people. 8/10Multiplayer: It's fun and broken! So far I hacked 10-12 people/ got hacked 6-7 times and was able to find 1 Race and 3 decryption matches. Finding a game takes a long time, and when you find 1 it's really lagy. 1 Vs 1 hacking is fun & nicely done, but Race &  decryption are really lagy and messy. Modes: 1VS1 Hacking, 1VS1 Trailing, decryption( deathmach/Team deathmach ), Race. Again, they are fun, but I spent more time trying to find a game than actually playing one. Players are not from U.S. You go against players from China and U.K. so expect huge lag. 7/10Stop comparing this game to GTA. it's not even close to GTA. I would say, Assassin's Creed + True Crime Or Splinter Cell + Sleeping dogs. Not GTABuy this game, you will enjoy it. Stop comparing it to other games. Campaign worth 60$ itself + other things you can do. Don't buy the season pass !I'm taking one star off just because there is absolutely nothing to do in the game after you are done with the side missions. Only thing you can do is to take care of criminals. That's it... no more shooting. If you shoot one bullet, people call cops. It's not acceptable. I finished the main missions in 12 hours. Side missions gave me another 7-8 hours, now there is nothing I can do.Update: June 23Online Hacking: it's getting annoying so I have to mention this here. Some people disconnect their internet when you are about 90% hacking them, so you get zero points. Also, some people get bounty on themselves by hacking NPCs and wait for you in car to show up.

{"product_name":"B00006LEM9","description":"For even the mildest fans, anything related to this beloved book deserves top-notch treatment. Vivendi's officially authorizedThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringfalls disappointingly short of that goal. The game is intriguing enough (credit the source material) to play through entirely--once. For the cost of the game, you are guaranteed a reasonably pleasurable 10 hours of gameplay. After that, it will likely sit on your shelf.There are good things in this game: the RPG mechanics are fine (at various points in the story you play as Frodo, Aragorn, and Gandalf), the visuals are beautiful in parts, and certain aspects of game design are fantastic (Gandalf's magic-casting stands out). Little touches make it appealing to true fans, like when Aragorn receives the repaired Sword of Elendil, and it glows during fighting. It would be a great game for even non-LOTRfans to play, since a good deal of backstory is provided in lengthy cinematics throughout the game.Fellowship's greatest asset, of course, is the story itself, as well as the bevy of villainous creatures that provide great boss-fight material. I'm sure many other gameswishedthey had a Balrog to offer.But the story deviates strangely from the book in order to satisfy the format of an RPG game. The final boss-fight (which we won't spoil here) is completely unrelated to anything devised by J.R.R. Tolkien, and it seems hollow, strange, and unsatisfying. The puzzles sprinkled throughout the game are random and often frustrating, as is your first encounter with the Ringwraiths (inevitably, you die many times--too steep a difficulty curve right out of the gate). This game is still strongly recommended, but with many caveats. Proceed with caution and you're likely to enjoy yourself. Expect a masterpiece and you'll be wishing you saved your money for a different PS2 title.--Jennifer BuckendorffPros:Great story and great characters (of course)Missions that require problem-solving as well as combatGorgeous mapsGetting to play as GandalfCons:Painfully long cutaway scenesCheesy endingOften-tedious fights","reviewerName":"Forza Catracha \"jcva13\"","summary":"Entertaining!","reviewText":"I decided to start playing this game with determination to finish it.

{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Pretty amazing","reviewText":"Although GTA5 is an exceptional game, I cannot give it 5 stars and, I'll explain why towards the end of this review. But first I want to list the amazing things about it, and yes I do think everybody should play it, even people who don't like driving games (of which I am one).First of all, take a deep breath and prepare yourself for the city of Los Santos. You really don't get much better than this: the city is huge and every single scrap and corner of it has been finished off to a high level of detail. Seek out a derelict corner of the freeway and there's detail, drive to the roughest, highest, remotest spot and there's detail, walk into a store and there's detail. It must have taken literally years to build this environment. The character models are also good, of course the three main leads are fully realised, but the passers by in the street are also very creatively designed. The gameplay contains a very large amount of vehicle driving, and of course this is hugely satisfying, and very well implemented. The script and dialogue are sharp as a knife, sometimes hilarious (Trevor, usually), and sometimes very offensive (no swear word is taboo here).So, a bit about the game itself, well, you play as three characters (you can swap between them), who come together and form an uneasy bond as three criminals with a shared goal; making loot. There's Franklin, the youngest character with a violent inner city gang background, Michael, a former professional thief who is living in luxury, and Trevor, a half crazed, loose cannon who provides most of the extreme highlights of the game. Missions are split between plot-driving &#34;heists&#34; which all the three leads play together, and personal side-missions,  of which there are a whole bunch for each character. Smaller side-side-missions include buying commercial properties and reaping rewards from them, and taking on stunts like races, parachute jumps and rampages.So now I am going to list a few of the things that I found frustrating. First of all, believe it or not, the main, big missions of the game are nearly all too easy! This is largely because of the games very generous auto checkpoint system, which ensures that even if you are a terrible and careless player, as long as you just scrape through a few minutes of play in a long mission, you'll be rewarded with a simple restart from a checkpoint every few minutes each time you die. Most of the quick deaths for me happened in on-foot combat, of which there is a fair amount. Even in the toughest missions, I seldom bothered with cover or tactical positioning, because as long as you spray bullets heavily enough in all directions, you'll normally make enough progress to get you to yet another checkpoint. Not really the attitude of play that the game makers should have been so forgiving about!The next thing that rather disappointed me was the actual lack of surprises. All the missions are fairly predictable. Even GTA3 had more amusing and creative missions than this, in fact GTA3 had so many quirks and clever missions, that none of it's progeny have ever quite equalled it.Finally, the one thing that made me REALLY angry was trying to fly HELICOPTERS. Oh my god, this was pain, pain, pain. After bumbling through one or two helicopter missions, I searched for and found the &#34;Flight School&#34;, but too my huge disappointment, this was nothing of the sort, it was just an obstacle course to get through and get a score for, rather than any real guidance on how to successfully control the thing. Hideous element of the game. I don't mind learning controls but at the end of the day I am not trying to play a helicopter simulation game, I just want to have fun. I think they could have made this simplerSo there you go, that's what made me drop my score to a 4 rather than a 5. But it's still a superb game and a very, very rich experience. Definitely for adults only, due to the ear-popping bad language and one particularly nasty &#34;torture&#34; mission which is treated like a game, and leaves a very bad taste in the mouth. But even with that, you'll grow very fond of Los Santos after a few days. It' would take weeks or even months of dedicated play to see all of the city and it's surrounding areas, but you can keep p[laying the game after the final &#34;plot&#34; mission is over and just explore to your hearts content, so get it - you won't be sorry.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"Battlefieldr","summary":"Awesome, but not the best. (4.5 stars)","reviewText":"GTA V (Grand Theft Auto Five), just like all the other GTA games by RockStar, is a sandbox game that focuses on the story of onr character. What makes GTA V so different is that you have the option to play as 3 characters, all with a unique story, which all eventually tie in together.The story focuses on these 3 characters- Micheal, Franklin, and Trevor. Each character has their own \"prolouge\" before meeting up with one or the other. Rockstar does a great job with this, and the storyline. Also, this game has a completion system for each mission, and ranks you against friends on what optional objectives/challenges you have completed.As expected, Rockstar definetley amped up the graphics and physics engine. The world of Los Santos (based on GTA San Andreas) is beautiful and immersive. Everything seems to be dynamic and realistic. In my opinion, the game feels too realistic and stiff. This is not a huge problem however.There is plenty to do in the game besides the story, and each character has plenty of side missions. Sometimes i find these random side missions to be more interesting than the main story.The gameplay is practically the same as GTA IV, the target system and cover is better too. Gunfights are fun and less annoying than in IV.As explained by everyone, the Police is upgraded, and yes, much harder to escape. The cops are unforgiving in this gane, they will hunt you down for punching someone or shooting into the sky. It isnt as bad as percieved, but it gets annoying.I also never realized how aggravating it is thay when you die, you lose $5000. Sure this isnt that much, but it adds up, and you'll find yourself losing a lot of money at times.I havent gotten that immersed into Online, but it is great. Rockstar did a great job with this, and it seems to be fair in the loght of MP.I would give this game 5 stars, but the few gripes that i have made me feel like this game was way too overhyped. The real rating i would give this is more of a 4 and 1/2 star rating. This game is very fun, and has a lot to do, but i find that it gets very boring very quickly. I am looking forward to any possible DLC. This is probably the best sandbox of the year,  but definitley not the best of all time. I really liked the story too, favorite one next to Bully.

Excellent lighting!","reviewText":"After watching all of the positive reviews I decided to give Crysis 2 a chance.  Crysis 2 is pretty good.  It starts off a bit slow, but a few hours into the campaign the action really starts to pick up.  Graphically this game is outstanding with terrific lighting effects.  The Cry engine 3 really does a superb job with environmental lighting.  The controls are smooth and easy to get used to.  I never played the first Crysis, but got used to the controls in about a hour into the campaign.  The story is good and gets better halfway through.  All the textures are smooth and I did not notice any pixelated walls anywhere.  The city environments are massive and the graphics look spectacular.  The insides of the buildings have lots of detail and look great.  One of the things that really impressed me was that this game is not linear and allows you to climb around to attack enemies at different angles.  The campaign has much more player freedom to move around the levels to attack your enemies.  I am playing this on a 1080p plasma tv and using a 120 gig PS3 Slim.  I saw some minor texture pops only a few times and a frame rate drop once or twice, but really did not interfere with my overall gameplay.  The campaign is much longer than most FPS games out there and I think this game is well worth the money especially from amazon with the promotional credit.  In my opinion Killzone 3 does have much better graphics, but this game still looks good.  Crysis 2 has the same textures and graphics through out the game. It seems like they did a lot of cutting and pasting graphics.  No wonder it only takes 5 or so gigs of space on blue ray.  Killzone 3 uses around 42 gig of disc space due to the graphic detail, animations and variety of environments...oh yeah and the beautiful CG videos.I would not judge this game by the multi-player demo that was released, it did this game no justice.  I played the demo and the finished copy is 10 times better.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00006HBTW","description":"It&#x92;s a pretty bold claim but for many,Mario Partyis the best multiplayer game series ever. No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Sam Maisel \"samtheman_17\"","summary":"Move over, monkeys!","reviewText":"Mario Party 4 doesn't need two-colored semi-transparent spheres to have a great time.

I bought both Monkey Ball games at the same time, because I heard they had tons of great minigames. Well, they don't, (Except for Monkey Fight in Super Monkey Ball 1) and Mario Party 4 comes out way on top. If you want good party games, buy Super Smash Bros.

Thrust into the role of Dr. Derek Stiles, you find yourself performing operations with your stylus as a healing tool, all while fighting the machinations of an organization that is bent on releasing a terrible new illness into the world.The plot sounds over the top, and it is. Not only will you be performing surgeries, but there are some procedures where you'll need your \"medical tools\" to get through other scenarios - such as deactivating a bomb planted at a symposium. The stylus controls are excellent, giving you plenty of control with very few misfires. The soundtrack and dialogue during a procedure give a very ER-type of feel, and you'll be feeling the pressure in some of the tough operations.The one problem area for the game is its difficulty. While it isn't impossible by any stretch of the imagination, you will find yourself doing certain procedures over and over again. The story, while solid, isn't as compelling as it could be, and suffers slightly from a large cast of characters who don't get much screen time. While the plot and cut scenes are still very enjoyable, a stronger story would help overcome some of the frustration at certain points, as it would provide some incentive beyond a mere score to pass each stage. As it is, some players might find themselves giving up on the game early if they become frustrated.That said, there is enough story and characterization here to make for a very good time. Naturally, the meat of the game is the operations, and once you learn the basics you'll find that they're quite addictive and fun. And just in case you're hungry for even more challenge after the game is over, you can replay any procedure you've completed. Finishing the main game also unlocks several challenge levels, which will keep you up for days as you try to hone your stylus mojo into an effective life-saving machine.

(you know it stands for First Encounter Assault Recon right?) was marked as an excellent shooter due to it's scary atmosphere, solid shooting, and (at the time) system pushing graphics. Two installments later the game has fizzled out as an above average shooter and has lost most of its scare value over the years. The game also feels more paramilitary than paranormal with the same generic soldiers, mechs, and the occasional tough boss. At this point if you haven't played the first game you will be completely lost in the plot. Even people who played the first and second when they came out might want to search Wikipedia for a plot refresher because F.E.A.R. has always been known for its holy plot and confusing endings.The game feels a bit different from the last two games, but not by much. The game is more tight ended with a better cover system, a couple of new weapons, and slightly updated visuals. You have your standard affair of weapons from assault rifles, sub-machine guns, shotguns, rocket launcher, and the few original weapons. The weapons feel solid though yet the aiming is a bit touchy. Every gun feels different and you must really use them at the right situations. This isn't a stick-with-one-gun type of game. The slo-mo is back, but you can now upgrade yourself by doing things you normally would in the game and earn points. F.3.A.R. is based around co-op this time around so you can play as either main protagonist Point Man or his dead brother Fettel who follows you around the story.You get points by collecting weapons, doing kills, headshots, using cover for a certain amount of time, finding the rare Alma dolls, dead bodies that give you Psychic Link points etc. Throughout the campaign whoever scores the most points gets to see that ending of that brother. It's a neat way to do co-op, but you can still enjoy the game by yourself. The game brings back the awesome mechs and they feel better than ever. You get to use them more often than the last entry so look forward to some awesome mech sections.When it comes to atmosphere I feel Project Origin pulled it off the best. That game was downright scary, but F.3.A.R. loses it somehow by concentrating too much on the action. Sure there are some points that make you jump, but Alma doesn't appear nearly as much, and those truly scary points are far and few between. The ending is even disappointing and still doesn't answer anything, but just concludes Point Man's journey to find Alma and his dad. Alma is what made F.E.A.R., but due to her lack of exposure in this final entry it just feels like an almost generic shooter. Not only that, but the campaign is really short with only 8 levels that can be beaten in about 8 hours.has the best multiplayer suite in the series with the head mode being F****** Run! where Alma's contractions (play the story to know what I am talking about) brings the walls down on you and you have to well...run. Its to bad no one is playing online anymore so you probably have to stick to LAN on this one. That's a bummer despite the game being so recent compared to the thousands who played F.E.A.R.`s separate mulitplayer mode that was released months later from the original. There are other modes to be had in the game, but if you can't get a LAN party going then you're stuck with co-op or just the single player.Overall F.3.A.R. has decent visuals, but for some reason the game has serious performance issues even on high end systems. Constant stuttering, complete hang ups and other issues bog down the experience a little. The game is enjoyable at best, but I doubt you will run through the game a second time (even with a buddy) just to see the quick second ending (that's what YouTube is for). I recommend this for long time F.E.A.R. fans, but new comers should start at the beginning or move on.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

This adds  immensely to the game's depth, and button mashers will be in for a shock when  they find that their mistimed tag-team moves backfire.Visually, this game is intense.

Hayes","summary":"New Colors Options Amazing","reviewText":"I purchased both the Red color and the Blue Color (at the time of this writing only the blue one has arrived).I must say that the Metallic Blue Dual Shock 3 looks more impressive in person than the image seems to convey.  The image doesnt convey the fact that it is metallic blue.  Metallic blue in this case means that the actually controlloer looks almost nearly like a dark shade of blue but has the \"subtle sparks\" in it that makes it shimmer and shine when one rotates it around in the lighting.Performance wise it is the same that we expect with all of our DualShock 3's.  Perfect feel for comfort, strong vibrant vibration, and great sixaxis motion control translation (on games that support them).The only other minor thing is that the \"DualShock 3\" logo and the \"Sixaxis\" logo are in a brighter blue on that front end of the DualShock 3.  I dont think it adds or distracts from the aesthetics since it is in an odd position on the DualShock 3 for this Metallic Blue color.EDIT:  Deep Red Color arrived today and it looks exactly like the picture.  Saying deep red is quite a stretch for it is a brilliant red but doesnt look quite luminous.These are a worthwhile purchase if you want to add a DualShock 3 color other than Black to your collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00000K1VA","reviewerName":"Dark lord of all that is itchy","summary":"By far the best resident evil game available","reviewText":"This game is awesome.  The plot is intriguing, the characters are realistic and it has some references to RE2.  It posesses some of the problems that the other RE games had: The controls still {bite} and the inventory system is pretty difficult to deal with at times (how does a key take up as much space as a shotgun?) but you get used to the controls and you just have to deal with the inventory.  A nifty new edition is the ability to make new and stronger ammo by creating various combinations of gunpowders.  You also become faced with situations where you have to decide what to do and your decision alters the course of the game (and in one case, which ending you see!) which was not seen in the first 2.  You are also stalked by one of the coolest looking monsters ever: the nemesis.  temporarily knocking this beast out can yield rewards that can make your life quite a bit easier, but be warned, it is no easy task.  Make sure that you are at least familiar with the plot of RE1 before you play this (RE2 never really comes up).  very fun and challenging.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2003"}

It works with both PS2 and PS3 (a nice feature because we have both systems).3. It folds so it will take up a lot less space that our other drum set!4. The foot pedal can be positioned anywhere, and it is much more comfortable to use than the Rock Band foot pedal.5. The pads have a nice thick rubber-like surface.6. The rims on the drum heads are lower than the drum surface and this makes it much easier to hit the drum's surface.  The rims on our Rock Band drums are higher and often the sticks hit the rims and do not make a strong enough contact with the drum surface.7.  Almost everything is adjustable so you can custom fit it to your size or style.8. I love having cymbals!What could be better?1.

Unlike other game environments that serve as nothing more than a visual backdrop, the devastating Helghan climate takes a notable toll. And, worst of all, the Helghans know exactly how to use the planet against you.The in-your-face perspective comes to life as you take aim with exotic new weapons and mainstays from the previous games, including the M82-G assault rifle.

The graphics and world they've created is awesome. It's just the controls are a little rough and the enemy AI is devastating, especially on the harder game mode. I thought i could wing it since i play these type of games all the time but the Helgan are more accurate in cover shooting blindly than i am simply standing shooting no cover. Its like heat seeking bullets. Very frustrating. The weighty feel of turning with the guns is also kinda crap. Wrestling with the controls to simply turn around in a firefight is kind of laborious. It's like your guy is drunk and doesn't want to cooperate with you. That said the game is a mix bag, great story telling and graphics for a future war game with questionable controls.

I had only played one other Tombraider game (to completion) before this.  That was the Underworld game for the PS2, which was not bad, but I'm told is significantly lower quality than the higher end systems.  I also bought, but never played Anniversary and Legend, so I wasn't sure I'd be motivated by it.  I'm glad I took the dive.The game plays vaguely like the Arkham Batman games lately or maybe more like the Uncharted games.  You control a young Laura starting out.  She's shipwrecked and a bunch of freaky stuff starts happening.  Basically, you get abused more than any human could and actually survive, and go on to kill many, many, many things.  It's an awesome amount of fun and the bow is easily the most fun weapon to me, however the guns were not without their charms.The game is very cinematic, almost to a fault at times.  There are, at least using a keyboard, some danged tough button pattern matching where you try to do what the onscreen prompts say to dodge, or strike someone, or what have you.  I found them very frustrating, though a friend with a controller had no problems.  There are also plenty of times when you lose control of Laura as she squeezes through a crevice or such.  It's excellent visuals and the model looks natural and the movement is true to life, but still you're pulled from controlling to watching.  Depending on your tastes, it may irk you a bit.  To me, it was fine, but makes it very difficult for me to picture replaying the game again.All told, the game will probably take you between 10 and 12 hours to complete and as I mentioned, that may be it for a while.  Still, it's pretty hard for me to say bad things about this game.  I had a great time through almost the entire thing.  There were very few parts I thought were especially cheap or save points that were so far apart I got angry.  Definitely an enjoyable game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2014"}

Driven by pure revenge, nothing can stop Kratos from achieving absolution.","reviewerName":"B. Convery","summary":"Play it with your shirt off.","reviewText":"That's what I've started doing.  It's a game that drips testosterone from marble columns of Athens to (but not quenching) the infernals of Hades.  There's not much happy in Krato's Ancient Greece.  Well, strike that.  Maybe Aries is happy because he's ripping Athens to shreds.  Fires, thunderstorms, Aries' steel clanging, while the helpless humans fire arrows at the God of War unleashed.  Pah!  Human Arrows.  It's like trying to put out Hades' flames by blowing bubbles.There is so much amazing about God of War.  First, I'll talk about thought.  There's folly about.  That's the theme of Greek Mythology, ALWAYS.  Folly between the gods and \"their human playthings\".  However, Greek gods are flawed just like the human pawns.  For the gods of Olympus err clumbsiness then clean-up their mistakes after.  What folly!  God of War WORKS as Greek Mythology.  I love the concept of \"destroying a god\" through Pandora's Box.  Opening Pandora's Box, the colloquialism, is to unleash a maelstrom of unpredictable chaotic events.  Is that what happens when a god is killed?  Absolutely.  This is what I mean regarding thought.  There are philosphical gems that glisten in Ancient Greece.Second, the gameplay and controls are extremely tight.  You'll use every button on the contoller when battling.  You'll use every move.  Rolling/evasion, blocking, comboes that can rise to triple digit numbers (my highest is 124) are necessary to avoid becoming burger to Aries' black-hearted baddies.  This said, tight controls are necessary, work perfect, creating some ridiculously fast paced/intense action.Third, is balance.  Now some friends say I smoke too much over drinking, but I understand balance is required.  God of War balances action and puzzle solving, and not once do the scales dip to one side.  Sure, the game gets difficult and frustrating the further you take Kratos, but never is there too much fighting, too much puzzle-solving, or too much drinking.  Wah?  The balance is great.Did I mention level design?  No?  It's brilliant.  Sometimes it reminds me of Prince of Persia:SOT and sometimes Tomb Raider.  Environments are very fluid, from the details of statues and Greek architecture, to Kratos' ugly reflection on a highly polished floor?  I'd hate to be the sap who keeps those Greek floors so spickitty span clean.  I wonder what that dude makes an hour.  Benefits are worth it, especially if you get to glimpse the Oracle of Athens in her sheer top.  Huh?  Great level design.To add one more edge on Kratos already sharp blades, God of War has a wonderful soundtrack.  The music is ambiant sometimes, orchestral at others.  Should I say it again?  Ok.  Balanced soundtrack.I'll wrap it up.  My wife came down when I was playing and she said, \"Honey, why do you have your shirt off?\"  I looked at her.  My eyes were bloodshot but not from God of War.  I replied, \"Kratos doesn't wear a shirt.  If he doesn't, I don't.\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"W. McKinney","summary":"Great, but could be even better","reviewText":"This is certainly a step forward. It just seems that it could have been much more. For instance, the voice commands are great, especially when watching television, but there are things you can't do, one of which is surprisingly turn on/off the system. So you have to use a remote for your television anyway, and since that's the case, it's just as easy to use the remote buttons as it is to call out voice commands. But I must say, the voice recognition is very accurate. Also, the television programming guide that downloads isn't as user friendly as I had hoped (and I was surprised to find you have to have an Xbox Live subscription to access it). It threw in a bunch of channels that I don't have (and I have everything my cable company offers), so scrolling becomes a real chore. Of course, you can select Favorites and access them with voice command, which is definitely a plus. I only purchased one game, Forza 5, and of course it looks great, but I'm not sure there's really a huge difference in picture quallity from the Xbox 360. I was thrilled to find that my Harmony remote will control the Xbox One. That is something that really irritates me about the PS4. I bought it as well, and nothing works with it. Controlling the Bluray player with the game controller is rather irritating on the PS4. Microsoft got it right on this aspect. It's definitely worth the cost if you're into gaming and like some automation in your home theater system. I'm hoping it will expand and get even better. Would love to be able to control everything with voice command.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001G3B0HC","reviewerName":"The Duck of Indeed","summary":"Better Than the Original","reviewText":"Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories takes place between Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2.  In this game, Sora, Donald, and Goofy are looking for King Mickey and Riku and find themselves in a weird place called Castle Oblivion.  As they go further into the castle, they start to lose their memories, while Sora remembers a girl he knew when he was a little kid.  How strange he didn't remember her before.  They also run into people in black coats called Organization XIII, led by a man named Marluxia.  This game has a fairly interesting story, and it's not over when you beat Sora's story.  There is also a story with Riku that you can play afterward.This game is different from the others as it is all about cards.  You fight in real-time, but most everything you do corresponds to cards.  Attacks, fire, cure, summons.  The higher the number, the stronger the card.  This makes figting a bit more interesting.  On the downside, every world is made up of rooms, and while you can choose what each room is by using a card (for example, you can make a save point, a room with strong Heartless, or a room where your cards are stronger), it can get a bit boring.  Every room is pretty much the same.  It may look slightly different, but going through rooms and rooms of figting Heartless gets old after a while.  Fortunately, as I said, the cards make things more interesting, and I liked the story.I played this game both on the Game Boy Advance and PlayStation 2, and I find the latter better.  Better graphics, there's voice acting, and I, personally, always found console games to be more fun.  (And you actually get to fight Zexion in this version.)So in short, this game can be fun, but can also get redundant.  The story makes it worth playing at least once, though.

Paslay","summary":"Better than I expected, but not great.","reviewText":"I picked up a copy of Deer Drive Legends recently. Because this is on a console I expected some free-roaming gameplay. What I was presented with was the same fixed camera gameplay you find in the arcade versions. This isn't awful, but loses some appeal without the gun accessory. To be up front, this is an arcade style shooter and nothing more. There's not a lot to discuss here so I will just break down the game by its elements.GameplayYou start by selecting a region to hunt in. In the beginning there is only one option. I would've preferred a couple choices but I guess the first stage is to just allow you to get a feel for the game. Strangely, there is no real tutorial. It took me a second to figure out which buttons did what. The stylus, or your finger, on the lower screen moves your camera. As I mentioned, you are stationary. The shoulder button fires your weapon. This control scheme is precise and works well for both left and right handed players. Deer will run through the scenery and you take aim and shoot them. Depending on where you shoot the deer, you will be awarded power ups and extra time. Don't shoot the doe, the deer, the female deer, because that will penalize your time. As another reviewer mentioned, there will be Moose (Mooses? Meese?) that will attack you on site. Let's be clear, I'm not a hunter, but if part of hunting is worrying about crazed attack Moose, then it's a much more dangerous sport than I imagined. Either way, you need to shoot the Moose before it charges you. If you get charged too many times you will lose the round. Each round has a challenge you must complete and completing challenges allow you to advance to the next round and ultimately other regions of the world.GraphicsI'm honestly impressed by the graphics. This game has budget written all over it, but the graphics actually make good use of the 3DS hardware. Environments are nicely done and populated by native foliage. Wildlife is well rendered and detailed. 3D is very well done, I didn't experience any blurriness or double image issues while playing. Overall the graphics are spot on.SoundThe sound effects and music are also well done. The sound does utilize the 3D sound features of the 3DS and utilizes it well.Lasting AppealThis is going to vary greatly from person to person. If you're a fan of casual games and especially if you're a fan of the Cabela's and other hunting games, I don't think this will disappoint. There are several regions to go through and you probably won't finish this in a single sitting. Online scoreboards and beating your own personal best will keep you coming back for more. If you're like me, more along the lines of the \"hard-core\" gamer, you may want to pass this one up. As I said, there's no story here, no free-roaming character control and no major RPG-esque upgrading/leveling system. Hard-core gamers will get bored after a couple regions.SummationIf you're a casual gamer or hunting game enthusiast, this game is worth your consideration. Graphic and sound quality keep this just above the bar of your average budget game. If you're looking for something with a lot of depth and strategy, you may want to look elsewhere.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2012"}

Blizzard","summary":"Assassin's Creed 2.5","reviewText":"The Assassin's Creed story continues with this direct sequel to Assassin's Creed 2 (AC2).  Again, you are placed in the role of Ezio.  Instead of going from city to city in search of your targets, you remain within the city of Rome.  Assassin's Creed Brotherhood adds some new elements and changes some things around a bit for yet another great game in the saga.Story:  The story of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood picks up directly following the events in AC2.  Due to various events, Ezio finds his way to Rome and seeks to undermine the efforts of the delusional Cesare Borgia and his scheming family.  As with the previous game in the franchise, the story here is deep and the characters memorable.  Caterina Sforza also makes a reappearance, but isn't quite as vulgar as she was in AC2, which is a bit of a disappointment.  The character Lucrezia Borgia is also introduced, and, although she is an antagonist, she is one of the most compelling and tragic characters in the game.  It is not quite as long or as deep as AC2, but it is certainly better than most.The visual style of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is very similar to that of AC2, it is Italy and done within the same time period, after all.  The difference here is that Rome is ancient, filled with ruins, so unpainted brick or marble is available for you to climb on.  The stunning chapel climbing sequences are mostly gone, in favor of the ruins, so you rarely get to see the fine, ornate, detail that Renaissance Italy was known for, but certain areas are the city are beautiful to look at.  As someone who enjoys the history of the Roman Empire, and yes Byzantium is included in that too, setting the story in Rome was a treat.  As soundtracks go, this is also well done.  Some of the tracks sound like they belong in the HBO series \"Rome\" and use vocals quite a bit.Gameplay:  Put simply, the gameplay in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood mostly mirrors that of AC2.  There are several new additions that further refine the gameplay, making it even better, mostly, than the previous installments.  If you enjoyed rebuilding and upgrading Monteriggioni in AC2, Rome has got you covered.  You can open a number of shops to heal you, make weapons and armor, dye clothes, and paintings.  There are other structures you open, like banks, landmarks, aqueducts, stables, a fast-travel tunnel system, and guild buildings.  All of these provide gameplay benefits and net you cash every 20 minutes.  Open every building, and you get a very useful cape.  It would have been nice if, in renovating all structures in a given area, that area would become more noticeably better, but as it stands, the difference is very subtle.In Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, there is also the new guild system.  There are three main guilds, thieves, courtesans, and mercenaries, along with an additional assassin's guild you control directly.  The three primary guilds give you side quests and a challenge board.  Complete every challenge and the guild owner will give you a special item.  Individual side quests open over time as you progress through the game.  The assassin's guild is very interesting, you recruit assassin's from Rome's population to fight for your cause.  These assassin's level up and can be sent out on missions or used to help you in a fight by providing backup or to rain arrows down on your enemies.  Although the assassin's guild is fun, once they reach the maximum levels, there really isn't much for them to do except sending them out on the difficult \"starred\" assassin missions, which net not only florins but also rare items, or calling them into battle.  You do not have access to your assassin's guild during certain gameplay sequences where they would be most useful, but you can use them fairly often.The full synchronization concept is also introduced.  In previous installments, you get a mission telling you to do something, it is then up to you to determine the best method to accomplish this.  In Brotherhood, you still have that option, but if you accomplish the mission in a certain way, you synchronize more fully.  As your overall synchronization meter fills, you gain special memories from earlier events.  These memories are triggered at various benchmarks, such as 30% overall synchronization all the way up to 75%.  Mercifully, the developers stopped at 75% knowing that not everyone has the patience to go much beyond that.  Keep in mind that if you fail the full synchronization requirement, and the game will certainly let you know this, and decide to suicide yourself to back to the checkpoint prior to the event you failed, you will still have failed in the requirement.  If you want to try it again, you have to restart the mission entirely from the beginning.Everything starts at the Borgia towers which dot the landscape.  These break Rome up into several zones, some of which are totally inaccessible for arbitrary reasons not connected to the story.  To get new assassin recruits and access to buildings, you must dispatch the captain of the tower and then burn it to the ground.  Each captain is given a star rating which is meaningless if you played any previous installment of Assassin's Creed.  The rating is supposed to indicate difficulty, but, I was able to take down a five-star tower the moment it became available when Ezio first entered Rome without guild backup.  Removing the towers removes a certain number guards or makes them weaker in that zone.One of the most talked about additions to the franchise is the inclusion of multiplayer.  There are several multiplayer game modes to choose from.  Alliance is where the six players are split into three teams, all sent to hunt other teams.  Team work is crucial in alliance.  Man hunt is another mode, where two teams take turns being both the hunter and the hunted.  Wanted is a mode where you are assigned targets, often other players, and you go assassinate them as solo agents.  There is a spin-off to the wanted mode, and that is advanced wanted where gameplay is shifted forcing a more stealthy approach as the compass, which points you to your target, is reduced in effectiveness.  Players can choose from a number of characters to play as, all of which are generic in appearance, allowing the players to blend in with crowds more easily, or even stand next to an identical non-playable character to throw off would-be assassins.  The whole system is ranked up to level 50 with bonuses at each level, and you gain points for stealth on top of simply killing the target.  This is used to discourage players from merely running around killing everything since the points gained just killing are relatively low compared to the bonuses given for actually being an assassin.There are other minor tweaks to the gameplay.  You now have shop quests which require you to scour fallen enemies and treasure chests for rare items that can be combined to make new equipment.  There really is no real reason to get paintings or buy every piece of weapon and armor in the game since there are no completion benefits or trophies in doing this.  The annoying flag mini-game makes a return, but with a twist.  Some of the flags are hidden the Romulus lairs, which are similar to the assassin's seal quest that ultimately yielded the Armor of Altair in AC2.  These lairs can be tricky to navigate, so it is likely you will miss one or two flags.  Completing these lairs grants Ezio the Armor of Brutus and Dagger of Brutus, which are both the best armor and short weapon in the game, unique in many respects.  The dagger is very useful, civilians and enemies sometimes cower and the animations using it draw upon how Brutus killed Cesar with vicious stabs, being both effective and brutal.  Da Vinci also makes a return, giving you a parachute if you destroy the war machines he is contracted, forced, to build.  These are fun mini-games allowing Ezio to take control of tanks, naval cannon's, and bomber aircraft.  Brotherhood also introduces execution's.  If Ezio counters or kills an enemy, he can follow through and cause a one hit kill on any nearby enemy, even brutes.  The trick is to know which enemy is going to attack next and kill them before they hit you, stopping the execution.  If you pull off the execution, you can follow it though to another enemy, and another, and another, without anything stopping you other than an enemy breaking your streak with a hit.Misc.:  Assassin's Creed 2 was considered my game of the year for 2009 and I believed Brotherhood would join it in 2010.  Sadly, this was not the case for a few minor reasons.  AC2 is a deep game with plenty of story elements to keep the player engaged for many hours.  Brotherhood is similar, but not quite as deep, only going as far as nine memory segments.  With few exceptions, the side missions assigned by the various guilds are very similar with little to add to the story, nor do they form small story arcs encouraging you to play them all.  The rebuilding of Rome is also fun, for a while.  You do gain discounts and new items in opening up shops, but, aside from this, nothing really changes all that much to the city.  Hearing the populace talk about Ezio or the assassin's more, the buildings being cleaned up, or even flying the assassin's or the Auditore flag, similar to how they flew at Monteriggioni, would have been nice.  This would give the feeling that the assassin's were tipping the balance in Rome.The assassin's guild is also very useful and fun, but, Ezio's guild seems very separate from the game with none of the missions bleeding over into the main game.  It would be nice had Ezio been given direct involvement in some of the missions, or if he could lead a team on special missions.  As it stands now, the guild doesn't really have much impact on the story with the exception of a few memories.  In fact, you could recruit people and not bother to use them at all in the game and not lose much.  The guild of assassin's can be useful as backup or to rain arrows down on your enemies, but I found myself rarely needing them, especially after leveling them up, which is quite easy.The main issue that kicked the game a few notches down on my \"Game of 2010\" list centers around multiplayer.  I usually don't play multiplayer, it gets repetitive too quickly and there is nothing affecting the game's canon in it.  Although there are a number of modes and character archetypes to try, it does get old.  Moreover, unless you have several friends you can invite, you will be stuck with a least one person not acting stealthily, racing from rooftop to rooftop to get the next kill.  It often seems as though many players are trying to take a multiplayer shooter strategy, which is get the most kills, and apply it to a unique multiplayer experience that discourages this type of gameplay.  This makes multiplayer less fun since the whole point of being an assassin is to kill without being seen until the last possible moment.  I would have liked a Demon's Souls multiplayer mode where you can bring in other gamers to help in some cases, or, have them hunt you down in the single player game  should something go wrong in a mission.  Instead of outright failing a mission if you are detected, a player could appear in the city and hunt you, even after you completed the main assassination.  I would have found this type of multiplayer more compelling.It should also be noted that this game has multiplayer trophies.  You could squeeze every last bit out of the single player experience, even hunting down the irritating flags, and still not get the platinum trophy unless you invest almost as much time in multiplayer as you did in single player.  As someone who often does not play multiplayer or find it enjoyable, this is a major let down.  I probably would have gone back after finishing game to get the more difficult trophies had multiplayer trophies not been added, but since they were, why bother?  For a mostly single player game in a single player franchise, these multiplayer trophies should have been removed in favor of bonuses in single player campaigns or just stripped entirely as a stand-alone feature granting UPlay points.Overall, in the single player game, it is an improvement in terms of mechanics.  Expanding the rebuilding game and adding in the assassin's guild was a fun addition, but it really doesn't do much to change the game.  The full synchronization concept is interesting and there are rewards for doing it.  Thankfully, the developers make it goal to get full sync, but set it up so unless the player actively ignores doing it, it is almost certain they will get the reward for completion.  The war machines side missions are very fun and I would like to see more.  The hecklers have also been toned down a bit and thief races are few.  Overall, it is a great game and a worthy addition to the franchise, but, for me, it just wasn't as good as Assassin's Creed 2 if only by a tiny amount.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2011"}

I say this because, although the graphics are dated they still look good, but the gameplay is incredible.  The story is engrossing.  The game is long and will occupy plenty of game hours, more so than some of the new games that are being churned out. There are multiple endings coupled with some great, non-linear gameplay.  There are Role playing elements involved in which you can basically grow and gain higher skills.  There are often mulitple ways to accomplish any given goal, which gives the game added replay value.Pros:lengthy gmae offers many game hours to playmultiple endings and non linear play adds replay valuestory is engossingmusic puts you in the characters bootsMultiplayer was aadded by a great developer team for freeGame is super fun to play overallCONS:Voice acting can get cheesy at timeslooks wierd in Direct3d/ and openGL mode is substandardAI is not as smart as newer games and the enemies are easily fooled into thinking that you no longer existYou will often think about this game when not even playing itYou may feel obligated to wear black glasses and a trenchcoatWhen you first hear ICARUS say, &quot;I now have full control of all of your systems&quot; you may lose bladder control.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2003"}

Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M.

{"product_name":"B000QCU9IK","description":"The Simpsons Game features a hilarious, sprawling, and mind-busting storyline crafted by the TV show's Emmy Award-winning writers. In this action-comedy, the full cast of voice actors from the TV show and movie reprise their roles to lend the ultimate in authenticity and realism to the game. In The Simpsons Game, Homer, Marge, Bart, and Lisa use exciting, all-new powers to save the world from rising chaos. To help the Simpsons, gamers at home must journey through all of Springfield (as well as vast worlds beyond!), vanquish an amazing array of villains, and fight their way through parodies of multiple popular games.","reviewerName":"Mr. Ben \"ctsamurai\"","summary":"Entertaining, but a weak game","reviewText":"The Simpsons game is a rather basic beat-em-up platformer dressed up with an entertaining story.  I hate to give away the entire review, but the game itself- if not for the Simpsons writing and style- is a bore.The characters are diverse, and playing two character teams makes for some interesting puzzles but I found the level design to be a little flat and confusing, you find yourself wandering over the same ground.  Having the \"target time\" displayed after a level makes you feel like an idiot when you were roaming a level for almost an hour and you \"should have\" finished it in 12 minutes.  That speaks to poor level design, not a genuine in-game challenge.The controls are tight, though the projectile targeting sometimes didn't seem to want to lock on to the intended enemy if you had multiple targets.  Jumping in itself is a simple task, but it is complicated by a camera system that is a little jumpy and rather touchy.  You can kind of control what you see and where, but you can't easily swing the camera around your character, nor is there a particularly useable \"look\" function (think Mario 64).  The flatness of the color palette will lead you jump and miss many many times when you think you're on target.However, problems aside you feel compelled to play through because the writing and voice acting is -naturally- very entertaining.  I wouldn't rank it up there with the great Simpsons episodes, but I found myself chuckling at the gags in the cut scenes as well as dialogue heard in-game.However, there is one thing at the heart of the Simpsons game that really annoyed me.  They keep making jokes about how bad most videogames are, that they're too violent, too predictable, that they rely on bottomless pits and spiked walls and flame traps and lava and all that(there are even \"cliches\" you can collect).  The sad thing is that this game is riddled with them, and not in a mocking way, but in a way that seems to say, \"we, as game designers, didn't try very hard.\"Making fun of something and then going right ahead and doing is a good way to parody something, but when the person has to experience that poor game design first hand, it just underscores what a lousy game you have created around a very funny premise.  It is worth a rental to experience the humor of the game, but I never want to actually sit down and play this game again.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001TOMR0C","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Great use of MotionPlus, but overly repetitive and bland","reviewText":"The Good: Motion Plus tracking is top-notch, fun fighting system with cool moves, nice art styleThe Bad: Linear to a fault, underdeveloped characters and story, not enough moves or powers, boring level and enemy design, no replay value incentiveThe first Red Steel was a highly anticipated on rails shooter. Back when the Wii came out people were excited for arcade style FPS experiences it could bring home, but Red Steel failed on that delivery with bad controls, a bad story, and uninteresting enemies to kill. Ubisoft must have just thrown everything out the window because they took the same characters and put them in a Chinese/Japanese meets Wild West format with a new art style. There's still not much content, and it's pretty bland, but the use of the Wii Motion Plus is top-notch and shouldn't be missed.The story is pretty quick and basic. You are the last of the Kusagari clan who is trying to stop the Katakana clan from getting a hold of ore to forge another powerful Sora Katana. Yeah, pretty boring, the characters are underdeveloped, and the whole story is a toss-up. Nothing memorable here at all. You're here for the action. The game has two basic mechanics, sword fighting and gun play. The game does a good job of auto-locking on enemies while you switch around with Z. Thanks to Motion Plus you can swing with 1:1 accuracy unlike any other Wii game out there. Hold your arm all the way back for a power attack, holding A+B allows you to charge your attack. Swing up to throw an enemy into the air and swing down to throw them down. It's pretty cool to see and do, but you unlock other powers and moves along the way.Shooting feels great and works really well. Besides shooting enemies you can break stuff open to collect gold which is used to buy upgrades, powers, and armor as well as health. There are side missions peppered throughout the game, but they are pretty uninteresting and by the end of the game you will just want it to end. See, the whole 1:1 sword fighting is fun, but there aren't very many moves and the game is extremely hard until you unlock them all. The enemies are pretty generic, but there is enough variety to which you have to adjust your strategy. You can't just go around flailing your arm about hoping to win. You also can't use every attack on every enemy. There are finishers you can use and you must use these to your advantage. Some moves are nearly instant kill on some enemies, so learn which attack works best on what enemy.The art style reminds me a lot of Borderlands, but it looks nice for a Wii game. While the art may look nice, it's very bland. Just a lot of blank brown deserts and empty towns. The game is also very linear, while you can climb up a ledge to find some coins it doesn't go beyond that. After about 1/4 through it just felt like the same thing and never ended. I wish there was more variety because the fighting system is excellent and shows how great the Wii can be. Once you beat the game it's hard to have a reason to come back. There's no multiplayer, but there are challenge missions.In the end Red Steel 2 gives players a solid fighting system, but it's wrapped around bland level design, linearity, underdeveloped characters and story, and a sheer lack of content. That's not to say the game isn't worth playing, by all means, go ahead. The Motion Plus tracking in this game is fantastic and really makes you feel like you're sword fighting and shooting a gun. If only Ubisoft spent 6 more months fleshing the game out more it could have been one of the top games on Wii.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2013"}

I'm a hardcore gamer at heart and when my last Xbox died out I was pretty pissed off (2nd Console I had gone through). After doing some research about the new console it's quite apparent what Microsoft has done here has greatly improved their market and for gamers such as myself. Granted a lot of the features the new slim model has should have been out when the product first shipped out many years ago.But none of that matters now...The system is actually more quiet than previous models, Integrated wireless is a total bonus and then some, My Xbox doesn't sound like a jet is about to take off when loading up; everything as a whole sounds really smooth and as far as I can tell no heat issues yet. I was a bit miffed that there wasn't an Xbox Live Gold card inside but I guess thats the brakes for the 4GB Version. Other than the obvious very low amount of GB its still a very solid system and you won't be missing out on anything the 250gb already has.If you don't currently have an Xbox 360 and are looking to get into the swing of things this is a good place to start, with Halo: Reach around the corner you don't want to be caught without one. Even if you have the older models you will want to highly consider upgrading, Its well worth the investment!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2010"}

Instead of putting together a glorified tech demo (I'm talking to you GT5 Prolouge), Codemasters released a single player racing game that falls between arcade and simulator at a nearly perfect balance.The graphics are top notch (the best at 30fps), the presentation is second to none and sense of speed is off the charts. The difficulty is way up there, but the game offers a \"flashback\" feature to rewind any really nasty wrecks. Also the AI has to be mentioned. Hands down, this is the best racing AI ever. Your competitors never feel like they are on a set path and it is very common to have nasty wrecks happen around you as you go sailing through the crowd. This combined with various styles of racing (drift, demolition derby, mountain races, etc.) makes the single player mode awesome. Online, there are only head to head races, maybe a patch is on the way to mix things up - demolition derbies online would be sweet.Grid is not perfect though. Despite damage modeling, your car always seems to be running fine... or totaled. There isn't really any middle ground and this causes some of the races to feel like demolition derbies when they shouldn't. The controls for some of the cars feel twitchy and can be kind of hard to control - espcially in a pack where one nudge can send you spinning. There is no tuning, painting or decalling cars here.This is easily the best racer to come out this year and probably will hold that title until a working, finished version of GT5 hits next year.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0050SZC5U","description":"","reviewerName":"Bobby Shornock","summary":"Very much worth the wait","reviewText":"Let's face it, Diablo 3 had a TERRIBLE launch.  The servers went through a multitude of problems on launch day, the day after launch, a few rolling restarts and server/game crashes.  However, being one of the most anticipated games of 2012, beating out Mass Effect 3, Max Payne 3, and probably all but Black Ops II, I can assure you that it's worth the wait.The loot system is just as complex as before, the rune system is re-worked so no longer is it item based, it now adds an additional effect to a skill, making certain abilities better for solo play, or group play.  Some abilities also are more useful depending on the difficulty.  Do you want to be a glass cannon on Hell or Inferno, or do you want to take reduced damage to kill longer?  Avoidance or Damage?  Heals or CC?  There are plenty of ways to play the game.  I wish that the game still allowed 8 players at a time, and who knows, maybe this feature will be re-implemented again in an expansion.How many people are going to be making Diablo 3 their next part time job come 5/22/12?  I think it's an interesting way to keep people playing, although I will have to laugh at the people that will actually pay money for an item you will never physically own other than in a video game.What Diablo 3 has done right:* Very easy to join games with your friends, open your Friends panel, right click the person, and invite or join to party.* No more having to worry about your characters getting deleted after 90 days of not playing them, or 2 hours in the first 48 hours of play.* The loot is still very complex and you will be scratching your head and seeing if this item is an upgrade* Skills are done to give diversity on how to play a class, no longer will you be forced to reroll if you screw up a talent point, or attribute wrong(Even though later patches in Diablo 2 fixed this)* Scaling difficulty the more people that play, that was a very good feature in Diablo 2 and made it a challenge and fun to kill Baal and Diablo in 8 player games by yourself.* No longer punished if you join games with people that are further along in quests.  You can play along with them and still progress.* Quest leeching, while it could be annoying in public games, at least it's an easy way to level up a noob without getting slaughtered.* Hardcore mode, definatly has the same feel as in Diablo 2.  This time around, expect people to die a lot easier if you don't stack Vitality along with your primary stats.* No USEast, USWest, it's all one.  There are still Asian servers, among others, that don't seem to have the issues the US Servers are having.* No Town Portal Scrolls, no ID scrolls(You still have to right click to ID Legendary and Rare items, but no longer do you have to waste inventory to do so, like in the Beta)* Achievements to up the replay value after you've gotten past Diablo 3 on Inferno with all 5 characters.* Being able to choose which quests to repeat, for missing books, side dungeons, or exploration puroses.* Banner porting and customization of your banner, the banner porting makes it VERY easy to get back in the game with your teammates that are rushing to complete quests rather than loot or take trips to town.*** The Collector's Edition, like all four Warcraft games, Warcraft 3, and Starcraft 2, feel like Collector's Editions.  If you didn't buy one for $99.99, have fun paying double.  You get the standard Soundtrack, Art Book, the making of Diablo 2, but the items that stand out, you get Angelic Wings, which make your characters stand out, you get a unique banner and sigil(If you played in the Beta), Diablo Skull and 4GB Soulstone Flash Drive glows red when in your computer!  It also comes with Diablo 2 and Diablo 2 Lord of Destruction(A $20 value) pre-loaded onto the flash drive, much like Starcraft 2 did with their Collector's Edition.What Diablo 3 has done wrong:* Always online DRM, not everyone has an internet connection, LAN and single player was a very big part of the success of Diablo 2, and well, some people don't want to play the game with other people.* Very limited chat channels, you have about 8 pre-set channels to join.  No more clan channels.* No guilds.  This is a feature that would greatly benefit players because it would be easier to communicate with your friends.* No guild halls with a stash, again, a great feature that would make it easier to give items to people in different time zones.* When Diablo 3 has to undergo maintenance, you can't play at all!  Single player should be allowed.* 4 Player games, I think 8 players would've done well, especially if everyone could complete every quest in a game even in different acts.A lot of people will knock Diablo 3 for various reasons, however, those same people will praise Diablo 3 for different reasons.  No games are perfect.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2012"}

I found myself playing the 1st demo stage over and over, despite the simplistic gameplay.  Hunter is a pure action game, reminiscent of those Gauntlet games of the mid-80's, but with FAR better graphics, spells, and an intriguing plot.  You can even play with up to 4 people simulataneously which makes this a great game when you have friends over!While simplistic (usually you just clear the enemies that are thrown or spawned at you to progress) and oftentimes repetitive, there's just something about the gameplay that seems to draw you in.  You are given a melee and projectile weapon and I can't even tell you how fun it is to simply kick back, and pound your way through a mob of enemies.  There are a few puzzle elements and an escort mission, but nothing too tough.  Perhaps the reason why I enjoyed this game so much is that the pure-action approach is a welcome relief from all the strategy and FPS games I've been playing lately.  Definitely an old-school concept on a modern console which is refreshing and reminds me of the fun 8-bit NES days.The game is rather easy and you will complete it in less than a week, but Hunter has staying power.  I've unlocked several new modes and I'm currently on my second game using a different character.  It's rare that I replay games, but this is an exception.  My recommendation is to buy Hunter as I feel it is the type of game you'll pull off the shelf after you're beaten it simply because of the fun, action-oriented gameplay it provides!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2002"}

While it's not personally my favorite in the series, the awesome level design and pure fun of Hammer Mario solidifies the game as definitely one of the funnest. You'll be hard-pressed to find a better classic platforming game. Period.Graphics - 9.0Whether you are playing the original version, which was graphically one of the best NES titles, or the Super Mario All-Stars version, which has Super NES quality graphics, the game does not look bad by any means. Each world has it's own theme and the game oozes Mario uniqueness. The Advance version is even better looking than the others, but this review is not really for that version, even though they share a lot of similarities. Definitely pick up the Advance version if you have a choice though.Music & Sound - 8.5There is only one word to describe the music and sound effects in Super Mario Bros. 3, classic. Although there are only so many themes and some of them are quite simple (which may annoy some people). But what do you expect?Ingenuity - 9.5Mario can fly! Hammer Mario! Frog Mario! Tanooki Mario! Airships, Koopa Kids, item storage, map-screens, item shops . . . Super Mario Bros. 3 expanded the platformer to the top of the cup . . . any more and it would've been overflowing! Many innovations and Mario staples were introduced in the third installment. A unique and innovative game for it's time.Replay Value - 9.0There are so many secrets in this game that it's impossible to see them all with one play through.

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-Fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.Xbox LIVE support including LIVE Achievements.","reviewerName":"masterkey","summary":"People, please!","reviewText":"I understand that games are expensive and most people want to go out and buy the most popular games with their hard earned money, especially to play online, but what I have found is that some of the most popular games are not as good as some of the overlooked.

I have a love hate relationship with the Elder Scrolls games. They are wonderfully imaginative and open ended, but also riddled with bugs.This is not your typical MMO, you will not be constrained to any class restrictions, and they really did a fantastic job of letting you play any type of character how you want. Heavy armor mage tank, no problem. One can get really creative with how they approach the game. With this aspect, the game is a homerun!Crafting is well done and varied as well, I craft more items than I buy. There is no global auction house, instead you must use guilds, and in turn become more self reliant. Another homerun!Graphics ( with a good card) are awesome. This game runs very smoothly, and is hands down the most optimized MMO I have ever played. They did a truly incredible and amazing job. Sound is great as well.Questing and combat are better than many other MMOs, questing isnt kill x amount of mobs and report back. Combat is much more interactive than other mmos where ya just hit a button. It is fun.Exploration is fun as well, a lot of people seem to knock it, but I think they did it well, considering its an MMo and not a regular elder scrolls game.If you are a fan of elder scrolls and MMos, you will love this game, if you want elder scrolls, and are not into MMos, you will probably hate it. If you are a fan of MMos, there is a good chance you will like ESO. It is a great game, when you can be immersed in it. But that is the catch, you cant really get immersed in it.Inventory is brutal. Awful. You have a single shared bank for all of your characters. You don't get a lot of bank slots, and upgrading is expensive and doesn't yield much more storage. It become a juggling act of logging in and out of alts to store crafting mats. It is so unnecessary. Its just Zenimax being cheap and not paying for more sever storage. This is one of the games most glaring faults!Now the downside....Bots and gold spammers are running the show. It was bad at launch. real bad. impossible at times even. expect to see bots camped at bosses. expect to be constantly harassed by gold spammers via zone chat and mail. While there is an ignore list, you will spend more time playing the ignore player minigame, rather than ESO. To make matters worse, you are limited to 100 ignored players, which fills up very fast.Personally I believe it is ESO employees that are the gold spammers. they could have easily resolved the issues by now, but they haven't. It has gotten better, but not good enough. They have changed what he gold spammers can type into chat boxes, but are not actually removing them, and they make reporting them time consuming and long winded. Why isn't there a moderator in each zone monitoring the chat and solving the problem right there and then?So while you are being bombarded with gold spammers, quests and combat are going to start to break. sometimes its a simple fix like logging in and out. However, it is hard to get immersed in the game when quests constantly break and some gold spammer just wont quit. for me this is when the frustration sets in, and I ask myself, why am I paying for this.Customer service is hands down the absolute worst. Nonexistent. If you have a problem, too bad. All you can do is send an in game mail to CS, they will eventually get to it, but don't expect any immediate help. They even banned me by mistake, offered nothing for my lost time, and never explained why or how I was banned. When I pressed the issue and asked for an explanation they just ignored me. Now 99% of my issues are just ignored. I don't know if they are too busy, or just don't care, I am guessing both.I also run a very large guild, and every day i see players leaving and not returning to the game. It is a lot. This game has potential, but not too many people are sticking around and waiting for it.All in all, is it fun ...yes. Is it well done... kind of, certain parts are so polished and optimized, then certain parts are so lazy and incomplete it makes you scratch your head.Is it worth $15 a month? hard to say. In its current state I am leaning towards no. mind you it has some serious MMO game changing potential, but I am kind of doubtful it is going to be reached. The real deal-breaker for me is the inability to control the gold-spammers and bots. They are relentless in this game and just running wild. its like paying for commercials, I can't stand it.While I do like the game, I also regret buying the multi month subscription. I could deal with the bugs, but I cant deal with bugs and constant gold spammers hounding you in general chat, mail, and guildinvites.If they cant resolve the issues quickly, expect this game to be F2P soon, no one is gonna pay a sub for long in its current state. While I suppose gold spammers are paying customers too, pretty soon they will be the only customers.EDIT: ERROR 301 So I havent been able to log into the game for some time because of some server error. Customer service has just wasted my time with wild goose chases and chores for me to do on client side. This product seems to only get worse with each patch. Oh, and CS doesnt really work on the weekend, so yeah, if ya have a problem on friday, you are stuck till at least monday. I really, really regret buying this game.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2014"}

I was waiting for the graphics to get worse because in the beginning when you are dropped off at a lighthouse I thought the graphics were amazing, but the entire game is like that graphic wise.. you can tell a lot of detail was put into this game.I give the game 4 1/2 stars for being a little linear, meaning not many side missions.. it would be nice if you could explore more in the world in the sky, but a lot of it is just going from objective to objective which don't get me wrong follows a great story, but it could use more exploring options.  I think that Dishonored was a little like this, as far as being linear from objective to objective, and Irrational games also made Dishonored.. but it really doesn't take away a large part of the quality of the game, it would just be nice to be able to explore more I guess... of course this comes from somebody who beat almost every objective in Skyrim, an open world game which is different then this and I knew that going into it... its still a solid 4 1/2 star game and it will probably be the best game of the year, I was never into the Grand Theft Auto games much, that game is coming out this fall but honestly the way this game is made with this quality it should be considered the best game of the year.. you can see now why it was pushed back a couple times, the developers really wanted to make it shine and they did, this game deserves your time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2013"}

This game is the second one. Which totally sucks considering the emotional trailer that was released ahead of time.If you've played Dead Rising 2 you've played this game except this game is on an Island (city, resort, jungle) instead of a mall (mall, city). You have tons of gofer missions where your job is basically to go from here to there and back again for a few bucks or a prize. Rinse and repeat. This is a cheap way to make the game longer and add so-called depth to the game. But is it really adding anything when you get quests like this one: a (fully adult looking) woman (in a bikini) talks like a baby and asks you to save her teddy bear from a bungalow nearby. WTH?!Some other noticeable defects in the game:-You collect money all over the island then use that money to upgrade and repair weapons. Who you are giving the money to is not explained. Why you would pay in currency that is defunct to fix weapons doesnt make sense. Why not have to collect parts to fix your weapons? Money?-The &#34;story&#34; doesn't exist. This game isn't touted as being a pure survival story like Dawn of the Dead or something where your only goal is to survive. This game is all about moving towards some kind of goal. The problem is that you don't know the goal for most of the game. Instead you'll spend hours and hours collecting juice from a gas station, fixing a kick butt armored car A-Team style (and then never using it again), checking out a downed helecopter only to find that you really only found a bunch more mini quests.-The enemies rank up with you so no matter how awesome you get you never really see the benefits of your new abilities other than in the new ways you can kill the zombies. On the other hand, you never are too far below the ability of any enemies so killing them basically becomes a button masher without worrying about skills or rank ups or anything.-Because cool weapons (valued at maybe $500) cost $1000 or more to repair if you use them you have to either 1) use a bunch of crap weapons because you don't want to bust your awesome one, or 2) spend a boat load of time finding money.-Cut scenes sometimes show all four of the playable characters but you never meet the other three characters or play along side them unless you play online. Why not simply make custom cut scenes for each character?-Zombies that explode, that bulldoze you (rams), and that are toxic may be interesting in the game but don't (in my opinion) fit in to the zombie story. Maybe there is one huge zombie in the world that happens to be in a straight jacket and tries to kill by running you over. I get that. But 50 giant zombies all in straight jackets in one city? Overuse of the boss. Some zombies could have become toxic if they worked at a waste plant or something but then they'd all be at the plant not all over the place. Why a zombie would blow up (ala Halo) doesn't make sense.For all its faults the game is a simple diversion that you may enjoy. I did for about 10 hours before I realized nothing new was coming. Now that the game is super cheap it may be worth it to you. For me, I'd have been very disappointed if I had paid more than $5- 10 for this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2014"}

While I had never loved the 360 controller, I had grown very accustomed to it.  I was very worried that this new controller would feel awkward in my hands.I am glad to report that the new controller is different in good ways, and the same in all the right ways.The new triggers and bumpers have a great feel and are slightly more ergonomic.  The edge of the trigger has been eased where your finger wraps around making it a bit more comfortable for extended game sessions.  The trigger has slightly less resistance than the old trigger, which I found acceptable, my son is not as big a fan.  The sticks feel a bit more precise, but more than anything they feel the same which is a good thing in my book.The most obvious change to the controller is the battery pack.  The battery pack has been replaced with a AA battery compartment.  No longer is there a wart on the backside of the controller, which makes it a bit more comfortable.  The batteries are a bit more awkward to swap in a rush than a battery pack was, but it is still very manageable.The new controller is very slightly heavier at 9 7/8 oz vs 9 1/2 oz.The dpad is now recessed, but feels right.The location of the X, back and start buttons is a little awkward if you are used to the old controller.

Either way, it's a perfect level of volume no matter which you prefer.I've examined the bluetooth function with my Mac Mini, iPhone 4, and iPad 3, and have experienced perfect results with pretty stunning sound quality.  These headphones will work for you like a charm if you choose to use them to listen to music on your computer should you choose to do so.  Granted, the sound won't be quite as stellar as when you use them with a game on your console, but I have to say these headphones sound almost just as good as a 300 dollar pair of studio monitor headphones that I use on a regular basis.Rarely have I used a headset that's better across the board for this price, and for the current sale going on (these are $220 as of December 31st, 2013), I can't recommend these highly enough.  Buy yet another quality product from Turtle Beach!  I'll be using these for years to come!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2013"}

Both Spyro fans and those who didn't play the first game will revel in the  exploratory greatness that isSpyro: Ripto's Rage. Gone are the impossible tasks,  unbeatable enemies, and fragmented game flow. This game sports superior controls, more  colorful and faster graphics, a tighter story, achievable goals, and plenty of gameplay  variety.Don't be fooled by Spyro's cuteness--this isn't a kid's-only game. With multiple goals  and side quests, a fantastic soundtrack by ex-Police band member Stewart Copeland, and  a veneer of understated humor,Spyro: Ripto's Rageis highly addictive. The  playfulness of the main character comes through in the exploration of the otherworldly  levels using the new moves, including super high jumps, rapid underwater swimming,  and extended flight and hovering maneuvers.Determined explorers are always rewarded--sometimes with an ice hockey match or other  sub-game, sometimes with riches enough to learn a new move or uncover a new area.  Simply put,Spyro: Ripto's Rageis one of the best action/adventure games for the  system. Despite the fact that this game is a sequel, it manages to bring a fresh new look  and feel to PlayStation gaming.--Jeff YoungPros:Massive, fun levels are completely navigableCute and quirky sense of humor will appeal to all agesResponsive controls are an extension of Spyro's upbeat and exacting personalityCons:Camera angles can be problematic, but are completely adjustable","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"Spyro's back for another classic","reviewText":"Spyro's first adventure was a groundbreaking experience that took place inside a giant world filled with colorful, breathtaking beauty.  It was *awesome* the way the game encouraged you to roam around many graphically-appealing worlds searching for gems and dragons.  Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage proves to be an even BIGGER journey.I honestly didn't think it was possible to surpass the original Spyro game.  It was truly one of the greatest adventure games on the Playstation.  I can only find a couple VERY minor problems with Ripto's Rage.  Let's get them out of the way:- I think the biggest problem is the fact that, once again, the up and down buttons on the directional pad are *still* reversed.  This means, for example, when you go underwater in one of the water levels, you have to hit the Up button to swim down, and the Down button to swim up.  There's a couple other places in the game where the controls are reversed, too.  As far as I know there's NO way to change it to normal.  None of this may seem like a big deal but there's certain obstacles in the game that require you to move quickly through the water, and you want *everything* to be as perfect as possible while you swim to your destination, but thanks to the controls, it won't be easy.  Personally, I've never been able to adjust to it- every so often I will forget that the up and down buttons are reversed when I enter a water or flying stage, so I might swim or fly STRAIGHT into an enemy.  It's mind-boggling to me why the game creators haven't corrected it, or at the very least, gave the player an option to change it.- I find it slightly disappointing that, this time around, every stage has exactly 400 gems.  In the original, each stage had a different amount of gems for you to locate, which made Spyro's first adventure seem like more of a mysterious guessing game.  Not really complaining, though.- A TON of cutscenes are included in Ripto's Rage.  You can skip over them if you want, but I'm amazed that EVERY level has a cutscene in the beginning of a stage and another cutscene after you successfully complete the stage.  Don't worry, Ripto's Rage is still a huge game, maybe even bigger than the original.  In other words, the cutscenes don't suck up all the space on the disc.  Ignoring the cutscenes you STILL have a lengthy game.- This brings us to the next minor problem: the reason we have so many cutscenes is because each stage has a different odd-looking creature living in it, and these creatures (who happen to speak English very well) always want to discuss with Spyro the problems inside their world that they'd like you to fix for them.  Just the fact that EVERY stage features a different talking creature is both a good and bad thing.  A player might think Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage is throwing in TOO MUCH and therefore, you may assume you need to try and remember all the characters you come across in order to follow a story (which isn't true because once you complete a stage, most of the time you never see that character again, so please do NOT worry about having to follow along to any kind of complex storyline).  BUT, on the other hand, all sorts of wild-looking talking friendly creatures communicating with Spyro makes the game THAT much more adventurous.Those are the only complaints I can find, and when you think about it, those are pointless complaints because the game does so many things right.I honestly believe the challenge has been increased significantly in Spyro's second adventure.  Instead of three or four dragons scattered throughout each stage waiting for you to find and rescue, you now have to search for three or four bonus games per stage and you HAVE to successfully complete most of them, which would be an extremely positive thing EXCEPT for the fact that a small handful of these bonus games are REALLY hard to complete.Each time you complete a bonus game you receive an orb.  There's 64 orbs in the game total, and to reach the final boss, you're required to find 40 of them.  In my opinion, probably no more than 10 bonus games are impossibly hard so you SHOULD be able to go through the stages, collect 40 orbs, and beat the game.  Just don't expect to get all 64 orbs because, again, some of those bonus games are difficult.I'm not knocking the bonus games.  After all, it's more interesting to tackle a creative and exciting bonus game than to simply walk up to a frozen dragon and rescue him, like in the original.  In Spyro 2 you don't know WHAT kind of bonus game you'll encounter, which makes the game overall one notch better than the original.  To give a few examples of the bonus games you play: one of them has you playing hockey on ice where you have two minutes to make five goals, another bonus has you trying to quickly burn eight dangerous dragons before they eat the good guys (don't even ask me WHAT these good guys are supposed to be- let's just say they're friendly people that really love you!) another bonus stage has you swimming through rings.  A whole bunch of creative, interesting bonus games await you.  Even if you lose at some of them, you will want to try them again because they're so much fun.People who are familiar with the original might be confused when they reach the end of the game and realize that they only explored three worlds.  The original game featured five worlds, however, the three worlds in Ripto's Rage feature more stages.  So it balances out.The graphics are *exactly* the same as the original.  I can't find a single improvement, or at least, anything different.  The exact same graphic engine.  Oh, and thankfully the creators remembered that very important option to change the camera angle to \"active\".  VERY important!Stewart Copeland from the rock band the Police returns and succeeds with another fantastic soundtrack.  Another all-around excellent job.My favorite thing about this game are the three boss fights you encounter at the end of the three worlds.  All three of these bad guys are EXTREMELY AWESOME to fight (sorry, I'm in the mood to whip out the big letters!) It is SO much fun shooting fireballs at them.  They also force the player to find a strategy in order to defeat.  You never really came across a boss fight in the previous Spyro game that required a certain strategy.I love the fact that everywhere you go you find LOADS and LOADS of gems and other things.  The levels and worlds in this game are packed with things to find.  Positively PACKED.  A truly awesome game.  The first Spyro the Dragon game was awesome too.  Swimming around really adds more flavor and magic to the game.  Yeah, despite the control problem I mention above, swimming around still manages to be pretty fun.  Of course, there's a lot of running around too.  In fact, there's more running than swimming overall.Pick up Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2006"}

Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired.

{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","summary":"\"That which starts with a bang ends with a whimper... and what a whimper it is.\" (SPOILERS)","reviewText":"\"The Last of Us\" is a game that I've been looking forward to playing for the last two years since its announcement in 2011 on SpikeTV's Video Game Awards. Keeping track of its development has been, more or less fun and the anticipation has been part of that fun. But does it live up to the expectations it's lathered itself with overblown advertisement and special editions. Let's find out shall we?THE SET UP:The game opens on a rather mundane note: Civilian life, unaffected by cataclysm. A single father and his daughter exchanging words behind the mask of some really great performances from the actors. The gameplay from there is basically \"on-rails\"; you're allowed to control the daughter as she wanders about the house searching for her dad, but not much else. The player has no agency in any either case outside of witnessing the collapse of mankind. The situation the daughter neither cared for nor was aware of erupts in a ball fiery chaos that she's otherwise helpless to stop. And, to be honest, despite that set back of losing control of the daughter, the setup is pretty great. It sucks you in and really gets into the atmosphere of the game. Unfortunately, the game never quite hits you the same way ever again and the further you go on, you begin to wonder why the game started the way it did.The narrative switches from the man and his daughter to Joel, a forty some year old survivor with a bad reputation, looking to get even with a fellow smuggler who's double-crossed him and his lady friend. Yet, what starts out as a run of the mill \"Get Carter\", turns into \"The Professional\" when an ailing freedom fighter, named Marlene, needs him get someone she cares about to her people clear on the other side of the bombed out United States.\"The Last of Us\" is undoubtedly inspired by the more widely known post-apocalyptic titles that have come out in recent years. Robert Kirkman's \"Walking Dead\", \"I Am Legend\" (starring Will Smith) and Cormack McCarthy's \"The Road\" are the biggest ones, their initial inspiration for their Fungus Monkeys notwithstanding (a BBC documentary on insect fungi that kill and spawn from the dead bodies of their victims). It wants to be the video game equivalent of either one, placing heavy emphasis on \"survival at all costs\" and the brutality of a society without law and order, etc., etc.In the words of Edward Buck, \"You know the music. Time to dance...\" And \"The Last of Us\" walks to the familiar beat of every post-apocalyptic \"Not-Zombie\" tale that's been told so far. It honestly does nothing with it that wasn't explored in \"I Am Legend\". And while that's not a bad thing (like, it isn't), the irony of it all is that out of all the inspirations typically cited, \"I Am Legend\" is probably the biggest thing \"The Last of Us\" tends to remind me of its desperate need to ape the dark situations and themes I thought were executed out far better in 2009's \"The Road\". A lot of this, I believe, has a lot to do with the gameplay itself.PROS:VISUALS:First and foremost, it goes without saying that the game is beautiful in the sense that it recaptures the speculative sphere of a world reclaimed by the world that came before: nature. On a standard resolution television it doesn't look like much to write home about; on a glossy HD screen, it really shines. Animals run free and unhindered by the bars of zoos, ruined streets crowded by rusted out cars are cracked with grass and trees that tower over the typical adult human. Things that once mattered before --- computers, bills and jobs --- all sit idle, abandoned by mankind that was driven out into the forests and countryside's by their fellow man turned against them. Said man, now hollowed out vehicles for a mysterious parasite no one knows the origin of, shamble about in the ruins of the cities, looking to infect others or die someplace where they can spread their spores to infect unsuspecting people who wander into their path.Character animation is surprisingly fantastic for something that was largely refined and animated using key frames (a hit or miss method of animation basic emotions that most 3D characters can't capture). It's the little things like subtle emotions expressed by characters, the way the eyes (that still maintain the \"dead eye\" look from time to time) switch whenever things are spoken or suggested by certain characters. It's pretty entertaining to watch. Similarly the game makes note of the damage you take as player and create some fairly interesting animations to signify Joel or Ellie's injuries (it typically never makes it into the cinematics, unfortunately).GAMEPLAYLike \"Remember Me\" and \"Tomb Raider\", \"The Last of Us\" plays up the illusion of an Open World, but probably allows you to do a little more than either game mentioned allows. It wants you to poke around in every corner possible, but only to an extent: Obviously placed obstacles will pop up more than an invisible wall that slaps you in face with a lack of a signifier. At the same time, however, the game also wants you to be on your toes and be mindful of your surroundings. The task in-and-of-itself is not a hard thing for me. I check-and-double-check my surroundings on the mere basis of either missing an enemy or item that I feel I need to get before I've been shot at so many times that my frustration mounts to the point of gun-and-gun melee attacks.That need to be mindful of sounds, that kick in at the last second to notify you of an enemy presence, resulted in missing items and upgrades. Yet, I can't say that I'm terribly upset about that (I'm not an achievement/collectible hunter). If Naughty's Dog's intention was to make you as tense was possible then they achieved their goal immensely. It doesn't reach \"Amnesia: The Dark Descent\" levels of terror/tension, but it's pretty good for a game that never claimed to be survival-horror in the first place. In regards to combat, \"The Last of Us\" gives you as much of an option to take out or slip past your enemies as \"Uncharted\" does. Slipping past them is always going to be the more favorable option, however, the game does not always give you that option (unfortunately).Another pro in the favor of \"The Last of Us\" is that the lie that you couldn't control Ellie is revealed as so. At in one point in the game you are allowed to control Ellie. It's probably the one point of the game I enjoyed the most as far as its gameplay is concerned. Avoiding combat is actively encouraged because you are in control of a fourteen year old girl who is neither skilled nor adept at killing anyone unless she can sneak up on them Sam Fisher style and stab them repeatedly with a switchblade. It's also the only time you get to control Ellie (unfortunately).\"Listen(ing) Mode\" is extremely helpful in regards to counting how many enemies you may encounter in one specific area. There were far too many times where I found myself unable to check my surroundings by merely peeking around the corner, which typically got me spotted (because no one's put \"Splinter Cell Conviction's\" cover mechanics to good use), so the otherwise superhuman quality of Joel's helped me out a lot.In regards to the companion A.I., it's a hit or miss. Ellie's ability to warn me when I'm about to be jumped from behind is tres helpful; the first time it happened, I was completely surprised that the guy got as close to me as he did. Her ability to toss bricks, however, is a hit or miss. Sometimes she hits her mark, other times, they're far too interested in bum rushing the guy with the gun (me) and the brick misses them. Once you're spotted, she CAN get in trouble, so she's not completely invincible (but it also clashes with what I'll mention in the \"Cons\" section). Companions do help a great deal when combating enemies, even if they're aim suggests the game still wants YOU to kill all the enemies regardless of their presence.\"Crafting\" allows you to create makeshift weapons to help you in situations wherein traditional weapons may not be readily available to you and it works in spades in melee combat. It's the little details that Naughty Dog puts into the game that makes you appreciate the work put into it.NARRATIVE:The strongest part of the game's narrative is undoubtedly the relationship between Ellie and Joel. It's your atypical \"frenemies\" turned \"surrogate daughter/father\" relationship. The two can't stand each other, but tolerate and corporate with each other because they need to survive through to the next day. Circumstances conflate and eventually the trauma of their situation forces the two bond emotionally. The manner in which it is done is nicely paced and comes off more natural than forced and the effort into their relationship is appreciated.PERFORMANCES:The other element of strength are in the performances; pretty much every voice actor involved in this game (from the elusive Jennifer Hale to \"Half-Life 2\"'s Merle Dandridge/Alyx Vance) is at the top of their game and their performances reflect that. Ashley Johnson is especially great as the fourteen year old Ellie, capturing perfectly the almighty adolescence that makes the even most level headed adult cringe with self-resentment over their behavior of forgotten youth; only, Ellie has no normal outlets in which she can act out, thus making her \"rebellion\" and misguided youthful energy interesting to watch being channeled in other methods.CONS:VISUALS:The unfortunate side effect for all this detail in the character animation, however, appears to be the same irksome motion blur that attempts to hide clunky motion-capture/animation in the same way Crytek's \"Crysis\" series does with quick camera turns and oddly reminiscent of George Lucas' attempt to insert the deleted scene of Hans Solo talking things over with a CGI Jabba the Hutt in \"A New Hope\". It's a minor detail in an otherwise outstanding presentation, but it stands out enough that it bugs me.GAMEPLAY:There's been a great big to do about the A.I. in this game. For the most part, the enemy A.I. is pretty competent. If you fowl up in a stealth segment or somehow get caught by Fungus Monkey, you're going to be killed or end up in a combat situation that you will not benefit from. If you're vice versa, the A.I. is at least polite enough not to notice you and you can get to the next loading screen without incident. However, as I progressed in the game, the A.I. was beginning to remind me of the \"Uncharted\" with a little more polish added to it. There are a far too many times where the game's A.I. breaks the rules of its universe. There were times where an enemy will notice a fallen comrade, demand to know where you are and fall silent.A few moments later they circle back, spot the fallen comrade again and start threatening you if you don't attack or knock them out. Much like in \"Bioshock: Infinite\", A.I. controlled companions can and will walk out into the open while enemies are searching for you, but they will not acknowledge his or her presence. It not only breaks the immersion of the game, but signifies no developer has yet to create a perfect balance of \"helpful\" or \"detriment\" and will sacrifice any element of the game just to avoid complaints they end up getting anyway. It's actually making me rather appreciative of the A.I. in \"Resident Evil 4\"; as much as I hated having to save Ashley all the time (shooting her accidentally because she got in the way), you could never fault the A.I. for being dumb as bricks for doing its scripted job and attacking your major weakness.The opposite instance may or may not have been my own fault. Early on the first level of the game, I encounter a pack of Fungus Monkeys. The first couple attempts to get past them in a hail of spore fog was not pleasant. I took a break, calmed myself down and came back to attempt to the section again. I K.O.'ed one and got past the rest without alerting a single one of them. Out in clear daylight inside a room unclouded by spores, I congratulated myself by reading a note I spotted in the room. I'm fooling about with the camera when I notice Tess (my companion for this level) disappear back down the stairs. Out of nowhere, the hideous growls of the enemies came barreling up the stairs to attack me. To say the least, I was baffled. My companion either alerted them (highly doubtful) or the entire scenario was a scripted event where no matter what I did, I was going to be attacked anyway. I'm still trying to figure that out.A personal bother, for me, would be the \"Bloaters\", infected enemies that toss spores at you. There's a stipulation of the universe that implies that if you inhale any of the spores, you end up infected in a matter of hours or days. Naturally, I would assume, if you encountered these enemies within the gameplay, their spores would kill you in one hit because of their deadliness. Instead, Bloaters are this game's equivalent of \"UNCHARTED 2\" Heavy Armored enemies (bullet sponges). You waste immeasurable resources on these suckers when you attack them from a distance. Attempting anything else will result in your immediate death. Instead of a spore related death, the Bloaters scratch your face and tear at your jaw \"Mortal Kombat\" style. Thankfully, they rarely show up within the core gameplay.I don't like how the game never gives you the option to run from a fight once you get caught up in one. More and more often, as the game progresses you are forced into \"Uncharted\" styled encounters that tip you right off the moment you spot a dozen or so \"Chest High Walls\" scattered about the environment to hinder your escape and aid only in combat. There is even a bloody sniper segment. A sniper segment in a game where your best choice is run and hope you out pace the enemy or the infected get them first. There's a particular level where you meet a survivor named Bill that throws you into an arena of infected when the scripted \"escape\" event cuts the player off from the safety as enemies are coming straight for you. I was immediately reminded of the third to final level of \"Drake's Fortune\" where Nathan is stuck down in a hole fighting Nazi Zombies while Elena procures him a means of escape.Gameplay, overall, is probably my least favorite aspect of this game and that's pretty telling, if anything. More to the point, I experienced the same amount of displeasure in the combat system as I did in \"Uncharted 3\". Enemies are resilient to the point of annoyance when it comes to guns. Unless you can hit them with a perfect headshot, be prepared to have enemies run at you even as your firing your weapon of choice (sniper-scoped, shotgun, pistol, etc). I had better luck killing enemies with pipes and planks than I have with hand-to-hand combat --- the latter boiling down to the usual quick-time-events and clumsy combat animations and guns.Clickers, Runners and other variety of other Fungus Monkeys are notorious for bullet sponge abilities; and with the added \"realism\" of your protagonist fumbling with his/her weapon (supposedly), prepare to die in one shot if they so much as breathe one inch from your face. Your best friend will ultimately be a long range weapons, Molotov's and silent take downs --- these are the only aspects of the combat that I actually enjoyed as they are the only aspects that seemed to want to cooperate with me consistently. Naughty Dog has yet to impress me on any level when it comes to gunplay and it's not surprising that it's no different here.And as much I enjoy survival-horror and action-horror, I've never enjoyed what it's done to my fight or flight response. The mind knows its experiencing a vicarious moment; the emotional response itself doesn't. As a result, spending most of my time becoming more frustrated than excited every time I found myself being spotted by an enemy on the SECOND floor whenever I stealth-attacked one of their partner's to death on the level BELOW, inflates my frustration tenfold in tighter situations.As far as platforming is concerned, it's minimal and that's kind of disappointing considering the vistas you could've looked down from climbing up the side of a building. You're biggest channel will be finding either (a): a ladder, (b): a plank, or (c): a dumpster to get to the marginally higher level. And there's actually a little quirk where Joel and Ellie cannot make impossible jumps or even simple jumps that end in scripted events that land them in enemy encounters or the tedious cycle of trial and error.NARRATIVE:VIOLENCE: If this was a film, \"The Last of Us\" would probably make an unforgettable 90 minutes or two hours, however, as a game, its narrative is needlessly stretched thin by frustrating gameplay that really fails to deliver on the notion of violence being the necessary means to an end. The writers really don't know how to get across the idea of a violence-driven world. McCarthy's \"The Road\" made it inherently clear that the protagonist used violence when it was necessary and it was usually in the name of protecting his son. He never popped his gun off because someone told him to step off or get beat senseless. The violence was driven by necessity. In \"The Last of Us\", the violence depicted in the game never feels necessary so much as it feels like a trigger to incite gameplay because the story of \"The Last of Us\" is being presented as a game where violence is commonplace, but never necessary. The so-called survivors that the player encounters in the game come off as hired thugs from \"Splinter Cell\" and \"Batman: Arkham City\". There is never an instance that these characters are acting out of violence because it is necessary and they can benefit from it, but because they can. When you attack these men there's never an instance wherein you feel like you're about to kill a person driven to the edge of sanity, like Joel supposedly was, but just another hired gun for an invisible antagonist that never appears in the game.Their position as body counts for the player to pick off because they are \"Enemy A.I.\" renders their status as fellow survivors that are forced to survive in otherwise unsavory means null because we're never given the opportunity or chance to see them as anything other than \"obstacles\". The architecture of the game clearly labels them as enemies and thus needs them characterized as such. Violence is also incited situations wherein it should've have been allowed to be avoided. But because this is a video game, we can't go without fighting mooks so the game forces you into situations wherein the player must fight with limited resources or suffer the deaths of a thousand deaths if he/she attempts to do otherwise.When I think back on \"The Walking Dead\", game always made you hyper aware of what you were doing and the possible consequences that would follow had you taken that course of action. From the people you meet twisted by a zombie apocalypse, to the very final moments of the game wherein you meet another person pushed to the brink of sanity; the violence that was always present in this game impacted the narrative and characters as well as the gameplay. And every time you reached the end of an episode, you thought about the things you did, be it triggered by violence done to others or yourself.Here, violence is typically incited by the gameplay and not the story. In order to get you familiar with the controls, the gameplay incites a pointless moment of antagonism between Tess (my companion) and a character that doesn't physically attack her but threatens her by way of telling her to get lost. Her very words \"Forget this\" and the gunshot to the man's head is there simply to get the player involved in the violence that it incites because it's a game, but it does not drive the narrative in the same sense. I spent more time scowling at my screen and wondering why that had to happen than I did thinking about statements that Naughty Dog wanted to use with violence in their narrative. Basically, it's another case of action vs. story.CHARACTER: The heart of \"The Last of Us\" is the relationship between Joel and Ellie; it's clear on that point that the biggest amount of work into that particular aspect of the story. People are paramount in the narrative of the game and it shows. Survivors come and go like guest stars in a television series, and really, beyond Ellie, it's the minor characters I found myself the most interested in. It's also usually where a game like this basically loses me because of its absolute disregard for said characters.As a Person of Color it still bothers me that post-apocalyptic narratives are presented as overwhelmingly white. As a Person of Color, I hate that in the first level I'm astonished to see as many Non-Playable Characters of Color appearing oddly out of nowhere, shooting the breeze, if only to eventually dissuade controversial discussion over the next instance of pointless violence towards a stereotyped POC that verbally threatens a white woman (it literally embodies \"The Black Guy Dies First\"). As a woman, I'm bothered by the fact that for a game that purported to be a game about a girl and how she bonds with an older man on a perilous journey, that I have to play from the perspective of the so-called man with no morality. It essentially defeats the purpose of a female-driven narrative and colors my opinion on how the writer is able to even get across that Joel is man without compromise or sympathy with one exception because of the world he lives in now. How I choose to play as Joel flies in the face of how they want to portray him. And the more I think about this, the more I think Joel would've benefited from being a Non-Playable Character with the player in control of Ellie.Sarah becomes irrelevant in the spectrum of what makes Joel who he is. Sarah's death adds nothing to the narrative of Joel like the situation of the world ending does. There's one confrontation between Joel and Ellie over Sarah that goes nowhere because its forgiven the next instant. The intro begins to feel like a game that started but never began. Sure he's broken because of his daughter's death, but they make it clear the world and not her, made him decide that he was to become a stone-cold killer. And that thematic never really comes into true play until the final stretch of the game.There is a great deal about this aspect of \"The Last of Us\" drama that feels contrived. Minor characters that accompany you from time-to-time are killed off to remind the player that this is not a happy world and that this story is full of angst. As a result, emotional investment in complex minority characters like Marlene, Tess, Sarah, Sam and Henry is wasted endeavor as considering their position in a post-apocalyptic narrative. They are all sacrificed in the name of boosting white and male drama. Henry and Sam are literally used as mirrors for what WON'T happen to Ellie and Joel (because their the protagonists). Tess' demise feels like they ran out of ideas for the character and offed her because they didn't want a third wheel tagging along. Sarah's death, while undeniably heartbreaking, begins to feel like a hollow event made up of shock value. It even hits a home run with the \"Bury Your Gays\" trope with one particular character you work alongside with early on. Does it work? For the most part, yes and its because they actually allow him to be a PERSON shaped by the same circumstances as everyone else. Yet, he isn't allowed to be in the same sense that the thing that would really oust him for being overtly Gay in an industry that shuns homosexuality, is killed, hence the aforementioned trope. Watching these characters drop off one-by-one was like watching \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\"'s \"Becoming, Part One\" and \"Seeing Red\" over and over again. It didn't matter that Kendra (the Slayer of Color) or Tara (Willow's lover since S4) were characters with potential and could be used in another manner that didn't end with \"death\".They had to die because Buffy and Willow needed feel responsible for their deaths and the same formula is used in \"The Last of Us\". Other character's stake in the narrative doesn't matter outside of their relationship to Joel and Ellie. Every minority death that occurs is all in the name of boosting the white and male protagonist's drama. As a minority, I'm quite tired seeing POC, Gay and female characters used a sacrificial lambs for that type of drama. Heck, the narrative eventually removes Ellie from any sort of mental or physical agency near the end of the game, all to pull some hackneyed ending that is far too reminiscent every \"Uncharted\" ending ever. However, instead of zombies, immortal tree sap and psychotropic water, it feels more like the theatrical tending of \"I Am Legend\". Because of the title, the writer's felt the need to come up with something that reflected it instead of, I dunno, creating something just a little smarter than what was given.The sticking point of the narrative is that Ellie is immune to the parasite that turns people into infected: She is literally the \"Omega Man\", but the story doesn't make anything out of it. It actually does a great job of avoiding characterizing Ellie as the second coming of Christ. But, I also think that's where it falters. At some point, the story seems to forget about Ellie's infection in the hail of Uncharted gunplay and tedious stealth sections. It becomes less about the cure and more about her relationship with Joel. So, the final few hours feel like something that pulled right out of their rear ends. Ellie is removed from the largest part of the narrative and essentially robbed of all agency. When it comes to the BIGGEST PART of the narrative where HER CHOICES may have impacted the path of the story, she's knocked out. And it's all in order to tent-pole the male ego's need to rescue a young woman with no say in her fate. No say in a situation she would arguably went along with the plan, considering her determination to complete her mission.\"The Last of Us\" becomes less about Ellie bonding with a deplorable man and more about a deplorable man's selfishness mattering more than the possibility of arming mankind with some type of internal defense against a fungus. The irony of it all is that you know Ellie knows that he is lying. Most will undoubtedly enjoy it because they get to keep both characters alive and intact and I can respect that (who wants to see anyone die, really?). For me, it the ending feels too-self aware and proactive of a choice that wanted avoid the \"obvious\" ending in universe that implies no one has \"Plot Armor\" (and everyone dies). Not because it was right, but because they didn't want to come off as \"obvious\".Overall, \"The Last of Us\", while not horrible, is lacking focus. The game introduced some great ideas with its gameplay and mechanics, but the need to fall back on traditional TPS mechanics and finicky A.I. ruins the balance they were aiming for. The story of Ellie and Joel is a moving one, but it a story better suited for a movie as the gameplay does nothing to add or enhance that relationship. Minor characters are great, but sorely wasted and mistreated in a game that doesn't have the attention span to focus on anyone who isn't Ellie and Joel. Violence feels more geared to the necessity of gameplay and never the story itself. \"The Last of Us\" is a movie that could be better suited with avoiding the atypical narrative tropes it used here. To say the least, I'm sorely disappointed with the final product. especially whenever I think back on the fantastic job Telltale did with \"The Walking Dead\". [a 3 out of 5].Also: Love it that my review got a 0 out of 01 the second it pops up on the page.

The mindless zombies that'll indiscriminately eat anything in sight or the remaining humans who believe in \"survival of the fittest\"? Personally the human bandits frightened me the most. Naughty Dog did a phenomenal job of crafting all the villains and soldiers who hunt you ruthlessly because we all knew what to expect from the zombies already. The visuals were easily the best of any current generation console game. The details were off the charts in this game. The lush environments and the item crafting really stood out. Unlike previous titles, ND basically gave you scraps throughout the game to make equipment. Isn't that what you should expect if the world went to hell? There wasn't and there shouldn't be treasure chests filled with gear and ammo for you. Every bullet counts because on hard difficulty there is barely anything for you to craft with. I loved the visuals and the premise of the game but the two stars of the game, Ellie and Joel stand apart from the rest. The maturation of Ellie into a hardened and intelligent young woman resembled that of an award-winning novel. When the cards are dealt, you play them as they are and you don't have a say. She deals with lost loved one after another, killing a person for the first time, and carrying the weight of potentially being a cure for humanity. She straddles the line between bending and breaking but she never does break.Joel on the other hand, has to carry the guilt of losing his daughter at the beginning of the apocalypse for decades before. He wants nothing to do with Ellie at first for obvious reasons, he couldn't save his own daughter how could he be expected to protect another? It wasn't a coincidence that his daughter is roughly the same age as Ellie. Joel wants to bury his past but as he tries to make amends with himself. In the end, Ellie gives him the chance to do what he couldn't 20 years before which is save her from the elements and the situation. His relentlessness towards zombies and bandits is chilling at times. This is a man unleashing years of pain and anger with every kill he makes.Joel and Ellie are without a doubt, the two best characters fleshed out in a game that I can remember. If you merely add the game play and graphics without the leading characters, this game would have been a 8 or 9 out of a 10. But Naughty Dog spent the time and effort to craft an amazing story held together with two flawed, and very human, characters. They take what is given to them because that is all they can do. There is no knight in shining armor to save them. They only have each other.Anybody who thought the story and game were boring needed to be evaluated. I can only assume that the 1 star reviews were written by kids who enjoy watching cartoon network or WWE all day and think those are more entertaining some how.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"JLeack \"Jleack\"","summary":"A technical feat","reviewText":"Pros:- Remarkable presentation- Great cast of characters- Premium and diverse gameplay- Fun multi-player and co-opCons:- Lack of draw for multi-player- Very linearGameplay:At its core, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is an action-adventure game. In the single-player the game puts you in control of Nathan Drake, a treasure hunter who always seems to end up in bad predicaments. The single-player experience follows a very intriguing and diverse path ranging from stealth gameplay in a temple setting, to high action gameplay on a train. The game manages to remain highly entertaining throughout, and the story's development is terrific in presentation and delivery. Very rarely does a game come around that impresses you on so many levels, and Uncharted 2 manages to do that without a hitch.Uncharted 2 has several enjoyable elements wrapped into the gameplay that create for an unpredictable and consistent experience. The most notable is the third-person shooter aspect of the game, which is arguably the most prominent of the bunch. Shooting sequences and gunfights are fun and engaging. Secondly, the platforming throughout the game is great and gives you a sense of survival. Unfortunately, the platforming is overly simplistic which is good in the sense that it won't frustrate you, but also won't challenge you. The puzzles within the game are great and have a great deal of mass. At times you'll be presented with a room where the entire room is a puzzle which makes for some memorable moments. Lastly, the new stealth gameplay is a lot better than in the first Uncharted, and adds a whole new level of flair to the game. At times, stealth is the best way to take out a group of enemies, and your success with stealth usually aids in making some situations more bearable.Controls:The movement of Nathan Drake feels functional to a point where at times you'll feel like you can do anything. You have the ability to cover behind objects dynamically, climb objects, jump, roll and more. It really feels like a cinematic platforming experience that very few other games have even attempted. The gunplay itself stands among the best, and each of the over a dozen guns in the game manage to offer differences while still remaining cohesive. The controls in Uncharted 2 really deliver on all fronts, and there isn't a single gameplay element that went unpolished.Graphics:Uncharted 2 is undeniably one of the best-looking games ever created. The game hosts over half a dozen different environments, each with their own beautiful high-quality textures. Character model detail is remarkable, and never before have there been such a believable cast of characters. Character animation is unprecedented and so surreal that at times it's hard to believe that you're playing a video game. Animations throughout Uncharted 2 are not pre-animated and instead are generated on the fly based on physics, movement and obstructions. The game itself is very well presented, and really shows the gaming industry what is possible with current technology.Sound:Sound effects and environmental audio make for some very realistic scenarios. The sound of rain falling overhead with lightning shouting from the skies heats up the environment with a genuine level of believability. The voice acting is high-AAA movie quality, and the deliberate melding of both animation and audio manages to create a visual and audio delivery that no other game has managed to produce. The soundtrack itself captivates the setting beautifully, with each of the tracks pertaining to scenarios and provoking the feeling of human emotion.Replay Value:Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is an incredibly well-rounded game. In terms of single-player, the story mode is roughly 11 hours in length, but condenses an immense amount of both quality and experience. Each minute of the game is really stunning, and the single-player could easily sell on its own. On top of that is a very enjoyable multi-player experience which features dozens upon dozens of unlockables as well as 7 maps and multiple game types. As if that weren't enough, there are also 3 player online co-operative modes which range from survival to multiple co-op stages which can be played on 4 different difficulties. Uncharted 2: Among Thieves offers a great deal of replay value which will keep you occupied for weeks on end.Rating:Story: 9.5Gameplay: 10.0Graphics: 10.0Controls: 10.0Sound: 10.0Replay Value: 9.5Overall: 9.8Own, Rent, Avoid:Own - Uncharted 2 is a game that offers a lot of content which is also very detailed. This game will keep you entertained for weeks no matter who you are.Last Thoughts:Uncharted 2: Among Thieves has set the new bar for both the action-adventure genre and games in general. Naughty Dog has delivered an outstanding game that both pleases and impressed on so many levels. This is one of those games that comes out every once in a while that you just have to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2009"}

But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros.

The save feature sucks and sometimes you will beat endless pit levels get tons of stars for star world only to find that it didn't save and you have to start over.  It only saves if you beat an entire world or you manually do it which is total bs.  The multiplayer is the worst I have ever seen in any game ever.  It's a total mess, virtually unplayable with more than two players and even then it's super frustrating because players can cut each others jumps short when jumping at the same time, jump on other players heads driving them into pits, pushing each other off ledges, hit each other with items, kill the other players if you run ahead of them even slightly, die if the other players run ahead or are too far behind you, glitch kill the other players if anyone dies as it freezes all other players for a second if one dies.  If you freeze glitch near an enemy it's game over or if in mid jump it glitch drops you straight down.....hence killing you instantly as 99% of the levels with exception of level 1 world 1 are pits.  The multiplayer in this game is \"trip over the other players feet\" style which I hate just like Battletoads on NES.  For a simple Mario game the controls are mangled, unresponsive and sometimes have a damn mind of their own.  The layout is simple but the response time from the game doesn't match the buttons your pushing most of the time and you end up dead. I have still yet to figure out if the game was made this way or not.  The sliding around, the delayed or no jump sometimes when you hit jump while running and terrible hit detection combined with the 99% pit levels is maddening at times.  I fail to see how this game is for kids, if more than one is playing this at the same time they will probally choke eachother...even single player is to difficult for kids with all the precision pit jumping required.  The cut scenes could have been so much better and actually have effort put into them rather then having the same exact scene 12 times when you beat castles.  I have beaten the game from start to finish worlds 1-9 three times over and overall it was a frustrating as hell experience due to the games horrid controls, mangled hit detection, tired endless pit levels and savagely crippled multiplayer.  The lack of innovation here also took away from this game as it is a carbon copy of New Super Mario Bros DS.Update:  They just re-released this game with a new Racoon power up on the Wii U.  The game is titled \"New\" Super Mario Bros U, if they are going to keep doing re-hashes they should just call it \"New\" Super Mario Bros Recycled, it's a far more honest and fitting title if they are charging 60+ dollars for this game everytime they release it over and over again.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2009"}

One, you can purchase MGS1 off of the PlayStation Store for a reasonable price since all PS3s do play PS1 games. OR do what I did and pick it up at a nearby GameXChange for an insane price. Two, you can complain at Microsoft for demanding that this be released on the Xbox360 even though MGS1 is a PS1 format game. Third, if you were one of the strange few that only played or liked the Gamecube MGS1 remake then you need to complain at Nintendo and Silicon Knights for not wanting to release that version to other consoles.

You'll be fighting in no time and, due to the very cinematic and intuitive battle system, you'll look like a pro. The world is large and you'll feel very free to roam. Everything seems to be very well done and it is...at first.The more you explore, the more you notice that everything is pretty much exactly the same. The cities are vast labyrinths of bland repetative architecture. The NPCs are numerous and nearly identical. You'll find yourself being accosted by the same woman begging for change in every city on every other block. Guards are apparently all twin brothers (BIG families).Speaking of the guards. These guards are weak pathetic excuses for henchmen. Once a few abilities are unlocked you'll find that Counter attack is the guard's bane, and really the only ability you need. Wait for a guard to start to attack (they're kind enough to take turns, one at a time) tap the counter button (insta-kill), rinse and repeat. I've easily taken on 20+ guards at a time without sweating it. I'm not saying I'm that good, I'm saying they're that bad.That brings me to the \"stealthiness\" of the game. It's not really there. There's no real consequence for being discovered besides killing pathetic guards. So instead of \"blending\" slowly through levels I just started tackling and running through levels to speed up the monotony. Don't worry the guards don't care as long as you don't hit them or kill anyone. Even then you can just kill them and move on. Even your primary targets don't really invoke much stealth to dispatch. You have the option, but it usually doesn't pan out, so it's just easier to rush the target, kill him and dispatch his guards after listening to him blather on for 10 to 15 minutes.At first the missions are fun. Climb buildings for breathtaking views, save peasants from unruly guards for info and additions to your health meter, pickpocket, rough targets up, track down contacts and eavesdrop  for info. Go to your bureau and then go kill the target. Fun at first until 15 hours in you're still doing the same routine for every mission. It's not like you even have to snoop around for who to pickpocket and whose conversations to listen in on. You climb a building marked by the hawk circling over head. It then displays everything you need to do on the map, including the other buildings you have to climb to get the info. So you just follow the map methodically until you've done everything to get the ok to kill whoever you need to kill. Boooooring.The story... Unfortunately not redeeming, at all. The major plot twist happens 15 minutes in. As the story progresses you get your plot points told from the men you kill before they die. Unfortunately it's the same stupid thing everytime told in slightly different ways and the dialogue lasts a good 10 minutes. So you do a mission, get told the same thing everytime \"the bad guys are doing good, and you're actually the evil one\" and then you go back to your leader and he tells you \"nope they're the bad ones, go kill this guy now.\" There is no depth to the main characters and even after 20 hours, you still really don't care either way what happens to any of them.This game had SO much potential but fails because after the first couple hours there's really never anything new about it. It's painfully repetative. It's like a model: pretty to look at, but not enough depth or entertainment to spend more than a couple hours with. Rent it and save your cash.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2008"}

The main story is pretty short (I'd guess around 6-8 hours though I'm not sure) and there's really no other modes to sink your teeth into. There's a challenge mode where you can join your friends and essentially play small portions of levels. However, with no competitive aspect and little variety it quickly becomes boring.The story is a relatively generic jock sci-fi throwaway which ends up taking place solely in a blown up theme park. The game is very vulgar, but in a childish way where it's so stupid it's kind of funny. However other times it comes back around and you're left just shaking your head. The leash is an interesting gaming weapon, but it is very simplistic, allowing for very limited attacks and experimentation. Most effective attacks boil down to leash a guy to you (unless they're \"too fast\" which was annoyingly ridiculous) kick them away and blow of their head. The guns you get are pretty cool, but with very limited ammo most of the time and only two weapon spots the fun is limited. Also, the coolest part of the weapons, getting a new one and trying it out on a bunch of baddies, ends around 3/4 of the way through.The whole point system is very interesting, with how the leash gives him the hud and points for effective play resulting in ammo and weapon upgrades, but at the same time it gives points for things that break the idea. For example groin shots (dude, you just don't shoot another guy in the d*ck), getting drunk, and killing insects. Why not just get rid of all the pretense and make a wicked awesome game, who cares if it does or doesn't make sense.Finally, I had a multitude of glitches, the worst being a game breaking glitch where I had to restart the whole level. Along with that large glitch (of which I've heard there are many other gamebreaking glitches, mostly involving your AI partner getting stuck) there are many other smaller ones, for example some of the animations/challenges not activating when they should (especially for nut shots).In the end, this game is essentially a placeholder for Gears of War 3. If they didn't have to release it when they did, I think Epic could have had an absolutely amazing game on their hands.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2011"}

When it came out for the PS3 i was so excited!!! Luckily, I didn't rush out to buy it or i would have been seriously let down. (Although the graphics are amazing!!!) The gameplay isnt as good as i thought it would be. Unlike most people, my main gripe has nothing to do with the whole steering wheel thing. I've always played racing games with my controller so its never been a problem for me and the steering mechanism is pretty easy so it really shouldn't be a problem for anyone. Here in my opinion are the pros and cons of this game.Pros:-Beautiful graphics-awesome vehicles-weapons-online when it works-make your own music playlistCons:-AI is terrible!!!! they made the AI in this game tooo hard!! no matter how hard you try on some of the races you want be able to get in front of the computer. Just when your at the finish line getting ready to finish first the computer comes out of nowhere and passes you and ends up in first. WTF????-Traffic is tooo bad!!! I understand having a little bit of traffic but come on!!!! traffic can be ridiculous. which can cause you to lose the time trials or preview races-Not enough HOT Pursuit races, there's more previews and time trials and hardly any hot purusit which makes the game what it is.-Far to many cut scenes. even though it says skip they end up showing it to you anyways. It takes forever to start a race-load times are extremely long-the in-game wreck scenes are too long and you cant skip them. by the time you get back in the game from the wreck scenes everyone will have passed you.-when you are taken down its game over, when the computer is taken down its up and running in seconds which makes the game more difficult. If i have to stay down when im taken down why cant the computer?? its supposed to be realistic like racing up against other people but its nothing like that.-On some of the races you race against the computer which might have a better car than you and the only car you get is some lame car they choose for you to race in while the computer is going superfast and killing you.-Turbo is essentially useless because you cant out run the police even when you use turbo and drive perfectly which makes no sense.-no split screen. Why would anyone make a racing game without split screen??-online is horrible. maybe its that way for me because i rented the game and got a free 2 day trial, other than that you would have to buy the game to play online.-online was really glitchy, the only game i could play was the interceptor, no hot pursuit or race, how am i supposed to know if i like it if im playing something boring like interceptor??Between the AI, online, and all the in-game cut scenes i am soo glad i didn't purchase this game. there is no way i would pay full price for this. Maybe 10 or 15 dollars. They also have the nerve to charge money for the added map packs and extra cars!! NO THANKS!!!! a lot of my friends rented it but didn't buy it cause its not good enough. Now that i've experienced it i can see why....","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2010"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E986","description":"","reviewerName":"Alex \"47\"","summary":"The Best Racing Simulator Just Got BETTER.","reviewText":"-Note: I will add a LOT more to this review the more I play it. Stay tuned.-First things first - here's what you get when you get Forza 4 at or soon after launch date:The limited quantity \"Ship Bonus\" car pack available for fans who order Forza 4 early:1965 Ford Mustang GT Coupe2011 Koenigsegg Agera1997 Lexus SC3002011 RUF RGT-82011 Tesla Roadster Sport---It's finally here! After what seemed like decades, Forza Motorsport 4 is now available, much to the delight of video game and car enthusiasts everywhere. Given how great Forza 3 was, could Forza 4 be even better?The answer is, well... yes.Forza 4 is everything the third was, and more. More cars, more manufacturers, more racers online (16-players!), and, although not TOO many more, more tracks. I could make this review be 5,000 words long, but rather than do that, I'll try to make it relatively short. This game's incredible. I already said that, didn't I? Aw... but seriously. The World Tour mode is absolutely brilliant, and makes the single-player more fun to play, whereas in Forza 3 - at least in my opinion - the game was much better online. The only real downfall in World Tour is that, although the A.I. is SUPPOSED to get better or worse depending on your playing abilities, it doesn't work all that well, and you'll breeze through half the career or so with no trouble at all if you're a somewhat competant driver. The best thing about the World Tour, is that you unlock cars each time you level up. And now you're likely saying, \"Hey. Idiot. We could do that in Forza 3.\" But this time? You get a selection of normally between 2 and 5 cars to pick, and let me tell you, a lot of the time you are going to rip your hair out trying to decide which car you want. Lamborghini, Ferrari, or McLaren. Hm...Also in the single-player is the all-new Autovista mode, which allows you to take a look at a handful of the game's hottest cars, inside and out. Not only do you get some random British guy giving you information, you also get a bit of commentary from Top Gear's own Jeremy Clarkson, and lucky for us, Turn 10 didn't give him a script to read - he's as Jeremy-ish as ever. I should also let you know that to get the cars available in Autovista, you have to complete single-player tasks, so you can't turn your 360 on, go to Autovista, and check out Halo's Warthog right out of the gate. As a matter of fact, it'll take you quite a long while before being able to check that thing out. Autovista isn't going to be for everyone - I for one find it pretty cool, but I wouldn't check out a car more than once, but there are some people that will spend quite a bit of time drooling in it, and then another group of people that will find it completely and utterly boring.That sums up the single-player in a nutshell, really. Given that the game hasn't been released at the time of this review, I'm unable to review the multiplayer effectively, so I'll add that in at a later date. How's the game look? How does it sound? Let me just say that this is the best looking game I've ever seen on a video game console ... it's CAR PORN at its finest, and the sound only enhances it. While Forza Motorsport 3 had some cars that sounded sort of \"meh,\" Forza 4 is just insane - that's really the only way I can think to describe it. The tire squeeling, the engines reving, the gears shifting, all of it is pretty much unbelievable. The one downfall is the soundtrack, which I believe would be more at home in an arcade racer, not a simulation game like Forza.I've already said it probably half a dozen times, but Forza Motorsport 4 is THE GAME for fans of cars. With so many cars and more to come in the way of downloadable content over the months, there is something for anybody with a pulse. This review was quite brief, as I didn't want to explain every single little thing in the game, but I think I got the point across - I have a gut feeling this game will be my Game of the Year, and I've yet to play Battlefield 3, Modern Warfare 3, Skyrim, or anything like that yet. Yeah. It's that good.---Pros:Several hundred cars with plenty of more coming in the months following release.Improved everything, as you'd expect - car physics are more realistic than ever.16-player online racing.Cons:Only five new tracks, and developer Turn 10 isn't guaranteeing there will be more in the future as DLC.No Porsche due to licensing issues, although a few RUFs are available. (It's rumored that Porsche may be downloadable content after EA's exclusitivity rights expire in December.)No weather effects or night racing.5/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2011"}

At the time of its release, my computer was already considered \"over the hill.\" 2 years after the game's release, my new top of the line computer can still barely handle the game on high settings...after all, I couldn't imagine anything less would be worthwhile. But, boy, are those graphics beautiful. You can see the pores on a character's face. Yet, a pretty face isn't everything, and this brings us to the first critique: The developers created a game that most gamers cannot enjoy to its fullest. Upon release, it's capacity exceeded that of the X Box 360 and Playstation 3, whose players were left out in the cold. Even avid PC gamers to this day can only cringe at the processing power required. Typically, hardware and software manufacturers leapfrog eachother in technology development, keeping PC technology in a state of constant progression, however Crytek (the developer) decided to jump over the moon, leaving everyone in the dust, and questioning if they really wanted to follow - it is hard to comprehend how the game was even developed! There is such a concept as pushing too hard, too fast, and too soon, which might be a rationale for explaining why Crysis wasn't actually nearly as successful as anticipated - too many people simply weren't going to be able to experience the game.Secondly, the back end of the game is rather disappointing, and I am not talking about the storyline itself (Don't worry, I won't give anything away, assuming you haven't played the game yet.) At a key point in the game, the overall performance begins to become choppy and \"laggy.\" Many bugs will begin to present themselves, and make their presence VERY well-known, in some cases, making it impossible for the game to progress, as the bug(s) prevent a triggering mechanism that allows the game to continue from occuring. The framerate also tends to drop drastically for no apparent reason, and the game has the tendancy to \"crash\" unexpectedly. You can also expect to have problems with \"clipping,\" in which the problems are compounded by the physics engine. At unexpected and undesirable moments, the hero will find himself falling through non-existent holes in the deck of an aircraft carrier and sinking to the sea floor, and floating around within the solid matter of an alien space ship...can someone say, \"Philidelphia Experiment?\" Furthermore, controls tend to resist working properly when you need them most.  I can hear you now: \"Maybe you should get a better computer!\" Well, to the little drooling butterball living in your parent's basement, sucking up their parent's food and money to play games, I say to you, my computer is just fine, and handled the front half of the game beautifully, and is fully updated, along with the game. What these problems truly imply is that the developers and testers were sloppy and hasty during the back end of development.Of less importance, but still a sign of hastiness and laziness,is the boringness and poor performance of the vehicle interaction. They feel like a last-minute addition.Oh, and we cannot leave out the stereotypical FPS cliche of requiring the hero to empty half a magazine into the most basic of enemies to bring him down...if only we could take 5 bullets to the head and live to tell the tale!As a final note, however, I will end on positive terms - visually, the game is gorgeous and exceptionally impressive, and the storyline is unique and fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2010"}

{"product_name":"B002I08RA0","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"Not what I expected.","reviewText":"This is my first and only AC game that I have played, and after playing trying my hardest to enjoy this one, it will probably be my last.AC is one of those series that I always have had some interest in, but not got around to playing it, due to being occupied with other games as well as not having much free time to actually try it out.  But I have always been impressed with the commercials and there was a fair amount of buzz and hype surrounding these games, so when I got the opportunity to get this game, I jumped at the chance.  I was very excited while I waited for the game to arrive in the mail, but my excitement soon faded when I actually put the game in.To be completely honest I was expecting something completely different in terms of gameplay.  From my observation on the many AC commercials, I expected it to be some sort of Splinter Cell type game with more combat.  I loved the Splinter Cell series. While AC does have some stealth aspects, it just didn't come off as smooth as Splinter Cell did.  The game does move slow, but it just seems so forced and is not as natural feeling as Splinter Cell.In addition, the controls are absolutely horrible, there are confusing button combinations you have to remember just to do simple things like jumping or leaping to ledges while platforming, and while the game does have instructions on your screen while doing these things, it is still very inconsistent, and many times, trying something as simple as leaping to a ledge above you will have Enzio inexplciably vaulting off the wall to his death 100 feet below.  It seems as if you as a player are always a step or two ahead of the game and are forced to wait for the game to \"catch up\" to your movements before you can continue; extremely frustrating.The poor controls also carry over to the combat system.  Again there are different button controls you have to do to do simple things like block.  Instead of pressing one simple button to block, you have to hold down the Right Trigger, THEN press the button to block, but in the heat of battle if you forget to hold down right trigger, and you attempt to block with that same button you will do something completely different and unexpected.  Also the combat sequences are very slow and drawn out, and are not fluid at all as compared to Castlevania, Batman, or Drake's Fortune.  Also the slow motion scenes when you finish of an enemy are not only poorly done, they are distracting when the actual combat was slow enough as it was.  While Batman also has the slow motion finishing scene, that is preceeded by fast paced and FLUID combat so it is NOT distracting and usually the slow motion finishing move means the end of combat.The graphics are very good though, and the cutscenes themselves are done very well.  Its really a shame, that the  gameplay is just so bad.  Because this is my first AC game, I do not know much about the back story, so it is not fair for me to praise or criticize the actual story itself. But I can say I do not like the virtual reality simulator thing you are forced to go into whenver you die and you have to \"walk back into your memory\".  Its very annoying especially since you (me at least) are not exactly clear of where you have to go.  I would have thought you just have to walk forward, but sometimes for me that didn't work, and I was walking in circles until I finally got back into the action.  I also don't like that annoying jerk that follows you around on the beach.  I sense there is some animosity between Enzio and him, but too bad I won't play the game long enough to know more about him.  Because I don't enjoy the gameplay enough to continue playing.I tried this game as 5 different occasions trying my hardest to give it a chance, but I could barely get through the first level before becoming bored and frustrated out of my mind due to the game play and poor controls. As a result, this game will join GTA IV in my short list of games I own that I will never complete because of these reasons.I guess if you are a die hard AC fan, this game may be for you, but you are thinking about having this game as your first AC game, then I would suggest against it.  Maybe you'd be better of starting with the first two because from what I've heard the first two AC games are better than this one. But for me, after playing this game, I will never try them as I have become turned off from the entire series.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I0HCNI","description":"","reviewerName":"Nutwiisystem.Com","summary":"A better exercise game than most exercise games","reviewText":"I'll admit, after playing every movie tie-in game from Ghostbusters on the Apple II to Kung Fu Panda on the Kinect, I've grown a bit weary of them. Game publishers seem to know that they can produce a sub-par gaming experience, but as long as it contains characters and loose tie-ins to popular movies, they'll still sell a bundle.So my expectations for Star Wars Kinect were very low. Perhaps that's the best way to approach this game. If you go in expecting precise light saber control, graphics on par with the movies, or even a decent storyline, you'll likely be disappointed. On the other hand, if you want a game where you can build up a really, really good sweat and be moderately entertained in the process, you are going to want to add this one to your collection of Xbox Fitness games.The game has several playing modes. The main mode is the story mode called \"Jedi Destiny\". The storyline takes place somewhere between the first and second movie. The story begins with the familiar Star Wars scrolling introduction and music. You're a young padawan being trained to be a Jedi due to the increase in the power of the dark side. You start by flying to the Wookie planet, where you meet Yoda, who leads you through the training. You actually meet a lot of familiar Star Wars characters, from Chewbacca to C3P0 and R2D2 to Mace Windu. Voice acting is passable but not great.The training, of course, is mostly your getting acclimated to using the Kinect for gameplay. You get to start with controlling your light saber. Being able to foist a \"real\" light saber is of course one of the most anticipated features of any motion control Star Wars game, but in the case of Kinect Star Wars it's unfortunately one of the most disappointing. You never really feel in control of the light saber-for example, regardless of how you move your hands and arms the light saber will just make a \"slashing\" motion. Eventually you just learn that you have to flail your arms wildly to use the light saber (whether to deflect lasers shot toward you or to slash opponents in hand-to-hand combat). You do have some rudimentary control over high and low positioning of your light saber strikes and blocks, but precise one-to-one light saber control is probably something best done on the Playstation Move more so than the Kinect.Happily, the rest of the game is perfectly suited for the Kinect. On the Wookie world, you go through an obstacle course where you learn to run (actually, just taking a step forward), kick, jump, and crouch, skills which you'll need throughout the game. A little icon will appear in the game any time you need to do any of these things.By far the coolest feature of Kinect is when you use \"The Force\". You rear back with your left hand and point at an object (or villain) until it glows, and then you push forward to send it flying. This takes getting used to, but once you've mastered it you really feel like you can use the force anywhere (after playing the game I even tried using the force to grab my coffee mug from across the table...it didn't work). The inadequacy of light saber controls is mitigated somewhat by the ability to \"force push\" your opponents or hurl objects at them while you're striking them with the light saber.You eventually learn other combinations; jumping while hurling your light saber down, for example, causes an earth-shattering effect that renders your opponents confused, which is especially handy for the tougher opponents. Here's an example of what happens when you put it all together:Something else you get to do is fly a speeder bike through the forest. This too is a blast. You basically hold your arms out in front of you and steer by tilting your body left and right. You accelerate by leaning forward and brake by pulling back. You shoot enemies just by putting them within your sights (the gun will go off automatically, so there's no buttons to push). Later in the game you'll engage in space combat, where you man a gun turret a la Luke in the original Star Wars. Again, this is just a matter of leaning your body to control the gun scope.I'll be honest-the storyline is very weak, to the point where by the second mission I lost pretty much any interest in what was going on. Something else that annoyed me was that the action seemed forced and gratuitous at times. For example, you'll spend minutes fighting off hordes of enemies, your droid companion will says something like \"well, it looks like we got all of them\", and then a whole new batch of enemies will magically appear. After this happens repeatedly, you start getting annoyed, as if you're swatting off swarms of mosquitoes rather than having meaningful battles.But I have to admit, with the exception of Kung Fu High Impact and \"pure exercise games\" like The Biggest Loser or Your Shape, I don't think I got as good a workout with any other game. As other reviewers have noted, the physical activity in this game is intense. You're working out your upper body when you use your light saber to slash or to block, when you're controlling a pod racer or a spaceship, and even when you're using your \"Force Grip\" to hurl objects. You're getting a decent lower body workout every time you step forward to \"run\", and especially when you jump to leap over objects or to make the earth shatter with your light saber.All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by Star Wars Kinect. Unlike most other Kinect games, this one seems to have gotten past the \"Hey, isn't the Kinect cool!\" type of game play and really uses the Kinect in new and inspired ways. The Kinect is obviously an integral part of the game and with the exception of light sabers seems to add a lot to the game. Granted, it's not a perfect game. The story line is weak and even tedious at times, and there is the noticeable lag that most of us have gotten used to with just about any Kinect game. But if you can get over these annoyances the workout value is excellent.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2012"}

An excellent follow up to Dragon Age : Origins. I really enjoy the updated combat style. The character moves alot faster in this game compared to DA1. I have played it for both Xbox 360 and PS3 and it seems to me that the PS3 version runs alot smoother. It is not without it's faults though. I have experienced some freezing and sometimes the audio disappears, but this does not take away from the game itself. It has an excellent, deep storyline that keeps you hooked right off. Highly recommended for the Dragon Age fan. I am very impressed and am looking forward for more from Bioware.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002I0F5I2","reviewerName":"SM-NM Catboy","summary":"Fun but not quite an excellent game","reviewText":"Uncharted 2 is undoubtedly an above-average game; however, it is not quite an excellent one. I would rate it 3.5-3.75 stars, but certainly not above 4. Here are some of the reasons:1. In many scenes, other characters always get in the way and you can't maneuver Nate as freely. The battle scene with Tenzin and other Tibetan villagers is the most annoying. Stop following Nate around so much!2. Nate can only carry two weapons. Why? Some may say that makes the game more challenging. In my opinion, it's less fun and more annoying. Even in real life, you can carry more weapons and ammo than that.3. The Guardians (both in the Tibet snow cave and inside Shambhala) are too difficult to beat, making those battles very annoying. I am not a hardcore gamer who may enjoy stuff like that. If that's your cup of tea, then that's fine, but it's not mine.4. The puzzles are so stupid. Not fun at all.5. There are a few more cons that I can't remember....There are many good points about the game, three of which are [1] there are no finite life/health gauge (no health goodies to pick up), [2] the cut scenes are more integrated into the game, and [3] good graphics (I would rate background/scenery 95 out 100 and human faces 85 out of 100).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000P46NKC","description":"Resident Evil 4 Wii","reviewerName":"Terrence A. \"cinemaparker@twitter\"","summary":"Instant Classic!","reviewText":"This game is awesome. It's scary and a lot of fun to play with great production values.I'd never gotten to play the original Gamecube version or the rerelease on the PS2, so this was my first time getting to play this game and I loved it. One thing I have to mention is that this game does have a bit of a learning curve to it and I'll explain why: the nunchuck controller controls movement and the Wii-mote controls aiming, firing and menu functions. It's a bit daunting at first and it's just a strange thing to point the controller at the screen and aim where you want to fire. I got used to it but it took me a while, as I found that sometimes I would just forget to point the controller at the screen. Also, action sequences that require a timed button press are made to be a little more involving, replacing them with a shake of the controller or a winding motion if you have to do something like turn a crank. Once you get used to the button layout and how everything works, you'll have a blast. I really liked the B-movie presentation and the music is really well done, especially near the end. I wish the Wii was able to output in HD because the graphics were a bit of an eyesore after gaming in HD for the past couple of years. The graphics are okay but outdated and slightly muddy. Even more noticeable now that Resident Evil 5 is out, and that game is shiny and really, really nice looking. Still, the gameplay is good enough where you'd be willing to overlook that. Plus the game has all the extra features that were put into the PS2 version so you're getting a feature packed game for relatively cheap.If you have a Wii, I'd consider this a solid purchase, especially if you haven't already played it. This was a lot of fun from beginning to end and definitely worth experiencing, especially with the Wii style controls.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2009"}
