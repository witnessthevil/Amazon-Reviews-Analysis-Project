{"product_name":"B00005NZ1M","description":"When Microsoft releasedNFL Fever 2000on the PC in 1999, it gaveMaddena serious run for its money. It's been a few years, butFeverandMaddenare once again going head-to-head on the Xbox,  and once againFeverproves itself a serious threat to EA's perennial  football powerhouse. That's not to say thatNFL Fever 2002is a perfect  game, because it isn't, but it does offer great graphics, decent AI, and plenty  of bone-crunching gameplay.NFL Fever 2002features several gameplay modes, including practice,  single game, and season, which itself contains a couple of different options,  including dynasty and fantasy challenge.Fever 2002has a full NFL  license and includes all 31 current NFL teams--and 15 fantasy teams--along with  all the current stadiums. Dynasty mode is where most players will find  themselves, as this mode lets you manage all aspects of your team, including  signing and cutting players, negotiating trades, and making sure that your team  comes in under the salary cap.A great feature in dynasty mode is Dynamic Player Performance, which adjusts  players' ratings (which determine how well they play) based on past game  performances. So if you have a second-string running back who rattles off three  or four great games in a row, his rating will increase, which should keep him  performing at that high level. On the flip side, if a player has several poor  games, his rating will decrease.Because it was designed specifically for the Xbox (unlikeMadden NFL  2002, which was ported to the Xbox from the PlayStation2 version),NFL  Fever 2002looks awesome. Player animations are highly detailed, the  stadiums look fantastic, and the weather effects are topnotch. Beyond the  obvious features, though, there are many subtle details that really add to the  experience: the field will get torn up in wet weather, player uniforms will get  stained with dirt, and the crowd will begin to thin out if the game is a  blowout.In terms of gameplay,Fever 2002delivers a solid experience. The AI is  pretty solid, especially on the defensive side, and if you call a perfect game  it's possible to get a shutout against the computer, even on the higher  difficulty settings. On the downside, the computer rarely runs the ball, even  when it has a high-powered running back like Corey Dillon, and AI play calling  is rather suspect at times.Those complaints aside,Fever 2002is a lot of fun. It offers great  graphics, multiplayer is a blast, and the dynasty mode features a good deal of  depth. If you only want one football game,NFL Fever 2002deserves your  consideration.--William HarmsPros:Dynamic Player PerformanceGreat graphicsSolid defensive AICons:Computer rarely runs the ballGameplay a little arcadelike at times","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Beautiful, easy to learn, fun, but missing some key points","reviewText":"One of the flagship titles for X-box and one of the reasons I was so looking forward to X-box to begin with...a great looking football game without having to learn all those massive key combinations like Madden (which can suck the fun out of a game if you're so busy trying to figure out buttons).I'll leave the pro's quite simple, since many of the reviews you will read are all positive, and I concur for the most part:- Game graphics are absolutely stunning.- It is relatively easy to learn...you can pretty much master the controls 20  minutes out of the box, and the included tutorial is great.- Tons of plays to chose from, some would even say too many...I know I can't possibly go through all the plays within 30 seconds per down.- The stadiums are great as well as weather and lighting effects.  All the teams are present, plus many to unlock and special teams.- Accurate stats on all current players and extensive create player/roster functions.- Highlight real and commentary add more realism.- Great save feature.- Practice feature.- Energetic soundtrack.- Force feedback on controls.The not so bad cons:- The manage teams (you play the role of manager) function is a bit overwhelming for the casual fan.  You can literally spend hours building teams from scratch, trading players, working with salary caps, etc.  This is micromanagement at its most and really detracts from the game unless you like that sort of control.- Dynasty mode.  You play a team for 25 years and try to make your mark in history.  Fun, but the quarters are limited to 5 minutes thus really making it hard to make a game without huge plays (a big gamble).- No season mode.  Why can't I just pick a team, and play one season up to Superbowl?  This is probably my biggest contention with the game.- For novice players, the whole 3-4, 4-3, dime and shotgun plays need better description.  With so many plays to choose from it's hard to decide on the best strategy with little description.  Most of the time, you will just end up picking the `recommended' play that the CPU chooses.All in all, this is a great and fun game to sit down with a buddy and play a regulation game with.  I know my friends and I are sitting on the edge of the seats when we play and really get excited with great execution of plays.  But the long dynasty and lack of one season modes make this game fall short of 5 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2001"}

Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Fast and flashy","reviewText":"Bayonetta is a female clone of Devil May Cry, so really if you liked that game , you'll like this. What's been added is a lot more crazy attitude and a wilder series of events in general, and a LOT of combos.The plot is so hard to understand you might be advised not to bother trying...just play the game - which in it's barest detail means that you go from location to location, kill everything that moves, move on, kill everything again, kill a boss. Collect points and items, upgrade your weapons and buy new skills, you get the idea.The problem for me was that successful fighting was based on combo's. And there are an INSANE amount of combo variations. Well I mastered about 2 of them. And trust me, if you're not one for combo mastery then I would pretty much forget about Bayonetta. Many enemies and bosses will just paste you in the blink of an eye if you can't do something like: X,X,X, pause, Triangle, pause, pause, X and Triangle together. Or about 3 dozen variations just like that. I may be past the prime of a teenager now but this combo madness just left me cold. I died thousands of times because my combos were so lame. And that left me feeling very frustrated, because I really wanted to be having a great time...the game really looks like you should be having crazy mad fun being a bad-ass, combo-performing sexy witch, but in my hands, she was none of those things.Which is a shame becasue the game looks awesome. Bayonetta herself is a sassy, smart talking dream of a character. The scenery is all lush, the bosses are gigantic and awe inspiring. There is also some variety in gameplay: first person shooting, motorcycle riding, gravity defying platforming and some spectacular set pieces: I LOVED the prologue in which you fight while standing on a falling clock tower - and it happens again when you have to escape a burning town and you have to run up a tall tower while it gradually falls over - very clever.But sorry, I can't do combos, so sadly the game did not get to show me it's full potential. But I am sure there are lots of skillful gamers out there who will love this. And I didn't notice any poor performance on my PS3 as mentioned in early reviews - did it help that I entirely uploaded the game onto the hard drive before playing? Anyway, it looks great and is fast and furious. You could do worse than to try it out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2011"}

Included on one disk is Sly 1, 2, 3 and a 4 mini games.  The mini games are worthless, just a bunch of 30 second motion games to demo the Move.  All three Sly games are presented in 720p HD.  The games are clearly much cleaner, sharper and just overall more graphic.  The framerate is also much smoother.  The sound is also much cleaner and stronger.  All three games feature trophy support (very easy to platinum all three).  Really those who want Sly in HD should pick this collection up.  Those who always wanted to try out Sly, they should probably pick the collection up.  For those who never liked Sly, obviously this collection isn't for you.  These games are not built from the ground up, but rather just polished and refinished a bit.  Sly to the Sly Collection is just like God of War to the God of War Collection.  While the games are not built from the ground up, the graphical enhancement is clear as day.  The games look much better than the original ps2 versions.For those who don't know the series, it is an interesting mix of Metal Gear Solid, Mario and Ocean's Eleven.  My main draw to the series is the unique factor.  I have played hundreds of games, many just seem like the same game I have played before.  Sly does not fall into that category.  It stands as a very unique experience and there isn't much quite like it.  The gameplay is a mix of platforming and sneaking around.  The games are certainly lighthearted and not adult themed, which works for me.  I enjoy Mario, Pixar, etc.The only complaints I have is the price (probably better at $35 or $30) and the mini games are terrible.

Not that they are bad mind you; some are outright fantastic (Metroid Prime 3, Zelda, Mario Galaxy) but a lot of them are either family/kid-oriented, using the controller in a gimmicky-\"aint-this-neat\" way or they're just ports of other games with Wii controls. But now and then one will surprise you and while it might not be buy-worthy - unless you have kids in which they'll have loads of fun with this - Lego Star Wars is a game that's quite fun although it does run into a few flaws.Story: The selling point is that you can replay the entire Star Wars saga in game form, starting with the Phantom Menace right till the end with Return of the Jedi. Some faithfully recreate moments from the films, including camera angles at times, while in others it changes it in a quirky way (example, in Episode I where Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan ambush the droids on Naboo, instead of both fighting them, Qui-Gon does the work while Obi-Wan's lightsaber malfunctions, complete with a facepalming Qui-Gon).Graphics: This ain't Mario Galaxy or even the Umbrella Chronicles but the graphics here are quite charming since everything's done entirely in legos (obviously) so it's a very inviting and kid-friendly atmosphere. In 480p, there's not a lot of super impressive effects save for the lightsaber glow but everything looks shinier.Sound/Music: No real voice acting to speak of save Metroid-style grunts and yells from various characters but the music of course faithfully recreates the film's soundtracks. My one problem, strangely is that the volume seemed kind of low and it didn't really knock me on my you-know-what. I loved playing Knights of the Old Republic because the sound really made the experience epic while here the music should've been brought up more.Gameplay: Platform-style through various levels with a couple of vehicle-based missions (the podrace in Episode I for instance). The stages are filled to the brim with things to \"force\" which'll yield money, things you can build/destroy or activate. You travel with a pack that can range from small characters who can travel small spaces, R2-D2 who can hover for a short time or others that can hookshot up onto a ledge. My one complaint is that at times you'll find yourself unsure of where to go and it's only through either trial-and-error or just accidentally stumbling on it that you'll know where to go.What makes the game's replay value through the roof is with the money and level collectibles that can be found. If you ever love 100%-ing a game like the Grand Theft Autos or Metroids, you'll be busy with this as not only are there is characters to unlock and things to buy but a percentage rating for each stage. What might bug people of the games is that aside from the combination of both trilogies, nothing really substantial has been added. While it's more neater to have lightsaber sounds come out of the Wii-mote (which by the way can be used for lightsaber action but it's not direction-specific. ie swing up, characters swings up etc, it's just an ordinary swipe), it's basically the same thing but for those, like me, who have never played a Lego Star Wars game before, this is the one to get.Small kids will find a lot to like with this one as not only is it Star Wars but there's just so much to do and it's all in Legos so big plus there. Adults will find it fun but it's not really deep involving gameplay, it's just enjoyable to play.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2008"}

David Swan","summary":"Get Off the Couch and Catch Some Pokemon","reviewText":"I won't go into all the features of Soul Silver because by and large this is nothing more than an upgrade of previous games. There are zero new Pokemon but there are huge opportunities to fill in gaps in collections. I managed to obtain some of the rarest Pokemon that I've never had a chance to snag before including Mewtwo and Ho-oh. Even many of the non-legendaries that were still tough, if not impossible to get in previous games are available. For me the starter Pokemon may be harder to get than legendaries since you only get your choice of one of three when the game starts with the other two being completely unavailable. One nice thing about Soul Silver is that it gives you a starter Pokemon from Kanto and later in the game one from Johto and one from Hoenn. I managed to get a Cyndaquil, Squirtle and Torchic in one game. None of the ultra-rare event only Pokemon like Mew, Arceus and Celebi are available without, again, going to an event (and I hear a rumor that Mew will be available eventually in a WiFi event that anyone can easily get).  So that's it for what's available to those who want to \"catch `em all\". What I will focus my review on is the one new big feature of the series, that being the Pokewalker.There is no doubt in my mind that the Pokewalker existence is a direct response to the growing epidemic of child obesity. The big question is whether it's properly designed to meet its goal. I found that the Pokewalker exceeded my expectations and might just open up a new frontier in gaming. The Pokewalker is a pedometer that can also serve as a kind of pseudo Pokeball. In fact it's even designed to resemble a Pokeball except for the fact that it isn't spherical. In order to get your Pokemon into the Pokewalker you need to place it in front of you DS and press a button to connect and the data will stream over. Naturally you can also return your Pokemon and a good day of moving about should raise you Pokemon up a level as well as increase its happiness. As a pedometer the Pokewalker will count the amount of steps you take and store up `watts' that can be traded in for chances at Pokemon or items. Any watts left over when you return your Pokemon to the DS will get saved and when you collect enough watts new areas for walking open up. When I say areas I'm referring to the area that your Pokemon will walk in and the other Pokemon you encounter will differ based on the area you send your Pokemon. For the player, running, biking, riding the elliptical, doing housework, walking to school and so on will generate watts. For ten watts a player has a chance to catch a Pokemon using the three buttons on the Pokewalker. For 3 watts a player can try for an item. Catching a Pokemon is pretty simple and you'll probably succeed more often than fail except in the case of harder Pokemon. Using a Wifi event I opened up a route called Winner's Path and had a heck of a time getting Munchlax, one of the few Pokemon that continues to elude me. There are unlimited balls and any damage to your Pokemon heals at the beginning of each battle. There are three levels of Pokemon per area and the more steps a player accumulate in a day the rarer Pokemon they can catch.The Pokewalker succeeds because it encourages players to move around quite a bit in a single day in order to get better Pokemon and it encourages them to stay active by having environments that are locked until hundreds of thousands of watts are accumulated. There are just tons of Pokemon available in the Pokewalker including some that are quite difficult to obtain. The best one I saw was Spiritomb but that one requires a whole lot of watts so a player will need to move around quite a bit. There are no legendary Pokemon in the Pokewalker and personally I think it would have been nice if it included something like Celebi although perhaps it's difficult to limit a capture to just one with the Pokewalker which would mean player could conceivably load up on multiple legendaries if one was available. I really can't say whether kids are actually moving about more to capture more Pokemon but this is definitely the kernel of an idea that could take off. It's quite likely that video games bear at least some measure of responsibility for childhood obesity and it's nice to see Nintendo trying to reverse the trend.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0009XEC02","description":"Third installment of the popular SRPG series.  First for the DS handheld.","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"Even better than its predecessors...","reviewText":"...which is saying a whole lot. It is my professional opinion, as a hardcore strategy gamer, that the Advance Wars series represents one of the top 5 strategy franchises of all time. The previous two GBA offerings- Advance Wars and Advance Wars: Black Hole Rising- were as close to perfect as any turn based strategy came I've seen.I'll be forthright though- I prefer combat-oriented games over empire building/resource gathering ones. If you're a big fan of the latter, the general lack of micromanagement in Advance Wars may be a turnoff. Or then again, maybe it'll make you start to realize how boring all that stuff really is. The presentation and game mechanics are little changed in Dual Strike- even the graphics look pretty much the same as its GBA forebears. You still just have one money resource, which is accumulated by holding cities, and all of the units and COs from Black Hole Rising are still there.Dual Strike adds a bit of extra functionality on the DS. Namely, you can control everything with the stylus if you want (I found this to be a bit cumbersome however, and quickly returned to the D-pad), and the second screen sometimes turns into a second battle front or a display of an objective. You can also have two CO 'tag' teams that you can switch off at the end of a turn, and that can activate both of their super-powers together. This is what the 'dual strike' refers to, and it also lets you essentially take two turns at once, which is extremely powerful. In some missions you actually have two battles taking place at once, and the second can either be directly or AI-controlled. There's also missions where a special objective is shown, e.g. a missile that will kill everyone if it lands in 45 mins. The added real-time aspect is actually rather fun.Points accumulated during battles and missions can be spent on maps, uniforms, unlockable COs, and other traditional fare. Additionally, COs gain experience every time they win a battle, and every 1000 points they get promoted. This unlocks special skills that do everything from charging the power meter faster to giving you funds when you damage enemies. Each CO can choose up to 4 skills, and you can change them outside of battles.And then, of course, there are new COs and units. All of the nations have new commanders, all with distinct powers and capabilities. Green Earth's Javier, for instance, has resistance to indirect fire and is actually somewhat decent against Grit. New units include the aircraft carrier, stealth fighter, piperunner, black bomb, and megatank. All of these have a pretty significant impact on battle, though all are also very expensive. Some of the traditional units have been tweaked as well- the most noticeable change is that cruisers can now shoot at other ships. There's also the comm tower- a new building that boosts your firepower when captured, and Oozium- a slow neutral unit that destroys any unit it runs over.These changes, though nothing that'll make the game unfamiliar to veterans, are enough to make it new and more fun. There's even more replay value here than before, with all the skills and content you can unlock. The campaign is- as one may expect- excellent, and includes a traditional 'hard' mode. There is also a level editor, and several new battle modes.While perhaps not the best looking DS game out there, Dual Strike is certainly one of the best in terms of gameplay. It improves upon its predecessors, both of which were impressive achievements in their own right. For fans of strategy, this title alone is reason enough to purchase a DS, and comes with the highest recommendation.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2007"}

You need this like you need blood in your body. Okay, maybe not that badly but still worth every cent.Review:The single player for this first person shooter is a tad repetitive but still tense and creepy as all hell. I wouldn't put this at the top of scariest games of all time but it's at least top ten. It's unsettling and unnerving at times but the emphasis is more on action in this game.The single player campaign is a lot of fun, with pretty nice graphics and effects. The rag doll physics are hilarious and it's always a blast to shoot someone and watch them fly back and over a railing to a six story drop. One of the things that makes the single player really stand out is the enemy soldier A.I., which you won't really appreciate until you experience it for yourself. They are very strategic in their methods and execute what seems like professional, real-world offensive maneuvers in washing you. Just don't be surprised when they keep you pinned down long enough to throw a grenade right where you're squatting and there isn't a damn thing you can do about it. There is also a nice little Max Payne style slow motion button that works wonders when you're going up against a squad of commandos with high powered machine guns and rocket launchers. Also, the 5.1 surround mix on this game is immaculate. This is a game to be played loud and in the dark for maximum effect.The multiplayer portion of the game is just downright gritty. Literally, it's the perfect game for those that just want to go online and shoot someone in the face with a shotgun or empty an entire clip from a machine gun into their jiggling bodies without having to think about it too much. The modes are your standard deathmatch, CTF, team based modes so there's really nothing innovative about the multiplayer game, save for the modes that allow one to use the slow-mo function. I'm actually surprised at how well it plays online and if there's one thing that I have to complain about, it's the lack of a lobby function. So basically, you'll get kicked out of the room once the session is over and everybody will have to start the process of starting up a new room over. It's a minor beef and I'm praying that they'll fix this with a patch, which I'm sure they will.Bottom line is, this game is damn good and a great port over from the PC version. Great graphics, fantastic surround sound, exciting multiplayer action and some spooky chills will make this worth your while.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2006"}

Like other titles in the Call of Duty series, it uses team-based play, with the computer \"driving\" your teammates.  Modern Warfare continues in the tradition of the other titles, following one common storyline and putting you in charge of the major players in the story.  However, this time around we get more structure to the missions, more life to the characters, and more depth to the story.  You spend most of the game as new recruit 'Soap' MacTavish, but you also get to flash back to an earlier point in the story, play as your commanding officer, and learn more about him.One odd departure from other games is that there are storyline sequences that are not exactly \"playable\", but neither are they cutscenes.  You live a segment of the storyline through the eyes of the person going through it.  These are short, so they don't frustrate, and what they do is heighten the drama.  It's an interesting technique, and because it isn't overused, it works well here to keep the storyline going.Another great pacing trick is that the storyline spans countries.  It crosses continents and it puts you in more than one spot:  one of my favorites was manning three guns using night-vision cameras aboard a large plane as it provides air support to your team on the ground.Overall, the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare graphics are very detailed, the environments feel authentic, and the sounds impressed me.  One new wrinkle was the addition of dogs, which you have to melee if they get too close to you--fighting them off can be pretty startling and very deadly.  There were some interesting graphics upgrades this time around too:  more realistic blurred vision, heat waves blurring the air.  Particle and dust effects that seemed alive with their own physics.  Night vision also looked very convincing, and zooming in with the scope produced graphics just as sharp as if you were standing up-close.  I also liked the dialogue and I really enjoyed the fact that my teammates seemed to be somewhat intelligent.  There were some really neat goals in each mission, and I have fond memories of the adrenaline rush.  I'm delighted that there will be a Modern Warfare 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2009"}

My ONLY problem with Syndicate was for its almost $60 price tag it was way too short to have NO online content to speak of. The game play was beyond awesome. The visuals while not ground breaking in any way were acceptable. The guns were slow. There were way too few trophies for accomplishments. Some bosses were great just hard enough to beat to make the experience fun. Others bosses were not so great either too easy to beat or too hard to beat. All the BOSSES were TONS of FUN! The controller set up could have been a bit more user friendly but hardly the worse control button layout I ever experienced. The game was reasonably fast paced. The cut scenes were nice. The story was predictable but interesting enough to keep me hooked. I finished this game in 2 days which is an all time record for me. The only real problem I had with the game is that just when I was really getting into the game and all its complex but interesting features the whole thing was over. The game has almost no replayability because it lacks an online play mode which at its price is unforgivable these days. There is no Downloable Content that adds to the storyline. If Syndicate had as many places to visit and things to do as lets say Borderlands this would have easily been my new favorite game. For its price Syndicate is very expensive fun given it is so totally short. Syndicate is like eating at a Posh Upscale Restaurant, the food is great, the presentation and preparation of the food is awesome, the atmosphere is beyond perfection problem is the portions are so miserly that you leave the place so hungry you could eat a cow! Syndicate was so much fun it made you hungry for more that it did not deliver. As for comparing Syndicate to Deux Ex. Syndicate is so much better than Deux Ex ever thought of being most notably because; Syndicate is a fun action packed FPS shooter that actually gives the player ample ammo. There is no shortage of ammo in Syndicate AMMO as it should be plentiful. Oh and the weapons in Syndicate were also fun. Loved the Sniper Rifle too. So Five stars for Overall FUN and 4 OVERALL for lacking an online player mode and being woefully too short in campaign mode! I am happy to have brought Syndicate but for being such a short campaign for its heavy price this game is one hell of an EXPENSIVE TREAT! You might want to wait till the price comes down if you are a gamer on a tight budget!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2012"}

I'm pleased to say that Arkham Asylum falls under 'good'. As a matter of fact it's the best Batman game yet.With the Joker on his way to the gloomy nuthouse it's safe to say that he's not going to be a problem anymore right? Wrong! He deliberately manipulated Batman and many others in order to get inside the asylum and execute an outrageous plan of mayhem and death that involves some of Bats' most famous foes. A long hallucination scene induced by Scarecrow's poison is the highlight of the game.As Batman you have to explore every murky corner of the island from long-forgotten caves and sewers to the high-security penitentiary. There are plenty of thugs and convicts along the way that need beating up and pulverized as well as 240 Riddler challenges. It's not particularly hard but there are some parts of the game that will have you tearing your hair out in frustration and absolutely hooked until you beat it. There's also loads of trophies and some DLC for those who need to get more out of it.Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamil return as Batman and the Joker. To me, and to most people, Conroy IS the voice of Batman. Forget the nobody who has taken over in recent years with poor interpretations like The Batman, and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. If it's not Conroy, it's just not right.However, the only real complaint (and it's a big one) I have of the game is a common flaw among all video games these days. The X button just has to many functions, often resulting in Batman doing something you don't want him to do, which can lead to death. This is especially infuriating during the Joker Challenge matches.Pros:Brilliant GraphicsAdrenaline-fuelled fight scenesKevin ConroyMark HamilHarley Quinn is gorgeousAmazing ArchitectureNo RobinCons:Bland musicNot much of the BatmobileNo AlfredGraphics ASound AGameplay BLasting Appeal B","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2010"}

Mok","summary":"Frustrating, poorly paced, awful save-game system.","reviewText":"Activision got the mechanics of this game pretty much spot on, and it looks and sounds great, with good artwork and graphics, plus good voice acting.  But the gameplay is seriously hindered by some massive problems:- There is no alternate mode available to play.  When you start out, you pretty much have to play Story Mode.  You get very limited control over which X-Man you play as.  Yes, there is a roster of tried-and-true favourites to choose from -- Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm, Iceman, Rogue and Jean Grey -- but they're not all available at the same time, and their abilities are poorly balanced (Wolverine is overpowered as usual, but Cyclops positively sucks).- Why bother having a Danger Room training mode if the only character you can train is Magma?  When you start out, there *are* a few team-training missions where you can build up the abilities of your preferred X-Man, but it's not possible to do the single-character training lessons as any character other than Magma.  Boo.- Each mission is far, far too long, with too much running around looking for things to smash.  The second mission in the game (also the first mission proper) took me about two hours to finish.  Two hours!  When your characters actually go up nine levels in one mission, you know you have a design problem.  By the time I got to the end, the fun was gone.  The maps should have been half the size.- With such long missions, you better give us the healing icons we need.  Well, in this game, healing icons are mostly hidden in environments and objects you have to destroy, and you get maybe one healing icon every 20 objects you smash.  So when your health is low, you end up running around smashing objects desperately hoping the game would actually give you a healing item.  Absolutely dreary.- The save-game system is one of the worst I've ever encountered.  What could the logic be of not having an auto-save feature at the end of missions?  If you finish a mission, you end up at the Xavier Mansion -- where it's supposed to be safe haven, right?  Unfortunately, this game has a habit of launching super-hard missions at you when you're not intending to move on in the game.  I was just about to catch my breath after the two-hour first mission when the game sprang a \"flashback\" on me.  Turns out this was a mission like any other where you have to battle eight sentinels at a time, whose attacks take half your health -- no exaggeration.  Maybe the game programmers had a ball designing this mission; playing it was like water torture.- The loading times are excruciating.  Even when you press start to pause the game, there is a substantial lag, and loading times between parts of a level are inexcusable.  This game really doesn't seem that much more complex than others of its type -- why the long loading times?I enjoyed this game at first, but after about an hour and a half of struggling with the above issues, it got to be laborious and joyless.  Too bad, because this game had born the promise of being the best X-Men game yet outside of Capcom's two-player fighting games.  It allows you to progress your characters and features a plethora of background detail.  But the problems are just too substantial for this to be even a somewhat good, let alone great, game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2004"}

The game that I waited over a year for and got a 360 just to play. So, did it live up to its long waiting and name? Everyone who has waited for this game apparently loved the first. That is the case with me. I am absolutely in love with Fable. So, when I heard that Peter was making a sequel I was in a moment of pure bliss. I counted down the days and checked on news on the game. In the first Fable, we are introduced to the 'choose your own path' scenario. Something that isn't too common with games. It's not in every game that you get to choose to be evil or good. You don't have many choices. Fable brought that to us, and we loved it. We wanted more. And Lionhead gave us more. So, did Fable 2 live up to the first one? I will list the pros, cons, and my opinion of the game below. And a warning to all: It may CONTAIN SPOILERS. Cons first, then pros.CONS:-The 'feel' of the game wasn't as powerful as the first Fable. I didn't get drawn in emotionally to the storyline.-The storyline is a bit confusing when you first play. At least, it was for me. I am starting it over now though and it's making more sense.-It's cool that people love you and all but when you DON'T even USE the follow expression on them and they follow you anyway, it's a bit annoying. When I got married in Bloodstone people, prostitutes even, horded into my room and they wouldn't go away. Very annoying and frustrating.-A problem that I was hoping they'd fix for the second game that happened a lot in the first game is lagging. The game will lag when you buy things and sometimes when there's too many people in one area.-It's harder to find items and get gold off of people. In the first Fable we were all used to just pressing one button on a dresser and we automatically stole something in one second. Or, when you smashed a barrel, almost every time you'd find something, from potions to food to gold. In Fable 2 there is nothing in any crates or barrels, which makes it harder to find food and potions. And, if you want to steal something, you have to hold down the A button. There are chests and places to dig all over the place but there are also plenty of crates stashed everywhere in the game. If there were food in there then it would make things easier during fights so you wouldn't have to keep buying them instead.-I've noticed with the shops that once you buy an item it automatically sells out. This is aggravating because when you want to buy food or potions then you can only buy one of what they have in stock, thus making things harder for battle.-Healing during battle. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong but most of the time when I'm battling and I'm on the verge of dying, or rather being 'knocked out' then I wait for my food or potion sign to pop up on the pad. But..most of the time it never does, when in fact I DO have potions and food. I have had to go to the start screen many times to give myself a potion before I get knocked out because the game fails to do so for me.-The ending was..a bit confusing. I get the storyline, even more so playing a second time. It's just that the ending upset me a bit. There was no actual battle with Lucien. You play the treasure chest, he falls off the pedestal thing, and dies. Then you make your wish. No boss battle. It's just over.-One thing that I liked about the first game's battle system was the option to target your enemy. In Fable 2 you can do that too but sometimes I have a hard time distinguishing who I'm targeting.-The 'controls' are hard to understand. I've come to the conclusion that it's strictly and xbox 360 thing. The words on the screen are too small to fully read sometimes and I have a hard time understanding what button they want me to press. I've noticed this in other games as well. No, it's not my TV. I can't really blame the game for this though.-I hate that it takes people so long to get to their shops. It'll be like midday in the game and the barbar still won't be in her shop. I have to wait around for her or any tailors.-I get and like that my character is a mute but my character never makes any expressions (other than the ones you make them use). For example, when you're standing there in Lucien's castle in the beginning and your sister gets shot you do..nothing? Your character just stands there like nothing has happened. No expression at all. And this is throughout the whole game too. In the first game your main character would gasp, cry, scream (silently), and even threw up because of what happened to his family and home. He had expressions. Your character in Fable 2 does not.-I didn't like the scenes when people talked very much. Whenever it would show L1 for you to zoom in on something they were talking about, whenever you did that you couldn't hear the conversation anymore. So if you wanted to hear say, your character and Theresa talk at the beginning then you shouldn't zoom in to where it tells you to because you will miss the conversation.-Hammer was quite annoying. No questions asked.-I would have loved to hear more about Theresa's story. How, if she is indeed the same Theresa from the last game, she is still living after 500 years.PROS:-Being able to choose to be a female or male.-The game has elements from the first Fable aka Theresa and the Guild, along with the Legends of Heroes and Albion 500 years ago.-The visuals were beautiful and life like (you could see the leaves from trees blowing in the wind and the sun and moon with the day and night radiated beautifully).-The citizens of each town are unique. There is rarely any that look alike (except for maybe Bowerstone. Many of the women tend to look alike there).-Being able to have kids.-Being able to have sex with whoever you want, not just a spouse.-The dog tended to get on my nerves sometimes but I actually started warming to him as I went along in the game.-The expanded range of area. There are so many places to explor OFF of your path that it would take a while to explore every beautiful corner of Albion.-The areas are much bigger, which I think is impressive. In the first Fable, there were so many arches that you had to pass under into the next region so to say, for loading purposes. My guess is that the game developers at the time couldn't make an area too big or expanded because it would lag. Well, in Fable 2 that is pretty much eliminated. It's like taking 3 loading screens from the first game and putting them all into one free-roaming area in the second game. It saves time, annoying loads, and it's immense. Great treat there.-All the details in the game are wonderful. The houses are so much cooler than the ones in the first game.-I love that you are able to use a gun, as well a bow and arrows too. And of course, a sword.-You get to buy a variety of clothes and still get hairstyles. You even have the option to dye your clothes or hair.-The ending gives you three options for your wish and the result of your life after the game. Of course, waiting after the credits are finished to continue.-When you had to pass through the marshes that was pretty awesome. It creeped me out but it was amazing. As you continue on through the marshes you will soon come upon what used to be Oakvale, where our hero in the last game lived. Of course, Oakvale is now a watery grave full of ghoulish fiends. Still, it was awesome that it was in the game and I was glad to see the bridge, hill, and scarcrow still there, after 500 years.-From the very beginning you see just how much the game is similar to the first. Good/evil choices and having to earn gold to buy something.Overall, Fable 2 was a very interesting game. I am not disappointed and I will definetely be playing it a lot more to explore Albion more. I really honestly think that people who didn't like it that much playing it through, then they should certainly try a second time. I played as a girl the first time. Well, I've come to find out that I don't like playing as a girl. The girl's expressions are annoying and she gets pretty ugly when you give her too much physique. She's like a he-woman next to her husband. I am playing as a guy this time around and I will say that I'm liking it more the second time around. Things aren't as confusing now and I'm flowing along with the storyline quite well. The first game is still my favorite. It beats this game by a long shot. But, if you have played the first game and you have a 360, then Fable 2 is worth getting. I totally recommend it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2008"}

I will rate them from my favorite to the least favorite.my favorite is Killzone. even tho it has old PS2 graphics. in my opinion it is the best in this collection. it has a longer campaign that the other two. you will unlock more playable characters as you go along. there is 4 of them. they're basically 1 team. so its basically CO-OP with the CPU. if you choose a different character. you will have some different objectives. pretty cool game. the graphics were terrible at the beginning. but halfway through the game the graphics were kinda good.Killzone 3 and Killzone 2 are very close to eachother. but i liked killzone 2 more . but i will rate Killzone 2 nowgame is great. I liked the graphics (probably the best graphics on this console overall. lighting is awesome). it carried over few things from killzone. but mostly it changed. a lot. more technology and more weapons. what i hated so much about this one is that enemies are so hard to kill. i have to empty half a mag in a regular enemy in order to kill it. i didn't like that at all. and sometimes you'd be in an area with some 250 enemies that you have to kill. takes me an hour to go pass through an objective in a mission. so you might get frustrated a bit.and now for killzone 3. the game is great as well and worth the play. its very very similar to killzone 2. few more weapons and some changes on already killzone 2 weapons. graphics were just about the same. but not as good as killzone 2. though still one of the top ps3 games when it comes to graphics as well. the gameplay and mechanics are similar to killzone 2. there were a lot of additions. and some stuff were removed from killzone 2. enemies were easier to kill. but generally .hard to kill compared to other games. but there was this weirdest thing ever. halfway through the game. i easily noticed that the game was harder. i was dying about 3 times faster. 1-5 shots were killing me depending on the weapon. you cant change difficulty so it was weird to see. i was playing on normal mode. and halfway through it it felt like i was playing on the hardest difficulty. it wasn't very hard but as a shooter. it was. enemies were hard to kill too. and i disliked that nonsense.overall games are great. and worthwhile. this is a good collection to catch up in the series. get it now if you have a PS3. this gen won't last forever obviously.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2014"}
{"product_name":"B008PQU3E4","description":"","reviewerName":"Nikodem Leszek Blach \"Nik\"","summary":"Worth every penny","reviewText":"I played Killzone 3 briefly when I bought my current PS3 model, and I only played it online (I found it only \"OK\" online personally).  I recieved this gift for Christmas along with the Sharp-Shooter accessory to utilize for Killzone 3.  As a collection, this is a bargain and a great complete experience.Killzone 1 is dated, obviously, but it allows you to play through the same story as 4 different characters with notable differences between all the experiences.  I got a platinum in that game and loved every minute of it - even though I played through it 4 times. It feels solid and though the control scheme is a little dated, it works just fine.Killzone 2 is hard as nails.  It's a pretty game with good voice acting and an interesting series of events that drives the story.  You have 2 characters from Killzone 1 show up and create a generally great experience.. though again, hard.  Don't expect to get a platinum in this one.Killzone 3 is visually great, I felt the quality of the voice acting was worse than Killzone 2 (but that wasn't significant), and it supports the Sharp-Shooter accessory (along with 3d).  I'm a huge PC gamer and usually reserve that platform for my shooters - I usually don't Love console shooters.  Killzone 3 with the sharpshooter and 3d turned on provided some of my favorite moments in a console shooter, ever.The sharpshooter isn't perfect but when it works as intended it feels awesome.The game itself is very interesting and the plot drives the story.  The online is pretty solid though if you're big into Call of Duty or Halo you probalby won't care for it too much (It's very different - in a good way generally).  I haven't tried the sharp-shooter online but I imagine it would either be a major advantage or a major burden, all dependent on how good you are at moving and shooting at the same time with it.The online has very cool classes with the great idea that no class should just be a 'soldier'.  There is a Tactician, Infiltrator, Medic, Engineer and Sniper. The Tactician and Infiltrator are the closest you'll get to your traditional soldier but they definitely aren't. You'll encounter a great variety of classes when you play online because they all genuinely have advantages and disadvantages.  Even the sniper, who can literally turn invisible, does not feel the least bit overpowered compared to the other classes abilities.3 great games, a little more than 10 bucks each... If you've ever been curious about Killzone you should definitely pick this up and give it a shot.  It's a great series and this is a great collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2013"}

Now I've got a job that has something resembling a salary.  Having gotten so many years of fun and excitement out of my first-gen Wii, I decided to roll the dice on the Wii U by pre-ordering.  So far, I'm glad that I did.  This is a review of the Basic set with some comparison with the Deluxe set.What is (and isn't) included:The black deluxe set comes with (almost) everything that you need to get started.  It comes with the black console, power brick, sensor bar, HDMI cable (if you need component you'll have to pick it up separately), tablet, tablet charger.  What you do not get in the basic set are: a vertical stand for the Wii U (amounts to two small plastic brackets), plastic stand for the tablet controller, and the charge cradle for the tablet (which is pretty nice to have).  It is likely that you will be able to pick up non-oem versions of all of the above soon after release.  Only time will tell how nice those pieces will be.  The basic set does not come with the pack-in NintendoLand title.  It is currently release day and I've been playing it all day with my wife (who is a non-gamer) and we absolutely love it.  The extra plastic pieces may not be worth the upgrade, but in my opinion the game is (see my review of theDeluxe Setor theNintendo Landgame for more information).Neither version appears to come with one or more wii remotes.  If you already have a Wii, you'll be able to use your current remotes.  If you don't have wii motion plus enabled remotes, you will need to pick up a set of wii motion plus dongles in order to use them (at least for the game I've tried, which I will get into later).Setup:Set up is pretty easy, although you may have to wait a bit (at least close to release day).  Setting up the tablet controller, wires, internet, etc. was a breeze.  Internet setup was standard.  The system recognized the HDMI connection and selected the correct resolution and aspect ratio immediately.  Yes, you now have the ability to play the new Wii games in HD like the rest of the world ; )  I understand the cost reasons related to the SD choice on the Wii, but for most Nintendo fans these days I suspect that the upgrade is going to be a nice change of pace.Before playing any games I can tell that I'm going to like the tablet a bit.  Even during set-up you can tell that the tablet is well integrated with the overall use of the system.  At times the tablet display mirrors the TV content, and at others you see something different on the tablet screen while you are working.  The resolution, colors, and refresh rate of the tablet are all rather pleasing on the eyes.  The screen is touch sensitive, allowing you to interact with the tablet and games with both a press of the screen and the press of a button.  Hidden away in the back is a stylus, which is a nice touch.  I like being able to keep the screen clean while I'm playing with it.One word of warning: You may want to bring a book along (at least at first)--the initial setup required two downloads to be made over the internet.  The first was for the system itself, and the second was after I inserted the first game.  The tablet showed the progress bar while the initial update was downloading, and it took at least 15 minutes for me to see any real progress.  I switched to another activity for a while and eventually came back when the tablet alerted me that the download was finished.  This is most likely going to be an early adopter problem--I suspect since today is the release date that Nintendo's servers are getting slammed.Once setup is complete you're greeted by the Wii U main screen.  While the 3D organization is different from the Wii, you should figure out navigation fairly quickly.  One of the options is a standard Wii view, which appears to give you access to the original Wii OS for navigation and applications (very cool, I look forward to figuring out how to port over my apps and data from my old Wii).Just like the original Wii, you create Mii avatars.  This time you can use the tablet controller's built-in camera to create them for you.  After selecting hair and eye color, you can snap a shot of yourself.  The system configures several miis for you to choose from.  It automatically recognized my glasses, and gave me an option to add my full beard to my mii (making avatar selection much quicker than before).If you choose, you can also set up the tablet as a RF remote that controls all of the other devices in your media center.  This is a nice feature, and is quick to configure.  I selected my TV brand (Vizio), and the first remote configuration that I tried worked right out of the box.In order to use many of the Wii U's features you'll need to create an ID for the new Nintendo Network.  This in turn requires you to configure (among other things) a unique ID (that it says you cannot change), regional info, birthdate, etc.  If you are uncomfortable providing this information you may have to limit the features that you're able to use.  Personally, I don't care so it isn't a problem (they don't need phone, SSN, or anything that I felt was terribly invasive).First impressions of gaming experience:The interaction with the wii plus remote and nun chuck are (not surprisingly) very similar to the predecessor system, so I'm not going to go to deep into those features here.The tablet provides a real gem here.  Various games have different requirements--at least one tablet, at least one remote, just remotes, remotes and tablet, etc.  Multiplayer games that include both remote and tablet (for at least two users, of course) are a lot of fun.  No longer are you restricted to just one view on the TV or a split-screened view used in previous systems.  Now one user can use the TV as a primary display while the other user can use the mobile screen of the tablet as well as the larger display of their TV.  Simply put, the table offers exactly what you would expect--a combination of the benefits of a handheld with the benefits of a full console experience.  It is simultaneously interesting and difficult to describe without trying it.All I can say is this: hopefully game makers use their imagination and provide a new and unique gaming experience the same way that the Wii remotes changed the way that we view console I/O in the previous generation.  I think that this system could offer more than most of us would expect.As a media center:One of the things that Nintendo seems to be trying to do with the new system is tie together the media center the same way that the Wii did seemingly by accident.  The tablet serves as a remote for your devices, the system gives you the ability to play games, and the system also comes preloaded with the biggest streaming players: Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu.  I have currently tested the Netflix application and it seems to work quite well.  Otherwise, they do exactly what you would expect.  As a streaming player, the Wii U works just fine and the tablet controller (again) makes for a great remote.Overall:I'm rating this version 4 stars not because the product isn't stellar, but because I believe the upgrade is worth it for the NintendoLand game alone, not to mention the extra brackets, stand, and charger that come with the stand.  Besides the physical components, the deluxe version comes with 4x the memory (32 GB vs 8GB).  As most gamers know, this will probably make some difference in the long run.  If you feel like you can live without the extra memory, game, and accessories, you may prefer the white basic unit.  If you are thinking of getting the extras later, at the moment buying all of them (ignoring memory) will set you back about $80.I am definitely excited by the prospects of this new system.  As far as I can tell with my initial interactions, Nintendo may have hit another home run.  This last statement is worth qualifying, because as far as I can see all of the potential of the predecessor is here--it will just be a matter of Nintendo and other game makers living up to that promise.  I can't wait to see what else the WIi U has in store for the future.  (Especially the not-yet-deployed TVii feature that claims a release date in December.)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2012"}

And relished.  The game takes everything that was good about Diablo and Diablo 2 (random dungeons, killing monsters, loads of loot) and updates it into a visually stylish game that will keep you coming back to play for hours.The town of Torchlight sits atop deep catacomb of mines and ruined civilizations, but evil has spawned in the deeps below, and unless you venture down there to find it, the town will into collapse into the mine shaft and be lost forever more.  Such is the plot of the game.  There are three playable characters in the game: the Berserker (warrior), The Vanquisher (rogue/ranged), and the Alchemist (mage/magic).  Each class has its own detailed talent tree of three specializations, so you can, for example, play your Vanquisher as pure Marksman (ranged) or go Rogue, or a bit of both - whatever you like.The addition of a companion pet (a dog, a cat, or a ferret) is something I really like.  Not only does your pet wear saddle bags for extra loot storage, but with the click of a button, you can send your pet back to town to sell off excess loot for gold.  This is a real time event, so be careful of mobs and bosses when you are left in the dungeon alone!  In addition, your pet can wear with rings and neck items to boost their stats and skills (which are based off your character's), and be equipped with two magic spells.  I currently have my Vanquisher and my pet both equipped with \"Summon Zombies\" spell, so when we both cast it, we have six little zombie helpers at a time.  (Pets randomly cast their spells on their own.)The mod community is very active for this game, and the TorchED program is included on the game disc, if you feel like having a go at making your own dungeon and/or items.The game runs smooth as silk on my Windows 7 Pro (64-bit), although I did have a little trouble when not logged in as Administrator.  There is also a netbook mode, which does make it playable on a netbook at the cost of graphical details. As of the time of this review, this boxed version is v1.3, but there is a patch to v1.5 available online for download.  Also, unlike the downloaded version which requires a key, the boxed version has no DRM, and does not require (or even come with) a key, or require the DVD in your drive to play (a welcomed change! Thank you Runic Games for trusting your customers).Overall, while we're all waiting for Diablo 3 to arrive,  if you're a fan of good dungeon crawlers, then Torchlight definitely fills a niche.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2010"}

Blast zombies, plants and new characters across a mine-blowing world that delivers the depth of a traditional online shooter blended on high with the refreshing humor ofPlant vs. Zombies. Take on Co-op and Multiplayer action with your friends and sow the seeds of victory!","reviewerName":"Sreenadh","summary":"In Depth Review","reviewText":"hese days, big-budget shooting games like Call of Duty and Battlefield are designed to be objects of obsession. They feature incredibly tight feedback loops: nearly every time you kill a enemy or achieve an objective, you get points towards new weapons that kill more efficiently and spectacularly the next time around. In 2009, Plants vs. Zombies hit upon a similarly addictive formula for 2D puzzle games: each time you successfully fend off the waves of zombies trying to reach your house &#8212; by placing, say, piranha plants and exploding chili peppers in their path &#8212; you unlock new plants and face new zombies which invite you to change up your defenses. It&#8217;s arguably that stickiness, playing &#8220;just one more round&#8221; than you intended to play, that made these games so popular.Unfortunately, that stickiness isn&#8217;t fully present in EA&#8217;s attempt to bridge the two genres: Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare. Though EA has successfully managed to turn PVZ into a bonafide online shooter while retaining much of the series&#8217; charm, it&#8217;s not an obsession so much as a casual diversion. But if you can keep your expectations in check, Garden Warfare is still loads of fun.There are three distinct game modes in Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare, and I actually found the first rather boring. &#34;Garden Ops&#34; pits you and up to three other players against wave after wave of zombies attacking your garden &#8212; a clear attempt to mimic the original two-dimensional PVZ games. It falls almost completely flat, because the 3D version doesn&#8217;t let you carefully cultivate a strategic blend of plants to deal with the oncoming horde: you are the plants, and you&#8217;ll be mindlessly gunning down zombies with little strategy to speak of. You can drop little minion plants into prearranged planters, but they&#8217;re quickly overwhelmed. Garden Ops is also surprisingly long and rather hard, particularly for new players, so it&#8217;s odd that Electronic Arts lists it as the first game mode.But I soon forgot all about &#34;Garden Ops&#34; when I dove into the real meat of the game: 24-player online skirmishes and capture-the-base turf wars where actual players also control the zombies. The 12-on-12 matches are wonderfully hectic and delightfully diverse, partially because the huge environments (including cartoony towns, suburban neighborhoods, and a castle) are well laid out, and partly because each of the four different plant and zombie heroes have distinct, satisfying playstyles. How far do you want to be from the fray? If you like getting close and personal, the Zombie Scientist&#8217;s goo shotgun will do the trick. Meanwhile, the plant team&#8217;s Cactus can snipe from a distance. There&#8217;s also the Sunflower, a support class that heals with focused beams of light, and the Foot Zoldier Zombie, which can rocket jump up to the tops of buildings and deal death from above.If it sounds like I&#8217;m describing Valve's famous cartoony action shooter Team Fortress 2, that&#8217;s no accident: Garden Warfare producer Brian Lindley readily admits that a mix of PVZ and TF2 was one of the game&#8217;s original goals. Where TF2 is a mirror match of identical character classes, though, the plants and zombie teams each feel unique. As you might expect, the plants are at their most powerful dug into the ground, and not just figuratively. The zombies don&#8217;t have a sniper like the Cactus, and the other three plants can burrow into the earth to turn into powerful stationary turrets &#8212; or in the case of the Chomper, a giant purple piranha plant that swallows enemies whole, to avoid detection by tunneling through the ground. The zombies, meanwhile, have abilities that give them enhanced mobility and devasting single use attacks, like a jackhammer that the Engineer can ride into battle like a motorized pogo stick, or the All-Star Zombie&#8217;s dash tackle which sends enemies flying through the air. The plants and zombies make excellent foils for one another, both individually and as a team.If you ask the development team, the zombies were the biggest hurdle to turning PVZ into a online shooter. From the beginning, it was clear that PVZ&#8217;s plants made sense. &#34;People were very shocked that we went from a tower defense game to a 3D shooter&#8230; but the plants were always shooting,&#34; remarks franchise manager Gary Clay. But to make the formerly one-dimensional zombies suitable for a player to control, Lindley says the team spent months designing and redesigning characters to be the right blend of comical and useful. It shows: not only do the undead feel distinct from their leafy counterparts, they&#8217;re just as likable, from the pitiful way they rapidly shamble about the stages to the inventive weaponry they wield. The Engineer&#8217;s concrete gun, complete with a miniature concrete mixer slowly spinning on the character's back, is one of my personal favorites.The best part is that the abilities really complement each character&#8217;s playstyle. While the Cactus is sniping, it can protect its flanks by dropping exploding Potato Mines and Wall-nut barricades, or even pilot a flying hunk of garlic that can drop exploding ears of corn on enemy positions. (Don't ask how.) The Scientist can close the distance to enemies with a short-range teleporter, drop a sticky grenade, then warp out once again. Some of the abilities can also be devastating when used cooperatively, such as a pair of Sunflowers healing one another while laying down cover fire, or an Engineer dropping an airstrike into the midst of a Zoldier&#8217;s smoke grenade, where foes are unlikely to notice the marker beacons soon enough to react. Particularly in the Gardens and Graveyards mode, where the zombies have to capture a series of plant gardens and can summon additional computer-controlled zombies to their aid, there&#8217;s plenty of room for clever co-op tactics.As I alluded to earlier, though, Garden Warfare isn't quite as sticky a game as its peers. There isn't a ton of content, and the progression system that works so well in Call of Duty and the original Plants vs. Zombies isn&#8217;t in full force here.While the abilities are fun and work quite well, each of the game&#8217;s eight characters only has three to work with, and you can unlock them all within a few hours of play. Afterwards, there isn&#8217;t much else to obtain that isn&#8217;t cosmetic. You can save up coins to buy packs of stickers which unlock a few permanent weapon upgrades (three per character), and some character variants with different weapons (like the Fire Flower which shoots flames instead of sunbeams), but it&#8217;s slow going even if you play fairly well. A ten-minute match might net you 2,000-3,000 coins, but buying a new character costs 40,000 coins, so that&#8217;s easily a few solid hours of your time for a single character even if you&#8217;re laser-focused on that goal. On the flip side, though, you&#8217;re also guaranteed at least 750 coins per match whether you win or lose, so you&#8217;re making at least a little progress every time you play a round.With my goal of unlocking more content in Garden Warfare a distant inevitability, I didn&#8217;t really feel the urge to stay up late playing. I&#8217;m sure that often, over the days and weeks to come, I&#8217;ll get the itch to swallow zombies with a giant piranha plant, and return for a few more rounds. But I look forward to a sequel &#8212; or maybe some DLC &#8212; that makes the game a little less limited in scope. Team Fortress 2 built an entire business out of selling items for a game like this one, and there&#8217;s no way that microtransaction-happy EA isn&#8217;t thinking about that pot of gold.In the meanwhile, Garden Warfare gets my vote for the best kid-friendly shooter on consoles.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2014"}

The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"A necessary accessory","reviewText":"Some Wii games just use the Remote but others (primarily fighting games and FPS) need you to connect the Nunchuk to the Remote.

The last two were just downright terrible, and thankfully the folks at EA seem to have heard the criticism.  Either that or the return of 2K football (in the guise of the new All Pro football) had them worried.This game is good, though it is still not as good, deep or smooth as Madden games from the previous era (see 2004, 2005).  The good news is that developers focused on playability instead of idiotic and useless gimmicks (passing cone anyone?).The GOOD: The graphics are quite good, and the animations are the best they've ever been- the players have weight to them, and move very realistically.  The sound on the field is well done also.  The franchise mode is deep (though has its flaws, see below) and the superstar mode is more playable than before.  There are some cool features, such as a cleaner stats menu, and hall of fame content. That said, the biggest improvement is the game-play itself.  For the first time in ages, I have been challenged by a  Madden game.  The running game feels right, and some of the superpowers have been turned down (looking at you, Mr. Vick).  Overall, it's a very satisfying football simulation.The BAD: The presentation is awful.  The announcer is terrible; it's not Madden, which could be both good or bad, but instead we get some high school announcer reject.  The menus and the interface are not well designed, and are buggy and laggy.  The game also lacks customizability when it comes to formations and playbooks.  There is no designing your own play (a feature that was in Maddens past), and it isn't as deep with respect to substitutions.  The AI, though much better, still comes from the era of old-school Nintendo games: it will cheat shamelessly to get back into the game, turning Rex Grossman into Peyton Manning's long-lost brother if it has to.  The linebacker and their amazing jetpacks are still around to pick your passes off 25 feet in the air, though they are not as bad on lower difficulty levels.The UGLY: Special teams play.  This is just deplorable.  Any kicker can get a touch-back every single time, and the lack of depth or realism on special teams is shocking for such a high-profile game.  Punt-returns are a bit more realistic (ie: feasible) than last year, but that's about it.Bottom Line: A fun game that should bode well for future Maddens.  Let's just hope that EA doesn't rest on its laurels and give us their patented \"roster-update-with-a-crappy-new-feature\" and call it Madden 09.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2007"}

I fell in love with the characters, the story, and the magic behind one of the most beautiful in-game worlds I had ever seen. Basically, the sequel had A LOT to live up to, in my mind. I've been waiting over a year for FABLE III and now I've finished it. How does it stack up? Eh, not as well.THE GOOD:-THE STORY: It's been simplified, yes, but it's by no means simple, if that makes any sense. Take on the role as the man or woman who will eventually take back the throne of Albion by force. Along the way, you'll make promises to many characters, some of which will not be easy to keep. There aren't as many twists and turns as before, but it's much more involving, I think.-THE GAMEPLAY: Combat been improved and tweaked here and there, but if you didn't care for the hack and slash style of the last game, chances are that Lionhead has not solved that problem for you. You can combine spells and upgrade weapons by using them in certain ways, making every gun and sword you use evolve into (somewhat) unique items based on how you fight.-THE SANCTUARY: Like everyone else, I wasn't sure how this would work out, but it's oh so amazing. Press \"start\" and you'll instantly be transported to The Sanctuary, where you can look at and customize your outfits, change your weapons, look at your achievements, see how much money you've earned over the course of the game. And it really is an instant transition, which is just mind-boggling. It's pretty much instant access to John Cleese!-THE MAP: The interactive map made things a lot easier this time. You can manage your properties, see where quest givers are, and get a better grasp of Albion in general. Another flawless and welcomed addition to the series.-THE WORLD: Once again, I am blown away by Lionhead's ability to make such a beautiful and detailed world. The cities are all amazing in their own way, and sometimes just made me want to stare at them for a little while to take in the beauty. The characters that populate it are very funny, thanks to some amazing writers, and are all voiced expertly by some talented actors. It was a joy just to walk through the game.THE SIDEQUESTS: They are some of the best I've ever played. They're well-written and very rewarding nearly every single time. One that involves a D&D; parody had me laughing all the way through.THE BAD:-THE BUGS: I just boughtFallout: New Vegaslast week, and I didn't think I would every say this: but FABLE III is the more unstable of the two. There were simply too many instances of lag, framerate drops, and times when certain aspects of the game just stopped working. The breadcrumb trail Lionhead introduced in FABLE II, for instance, simply NEVER works. Never ever. And good luck trying to earn good money on the jobs, because the game will stutter just enough to make it impossible.-THE JOBS: I absolutely loved the jobs in FABLE II (bartending, wood cutting, blacksmithing, etc.); they were everywhere, I could play them when I got bored, and really made me feel like a part of the world, when I could stumble into a pub and know I could find a job there. In FABLE III, there are a grand total of three jobs, and all of them are glitchy to the point where you just can't play them for very long. That, and they're all played the same way, which was another disappointment. AND you don't get promotions by actually doing the jobs, you do so by way of unlocking the next levels with guild seals you earn by fighting. Very unfortunate.-BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL: Aside from the first real choice of the game, I never really felt the pressure to pick anything but the \"GOOD\" option every time. Lionhead still maintains this presumption that everything can be measured in purely good and purely evil acts, which leaves no room for those really gray decisions that make games like MASS EFFECT and DRAGON AGE so popular. Most of the decisions boil down to whether or not you want to be a benevolent ruler or a complete bully. There's no in between.-THE EXPRESSIONS: This was quite possibly the biggest disappointment in the game for me. In FABLE II, you had a menu where you could decide what expressions you wanted to use (point and laugh, pose, fart, etc.) and where. This time, you can't bust out your lute and start playing until a crowd gathers around you. You have to perform each expression to each individual person in the world. On top of that, you can't even select which expression you want to use! The game chooses for you. Even though I had unlocked pretty much every one in the game, I could still only just dance with everyone, since the game wouldn't let me do anything else. I would've cried, but Lionhead decided I could only play pat-a-cake.And while I was just as excited as everyone else about these \"touch expressions,\" they ultimately fall flat. Holding hands is buggy, since the hands never stay connected, and, for some reason, escort missions require you to hold hands with the person and lead them to safety. For all the purposeful silliness in the game, there is nothing sillier than leading a grown man by the hand across a forest, or haggling for lower prices with a dance.-THE DOG: It played a useful role in both the story and game of FABLE II, but it's pretty much useless in this game. Since the expressions are gone, you can't really connect to it as a character. Add to that the fact that it really won't help you in combat, and will often glitch out and lose the scent of the treasure and dig spot it had found. I loved the dog in the last game, but there was no need for it here.-THE ENDING: Now, I royally messed up with the ending. POSSIBLE SPOILER: You're supposed to gather a certain amount of money before a deadline as king, or else Albion will fall into darkness. You have a year, but the game skips ahead every time you complete a group of kingly quests. I had 120 days left, and I made the mistake in thinking I still had time to raise the money. After completing a quest, the game skipped a head, you guessed it, 120 days. Since I did not have the money, and had no warning, and something very, very bad happened to Albion which nearly killed the game for me.END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS: I very much dislike playing a game for twenty hours, only to get everything I had worked for destroyed. It's still making me question whether or not I even want to start a new game, or continue the one I have. I really didn't care for that.TO SUM UP:FABLE III was a lot of fun, and a true technical improvement over its predecessor, which I still find myself revisiting occasionally. But for every improvement FABLE III made, it made just as many mistakes. There are bugs and glitches aplenty (Lionhead's quality control should be fired); the expression system and jobs element were promptly destroyed, even though neither should have been touched, and the decisions you make just won't keep you up at night (thought the results might).But, I still have to say that Lionhead made a fun game here. Expressions and jobs aside, there is still an entire world to explore. The sidequests are some of the best that I've seen in any game, the world is beautiful, and the game will reward you handsomely for leaving the beaten path. It echoed some of what I felt to be the best parts of FABLE II.I really hope that Lionhead Studios step up and support this game with the patches it needs, and I must also hope that FABLE IV will mark the moment when the series finally got it right - and not just mostly right.(3 and 1/2 Stars)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2010"}

Let's break it down:THE GOOD:-The time system: As many have said, the game consists of alternating between story progression and free time where you can run around doing sidequests and recruiting new members to your team. What many haven't given Radiata Stories credit for, though, is the time system reminiscent of the N64 Zelda game Majora's Mask. Each person in the game runs on a schedule based on the time of day; sometimes the schedule can change depending on the point you're at in the story. The entire world here feels more alive than 99% of RPGs on the market even to this day (2011) because you literally have something like 150 NPCs going about their daily life. Basically no two runs through town are the same!-The combat: The combat is a lot like Star Ocean. You are free to roam around the battlefield and position your party tactically. There are a lot of options in combat, too. You set up which moves you will perform on a regular swing of your weapon, choosing between about 5 different weapon types with all-different nuances to them. As you swing, you build up points you can use towards special moves or special commands to buff or heal your party. You can also link your members up tactically to give you a lot of control over your 3 NPC helpers in battle. As you play, you really open up a lot of options on how you proceed with a battle. In my end party I actually didn't even bring a healer because all of my healing was done through special moves or items.-Character Variation: As much as collecting characters can be a flaw of the game, who you bring into battle makes a big difference, and it's not all about raw stats. Different characters bring so many possible variations to the table through different AI thought patterns (you'll have to observe your party and what they're doing to figure this out) skills, weapon types, status ailments, etc. Someone with a terrible attack may make up for it by petrifying the enemies, for example. I ended up using at least 20 different characters in my first playthrough, and I wasn't even collecting them on purpose.-Non-random Encounters: Not only are the encounters non-random - you see the enemies before you fight - but they don't respawn AT ALL until it's a new day. That means you won't be bogged down fighting excessively if you go the wrong way and have to backtrack.-Story Splits: At some point the storyline branches off, and the choice you make drastically affects the outcome of the rest of the game. You will want to play it twice to see the whole game. There is a \"new game+\" option for this, although you don't get to keep your levels. The only downside to this is that you don't necessarily get a good ending. I don't want to spoil anything, but it's hard to feel completely satisfied with either path you can choose. I still consider this a huge positive to the game, though.THE BAD:-Collection: If you get into a completionist mindset, you will need to rigidly follow a guide, because collecting all the characters is nearly impossible on your own. If you're looking to sit down and enjoy Radiata Stories without stress, just take it easy and forget about getting everyone to join up. There are tons of missable characters and stupid things like the inability to get someone if you sell a certain item you got 10 hours ago. You don't NEED all the characters, though, to win the game and get a good ending. You also get some people to join up just by talking to them a lot or even one time.-Travel: Although the game lets you warp around a bit, you can't always rely on that. Running back and forth through town to do sidequests and recruitment can be frustrating and boring. Some areas don't have a warp, so you will end up running for 10 minutes to get where you need to go. This especially sucks if you're running off on a recruitment task and realize you ran to the wrong spot or you didn't talk to the person enough times before trying to find the item they wanted or something lame like that. You can find an item early on (in the sewer) which boosts your run speed by 50%, though.-Save Points: There are very few save points. If you die mid-dungeon, you may be looking at redoing up to an hour of gameplay. You also need to make sure you save your game without sleeping to regain health, because resting at your bed can move the story along and in some cases delay your ability to save. I know RPGs used to have fewer save points, but this game is a bit on the extreme side. At least you can pause the game any time if you need to get up and leave for a while.NEUTRAL:-Overall Story: The story here is a mixed bag. I love the personality of some of the characters, and I love some of the jokes, but it's not a storyline you'll be telling your friends about. The main character, Jack, is a stupid kid on purpose, too, so if you can't get over that you might be disappointed. Still, the story isn't annoyingly bad or anything, and the characters have a lot of personality. Having two different paths is also something that could keep you playing, so overall I can't say this is good or bad, it just is.-Voice Acting: The voice acting was better than usual for this time period - the usual being pretty bad - so it might even be a good thing that I'm only putting this in neutral.-Production Value: The game doesn't make use of many cinematic cut scenes.-Unwinnable Storyline Battles: This game has to take the award for the most storyline battles that you can't win. This is foreshadowed by the very first fight: a fight you must lose. Sometimes you get a game over because you thought maybe it was a boss you were supposed to lose to, and you didn't bother healing. Other times you find out you had to lose after you just wasted 10 healing items. If you can't win the battle, I would prefer a cut scene. This isn't a big negative, though. It's almost funny.FINAL WORD:Radiata Stories is still worth giving 5 stars for its extremely good battle system and the awesome time system and living world. If you could combine some of these things with the story telling of a AAA RPG title, you would have the best RPG ever made. If you're a fan of Tri-Ace games like Star Ocean or Valkyrie Profile, you must give this game a try.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2011"}

The game has combos that do become somewhat necessary to an extent. There are a variety of semi-upgradable weapons. Some of the fights can get very challenging because if you fail to learn the pattern, openings, when you can attack, what attack to use, when to run away, etc you will run out of potions fast, then die.

Lethal","summary":"more of the same, with a few tedious innovations","reviewText":"I have played and enjoyed every game in the Ratchet & Clank series, though Quest for Booty wasn't a favorite.  This game has graphics as great as Tools of Destruction.  It also features the same funny dialogue and top notch voice acting we've come to expect.  Captain Qwark is among my all-time favorite game characters and is hilarious as always here.  Unfortunately, the tools in this game are largely repeats of what we've seen since the first installment.  A pistol and grenades are offered early, but most good weapons are withheld until fairly late in the game.  One powerful weapon, gun turrets, is gone completely, which substantially increases the difficulty.  The best weapon/gadget in video game history, the Groovitron, thankfully came back and never gets tired.  My favorite new weapon is the Rift Inducer 5000, which opens a portal to another dimension, allowing a monster to reach out its tentacles and gobble up any enemy in its vicinity.  I also like the MagNet, an electrified net that automatically locks on its target.  The rest of the weapons are basically rehashes with slight tweaks, and the need to level them all up is a real chore.  Mr. Zurkon is your synthenoid bodyguard, but his one liner taunts get old after a while.  When it came to throwing grenade type weapons, I had lots of trouble aiming; in some cases they went sailing off to the side for no reason at all instead of simply going where I was facing (and where my intended target stood).  Ratchet and Clank are separated for the bulk of the game and alternate missions.  The Clank missions feature awkward fighting and repetitive, unimaginative puzzles.  I couldn't end them fast enough.  Qwark accompanies Ratchet early, but unfortunately it doesn't last long.  The comic relief he provided would have greatly aided in spicing up the repetitive, mindless shooting and shaky platforming.  Far too many times I fell to my death because the game threw me off trajectory during a jump and made me land short of a platform through no fault of my own.  The swingshot likewise failed to deploy at completely random times and led to bug based deaths, including multiple times during one boss fight.  It was terribly frustrating and really took away from the fun factor, especially since I never had these problems in previous titles.  While the characters and story development are as brilliant as ever, this series needs to really look to the future and stop being so redundant.  A game where you primarily play as Captain Qwark would be a comedic gold mine and could offer a chance to fundamentally change the gameplay and breathe fresh air into the series.  This game stands fairly well on its own, but R&C veterans have been here a half dozen times now, and the formula is tired.  Add in the first case of shoddy platforming in the entire series, and I was very disappointed.  Wait for this to hit the bargain bins; there are much better games out there (like Uncharted 2 and Batman: Arkham Asylum).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2009"}

Then you're put on an island with a random selection of Final Fantasy characters, two completely dull friends and several boring fetch quests. After disaster strikes your island you awake in another world just to discover that you are the Keyblade Master, the chosen one, who will save world. After this you are joined by Goofy and Donald Duck and you set off to save worlds from Disney stories. In order to get to those worlds you get to fly a space ship made of Legos, I mean Gummies, and every time you use it you need to pass a little mini game involving some shooting and steering.So far, after playing the game for 36 hours and completing 4 worlds, I have to say that I'm really bored. I can sort of forgive the bad camera work, but the combat is dull, the movement and controls are stiff, the random encounters lack any sort of excitement and the Gummie ship sections are awful. Why is equipping potions for my team such a chore? I get that this is a remake but come on, the menu system is terrible.The main characters such as Sora and Riku have some awful dialogue and feel completely bland in comparison to the Disney characters. So I find myself not caring at all, at this point I just really want to see more Disney stuff and enjoy the aesthetics of the game.The level design isn't great, it feels small and cramped, and when you add the crappy camera and awkward spawn points of enemies to the mix you sort of feel like you're boxed in and are just hitting the attack button just to get somewhere. Sora's jumping and maneuvering skills are not the best and it certainly makes the game feel dated. The overall lack of direction leads to a lot of back and forth trial and error moments that can get really tiresome.The limited edition content is junk and it was not worth the preorder in my opinion.So while I enjoy the charm of the Disney aesthetic I am not loving the game as much as I hoped. I'm giving it a 3.5 out of 5 stars, but I'll round it up to a 4 since Amazon apparently doesn't like decimal point.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2013"}

Once again the graphics are incredible, the storyline is immersive and the stealth is great.If you haven't played the original Splinter Cell, I highly recommend you get it and play it first. The graphics were just jaw-dropping, with the way light played across active characters, and the use of night vision and thermal vision was crucial to completing missions.This &quot;Splinter Cell 2&quot; builds on that previous knowledge. While the initial message begins with some tutorial-like messages, they really expect you to have familiarity with stealth behavior and what to watch for. It's not very far into mission 1 where things get tricky and you're interrogating enemies for knowledge, while skulking in shadows to avoid being seen.The game is a wonderful change from all the shoot-em-up blasters out there. You are told to avoid confrontation, to get your mission done with a minimum of life loss. There are missions in buildings, missions by the water, mission with sunsets painting the sky. The range of worlds you work through is impressive. You truly feel like you are part of modern-day problems, finding solutions that really make a difference.The sounds add to the quality of the game, with the water dripping, the footsteps and other subtle noises that can spell the difference between survival and failure. I do have to say that the stock &quot;You stupid jerk, you've failed&quot; messages get REALLY annoying if you've gotten stuck at a certain point and have to listen to them 10 or 15 times in a row ...It can get frustrating sometimes for beginners to get the hang of stealth - but it's well worth it. You really feel a part of the game, watching for the shadows, listening intensely for the slightest sound. This isn't a game that you play with screaming kids in the other room and friends throwing popcorn across the table. It's a game that rightfully demands all of your attention, and rewards you well.There's also a multiplayer component, which is great fun. Get together with your friends, or meet new friends from across the globe, and slink through the quiet shadows together. While the game itself is fun, it's always FAR more challenging and enjoyable to face off against other human targets.

So the FPS portion of the games was done right. The RPG elements are convienent and useful, but. Not overwhelming.  You gather useful items and all the junk u pick up is bundled into one item for u to sell.. Which really saves a hassle. I have played fallout and borderlands but in my opinion rage is what I wanted out of those games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2011"}

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"M.

Maybe with so much hype for the last 2 years the game was doomed to be disappointing to some gamers, but I'm simply not that impressed at this moment with HALO-2.

{"product_name":"B00002SVWG","description":"In Final Fantasy Tactics you must guide your nation through a revolution while defending it from otherworldy forces!","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Arguably One of the Greatest Final Fantasy Games Ever Made","reviewText":"Final Fantasy Tactics, originally released in early 1998, went on to be one of Square's most critically acclaimed games of all time as well as becoming one of the mostly highly sought after Playstation titles until it was released as a greatest hits title. As the years go by, Final Fantasy Tactics is one of the few games where reception of the game has increased over the years rather than decrease.  Despite having a reissue on the PSP, the original game is still a treat.  However, both versions have their own cons.  While many have reported that the PSP version has slowdown, the original Playstation release suffers from a mediocre translation of a fantastic story.Final Fantasy Tactics concerns itself with Ramza Beoulve.  A noble who believes in justice and honor.  In the world of Ivalice, Ramza is about to be involved in the biggest power struggle in the world's history.  It concerns a conspiracy bigger than anything Ramza could imagine.  The story is full of almost everything you can imagine.  Betrayal, injustice and some of the most mature themes Final Fantasy has ever dared to go to.  Be forewarned, though.  Despite a T-Rating, the game is actually quite dark.  Despite it's cutesy graphics this game is anything but cute as it is easily the most violent and moving of all the Final Fantasy games.The gameplay that makes Final Fantasy Tactics a treat. Thanks to the job system, customization is nearly endless. Before each battle you can assign jobs to your characters. Each job has specific traits about them and can greatly affect how you perform in battle. Mages have devastating magic abilities while Knights are strong physical attackers. They also bring their own unique abilities to the table. Because there are so many job classes to choose from, there's a lot of experimentation you can do. As you master abilities you'll also be able to mix and match. You could have a Squire casting white magic, for example provided you've learned some of the white magic abilities.As battles progress you gain experience. You pretty much gain experience after each and every turn, which is nice. Not only do you gain experience but you also gain job points to help you master the abilities in your job class. It's pretty simple stuff and you'll be surprised at just how fast you can learn abilities here.However, Final Fantasy Tactics was notorious for being an incredibly challenging game.  In order to survive some of the games toughest battles you'll have to spend hours roaming around to learn abilities and raise levels.  Enemies don't let up and they actually are quite smart.  They'll take advantage of your parties disadvantages by usually attacking the weakest character or even ganging up on certain characters.  It's also no help that their attacks deal a startling large amount of damage.  If you want to survive in Final Fantasy Tactics, level grinding is a must and it's not negotiable.In terms of graphics, Final Fantasy Tactics is fairly cute looking.  But the sprites are incredibly detailed, especially for 1998.  Unlike the PSP version the game also runs smoothly and fast.  There are also a few cutscenes here and there to show you some of the story.  Tactics also sports some of the best music the series has ever known.If there was anything to criticize about the original release it would be the same thing that everyone criticizes.  The translation is absolutely horrible.  The story is incredible, but the script for the original Playstation version may be one of the worst efforts done in localization history.  It's almost worth it to pick up the PSP version of the game for this one reason alone.  Some of the translation is so bad some parts of the story are utterly confusing.  The only other problem with Final Fantasy Tactics is that if you really want to get through the game, you'll spend the least amount of time taking in the story.  As I mentioned earlier, level grinding is a must to survive throughout the adventure.  The problem is you'll have to do it too much.  To the point where it stops the advancement of the story.  Sometimes for long intervals at a time.  And the story hardly retreads or reiterates events.Final Fantasy Tactics is easily one of the best games in the series.  It is not, however, for the beginner or the inexperienced Tactical Strategy game player.  For those who don't wimp out, however, Final Fantasy Tactics is rewarding.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2008"}

As opposed to the first game, this one had a story and well defined characters and the whole thing just sucked me in.This game had one of the most interesting stories I had seen in a game up until that time.  You control Cecil, a Dark Knight serving under the King of Baron.  After taking Crystals from the magician village of Mysidia, Cecil questions why he is doing this, taking the Crystals from innocents.  He is sent to deliver a package to the Village of Mist.  Opening the package, the village is destroyed.  Cecil now works in opposition to Baron to try to save the Crystals and not allow Baron to get them all.  During this quest, the stakes get larger as Cecil learns of what is really going on.  Some of my favorite characters in the series are in this game: Golbez, Kain, Rydia, Rosa, FuSoYa, Edge, Yang, the Twins.  The cast of playable characters is large as characters come in and out of your party.

{"product_name":"B000UW21A0","description":"Sony Uncharted: Drake's Fortune 98103 PC Games","reviewerName":"Private Quentin Tarantino Fan","summary":"Forgettable and Repetitive  53%","reviewText":"Visuals-75/100(Nowhere near the second two, and the repetitive environments get boring fast)Story-66/100 (Mediocre and nowhere near the second and third)Game Play-20/100 (Extremely Repetitive, horrible controls, and more frustrating than an Objectivist)Sound-80/100 (Extremely well voice acted, as usual.  Sounds nice, I guess)Replay Value-20/100 (I have no intention of playing it ever again)As much as it pains me to write this review, I feel I have to write about this somewhat indifferent first installment of the Uncharted franchise.  As a whole, the Uncharted series is easily one of the best new franchises to debut this generation.  They have the near-perfect (with a few exceptions, which is really prevalent in this game) game mechanics, absolutely loveable characters, gorgeous graphics, amazing artistic elements, thrilling stories, and, of course, some of the most amazing set pieces to ever exist in a video game.  Besides, the Uncharted series are not games.  They are pulp and serial inspired action experiences that keep you in complete control of the whole adventure.  However, I have to admit that, for the most part, the first chapter in the series is highly overrated.  Now, it's not a horrible game, and there are some memorable moments within the game.  But overall, the interactive serial inspired experience of Uncharted is just simply not here, and as a result, the game is forgettable.I think my biggest problem with this game is the fact that this game doesn't feel like an interactive fiction both serious and fun; an excellent mix of poignant moments, exploration, great dialogue, amazing set pieces (come on, the hotel goes down with YOU inside of it!) and lot's and lot's of action scenes that let YOU control the pulp and serial inspired firefights and combat sequences.  Instead, in contrast, Drake's Fortune is just a horribly repetitive third person shooter.  Try comparing the two There is little to no exaggeration to this criticism: there is absolutely little break from the game's constant ability to throw you into room after room of enemies.  Drake's Fortune starts out well enough, but by chapter 4 the game loses all restraint and just sends wave after wave of around 50 enemies every 5 minutes.  Occasionally there's a boring climbing section, and then there's an equally boring puzzle in between.  Aside from about two very short vehicle sections (and the second vehicle section is AWFUL), the game play is nothing but shooting with the occasional.  It's boring, but that's not the whole story.  Either way...I think what absolutely KILLS this game is it's structure.  Drake's Fortune's structure is boring, and I mean REALLY boring.  I wish I wasn't exaggerating here, but Drake Fortune's formula is so dull and painful that it recalls a 20 year old game.  Basically, it boils to combat, short climbing section, combat, short climbing section, combat, and on and on.  Rinse and repeat.  Aside from the awful aforementioned vehicle sections, the game pretty much offers nothing else to break up the boring monotony.  Worse, it's mechanics are awful.While non stop action in a video game isn't always a bad idea, the action in this game is horribly repetitive and actually feels shoddy.  The levels don't offer much in the way of tactics, and as a result the game play results to a woefully simple cover mechanic.  Basically, get into cover, and occasionally pop out and try to aim with the totally wonky and imprecise aiming mechanic.  The aiming mechanic in particular is just god awful.  Aiming feels incredibly shoddy in this game.  I found it almost nigh improbable to shoot in a straight line.  Controls feel incredibly floaty, and you waste way too much ammo to the point you are almost always out and there are still a handful of enemies to take out.  It took me almost five tries to beat one section of the game because I couldn't aim worth a damn.  To add to this, it takes waaaaay too many bullets to shoot enemies.  You are constantly out of ammo, which forces you to often run out of cover straight into enemy gun fire, which often gets you killed. Then, you start the same boring section with the same broken mechanics process all over again.  No thanks to this, the game feels way too much like last gen, or sometimes even resembles what you would expect from an outdated and boring formula from the Atari 2600 days, just with the power of next gen consoles.Perhaps the last aspect is a little more subjective (Wait a sec... ha ha ha ha ha!!!!!!!!!  Lapses in logic, sorry), but Uncharted: Drake's fortune is forgettable in other aspects besides game play.  The story is generally not as good as the original.  There are little set pieces in the game,  There is no tense cat and mouse tank battle, nothing along the lines of the Airplane and desert scenes of the third game, they are all just bland and do little to break up the tedium of the constant firefights.  The jungle often gets repetitive and boring after the game continues on, and can't compare to the memorable locales of the second and third game.  On the plus side, Uncharted's acting cast is talented as usual, but since there is little to care about and little of interest on-screen, it really doesn't matter if you brought Robert De Niro in to voice one of the characters.  Good actors can't save crappy video games, and Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is no exception.On top of that, unlike the next two games in the series, there is no multi-player.  You can get bonuses through treasure, but since the game is not something you would want to play over and over again, what's the point?As somebody who loves the Uncharted franchise, I have to admit that Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is (naturally, this is a subjective review after all).  But don't be too surprised if you find this game to be lacking.  It's almost a mystery to me why this game is so repetitive and forgettable, but that's not a big deal.  You don't have to play this game to get the other two games, so I'm glad I didn't bother with this game and start with the second game in the series. To this day, nothing memorable about this game ever resonated with me, and I'm glad I skipped over it because I was almost turned off by the series because of this mediocre game. I suggest you do the same.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2012"}

Well, I just finished it and I agree with the lower end of the reviews. I feel bad for this game because it could've been so much better but it ended up being a waste of talent. The acting and motion capture works really well but the story is just all over the place and gets to the point where is cheesy and full of cliches.It was definitely an interesting experience but not worth buying or playing. The only reason I did is because I was really curious about the game and the story but I got to a point where I lost interest in the story and just played it because I had already payed for the game. I would tell you to buy it or even get it once the price goes down but the gameplay is so minimal and of no consequence that you'd be better watching in on YouTube. It's definitely fun to control Aiden but it gets old and boring after a while because your options are VERY limited. If you want to feel how it is to control Aiden just download the demo and that's all you need to know. It doesn't get any better than the demo, in fact, it gets worse.The main thing hat bothered me is how boring and limiting the gameplay is. You're literally just watching and doing pointless and dumb things like choosing which side of the bed you want to sleep in order to advance the story and feel like you're \"playing\". In the demo you'll play the most interesting and exciting parts of the game.-----SMALL SPOILERS ABOUT THE GENRE OF THE GAME-------I feel kind of cheated because the game was marketed as something else and they purposely hid what this was really about because they knew people wouldn't buy it. You go in thinking you're going to get some cool story about a girl and a ghost but in the end what you get is \"Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull\". I don't want to spoil anything but I feel an obligation to inform you about what the genre of the game is. It's not aliens but it's as silly as cheesy as aliens. Instead of aliens you have ghosts and \"infra-world\" crap. \"Beyond\" gets a little to silly for my taste. I guess if you liked \"Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull\" you'll like this game but if you didn't like that movie because it was too dumb then this is not for you.As some review I read said, \"if this was a move it would be a VERY bad one\" and I agree. I've lost all hope in David Cage and I wouldn't mind if they stopped making games exclusives for PlayStation.----SOMEWHAT BIGGER SPOILERS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE CURIOUS ABOUT HOW SILLY THE GAME GETS-----I just want to tell you a little about the story of the game so you know how silly it gets. Basically it gets to the point where the CIA wants to open portals to the infra world to control the ghosts and use them as a weapon and they ask Jodie to help them.***********************end of spoilers*********************If after reading this you still want to play the game then go for it but really, you're better off watching it on YouTube.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2013"}

Final Fantasy IX and X were both superb games that I played for months. Just what is up with this dress-up game, Final Fantasy X-2?My first impression of the game was that it was made by a bunch of male game designers who wanted to watch semi-naked teenage girls dance around to sexy music. Yuna and Rikku have both been given makeovers to wear scanty clothing. Paine was added in to give the 'goth' alternative in the trio. The three are like Charlie's Angels (a movie that I love) but less intelligent, more childish. These women are supposed to be in their 20s but act like they're 8 years old.You get to play Yuna, Rikku or Paine and you battle and puzzle your way through the game series, gathering spheres and working through missions. Somehow you have completely forgotten the Al Bhed language and have to relearn it. Somehow your cousin is in love with you. Instead of strategy battles, you are in &quot;active time battles&quot; which double penalize you for spellcasting and reward you for button mashing. The graphics were GREATLY reduced in order to bring this change, too.Gone is the brilliant sphere grid system to customize your characters. Instead you get ... paper-doll clothing changes. Yes, I'm serious. You get to try new outfits on your characters and get a few skills with each one. Of course, most of the outfits are quite revealing.The music was really annoying and I had to turn the sound off in some situations. The side quests were sometimes just tiresome and sometimes bordered on the highly questionable (giving back rubs to hit pleasure levels?) I had a lot of respect for Yuna after the end of FFX. Given what was going on two years later, it seemed like Yuna regressed rather than matured.I know a TON of women who loved FFX and gladly played it. It seems with FFX-2 they tried to make a &quot;game for women&quot; by turning it into insipid nonsense. What an insult to females everywhere, to say that the only way we'd play was to give us dress-up outfits and girly-girl giggling. And what an insult to say that girls should be sex objects that have to fall out of their outfits to get any attention.The game designers should have taken a good look at Eowyn and Arwen in the Lord of the Rings movie series to see how women can be intelligent, strong, skilled and amazingly appealing. I will finish FFX-2 to write the walkthrough, but it won't be a pleasureable experience.I'd rent this for a week and make sure you really enjoy what it offers before you buy it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2003"}

While appearing to be another platformer on the surface, its actually a game with endless potential due to the plethora of user created levels, made accessible with a stellar level design kit. Its fun, the sackboy characters are entertaining, the stock levels are amazing and some of the user created levels are incredibly unique and memorably.Story:There is none. Well ok there is a story but its not really anything that's compelling or worth mentioning. Its simple and it gets you from level to level...loosely. But this is a platformer, do you really need much motivation to move from start to finish?Visuals/Audio:I heart my PS3 and this game looks fabulous. Its cartoony so don't expect something MGS4 cut scenes but this truly is a beautiful game to behold. So colorful and vibrant as opposed to many \"bleak\" looking games. I wish the flame animations were better but oh well, can't have everything.I don't think I've ever mentioned audio in a game review before, its worth mentioning here. The sound track in this game is fantastic. I had so much fun with the music in this game. Its unique, fits the level designs perfectly, and absolutely enhanced the gameplay.Gameplay:Tons of levels to keep you busy and the difficulty does increase nicely. There are plenty of trophies to be found, minilevels to take on, as well as the user generated content. To find good user generated levels (because 95% of them are crap) search online for blog posts about the top levels, lest you waste time trying to use the user levels awful browsing.I have to say the most frustrating thing about platformers is when you can't make a jump - particularly one that looks like you should make it. LBP falls victim to this fate. It uses \"floaty\" mechanics for controlling/jumping so the controls are NOT tight like a Mario game. To make matters worse there is the dreaded 2.5D bs. It will cause you frustration. You will fail jumps and die because the game could not put you on the correct plain. You have to just trust the game to manage the plains for you, which is an adjustment.This is a game that should be played with friends on the same tv. I played online a number of times and have had mixed results. The game becomes increasingly fun when playing with fellow sackboys/sackgirls as opposed to single player. Be warned, when the levels get difficult, less experienced players will only slow you down and eat up lives. I enjoyed this difficultly but had to finish the game solo.I'd like to see more from the user community or Media Molecule in terms of more levels. The MGS DLC was fantastic and completely added something new to the game, definitely worth the $5 extra.If you like platformers, playing with friends, and want to see what others can create or try your own hand at level design then this is undoubtedly the game for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0050SX9I2","description":"","reviewerName":"BAH","summary":"A must-have remote for every PS3 owner and an improvement over past remote.","reviewText":"Nothing is worse than using a dualshock controller to navigate on the playstation 3. Whether you use it for browsing on netflix/amazon VOD or using it on playstation store, this remote is really needed. First, you are bumbling around with the dualshock because you have to use 2 hands to hold the dualshock controller. Then, you are trying to figure what button does what. This Sony PS3 media/blu-ray remote control really solves that problem.Design= It is longer and thinner than the original sony ps3 media/blu-ray remote control which I was a fan of. With it being thinner, some people may think it has a \"cheaper\" feel over the original remote. Very similar to the old remote in terms of design but the the new remote has larger number buttons but smaller scan/slip buttons, nice plastic \"glass\" PS button and has a better feel of up, down, left, right circular button. The old remote used 2 AA batteries and the new remote uses 2 AAA batteries. More energy efficient I guess.Features= It does everything that the old remote did but they improved it by adding input button, amp and tv power button, 3D button, devices button, instant scrolling button and the volume & channel button. More user friendly and less clutter is a big deal. That is a huge improvement over the old remote. It was annoying when you had to use a tv remote with the old sony blu-ray remote where you needed the correct setting. I guess that I can put away my tv remote in a draw and leave it there.Price= Very fair and reasonable price.Cons? People say backlit but I don't think that is necessary because you have such a great feeling of up, down, left, right circular button which you would be using mostly. I would say that a con would be that the stop and pause button is much smaller than the old remote. Space is limited on the remote due to the new feature buttons so they went with smaller stop and pause buttons. I prefer the bigger stop and pause button of the old remote. That pause button is used a lot for netflix and dvd/blu-ray playback.*I give this remote a 4.5 out of 5 stars and I highly recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2013"}

The AI is indeed challenging, sometimes to the point of 'cheating' as some might claim, but this game is meant to challenge your skills and ability to strategize accordingly and use the environment to your advantage to come out on top. Sure there will be frustrating moments when you lose a race by mere seconds (or even less at times), but this makes it even more satisfying when you trigger a powerplay that wrecks several opponents seconds before crossing the finish line to take first place!!This game can best be described as a simple, no-holds-barred epic racing simulator that strips away all the fluff and gets you right to the action, every single time!!! This game is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to anyone who is remotely interested in racing games!!EDIT 7-3-2010Just completed 11 out of 12 episodes. I found that you do NOT necessarily have to finish the final race for each episode ('Elite' race) in 1st place in order to be first in the season competition. This gives the player some breathing room seeing as the AI is quite unforgiving in some races, so finishing first in all would probably have been a frustrating requirement.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00DJFIMW6","summary":"Minion Madness","reviewText":"There is no question that everyone loves the goofy and silly minions from Despicable Me. They have not only delivered with humor and laughter, but they still know how to make a game shine, even if they are only in it for a brief run. The case is strongly here with Despicable Me: Minion Rush. The app is definitely one that is not only fun to play and master, but captures a young generation who has been hooked on bigger games like Temple Run. I like the game not only because it is simple to play, but very easy to control as well. What I do feel though is that if you have played one game, you've played them all, as the game plays similar to the challenge of Temple Run, but it is fun nevertheless for its value. I definitely recommend the challenge of this great game.Graphics: BSound: B+Control: B-Fun & Enjoyment: B+Overall: B","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2013"}

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both? The choice is yours ininfamous.caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Everyman turned superhero Cole.View larger.Devastating electricity-based powers.View larger.Go anywhere open-world design.View larger.An organic urban environment.View larger.StoryEmpire City was a run of the mill metropolis, until one day a massive explosion rips through six square blocks of its bustling downtown real-estate, seemingly leveling everything and everyone in its path. Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

{"product_name":"B004EW7LSY","description":"","reviewerName":"M. J. Sanford","summary":"Not a bad game for cheap.","reviewText":"Binary Domain is a sci-fi, third person shooter, set in the near future. The sets range from grimy subterranean, to sleek urban. No space ships or aliens, or laser/phaser guns. The setting design is beautiful. The upper city scenes look modern and futuristic, lots of clean lines and gleaming buildings. The under city looks gritty and industrial.The main premise, shooting up robots, is a lot of fun. Bits and pieces fly off the 'bots, and their abilities are affected by where you shoot them. There's enough variety of bad guys, and the boss battles are fantastically fun.One of the biggest dissapointments in the game is the customization. By this, I mean: There are lots of aspects to customize, but they don't seem to make much difference. You can level up your main gun, or unlock and purchase various perks. There's also a squad mechanic to the games, which means you can choose 1 or 2 other soldiers from the cast to assist you, each with their own speciality and strategy. None of these choices seem to amount to any change in game play. I played through twice, choosing different options, and it felt the same both times.Similarly, the weapons are uninspired. Assault rifle, handgun, a few different grenades. Then you can choose a LMG, SMG, sniper, or shotgun. The last two are the only ones that seem to get kills, but have limited ammo.Probably the biggest killer to this game is lack of split screen co-op. I *SO* wanted to play this game with fam/friends, and it's just not possible. So, it's yet another one player experience, with no real replay value.And, lastly, while the maps are mostly fun, they are pretty linear. In some games, \"on the rails\" can be a real bummer. Here, it's not bad. Really, you're just traveling from battle to battle, and those battles are the fun parts of the game. There's a decent, easy-to-follow, and predictable, story. A few dialogue options mostly exist to feed the \"trust\" mechanic. But there are some truly horrible travel sequences. One, for example, has your character jet skiiing through a large sewer tunnel, and mostly trying to avoid damage. It's just not fun, even though the NPC's try to whoop it up.Like my title says, it's not a bad game for cheap. Worth a play-through, but don't have your expectations high. Then, give it to a friend, since you can't experience it together.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00GANWVJE","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"It Beautifully Reinvents a Legendary Series","reviewText":"Over 20 years ago, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past came out on the Super Nintendo.  It has been hailed by several gamers as arguably the greatest Zelda title of them all (definitely the best of the 2D Zelda games, at least).  Most everything about the core series formula was pretty much established in A Link to the Past.  As such it's often seen as the most influential of the Zelda titles.  For over two decades A Link to the Past has retained a cult following.  For me personally, A Link to the Past was my personal favorite.  So when I heard about A Link Between Worlds I was filled with joy and worry.  It's the sequel to my favorite Zelda... and the potential for it not to live up to its predecessor was there.  Luckily this isn't the case.  Instead A Link Between Worlds is the best Zelda to be released in a long time.Set years after A Link to the Past, A Link Between Worlds focuses on Yuga.  A villain with the ability to turn the denizens of Hyrule into paintings.  It's up to Link to stop this fiend, and to do so he'll first need to gather three pendants.  It more or less borrows the formula from A Link to the Past.  Once you've obtained these three pendants, you'll then need to do seven more dungeons in order to save Hyrule for good.  This time going between two worlds.  The world of Hyrule and the world of Lorule.  As with A Link to the Past, you'll get the three pendants first and then go onto a bigger quest.  Once you've conquered the first portion of the game, however, A Link Between Worlds turns you lose and you're free to explore as much (or as little) as you want.  The seven proceeding dungeons can be tackled in any order you see fit.  This level of freedom hasn't been seen since the first Zelda.Make no mistake the dungeons themselves are challenging, with a lot of challenging puzzles.  The approach A Link Between Worlds takes is slightly different than that of other Zelda titles.  In previous games you often found the most helpful items within the dungeon you were currently exploring and then having to use said item constantly.  Here, you'll rent items and hold onto them pretty much until you fall in battle.  If you die you'll have to go and rent items again.  If that doesn't work for you you will eventually be able to buy everything you need at a more expensive price and you'll have the ability to upgrade it.  Some items are obtained by other means as well.  Often partaking in a small side quest.  The game is not always going to point this stuff out.  This helps to let players truly explore the worlds of Hyrule and Lorule.  Like the Light world and Dark world of A Link to the Past you'll also find yourself jumping between them constantly.The dungeons are no cakewalk.  The game itself is also no cakewalk.  Many of the puzzles are challenging.  Though there are hints the game is perfectly content to let you figure things out on your own.  There aren't a lot of handholding tutorials or anything of the sort.  A Link Between Worlds has little qualms cutting you loose and letting you figure out the dungeons and where to go on your own.  And make no mistake, the game is challenging.  If you're not ready to explore or to talk to ever denizen you meet it'll be easy to feel lost in A Link Between Worlds.  There's definitely a classic Zelda feel here.  The game rarely points you in any one direction.  Not only that, there are plenty of things to do off the beaten path.  There are always extra items to find, pieces of heart and mini-games to keep you busy for hours on end.  Thanks to the heavily non-linear feel of the game you'll feel like the in game world is bigger than it actually is.  But you'll rarely (if ever) feel like you're wasting time and when you uncover something new it always feels rewarding to do so.  The player is free to tackle the game at their own pace.  And should you ever get stuck, you can bet that there's an item you've missed that will allow you to explore the game deeper.Perhaps the best part is that A Link Between Worlds is almost always surprising you.  The dungeons themselves feel unique.  No dungeon ever feels like the previous one.  They all offer up their own unique challenges.  Just when you think you fully understand everything there is to know about A Link Between Worlds it's willing to add on another layer that not only forces you to rethink that which you've learned, but to try different approaches to each new challenge.  As I said, this is not a game that will hold your hand.  And you'll probably fail quite a few times (it is most certainly not an easy game) but you'll always feel a sense of accomplishment and wonder as you traverse the game.Graphically, A Link Between Worlds is a beautiful looking game.  It retains the feeling of a A Link to the Past.  The enemies themselves look familiar and so does the land of Hyrule.  This isn't a sequel that takes the world it is in lightly.  If you remember the layout of Hyrule in A Link to the Past the world pretty much looks the same here.  It's been given a nice coat of paint.  That's not to say there aren't new things to explore.  It's only to say that it's truly a sequel.  There's much more that'll pop out at you in Lorule.  Either way, the game is absolutely gorgeous.  Often times with a 3DS game I tend to put the 3D slider down.  Many games don't have a reason to play in 3D.  On rare occasions, however (such as Super Mario 3D Land) the 3D is worth cranking up.  The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds is such a game.  When you get a chance you'll want to explore some dungeons in 3D.  It's not the gimmicky &#34;pop-out,&#34; kind of 3D but rather the kind that lets you see more depth to the world around you.  From a technical standpoint, there are few 3DS games that look this good and utilize the hardware this well.  The soundtrack is even better.  It remixes quite a bit from previous Zelda titles but has a lot of new things as well.The Legend of Zelda A Link Between Worlds beautifully recreates and enhances the best of the older Zelda games.  You can explore without feeling like you're lost.  You can meet any challenge without feeling like the game is leading you through it.  But best of all, it's a rewarding experience all around.  It's lengthy, filled with lots of things to do off the beaten path and will ultimately have you coming back for more.  This is the best Zelda title to be released in a long time and any fan will be happy to enjoy it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2013"}

Angel \"americanpride\"","summary":"Still great in 2008","reviewText":"I got a DS and since it's compatible with GBA games I decided to play some of the best rated GBA games on it too.  I played Advance Wars: Days of Ruin (Similar game but more war based rather than rpg) and enjoyed it.Fire Emblem was released in 2003 so I expected the graphics to be a bit dated, but they aren't that bad for a small screen.  Overall, the gameplay and story was excellent.  Lot's of characters, lots of plot twists, and enough strategy.  I loved that if you 'lost' a character in battle that you no longer got to use them.  There are optional side quests/plots, which I skipped the first time around.  I definitely enjoyed this game enough to play it again to catch more of the plot details and play the side quests.  It's that good.  I also got the second installment for the GBA and the 3rd for the Game Cube.  After I finish those, I definitely plan on playing the newest one on the Wii.I also liked that the chapters/missions were not so hard that you had to play them over and over to finish and move onto the next part of the game/story.  At times it seemed easy, and it would have been nice to be able to turn the difficulty up...but at the same time it wasn't so easy that it wasn't fun.Anyhow, I would strongly recommend this game if you like Advance Wars, Final Fantasy, Jeanne D'arc on the PSP, and others that are similar in style).-- Added later:  Upon finishing this game, you find that more is unlocked.  For example, you can go through parts with other lead characters to get more insight from their perspective.  Going through to unlock other characters...etc...this game has more replay value than I originally thought and I thought it had good replay value to start with.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00HD4R5YU","description":"World-renowned Kojima Productions showcases the latest masterpiece in the Metal Gear Solid franchise with Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes. Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes (on sale Spring 2014) is the first segment of the 'Metal Gear Solid V Experience' and prologue to the larger second segment, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain launching thereafter. MGSV: GZ gives core fans the opportunity to get a taste of the world-class production's unparalleled visual presentation and gameplay before the release of the main game. It also provides an opportunity for gamers who have never played a Kojima Productions game, and veterans alike, to gain familiarity with the radical new game design and unparalleled style of presentation. The critically acclaimed Metal Gear Solid franchise has entertained fans for decades and revolutionized the gaming industry. Kojima Productions once again raises the bar with the FOX Engine offering incredible graphic fidelity and the introduction of open world game design in the Metal Gear Solid universe. This is the experience that core gamers have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Max","summary":"Metal Gear Solid 5 Executes","reviewText":"I purchased this game elsewhere because I wanted to be able to get this review out to potential buyers as quickly as possible.Value:Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is a great game, at least for what it is. The key thing to remember here is that Metal Gear Solid 5 is being split into pieces. Ground Zeroes is the first piece. The Phantom Pain is the next piece. There will likely be more after that. This means that this game is VERY short. You will be playing about 1/4 the length of a normal game for 1/2 the price of a full length game. The main mission, Ground Zeroes, is roughly 2 hours, and then there are side ops. These hold the familiar feel of the Peace Walker 2 missions. If you liked those, then you will like these. That being said, this game may not be worth it to you. Rent it for a couple of days and you can get the maximum experience. However, if you are like me, then the better option would be to just buy it and acquire all the Metal Gear Solid 5 pieces as they come out, and then play them all through again, one after another. This is probably the route to take if you are an avid Metal Gear fan. After playing it through once, I can confidently say that I will want to beat it again within the next few days. The main point here is just that you should be warned of the brevity of the game as I know that there are many people that want a game that will last. The Metal Gear Solid 5 collection will be one that any fan will want to have in full. That starts with this game and whether or not a few hours of game play will be worth $30.Another important thing to note about the MGS 5 series is that if you play Ground Zeroes for the Xbox 360, for example, then your save data will transfer to Xbox one. The same thing will happen for PS3 to PS4. This will also include any stats or information that carries across the MGS 5 series.This MGS has absolutely amazing mechanics. They are smooth and responsive. They feel great and better than they ever have. I got it for the Xbox One, and it is one of the most beautiful games so far. I specifically remember one mission where you have to shoot down some large artillery and then escape in a certain amount of time. My heart was pounding almost like I was living the situation (I highly suggest playing with headphones).The game play is fun, and in a way, personalized. If you want to be stealthy, you can be stealthy. If you want to \"run and gun\", then you can do that too. You play how you want to and this makes the game that much better, giving you all the more reason to get it.For those newcomers:Metal Gear Solid 5 is directly related to other games in the series. I believe it take place directly after Peace Walker. I promise you that you will be lost if you haven't played MGS before. Yes, you could read game summaries as some like to do, but I advise against it. I would suggest getting some of the other ones, at least Peace Walker, and then buying this along with Phantom Pain when that comes out. You don't have to, but for the full experience this is what I would suggest.I am giving this game 5 stars on the basis of what it is, and not how it relates to the price. This game is tons of fun while it lasts, and is a game that I in no ways regret getting. If you don't mind putting down $30 for an awesome, but quick experience, then I suggest doing so. If you want to get a lot of time out of a game, then this may not be the way to go for you. You can only play a game again so many times. Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes really pushes the MGS series forward. It retains what it needed to from older games while also introducing some awesome new features. 5/5 for quality. Value is at the buyers discretion. I hope this helped and if you have any questions, feel free to email me!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2014"}

{"product_name":"B003VJNPPE","description":"In BriefThe second instalment in the RPG saga about the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, features a thoroughly engrossing, mature storyline defining new standards for thought-provoking, non-linear game narration. In addition to an epic story, the game features an original, brutal combat system that uniquely combines tactical elements with dynamic action. A new, modern game engine, responsible both for beautiful visuals and sophisticated game mechanics puts players in the most lively and believable world ever created in an RPG game. A captivating story, dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much more advanced and sophisticated way.DEVELOPER: CD Projekt REDBrief Story DescriptionAfter helping to stop the rebellion undertaken by the Order of the Flaming Rose and saving King Foltest&rsquo;s life, Geralt became one of the central figures of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Temeria. Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...Key FeaturesA truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options.

The originalWitcherwas the game thatNeverwinter Nightshad promised to be. Two years later BIOWARE picks up the glove and comes back with a strong response, the masterpieceDragon Age: Origins. Unfortunately, its 2011 sequel does not live up to expectations. And this is all the opening the perfect sequel needed to come in and, once more, steal the show.THIS IS HOW TO MAKE A cRPG SEQUEL!Although there may be Xbox and PS3 versions of this game later on, this is a game designed from start to finish for the PC. In an age when 5-6 years old consoles set the standard this is very important. From the brand new engine to the very last script line, everything that could be worked on was and everything that could be improved shows improvement.  The story is now even deeper; the graphics are several notches higher; character development has been both streamlined and more balanced; equipping Geralt is now more detailed whereas loot is abundant.It is possible (although not necessary) to import your character from the first WITCHER. If, like me, you liked the original game, you will simply love the sequel.LOOK AT THE SKY: IT IS THE WITCHING HOUR - EVERY HOUR!The graphics are simply A-MA-ZING! I like the way the rock formations catch the moving shadows and how the wind stirs up dust. I like the subtle movement of the grass and the exploding colors of the wild flowers. I like the textures of the clothes, the shine of the armor and the glint of the swords. I like the way the sun gets in your eyes and the way rays of light play with the tree foliage.What is also important, these graphics and dynamic lighting are achieved even on medium-built systems (Minimum specs: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.2GHz/AMD 2.5GHz, nVidia 8800/ATI 3850, 1GB of RAM for WinXP/ 2GB for WinVISTA&7).Even more impressively, the game is set in a day/night cycle, and this is reflected not only on the levels of ambient light but also on the activities of the surrounding world.THE WORLD AROUND YOU COMES TRULY ALIVERemember how in most RolePlaying games approaching a Non-Playing Character (NPC) usually means he or she would utter any one of a small number of preset phrases? After a while, you have heard them all and it got very predictable. Well, prepare to be surprised. Again and again.This is a world you will truly be immersed into. A world that wakes up, goes to work, gossips, bickers and barters, and unwinds in the tavern. Walk the same streets at night and they are eerily empty. And that is without taking into account the ever changing weather!The immersion is so total for yet two other reasons: not only is the world fully open from the very beginning (no blocked areas or closed bridges!) but there are no loading delays between areas (only between chapters).THE LIFE OF A WITCHER IS NEVER BORINGGeralt is a real warlock, combining a mix of sword fighting with potions and spells. These are the three main character developing trees, Swordmaster, Alchemist or Mage. Sword moves, potion ingredients and spells can be combined - and all choices are meticulously balanced.With the original WITCHER it took me a while to master the timed sword-strokes - but it was really satisfying after that. In the sequel, sword-fighting has been simplified to the classic mod - and that is one of the gripes I have with this game. The other is the short dialogue options. I like my cRPGs wordy.Now, the story is far from being linear. Choices matter and choosing a path will bifurcate the story, most of the times irrevocably. And the story in WITCHER 2 is as important as the fighting.What I also appreciated was the return of consequences. Those of you who have played BALDUR's GATE Saga know that bashing or picking the lock of a chest was a punishable offense if anyone saw you. In contrast, in DA-O you could rob the town blind and (quite unrealistically) the NPCs could not care less. Well, in this game, your character better behave or face the ever vigilant guards.ADJUST TO YOUR ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF BINDINGMost retail versions of the game come with a simple disc-check, implemented by SecuROM. If you own FALLOUT 3, for example, you have experienced the same thing. Compared to the customer-abusing schemes out there (UBISOFT's and 2K GAMES' ears should be burning at this point) I find this solution not ideal but palatable. And yet it gets better:  if you are objecting even to this mild version of SecuROM, the developers made sure to also release the (digital) GOG version of the game which is DRM-free. Just for giving us this option, THE WITCHER 2 gets full marks in my books!A FINAL SPELLI have only praises for this magnificent sequel to a great game. It was one of the rare cases when I pre-ordered a game before I knew anything about it and was rewarded with a game that exceeded my highest expectations.  I do have some advice for the game developers though.First, keep showing the same respect to your customers and you will see that gamers know how to repay this with equal respect and loyalty. And finally, when the mega-publishers show up at your door with their mesmerizing bags of money, try to remember what happened to so many great game developing groups in the past that did not resist to temptation.WITH MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATIONS!(and not only because they promised all of their future DLCs to be free!)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2011"}

With richly detailed role-playing elements, Xenoblade Chronicles offers an extraordinary experience for veteran gamers and genre newcomers alike.","reviewerName":"Flea Returns: FF13","summary":"Unique world with a unique story that makes a wonderful game","reviewText":"Wow this game is just awesome. I haven't seen a story or setting like this in any game I have played. It was very long. Probably a little too long but every time I thought it was starting to drag on a little the story would kick into a new gear and I'd be completely interested all over again. As always my reviews rate the game on Story, Characters, and gameplay with more weight being given to the story.Story: 10/10This story is just wonderful. I mean it is completely unique. I mean, after all the story is about people living on the bodies of two titans. How cool is that? You play as Shulk, a young boy with a mysterious past who becomes the new heir of the \"monado\" a sword with seemingly infinite power. He begins to have visions seeing the future which guides him in his quest. Sharla, a girl Shulk cares for deeply, is killed by the mechon, robotic beings that live on the other titan called the mechonis, who have been at war for ages. Driven by revenge, Shulk sets out for revenge with the monado and discovers a world and it's history he simply can't believe. The story is just great and is really the best thing about the game. It keeps you guessing, there are constant twists, and it ends extremely well. Actually, one of the best endings ever.Characters: 10/10The characters are also really great. The story is clearly the strong suit of this game but the characters are right there with it. Each character is fleshed out really well. One of my biggest pet-peeves when it comes to gaming is when a video game doesn't give enough back story to the characters and thus you are not emotionally invested in them. Xenoblade goes above and beyond when making sure the characters are developed well. Some characters (Riki for example) don't have a lush back story to base their character on but overall these characters are great. (And admittedly, Riki's purpose is more of a comic relief character anyway) The main enemies are also fleshed out very well. Each enemy as a good back story and some of them you even become attached to.Gameplay: 8/10The gameplay for this game is in some cases amazing and in some cases very dry. However, overall the gameplay is still great but in comparison to the characters and story of the game, well it's obvious the weaker of the 3. First the bad. The fighting is very dry. You control one of your characters while you have 2 others in your party. Once you target an enemy, you activate auto-attack. your character then attacks at will and you can command him/her to perform special skills called \"skill arts\" which can range from a back slash for extra damage, heal the party, perform a combo, or buff your party/debuff the enemy as well as several other arts. Each character has unique arts assigned to each character. Shulk has the added skill set of the \"Monado arts\" which are special arts that can be performed using the monado. But after a while the fighting does become rather dry and does get rather old. There are added things that spice it up like chain attacks and different strategies with different parties but this is easily the weakest part of the game. And unfortunately, you do A LOT of this in the game.  The sidequests are vast. There are over 750 sidequests in this game. Oh geez wow. Unfortunately though 95% are fetch quests or kill quests. Go kill this scary monster please. Go get 2 of these and 3 of these please. Some of the quests result in higher powers for shulk and the others but most are pretty simple. Now the good. The rest of the gameplay is just awesome. While the fighting itself is rather dry, there is another depth to the gameplay that you can seriously play around with forever. You can raise the affinity between your characters and so depending on how much each character likes the other, they can learn attributes of the other characters. Also, the higher affinity a party has, the better they will perform in combat. LOOT geez man you get a lot of loot in this game. You are constantly picking up new weapons and armor and crystals. Your characters are extremely customizable and you can constantly upgrade their armor and weapons (other than shulk, who pretty much is locked in on the monado). You collect crystals that can be formed into gems that can attach to armor and weapons for added affects like boosting one's strength or HP or adding defense to a certain type of debuff. And while the fighting is rather simple, there is so much you can add to it and it really can become a strategy game.Overall: 9.75/10In the end, Xenoblade Chronicles is just an amazing game. It took me 95 hours to beat the game which is about average for someone who plays the main quest and does a bit of sidequesting. You can run through the story and only do the story in probably about 70 hours or you can seriously play this game upwards of 300 hours.  yes it's expensive and yes it's hard to find. My suggestion is go find a gamestop that has some in stock. And if you have to buy one off ebay, think of it this way. You are dropping 100 bucks on a game but you are going to get 100 hours of entertainment out of it. If you bought a game like god of war 3 or something like that, you paid 60 bucks for about 15 hours of entertainment. It's worth the money if you enjoy JRPG's. If you enjoy JRPG's then do yourself a favor and invest in this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2013"}

The good news is that these have been improved in DEAD SPACE 2 and are no longer the issue they were in the original. (There are still some problems with camera angles when boxed into a corner but these are an irritation rather than a deal breaker.) DS2 also handles zero gravity in a far more intuitive, and enjoyable way, with none of the crazy hopping from one surface to another as in the first game. Now you can move freely, as you would expect. Also improved in DS2 is Isaac's level of interaction. Now he speaks! This actually improves the experience more than might be expected, as it gives a greater sense that you're involved in an unfolding story. The graphics are above average quality though not outstanding. The gameplay is improved by the introduction of more varied environments (although this is still very much a corridor shooter), and there are still plenty of tense moments when battling with enemies, some of which will be familiar if you played DS1, and some of which are new. When compared with the original DS2 is basically more of the same but with a number of welcome improvements and enhcncements. On a final note: I found it a little easier than the first, but that might be because of the improved controls and my familiarity with the gameplay second time around. Anyhoo, there's still plenty of nerve-jangling fun to be had. Recommended, especially if you liked the original.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2013"}

If you are a duke fan you might be willing over look the flaws in this game,  I personally hated the game and would have given it one star,  but in all fairness it is not a one star game it has it's pluses so I am trying to rank it fairly based on the actual game not on my personal feelings and issues.If you are a huge fan you might like this game,  I would recommend waiting for the price to drop drastically or renting it too make sure that you like it before you buy it, because you may not like it.  It felt to me like it should have come out a long long time ago, and for me the loading times were like from the ps2 not even close to the ps3 I have not had to wait that long for loading games in a long long time,  in fact I can not even remember the last game that actually made me wait as long as Duke Does.The graphics for me were not that special and not bad,  the game play bored me quite quickly and the weapons were not interesting some one else recommended that game bullet storm if you are looking for a game with attitude first person shooting and such, that game also had loading issues but not as bad as this one.So in closing I would recommend that you rent it, from game fly or redbox before you purchase it, and I would recommend finding a used copy or waiting for it to drop in price,  this game will have a lot of returns because it really is not as special as it should be after all the time it took to make it and all the hype.The main problem with this game is they kept stalling it you can tell that they started making this game decades ago,  because it is the best game of last decade, if that makes sense,  I think that three stars is fair, I personally hated it, but other might even enjoy it,  rent it first, and do not pay full price get a used copy at one of the stores, or buy it from a friend or garage sale,  I bet you people who could not wait to get this game will be selling it  very quickly.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2011"}

I would never recommend this game to a Mario newbie.  The game is visually amazing, yes, but when you get to World 5, things get pretty insane...enough to throw your controller at the screen and give up after 50 stars (which is exactly and proudly what I did).You see, the thing is that once you get to World 5, you need 55 stars to get to World 6.  At most, you can only get about 51 stars from doing only the main star missions in all the galaxies up to that point.  You then have to get stars by doing the Prankster comets and various timed race missions (which are HORRIBLE...I've always hated those timed races).  That should not have to be the case at all.  In previous Mario games utilizing the star system, you were able to advance only by doing the main star missions.  Why isn't this the case here?Because of that fact, I give this game 2 stars overall and it's the worst Mario game to date.  It's also a practically complete repeat of the first Super Mario Galaxy game, so it's lacking in originality severely.  Also, most of those side missions actually require a second person to play co-op.  Absolutely sucks...The end of Mario games as single player endeavors is over, and that's really sad.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2011"}

I saw this phrase and thought of the days of the very first Final Fantasy, with a completely customizable party, a solid, inventive storyline &amp; combat system, and everything else generally associated with the first of this series.Although FFIX boasts the best polygonal characters of the series, as well as the best FMV, square has long since forgotten that video games are about gaming, not graphics.  Gamers can only be dazzled for so long before gameplay becomes a huge issue.  While I appreciate the characters, storyline, and stability of this game far more than I did those of FFVII &amp; VIII, IX lost a lot in the following ways:1)  What happened to the serious plotlines?  Given not only the recent trend towards serious gaming but also the release of the movie (sci-fi based, like FFVII &amp; VIII, not fantasy like IX), square should have continued their trend of seriousness.  A glance at FFX on PS2 shows that square intends on continuing the serious trends later.  Why the one reprieve? 2)  The battle system is boring.  Hardcore gamers and FF fans will yell at me for this, but lets face it: the battle system is the repeated mashing of a single button, with very little thought involved. 3)  The minigames, while much better than before, yield dubious and/or difficult results.  There are two extremes to the minigame situation: tetra master &amp; chocobo's hot &amp; cold.  tetra master (which everyone will recognize immediately as Triple Triad of FFVIII) is a collectible card game, complete with 100 different cards, collector ranks, and cards that can gain experience and have individual statistics.  The problem, of course, is twofold.  The first is that the highest collector level is ridiculously hard to attain.  The second is that there's no reward for attaining it.  Unlike Triple Triad of FFVIII, you get no items for having the best cards: you get...respect?  On the other end of the spectrum, chocobo's hot &amp; cold is far too challenging and nitpicky for the prizes it rewards (namely, the best/second best weapons in the game for several characters).Ok, that's the end of the rant.  The game is still fun.  The ending was the best FF ending I've seen in years.  So I'll stop whining.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2001"}

You can chain your moves together to make them more powerful and unlock awards for your different achievements in battle. The moves are also very cool.The story of this game is sadly lacking. It does have multiple possibilities for endings, but you don't really care once you've beat the game.

Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Corey Turner \"The Musician\"","summary":"Thought They Couldn't Get You in Daylight","reviewText":"Being a fan of the Resident Evil series, a four year wait for the newest installment really dried my patience out. Understandably costive time and care went into the process to include Resident Evil in the run of next generation games for xbox 360, and ps3. With that said, Resident Evil is a survival-horror game that features a completely cooperative campaign mode, and a secondary arcade mode `mercenaries'. Available, for a fee to download on whichever platform you wish to pick this game up on , is a versus multiplayer mode.Resident Evil 5 follows closely to the overhauled gameplay the fourth game brought. The overhaul to many was a make or break deal, though many critics (including myself) have felt this to renew the series, and bring it into a different light.  The change has a lot to do with movement, featuring a third person over the shoulder view. Alongside of that is the emphasis on collecting guns and upgrading them, no longer is it a struggle to maintain ammunition in case of a close encounter. This alone departs the game further from its supposed `survival horror' genre, nearing it to the action shooters like 2008's Army of Two.The game takes place in Africa, where you'll be taking on the role of Chris Redfield (one of the main characters from the original title) who is now a member of an agency known as the BSAA. Well I should say initially you'll be taking on the role of Chris, as a new character to the series Sheva Alomar (another BSAA operative) is also available for both single player and co-op. Though the game has been out since last spring, I'm opting not to spoil any of the story, I will say a few characters from the original trilogy reprise there roles (whether it be through cinemas, or flashbacks there are indeed a few).Graphically the game is up to par with many next gen titles, colors bloom and pop. For some odd reason a greenish  hue hazes many of the darker colors in the game. The constant daylight doesn't add to the fear so much as the atmosphere. The locations are pretty interesting, mines, shanty towns, safari terrain etc. To be honest, I didn't really find any spot noteworthy in the game for horror.  Sound wise effects are pretty standard, some gun shots will echo, explosions make use of a good subwoofer etc. Hearing the enemy before seeing them is always helpful, but a musical cue should be able to alert one of imposing doom. Voice acting is classic Resident Evil dialogue, pretentious and often times comical.  I will say this one still has an in-depth plot, I will continue to say it's not a very good one though.An armory of weapons are at your disposal; pistols, sub machine guns, sniper rifles, assault rifles, various grenades and of course a combat knife. Your inventory on the other hand has been scaled down, to emphasize cooperation with a partner they kept the game going in real time, so no more using the inventory screen as a secondary pause. To gain such riches one will have to keep an eye out for treasures they will glisten and are much easier to locate this time around. Each treasure is worth a different amount, and cannot be combined to create a more stunning unique item like in the previous game.  Treasures can be a gemstone or objects similar to what you'd find at an archeological site.Enemies will often use whatever may lay around depending on the location this could go from a intimidating pitchfork to a terrifying stick of dynamite. The enemy AI (artificial intelligence) isn't the greatest, but they know how to pose a threat. They will duck, climb, alert others of intrusion, anything to make your stay in there territory a nightmare. How you react and how to disperse ammo is up to you, a few different buildings to enter, and alternative routes add to replay value.Ultimately the first run through on this game is the most memorable, your weaponry acquired through out the game is forwarded to your next run through, making things a bit easier (a harder `professional ` mode will also be available to bump your game up). This game makes for a great buy if your a completionist, the weapons all have stats capable of increasing, and a museum like bonus adds bonus unlockable figurines to view. The game makes use of chapters, so if you'd like to repeat a certain segment check the available chapters you have unlocked and have fun. Any cinema that has been viewed within campaign can now be viewed in the menus. Loading screens usually have blots of information of the Resident Evil timeline. The 'bosses' faced in the game are kind of a let down though a few are entertaining. Don't expect the boss battle variety of previous games, as a majority of them in this title all have something in common.Horror is almost non existent, campaign has been greatly shortened from Resident Evil 4's mammoth duration. In terms of Resident Evil the game has taken a leap of faith in technological advancements, but unsatisfying fell short of expectations with nearly everything feeling more dulled down. So on it's own the game is (to me) a 4 out of 5, and is an obvious recommendation. On behalf of the other Resident Evil titles and how well it stacked against them though, I'd have to give 3  out of 5. If I could make a quick recommendation here, it would be to simply rent this game and play through it with a friend. If  you enjoy it and/but want more horror try out Dead Space another good rental.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2009"}

It stopped reading any of the games I tried out.  The classic \"Disc Read Error\" message became commonplace in my house.  Sony would do nothing for me, it was more expensive to get it fixed than to buy a new one.  So.....like an idiot I bought a new one.  My second PS2 only lasted 6 months and did the same thing.  This time, it would not eject my NCAA Football game so I had to force open the disc tray just to get my game out.  Once again, Sony would do nothing.  The warranty was only for 90 days, thus the 6 month time frame did not allow warranty coverage.  This was a very disappointing product, as I had never had problems with Sony products before.  I enjoyed many of the games I played on the PS2, I just believe that it should last longer than 6-8 months.  I bought an Xbox and never had any problems with it.  Ever.  Shame on Sony for putting a junky product, charging $200 for it (at the time), and then not backing it up with a decent warranty.Overall = Poor","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2007"}
{"product_name":"B007FTE2VW","description":"","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"Could be good eventually...","reviewText":"By now the whole world has heard of the launch nightmare that was Sim City 2013. I'm going to try not to beat the dead horse any further, and instead focus on the actual game as I've played it so far.First off, I'm a veteran of SimCity going back to the very beginning. I've played every single SimCity game including the original DOS version, which was one of the first games I played period. I am a HUGE fan of the franchise and was extremely excited about this release. The previews looked amazing, showing off the Glass Box engine and new city-building aspects.My overall impression now, having played with it for a few days, is that it's got potential but is definitely not there yet. Whether this is the result of a calculated move by EA to make more money, or a rushed deployment, or a bit of both- I don't know. However, there's little question that SimCity 4 (circa 2003) is a much better city building game. Here's the balance sheet:Pro side:A lot of things that you had to do manually before, and were a bit of a nuisance, have been streamlined. For example you no longer need to lay power lines or pipes manually, which used to take an inordinate amount of time and was quite a chore. Roads are the big connectors now, and are the only place you can designate zones or build buildings. As long as you have a power plant or pump station on the map, anything connected to it by the road network gets the power/water.The road interface in general is well done and works a lot better than before. No more weird 'looks like a dead end, but isn't' streets going over terrain, and you're no longer constrained to building along very straight rectangular lines. You can build circular streets, and zones placed along these actually work. There are two kinds of roads- regular streets and avenues. Avenues are essentially identical but support heavier traffic, and take up more space.In general the graphics and detail are improved over SimCity 4. You can zoom way in and see people going about their business, see emergency vehicles responding, etc. The world is fully 3D and looks nice, and buildings are varied and well done. Sounds are also well done in general, and the disasters are intense and impressive. The cities really look alive in a way they haven't before.The upgrade system works well, both for roads and placeable buildings. It's cool that you can now, for example, upgrade a school with extra classrooms instead of building a new one. Many extensions unlock extra buildings or services, such as bus stops if you place a bus depot. Pretty much all of the placeable buildings have upgrades, and some of them look quite cool.Zones are also streamlined, and density is based on city population and the street you placed a zone along. This saves a lot of bulldozing and rezoning, since all you have to do to up a zone's density is upgrade the streets.You can play cooperatively, with friends claiming and building cities that interact with yours. This is kind of fun, though it also means you have to be on the same server and same landmass. Landmasses support anywhere from two to 7 cities. However, if you don't want people interfering with your domain, you can also make a private landmass. Cities can collaborate to build a 'great work,' which benefits all in the region. You can also deal with unsightly things like garbage and sewage by putting it all in a few cities, and exporting it from your idyllic cities- great for those who've had dreams of recreating Panem.The overlays are well done for things like pollution, land value, crime, power coverage, etc. It's very easy to see where your utility buildings are and where you need to expand.There is a sandbox mode that lets you just go crazy with buildings, irrespective of funds and other nuisances. This is nice, since most of the fun of SimCity isn't micromanaging resources, but rather building stuff and then watching it go down spectacularly in a disaster.Negative side:City size. This is the one REALLY big disappointment. When I first saw the city border, I thought 'okay, for sure it's going to let me expand that... right?' Wrong. I could live with most of the other issues, design changes, and bugs, but not this one. In my opinion, this game would be better called 'SimVillage' on account of how tiny your cities are. Plop down avenues for your city, and they'll take up a good 10% of the total area. No joke. Furthermore, I'm pretty sure this isn't going to get changed anytime soon to keep server load and load times down. It's already bad as is, and making cities 5 times larger (which is what I'd say, at minimum, is necessary) would certainly not help matters. This is somewhat mitigated by the fact that you can claim adjacent cities, but seeing as how they're essentially separate entities that only interact statistically it's not really the same.Possibly as a result of the city size, you are forced to 'specialize' your city. For example, a city can have a utilities department which lets you build things like water treatment plants. This effectively solves sewage problems and means you can support nearby cities' sewage. You could also go the tourism route and build an airport, or education which gets you things like a university... there's a lot of choices, but the problem is you have to pick one.It does not appear you can change the landmasses or create your own. I really liked this in the older games, but now you have to pick a canned landscape. They're nice, but this has dashed my dreams of creating my isolated mountain manor- complete with water and power- from which to observe the burning and irradiated ruins of the city under my care :-(There are quite a few graphics issues, including tearing and oddly low-res closeups. I was especially surprised by how bad the game looks with all settings maxed; it certainly doesn't look like it did in the demo videos. Take this with a grain of salt though, as it's possible I did something wrong or need to mess with driver versions (although I can't remember the last time I had to do that for a game).There seems to be fewer 'events' and rewards, such as placeable landmarks, statues, and such for doing well. You can get a mayor's manor, but that's about it as far as I've seen- aside from DLC content. That also raises the specter of what they're planning to do with that, as it's been an integral part of the franchise. I think it's highly likely they're saving these for future DLCs, which is a bit too money-grubbing for my tastes.You can't skip tutorials, neither can you avoid them. A bizarre and irritating oversight, especially since the game really isn't that hard to figure out by just diving in.And lastly, yes, there is no offline play. To even access the game you have to log into Origin, and it appears your cities aren't even stored locally. This also means that even if you have a screaming fast game rig, you'll be stuck with long load times on account of having to fetch data from EA's servers. This is an especially major deterrent to switching between cities since it simply takes too long.For the record, I actually didn't suffer much of the launch day debacle, possibly because I expected it and waited a day to even install the game. However, I later found out that I'd somehow ended up on a Europe server which it had chosen by default (possibly due to aforementioned debacle). It also took several tries to claim my first city, and load times were excessive. When I switched to a US server I found that there is apparently no shared persistence between servers and no obvious way to transfer data between them. For all intents and purposes, if you change servers you start over- complete with the tutorials you can't skip. Overall, the online vs. offline setup is a bit of a nuisance and I do agree it should be optional. Does it kill the game by itself? Now that people can actually connect to servers, no- and I'm inclined to forgive that much as a typical launch day blip.Is SimCity 2013 an unmitigated disaster as many proclaim? I would say no, but it certainly isn't the best game in the series either. Overall, it has been disappointing for me- largely due to the scale and scope you're limited to. I do think it's likely a lot of this will be added back in DLCs, but then again some of it might not. Also, you will of course have to pay for said DLCs, and I can totally understand the furor over having to pay extra for things we were able to do straight out of the box in SimCity 4.Final recommendation: wait on it. This game could eventually end up being all it was hyped up to be, but it simply isn't there yet.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2013"}

And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive.

I thought I'd be able to make something fairly easily, like I do with TimeSplitters, but I don't understand this mapmaker one bit.It's confusing, complicated, and not very well documented.That is about all there is that is really bad about this system, but that first one really bugs me, since the whole reason I bought the game was so that I could take my laptop over to a friend's house and we could hook 5 or 6 computers up and play... but the controls are just too weird.Now for the good stuff:More characters!  About twice as many characters as in the PS2 version.More levels.  Tons of levels, plus if custom levels if I can ever figure out how to use the map generator.I say, if you have a desktop computer, or if you don't have a PS2, go ahead and get this game, because it is an excelent First Person Shooter.

There are even unlockable \"bonus\" features you can explore, like on a DVD, such as making-of videos, game art, a soundtrack, and more.The story of the game sets you down running as the first character you play, Lucas Kane, has just stabbed a man to death in cold blood. In a pretty intense sequence of events, you have to figure out how to get rid of the body and get away from the scene of the crime without getting caught. If you manage that, Lucas takes a break for a while as you start playing the next characters, a pair of police detectives who are investigating the murder.  Throughout the game you'll continue switching back and forth between characters -- as the detectives you're trying to put all the pieces together, while as Lucas you're trying to evade capture for as long as it takes to figure out what happened. Along the way you'll also play other characters briefly as well, but the main focus is on these three.  What's amazing about it is how well it all works together.  Despite the fact that you're playing both sides of the case, the suspense and the level of interest in the unfolding story are both kept high. As it continues, it grows rapidly to encompass a global conspiracy reaching back into history, shadow organizations coming to power at last, and a city slowly freezing to death.The graphics in the game, while not the best I've ever seen, are quite good.  I was most impressed with the facial expressions of the characters which really carried quite a bit of the feeling in the words. As far as the voice acting goes, for this game it was top-notch.  The actors for Indigo Prophecy should be congratulated; I'd have to say they put in the best vocal performance I've heard for a video game since I played The Longest Journey a few years ago.  The control system is interesting and unique, but still reasonably intuitive -- incorporating some of the standard movement functions for scenes of walking around and exploring with a call-and-response system of flashing lights for action sequences. It's hard to describe adequately, but the controls for action/fights are definitely not your standard \"button-masher\" types of controls.  For Indigo Prophecy, you really do have to pay attention to which buttons you're pushing, how fast, and in what sequence, or quite simply you won't make it.A surprising amount of time early on in the game is spent away from the main story action, on (dare I even think it?) character development. The results are occasionally laughable, but for the most part they come out quite well. Most enjoyable was the one-on-one basketball game between one of the detectives and his co-worker and the sparring match between the two detectives. These are little \"mini-games\" within the larger framework, but they're quite effective in actually establishing key traits for each of the featured characters. Of course, as the story grew these became fewer and fewer, but I was satisfied that the characters had been established quite well by that point, something I almost never get to say about any game.What makes Indigo Prophecy one of my new favorite games is that it really tries (and mostly succeeds) in telling a big story in a unique way, and keeping the player engaged while doing so. It reaffirms my belief that games can be a strong vehicle for good storytelling, when done well, and it is one of the best surprises in games this year.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2005"}

For the first time, drivers explore new competitive kart possibilities, such as soaring through the skies or plunging to the depths of the sea. New courses, strategic new abilities and customizable karts bring the racing excitement to new heights.","reviewerName":"J. Sherman \"The Critic\"","summary":"Still in the Lead","reviewText":"At its core, this Mario Kart is like any other; you race to the finish line while beaning anyone in front of you with Koopa shells, bombs, fireballs, or--if you snag the new Lucky 7 item--everything.  The character roster, however, is slightly tweaked with new challengers.  I'd like to know the story behind the sizable Honey Bee, Shy Guy's now a regular, Dry Bones seems to be stuck in traffic and couldn't make it, and Metal Mario sound like he sticks his face in front a motorized fan.  I mostly race as my Mii, who can challenge other players via StreetPass and SpotPass.Another noticeable change is a varied kart customization system that lets you create the right kart for the right track, even if it's a tugboat monster truck.  Speaking of tracks, the assorted racing cups are the usual mix of old and new, including 2 Rainbow Roads (Seriously?).  So if the other racers or traps don't slow you down, the freefalls into infinite space will.Not much in the way of game modes, either.  It's just the usual; local & online play, collecting coins, battling for balloons, and Mission Mode has been cut this time around (Not that I've ever seen the point of purposely ramming your kart into an overgrown Goomba).  But whether you're competing against your newly acquired Mii, or trying to take first place on Rainbow Road to unlock the next engine class, MK7 (Not Mortal Kombat 7) shapes up to win handheld championship gold yet again.This game is rated E for Everyone: Violence.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2012"}

Yes, I know. Xbox one has only 792p instead of the 900p of the PS4 or the unlimited p of PC gaming. I don't own a computer with the power for something like that, and I don't yet own a PS4, so I made due with the best graphical experience on the systems I own.And let's point something out. Everyone tells me how amazing this game looks. I don't see it. You can say it's because I'm on the &#34;inferior&#34; Xbox One or whatever you want, but I've seen this on the PS4 live and in person as well - it just doesn't wow me at all.I don't know about the other versions, but the draw distance for vehicles is pretty stupid short. I get on the highway, going the wrong direction as fast as I possibly can in a sports car. I can actually see the cars popping in. This is supposed to be a next gen game, but it suffers the same graphical... stuff... that the old systems dealt with. I've also seen the game on the PC in high detail. Draw distance on there is not a problem at all.Textures are bland. Music is OK. Character models look like last generation.Overall, the game is OK, but not something worth $60 and definitely not worth also spending money on a Season Pass.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2014"}

Stoffer","summary":"Fun But Dumbed Down In Comparison To The PC Version","reviewText":"The game is a blast and was well put together. However, if you ever played it on the PC there is no comparison as far as challenge.Typically, a game on normal mode on the Xbox 360 version will last about 3 hours, but on the PC it would last around 12 hours. Also, there are not nearly as many different types of units and buildings as before. Nor are the options like treaties and trading nearly as diverse.What I've always had a problem with Civilzation is that there really is no actual single player campaign. It's more of you rather play against someone online or a bunch of computers. Therefore, Civilization loses its edge after a short time.On a positive note, the gameplay is smooth, the graphics are standard, and the strategy side is still very much there. There are five modes of difficulty and you can also download maps that change the game to give you a lot of money, have the barbarians be a lot more hostile, have the building be a lot faster paced, things of that nature. A pet peeve for me is that the achievemants were pretty easy to obtain and although AP don't mean anything in reality, I take pride in having 17000+ points. So I didn't mind earning about 700 AP in a week or two of purchase without trying.So get this game over other strategy games like Halo Wars (eye rolls) but don't expect to be playing this game for more than a month or two. It unfortunately gets dull and repetitive after a while.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2009"}

On top of my list is Archery.  You use both the nunchuck and remote during gameplay.  Holding the remote in your left hand straight up and pulling back with the nunchuck in the other hand like you are really using a bow and arrow.  Sounds easy but the game gets progressively harder as you go on. Another one my family loves to play is Swordplay.  In Swordplay you use the remote as if you were using a sword.  You can even use a block feature by pressing the \"B\" button.  We laugh like crazy when we play this one and you can get into some really extreme battles.  I just love to watch the Mii's fall-over the platform in slow motion!  Canoeing is another fun one to play.  You use the remote like you would use a paddle and try to get around the course avoiding obstacles and try beating your opponent to the finish lines.  I love crashing into the other canoe and making them get off course.  This game will give you one good workout of your arms so be prepared.Wii Resort is an welcomed added addition to my collection of Wii games.

Recht","summary":"What Would Elvis Do?","reviewText":"The original Perfect Dark was so darn good that when I saw this for a measly twenty bucks I couldn't pass it up. I spent a good year on the original--it was an all-purpose shooter. Even if you were alone, the multiplayer bots kept things fresh, and there were a million and one options to tinker around with.That game stored not only your custom-tailored character but also your lifetime stats down to the mileage you've run and every round fired. This made it the cartridge of choice whenever I invited people over and we wanted something to play. There was fierce competition in my apartment for several months as people vied for dominance in one stat group or another. If you weren't a marksman, maybe you would only use mines and thus lay claim to the title of most explosive kills and so on. I tell you all this so you'll understand that not a little bit of nostalgia factored into my overall rating. If I hadn't played the original this one would probably get three stars. As it was, I enjoyed it more than a newcomer might.So I was very pleased to see that bots were being included in this installment as well. I don't know why other games don't mimic Perfect Dark's multiplayer system. All I know is that between the original and Dark Zero, I kept wishing for a game that played just as well with multiplayer just as customizable, and never got it until now.There are a number of standard rulesets like killcount and capture the flag but there are also scenarios that can be fought through against other live players.The best, though, is when you have a friend over and want to play. Then you can have a real versus match--none of that one-on-one crap that gets old very fast. Want to play 5v5? Just add eight bots. Instant opponents, or teammates. You can adjust their skill levels anywhere from completely pathetic to death incarnate. And if you're better than your friend, you can add a couple extra bots to his team.Missing, though, are a lot of those options I mentioned before. You can't customize your character in this one (forgivable), you can't tailor the bots' personalities or appearances (also forgivable), and you can't view your lifetime stats anymore (blasphemy! burn the witch!). That left Dark Zero feeling more cramped than the original. I still can't figure out why they removed all that content. Ah, well. The deathmatch arena in Perfect Dark Zero is still the most fun multiplayer--even just against bots--I've experienced in a while.As far as the single player campaign goes, it's ruthlessly average. Not bad at all--not even implying that. Everything's rock-solid, action-wise. I just mean the story and the levels are so-so. Nothing standout here. Nothing unsatisfactory, either. You'll get your share of challenges. Some of the stretches you have to navigate in this game will keep you on your toes. I must have tried the bridge assault level ten or twelve times before I made it.There were a couple of noticeable flaws in the otherwise smooth veneer of this experience, though. One was the physics of a downed bad guy. It's really common in this game for a dead body to start \"dancing\" on the ground, or even take off and hover in midair for a while. You'll waste a lot of bullets shooting at dead bodies you think are attacking you. Another is the shadows. I haven't seen shadows that pixelated since SNES. Still, these are pretty minor. You won't have a problem overlooking them in favor of the action.I really liked the music in this game. It seemed to fit perfectly and it did a good job of getting me into whatever was happening onscreen. No thick atmosphere here, but that's a good thing. You're promised an adrenaline rush or ten, and it delivers. Consequently the themes in Dark Zero are much more energetic than in the original. The opening video and song reminded me strongly of Bond credits. Slick.All in all, I truly liked it. There were flaws, but it was a well-executed game. When you factor in the price you can't go wrong. It's a solid shooter and the adaptable deathmatch will keep you playing for a while.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2008"}

Since the system features and functionality are easily found from other reviews and various web sites, I won't comment on these. I would like to share my thoughts on the bronze version of this unit based on personal experience.When I was looking to purchase this item, I was undecided between the blue and bronze. Surprisingly, there are limited number of photos/videos on the web for bronze; many look different than what it actually looks in terms of the color depth. The product box itself does not show the overall color scheme very well, which made the decision tough for me. I decided to take the leap of faith and go with the bronze anyhow since blue seemed to \"kid-like\" and I'm a middle-age male gamer.When I opened the box, the top of the unit appeared to be a dark brown, almost black. It's very glossy and will get finger prints but that's not a big deal to me. When I opened up the unit, I was slightly surprised that the color of the \"face\" is actually closer to a dark coffee/mocha rather than black as it had appeared in photos online or on the box; the photo on the box as it is shown is much darker than the real unit. Some reviewers have written it is black inside; I don't know how they could think so since it is definitely NOT black; maybe they got an import model? The overall theme/feel is under-stated and sleek. Although I was never a big fan of the color \"brown\", especially when it comes to gadgets/tech, I'm beginning to get used to this after a few days of use. When compared to blue or burgundy, I think bronze appears to be much more sophisticated for a mature gamer as myself.Ok enough about the color. Just one comment on the texture of the DS. I found the back of the unit to have a harsh texture, which makes holding it not very comfortable over a long period of time. I decided to get the CM4 Catalyst Slim Cover, which is relatively pricey but worthwhile investment. With the heft of the XL, this case really helps improve the grip and playability.All in all, this an awesome piece of tech; I highly recommend it to all gamers of all ages!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2010"}

Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, PS2, DS, PC, Activision, T.","reviewerName":"Caleb Williams","summary":"The Best Spidey Game By Far","reviewText":"Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does whatever a spider can. Sorry, I couldn't help myself but this game really has reignited my love for one of the greatest comic book characters ever created. As a stand alone, he's not the greatest thing in the world, but he's complemented by the ocean of incredibly cool villains that he has pitted himself against over the years. The Marvel universe does very well in creating unique characters both good and evil and this game brings both the free roaming New York gameplay made famous by the movie to game tie ins, with the Marvel Universe to make one incredible game. The developers of Web of Shadows promised us a new combat system that would present a realistic fighting experience unique to the Spider-Man character and not seen in any game before.The plot focuses mainly around a Venom symbiote invasion of New York City in which it starts to take over and transform regular members of the public making an army of Venom's that Spider-Man must take on alone, or so he thinks. The symbiote has also taken host in Spidey who for some unknown reason is able to control its corrupting powers but on the positive side lets you switch between the traditional Spider-Man attire and the famed Black suit. Switching between the two gives you a differing array of fighting abilities but also gives you the option to make good or evil choices that will ultimately effect who you gain help from when combating the infestation. When the invasion hits a peak S.H.I.E.L.D. are forced to quarantine New York and employ the help of the infected Spider-Man to defeat venom and the symbiotes along with infected fellow superheroes and villains making them much more powerful than they have ever been and a real challenge for Spidey.Although this does take on essentially the same gameplay mechanics as the last Spider-Man games which were adapted from the movies, the new fighting system is a breath of fresh air and makes the experience of battling numerous enemies that little bit more enjoyable. Ground, Wall and Air fighting mechanics allow you to tackle enemies on each front as you can take enemies out on the ground with unique moves, then smoothly web shoot your way to the wall of a sky scraper, battle a few enemies there and then take it to the air with the help of your web slinging. Having the ability to smoothly switch between both suits with a simple seamless click of the left analogue stick allows you to chain together special attacks individual to both suits making for an arsenal of exciting attacks on your opponents.Utilising the Marvel universe as the platform for the game really works very well as the geeky comic version of Peter Parker shines through very well, especially when being taught some fighting skills by the likes of Wolverine and Nick Cage. The fellow comic book heroes and villains are a welcome addition as you can align yourself as either good or evil allowing you to utilise the special abilities of those you align yourself with. My personal favourite alignment is that with the unstoppable Rhino as, when you're in trouble, you can call upon his services to jump on his back and plough through anything in your way. Also the gift of flight, when trying to reach a far off island such as the prison Rikers Island, is a healthy advantage for you to call upon your friends services.The plot does certainly take on an epic feel when the invasion is in full swing and having the entire of New York City at your disposal to swing about is definitely a big plus. One way this game does fall a bit flat are the cut scenes. Although they are meant to be in a comic book world, I found the graphical content of the scenes a bit too choppy and vague to really portray the supposed doomsday feel that the games plot was trying to put across. I would have much preferred CGI rendered cut scenes that didn't use the graphics engine of the game play, that way it would have given off a more blockbuster movie look.Undoubtedly this is a welcome addition to the Spider-Man video game franchise as it presents a unique combat style and allows for the excellent presentation and introduction for his fellow Marvel Comics superheroes. This is definitely the way I would love to see the Spider-Man movies go in the way of incorporating more fellow heroes into the world and obviously leading into an Avengers movie which is, coincidentally, in the works. If Spider-Man were to be a part of the Avengers film then it certainly could work just as brilliantly as this fantastic game. Buy it, you will not be disappointed I promise.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2009"}

I have since forgotten the story but Shadow Fall is a great start for new comers or for people coming back to the franchise.  So far the story is great and the graphics are amazing.  You get to see how your player gets shaped by events and leads him to where the game takes place.  The controls are intuitive and easy to use.  So far I like the campaign and there are suspenseful moments.I am disappointed to find out that this game is only single player.  I played through the Killzone 3 campaign with a friend and had a blast.  It's weird that they would choose to ditch a cooperative campaign especially with more power on the PS4 to work with.  I was actually quite frustrated with the game last night.  I was still learning the controls and I missed that Up arrow showed you where to go.  I was running around forever with no direction whatsoever.  Also, why did they choose to write everything in the smallest text possible when they know a lot of people would be playing on large screen TV's.As I play through this game there are a ton of little things that build up.  The space levels and just walking sometimes you fill find that you can't go forward anymore.  You have to raise yourself or jump to continue.  Although this isn't bad it feels less than polished.  Also sometimes I feel like I am just overwhelmed with enemies and die fast and sometimes I feel like there are barely any.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2013"}

There is PLENTY of room for improvement and full utilization of the game engines.  As a game though, it is HORRID.  The story is short, ridiculous (forget everything in the story in the previous games, they threw most of it out), and the game play is VERY bad.  First person shooters are a dime a dozen, and they have controls pretty well figured out.  Not this one.  They throw a bunch of useless stuff just to complicate things.  For some grenades, you have to press 3 buttons to get it out (R1 - R2 - R2).  The controls are confusing.  There is no guide to walk you through how to use your skills.  Whenever you get resurrected by your robot, you are always looking up at the sky (as if to say thank you to someone).  Speaking of your robot (OWL), it misses all of those shielded enemies more times than not.  It's mostly just a gimmick and never very useful.There are few save points, and most of the time, you will go back to the beginning of a chapter.  There are many points in the game where you have to unlimited enemies, until you figure out what the game wants you to do (rarely obvious, even with the red dots).All in all.

I picked up Lord of the Rings: Two Towers and took it home. Played it for an hour and beat it then took it back to get a better game. They told me about Sands of Time and said it was a great game. Took it home and I was not the least bit disappointed. What a truly great game!Story: King Sharaman of Persia and the Prince are heading to Azad but seek to conquer a city in India en route with the help of the local Maharajah's (AKA King) Vizier (AKA Political Advisor). During the battle, the prince heads straight to the vault only to discover the sands of time in an hourglass and the mythical dagger of time. When the prince presents the dagger to his father, the Vizier demands it as payment for his help. The King refuses and they continue to Azad along with the Maharajah's daughter, princess Farah, as a prisoner. In Azad, the Vizier tricks the prince into releasing the sands of time with the dagger, and all hell breaks loose. A sand storm breaks loose and everyone is transferred into sand monsters except the prince, Farah, and the Vizier because they possess the artifacts of the hourglass; the dagger, medallion, and the staff. The prince must work with Farah who knows what is going on and what needs to be done to return the sands to the hourglass.Gameplay: 3D platformer. You traverse the palace using acrobatics and solving puzzles to reach the next area. The acrobatics include wall running, jumping, climbing, etc. Once you reach a new platform, you fight sand monsters. You fight with your sword but have to use the dagger to defeat humanoid enemies. You use acrobatics in combat as well such as jumping over enemies and rebounding off walls to strike them. The dagger can be used in combat to slow down time and freeze enemies. Farah helps in combat by shooting arrows but the game ends if she dies. While you are traversing the palace between platforms, you can use the dagger to rewind time by up to 10 seconds. If you fall or make a mistake, you can rewind time and try again instead of dying and starting again. Your dagger has a set number of sand tanks (used to rewind time) to use with new ones gained as you progress. Once you sand tank is depleted, you can't use the dagger anymore to rewind time. You can replenish the dagger by absorbing enemies and sand clouds. If you don't absorb a fallen enemy quickly, they will come back to life. Your combat affects (freezing enemies) and other special abilities are taken from power tanks which are gained by defeating 16 enemies after collecting a new Sand Tank.Conclusion: Graphics are very good on the GameCube. Controls are easy but you will still find yourself rewinding time often while attempting acrobatics between areas. The game is not short and not too long. The game is challenging but not overly difficult. I didn't find the game boring or repetitive in any way. I was hooked from the beginning to the end. The game also includes the original prince of Persia game that is playable and a feature to link it to the GB Advance game to replenish health. Also, IGN rated this game as # 8 in the GameCube's top 25 best games list. It was the only Prince of Persia game to make the list. Worth getting even now after the GameCube's era. Will play on the Wii with a GameCube controller.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2011"}

Poopyerpants","reviewText":"I got my little brother Dead Space for his X-Box 360 for Christmas. The game ended up spooking him enough so that he was barely able to get past the 2nd chapter, and so he flew it my way to see what I would make of it. The game took me roughly a week to polish off (between work and sleep) and I found a thoroughly frightening game with beautiful graphics and one of the spookiest atmospheres to be found in any horror/survival shooter game. Beware, a few mild spoilers ahead!Dead Space takes place in the ever far-flung future around a distant planet called Aegis VII on board a derelict mining ship called the Ishimura. It seems that that CEC (Concordance Extraction Corporation), the company which owns and operates that mammoth ship, has lost contact with it. To make matters worse the ship, populated by 1,000 miners, scientists, and ship command types, is transmitting a distress call. So the CEC sends another ship, the CEC Kellion off to Aegis VII to see what's happening. The Ishimura is an interesting vessel, officially titled a \"Planet Cracker\". It cuts away a huge portion of the planetary landscape, pulls it up into orbit, and commences to refining these large chunks of rock into ore. And, predictably, a ship with this capability is going to be, by necessity, a rather large vessel by default.The Kellion carries a small complement of personnel who are there to find out why the ship went silent and are tasked with repairing it. But shortly after arrival the Kellion crashes inside the landing bay of the Ishimura due to a malfunction of the guidance control. Among the personnel on the Kellion is Isaac Clarke, the story's protaganist, and the guy you'll be playing as. Seems Isaac has a girlfriend on the Ishimura named Nicole, and Nicole sent him a strange little video before the ship went offline. Isaac also happens to be an engineer, and he has a real knack for taking existing mining tools and weapons and \"upgrading\" them to make them very palatable for use as weapons. From the time the Kellion crashes in the Ishimura's landing bay you'll know that something has gone horribly awry because the ship seems to be deserted. By the end of the first hour of play you'll wish it *was* deserted and filled with anything *but* the nasties that now inhabit it. By the time Chapter 8 rolled around (there are 12 total) all I wanted was to go home. I did not want to be on this ship at all and the feeling of constant dread that accompanies the game really amps up the fear factor considerably and in turn makes it that much more viscerally enjoyable.Dead Space isn't a FPS but rather a Third-Person Shooter (like Tomb Raider). The view the player has is over Isaac's right shoulder, which is a bit unusual in a game of this type. There are numerous weapons for use by the player, starting with the basic Plasma Cutter (a mining tool) to the Pulse Rifle (a military assault rifle) on up to flamethrowers and a nasty little weapon called the Ripper, which teleports a circular sawblade out about 10 feet where it hovers (and in turn shreds) any mutants that happen to be standing there. All weapons have a secondary fire mode. The Plasma Cutter can swivel 90 degrees allowing you better \"cutting\" angles for severing limbs off of baddies, while the Line Gun can fire off a mine which deals blast damage to any monsters standing in its radius. In addition to this Isaac gets a nifty little item called a Stasis Module, which can dramatically slow down moving objects (including monsters) so that they can be bypassed or taken apart at the player's leisure. Isaac also wears a specialized suit called a RIG, with armor plates and visual aids which let the player know his current health and how much juice he has for his Stasis Module. If all else fails Isaac can use two melee attacks, one in which he stomps his rather large, armored boot on the ground (which destroys little swarming enemies) and one in which he swings a big ol' haymaker at his opponent using his weapon. It's a lot to keep track of, but after the first chapter or two much of it becomes second nature.From the get go Dead Space makes you feel very alone. The Ishimura is a *huge* ship and it is filled with hundreds of nooks and crannies potentially filled with monsters that want to dismember you piece by piece. And the monsters (named Necromorphs) are actually dead members of the original crew. And since there were originally 1,000+ crew this means a whole pile of monsters. Necromorphs come in several varieties. The most common are former humans whose arms have been transformed into stabbing weapons with long spikes where the hands used to be, while others were transformed from infants who like to crawl on walls and shoot long range barbs at you. Others have been absorbed into the ship itself and blast explosive, sentient tentacle beasts in your direction. Early in the story you're separated from your compatriots and have to work entirely alone to repair the ship and bring its basic systems back online, and Necromorphs will drop in to visit at typically the worst possible times. There were moments in the game where I audibly yelped in surprise at my TV screen as a Necromorph dropped from the air vent above me, depositing a bundle of undead nastiness right in front of me. The game is loaded with moments of this type and I found I was unable to play more than 3-4 hours at a time because it was simply too much for my nerves to handle. This isn't helped by the ambient atmosphere, filled with sounds of metal clanging below you, or air vents hissing above. You're constantly looking around to see where the next attack is going to come, even when none does.The graphics for the game are really pretty and the Ishimura reminds me a great deal of the Nostromo from the movie Alien with its \"used future\" look. There's no doubt this is intentional and fans of Alien will probably react with the same degree of paranoia and fear inside the Ishimura. At various points around the ship the player can stock up on supplies from Stores, sort of an electronic vending machine, as well as Power Nodes, which are the critical component used to upgrade weapons and armor for use on the Work Bench. Enemies routinely drop ammunition and money (possibly what their previously living human incarnations were carrying at the time of their...necromorphing). By far the most precious commodity are the Power Nodes, and collecting them becomes a pastime of its own. They don't drop from monsters (except for one or two bosses) and can only be found in power boxes located sporadically throughout the ship, as well as being purchased for hefty sums from the Store. But even the humble Plasma Cutter can be come a customized killing machine if it is upgraded enough (the P.C. became my weapon of choice as a direct result of it).Dead Space also separates itself from the rest of the horror/shooter genre by including two very unique spins on the basic theme. The first is to be found in Zero-G operations. Newtonian physics, monsters, and loaded guns always make for an interesting experience, and the Zero-G segments tend to come across as a puzzle of sorts loaded with adrenaline. The second nuance is that there are numerous spots on the Ishimura where the hull is exposed to open space and requires that you use a finite source of oxygen in your suit. Once the O2 runs out so does your life. One can carry small oxygen canisters around with them, but they take up valuable space and when one isn't sure when these airless episodes are coming one may be disinclined to carry them. Fortunatley the player can upgrade the amount of air their RIG carries by upgrading it at the Work Bench using the aforementioned Power Nodes.Deep Space draws from many sources, but at the end of the day I was amazed at how very close in flavor it was to System Shock 2. In fact one can put the plotlines for both games side by side and say they're almost the same game, just with different names, monsters, and a few added bells and whistles to Dead Space. The plot for both involves a lone player tackling on a crew transformed after death and tackling a biological entity which controls the whole collective. Both plots involve a ship that is slowly turning into a biological organism and which have a device of some sort which instigates the whole problem in the first place (Shodan in SS2, the Marker in Dead Space). Both involve betrayal from trusted friends and sometimes even helping your enemies a bit when your purpose temporarily is in line with their goals. And both contain video and audio logs of deceased crewmembers providing hints on how to beat the Great Opponent, as well as backstory. However to say that Dead Space is a remake of System Shock 2 is a bit unfair to it too because many games have given nods to SS2 (Doom 3, Bioshock, and several others) in very similar ways. Dead Space also takes a healthy heap of atmosphere from movies like Event Horizon, the aforementioned Alien, Aliens, and yes, even a pinch from Night of the Living Dead. Thus I would sum up by saying that Dead Space is really a fusion of the best these games and movies have to offer presented to the player in a very cinematic way. It's literally like starring in your own sci-fi/horror film. And there may just be a moment that comes along and makes you soil yourself, as the title of my review indicates. Fortunately this didn't happen to me (like I'd admit it!) but I will say that when my dog came up behind me and put her cold, wet nose on my ankle at 2am I jumped 3 feet in the air. Now that, my friends, is a game!For the price Dead Space *cannot* be beaten. For a paltry $20 this is a horror/survival game that very much is worth every penny you'll pay for it. If you loved the System Shock series, Bioshock, Doom, Aliens versus Predator (PC games), and the like then you will want this game on your shelf. Now, off to go find a fresh pair of drawers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2010"}

Bullet time is the order of the day here, and although it isn't put to the best of use here compared to the Max Payne games, it still manages to be fun for a while.

The grindhouse-style presentation of the game however is just plain great though, and the graphics are solid as well.  There's no multiplayer to be found though, which Wet just seems like it could have been suited for.

It has artfully combined the game types of shooter and RPG, with more of a lean towards shooter. First and foremost understand that the game is not meant, nor designed, to be played like a standard first person shooter. Similar to old school \"dice\" based rpg's, each attack will have a success/failure percentage. Depending on your range, weapon, and skill will determine the ratio of success/failure. When you engage in combat you utilize what the game calls the V.A.T.S system, this literally \"stops time\" while you target a portion of their body (arms, legs, torso, head, weapon), each body part will display your percentage for a successful hit if you should choose to attack. Now rest assured that this combat system does not make for  \"slow\" rpg/turnbased style combat, the action is dizzingly fast. The manner in which you engage/defend against an enemy is extremely strategic, this is what I feel truly makes this a great game, the combat system balances action/strategy in a \"new\" and entertainingly \"fast\" way. The leveling system works nicely where you can improve your characters attributes based on your prefered playing style (mainly stealth v. combat strength).  Furthermore the game has excellent graphics, and a well thought out, well executed story that kept me very interested from begining to end. The main quest took me about 25+ hours to complete, and I look forward to performing the side quests. The reason why I have docked .5 a star is because as catchy/mood enhancing the music is, there are only about 20 tracks which do get a bit repetitive for such a lengthy game. Overall this is an excellent game, that has taken risks to create a \"new\" gaming experiences, with nearly flawless results. I have a XBOX 360 arcade (bought in Oct of 08) and only had the game freeze once in the 25+ hours of play, I have experienced zero of the bugs that the one star reviews reflect, which logically points to the hardware rather than the software as the reason behind all that. If you enjoy action games and rpg's the purchase of this game is an absolute no brainer. Furthermore I look forward to \"Fallout 3 DLC\", which are downloadable expansions exlcusive to XBOX 360.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2008"}

I just restarted it for maybe the dozenth time and found myself doing things and making choices which I had never done before. I've also found new elements in the game each time I've played it.If you play F3 the first time without ever having read a walkthrough or a WIKI online, you will have a lot more difficulties just due to lack of knowledge of just the basic strategies of the game. In addition, there are specifics which you have no way of knowing in advance, such as which found items can be sold/traded and which need to be held for later use, or which side quests you should tackle first. You can learn all of this on your own -- it will just take a lot more playthroughs.Even after a dozen times through F3, I still have to get help online once in a while when looking for something or for getting around an area. Use your favorite online search engine to look for \"Fallout 3 WIKI\" to get such help.I gave F3 4 stars overall because getting around in buildings, tunnels, and debris-blocked streets takes up way too much time and is too frustrating and doesn't add any fun whatsoever to the game (IMO). The map system in F3 (for inside buildings or other specific areas) is only slightly better than none at all. On a scale of 1-10, I give F3's map system a 1 and Bioshock's a 10.Despite this, F3 is the best game of its type, in my opinion.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2009"}

Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look.

Blending unique gameplay, humorous characters and interactions, and the aforementioned graphics,Munch's Oddyseesimply feels unlike any other game in the 2001 console gaming lineup. Players control two characters in the game: Munch, a wheelchair-bound hero, and Abe, a character some gamers will recognize from previous Oddworld games. Their goal is to find and free the Mudokon queen, keeper of the remaining eggs of an endangered species.Both characters feature unique talents that, via a tag-team style of play, propel the player through the game. For instance, Abe can climb and jump to reach new areas, as well as temporarily possess an enemy's soul via a chant. The web-footed Munch can swim to new areas and, when on the roll in his wheelchair, use his sonar plug to control machinery remotely. Saving an entire race also requires a coordinated effort on everyone's part. To get the job done quickly, players can deliver verbal commands to kinsmen. They'll gladly greet you (in a witty manner), then gang up on a mean-spirited enemy or accomplish difficult tasks for you. As with the rest of the game world, the finely detailed characters and environments, as well as a refreshing charm, draw you into an experience with the quality of a Pixar film.

{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"Tobie \"broadbandfreak\"","summary":"The Best Halo Game","reviewText":"**Spoilers** The best Halo game of the series. Halo 1-3 consisted of pushing back the outbreak of The Flood, while Halo 4 takes us down a darker path. Encountering the Prometheans and one of their commanders, The Didact, become the major enemy of the game.I like Halo 4 over its previous predecessors because it really gives light on the story. Halo 1-3 had major loopholes in them for people who did not read the novels, and I was left to having to read online forums to fill in those gaps. Halo 4 helps keep a solid story going. There are times where I was wondering about certain facets, but as the story progressed, it shed light on those questions that felt unanswered.Halo 4 is a solid 10/10, and is the best FPS I have yet to play. The soundtrack is marvelous. The graphics engine 343 used really showcases what the Xbox 360 is really capable of - it reminded me of the CryEngine used in Crysis 1&2. I never noticed a drop in framerate, and the Xbox 360 never once froze during the hours of gameplay. The controller mapping took some getting use to. While the main buttons were still the same, a few of the extra ability buttons were changed around. I did not play Multiplayer since I do not have a paid Xbox Live! account. Aspects of the story reminded me of Dead Space - Dead Space had the Marker, while Halo 4 had The Composer.Put it simply, the game contained elements that I had never seen Halo use before. Master Chief gains suit abilities that reminded me of when I played Metroid Prime, and the enemy models used were similar to the ones seen in Metroid Prime as well. One of the suit abilities obtained was the Promethean Vision, which was a heat tracking visor for the suit - awesome, loved using it when I could. You also get a chance to pilot a robot, which reminded me of MechAssault from the original Xbox.Finally, and I said it before, the story is what really allowed this game to blossom. I had the chance to see the true relationship between Master Chief and Cortana. As Cortana begins to lose her sanity, I saw a side of Master Chief that he was concerned about her and getting her home safely before the damage was beyond repair. Cortana becomes the pillar of morality in the game, which is ironic because she is an AI - it made me recall the novel &#34;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&#34; Cortana perseveres and remains faithful to Master Chief while talking about how bad everyone has treated him over the years and how he deserves more credit than what has been given to him. Master Chief is a creature of war; he does his duty with no emotion, but I saw him become emotional in Cortana's conflict with herself. It gave tones of a love story, only it was platonic and transcended levels of transhumanism. The sacrifice that she makes to keep him alive is what makes it all the more touching.All in all, Halo 4 can stand on its own two feet just fine, but those who have played 1-3 will have a deeper appreciation for the storyline. I read articles that this is the first game of a new trilogy of Halo games (5-6 will be released on the Xbox One), so I am looking forward to playing those when they are released, especially since 343 Industries kicked major butt with this release. Most games I've played with multiple sequels have a tendency of a gradual decline, but this game sets the bar to a whole new level.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00EI4V3FU","description":"","reviewerName":"Maek","summary":"Do NOT bother","reviewText":"Seriously, don't bother.  I found a budget headset to be intriguing, but knowing Turtle Beach's past track record for charging exorbitant prices and failing to deliver at that price point, I was skeptical.And I was right to be skeptical.  Other reviewers have complained that the volume was simply too low on the headset, even on maximum.  So that's the first place I went to on this and man, the other reviewers were not joking.  It's almost inaudible at maximum and anything less than maximum is a jocular attempt at seeing how good your hearing is.  If this was a hearing test, then I'm clearly deaf.What compounds the problem of low volume broadcast is the fact that it has an open ear design.  Yes, you read that correctly.  In order to \"immerse\" yourself in the game, the Turtle Beach designers have decided to employ the headphone portion as an over-ear design with a slotted opening around the perimeter of the speaker so you can still hear outside of it, presumably so you can hear chat audio on the headset speaker in addition to the game audio from your own home entertainment center.  With the low volume already broadcast by this headset, it's practically drowned out by the gameplay itself.  Great concept, poor execution...simply not good.Chat works well, but what's the point of having a one-sided \"sorry, I can't hear you\" conversation?The only saving grace on this headset is its ability to plug directly into the PS4 controller.  I found that to be nice and easy...I just wished that I could actually hear the dang thing.Now for PC buyers, beware.  They say it works on the PC, but there isn't a wireless nor USB component to this headset.  So unless you actually have a headset jack specifically set up to both receive and transmit audio (i.e., the headset can accommodate a 3-striped 3.5 mm jack, not just 2-striped regular headphone jacks for audio only), you're out of luck.Overall, however, I can't fathom recommending this headset.  At this price point, you're better off with something from Logitech, although I'm not sure if it works with PS4 or not.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYDEQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Gearhead Mania","summary":"Cross between Test Drive Unlimited, Dirt 2/3, and Forza","reviewText":"Forza HorizonAfter reading numerous reviews for Horizon, I played the game thinking it would be what was described as an \"expansion\" for Forza 4 that was plagued with pay-to-play add-ons or extras. What I found was a game that is quite stand-alone. I can't see Turn 10 or any developer somehow tacking this onto Forza 4 to make Horizon an expansion pack. The gameplay is quite different for one, and the physics feel different. At high speeds, most cars just start to feel loose and out of control with the smallest of bumps while in Forza 4, most cars feel tight and tend to understeer although there are some exceptions.The physics for Horizon feel flawed, and the car specs are out of touch with reality. For example, I drove a Dodge Charger SRT-8 and it felt slow like it took forever to reach 100 mph while in real life, it would be difficult to keep it below 100 mph. The Ford Raptor in the game can easily maintain speeds over 100 mph while in reality, the Raptor is governed at 100 mph as are the other F-150 pickup trucks due to limitations of the driveline and tires.Dak the garage operator sounds like a moron at the beginning when he tells a NPC that the \"fancy shocks\" on the Mercedes are garbage and that the NPC needs to switch to something more familiar to him. The \"Fancy shocks\" are probably the magnetorheological dampers that automatically adjust to changing road conditions within milliseconds. Dak sounds like the typical quasi-gearhead that pounds his chest and proclaims adjustable twin-tube shocks to be superior to everything on the market whereas the \"fancy\" shocks can be custom programmed to adjust to varying conditions on the fly giving you essentially unlimited compression/rebound profiles on the fly or available for different racing conditions. Even motorcycles like the Ducati Multistrada has the Skyhook adjustable system, the Panigale 1199 has electronic adjustable forks and rear shock, and the BMW S1000RR HP4 has electronic adjustable suspension.The feel of Horizon is quite similar to Test Drive Unlimited, where you drive around and can challenge computer racers. However, the other aspects of Horizon feel like a mix of Forza 4 (graphics, menu interface, store/garage layout) and Dirt 2 or Dirt 3. No one will think Forza Horizon is a realistic racing simulation, but it is a lot of fun but isn't dumbed out like Need for Speed.My biggest complaint has to be the fact not all of the buttons can be remapped. I prefer my \"Y\" to be upshift and \"B\" to be downshift, just like in MotoGP 09/10, Forza 3, Forza 4, etc... however, Forza Horizon decides to limit these options and defaulted to using X or B for shifting. As a result, I stopped manually shifting and switched it to automatic for a meager penalty in bonus points. I tried all of the layouts and couldn't find one I liked. It would be really nice if I could custom map each and every button!!Yes, there are a lot of add-ons and extra cars/packs that cost Microsoft Points. This was the case with Forza 3 and Forza 4, especially with Forza 4. This is an easy way for publishers and developers to recoup the development costs, and I notice that they tend to slow down the \"Platinum\" or \"Game of the year\" release of the games that usually include all of the DLC. I was able to get the Rally Expansion for free because I ordered Horizon from Amazon, but I probably won't be buying any DLC since many of the extra cars just aren't worth it.Overall: 4/5 - fun game to play, but it wasn't designed to be the next Forza motorsport game. It is a cross between Test Drive Unlimited, Dirt, and Forza. The physics are a far-cry from realistic, and the gameplay can get repetitive. I hate how I cannot remap all of the buttons, I want to keep driving it in manual shift mode but I want the upshift and downshift buttons to be a certain configuration and not restricted to the different layouts in the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2013"}

It had great graphics, sounds, and decent controls and really drew you into the world but the main characters were so off-putting and unlikeable and the situations border-line realistic it was hard to have fun playing it. When did rockstar decide to take itself so seriously? Red Dead Redemption carries alot of this over making it a somewhat better and somewhat worse game.The story of Red Dead Redemption is a huge improvment over GTA4 with more stylish cut-scenes and a more likeable protagonist. The story flows alot better too and while it does shorten the gameplay a bit (I beat it at around 17 hours) it feels like everything you do ties into the bigger plot. It does stick with GTA4's more 'realistic' sensabilities but I can forgive it because Rockstar actually made this narrative alot more compelling to play and added so many different gameplay elements with mini games and side-quests you'll be sucked in for hours.The graphics of this game are phenomenal...when they work. The horizon's look beautiful and the weather effects and motion capture some of the best I've seen in a video game. Unfortunatly there's so much screen-tearing and loading that it's hard to get sucked into it. Dont' get me wrong it's not as bad as say Mass-Effect or even Fallout 3 but when Rockstar obviously put so much effort into the look of the game (and alot of the immersion rely's on this) it's kind of disappointing to see the lack of polish.The controls of Red Dead Redemption are a mixed bag. Walking around on foot and shooting are fine (though WHY are we forced to use the R2 and L2 Buttons to shoot/stab/punch? Why can't we map our own controls?) but when you get into lasso-ing and horse riding the controls get sloppy. Just riding a horse in this game is simple enough though does require a bit of getting used to, but if you're trying to to something specific like lasso or herding you'll be frustrated....VERY frustrated. I realise herding cattle in real life is a pain in the ass but even Twilight Princess's mini game was easier than this sloppy mess!So while I think Red Dead Redemption is less than perfect and could've used more polish to smooth out the controls and graphics it is still an engaging experience with a great story and atmosphere. With so few western games out there Red Dead Redemption is an easy purchase for genre and sandbox fans.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2010"}

Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission. Train and equip your team to survive insurmountable odds.Explore the Galaxy- Scan planets to uncover unique secret missions in theMass Effectuniverse.Integration with OriginalMass Effect- Players of the firstMass Effectcan import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. New players will find a thrilling stand-alone adventure awaits them, a polished and action packed journey that surpasses the first game in nearly every possible way.Intense Third-Person Combat- Increased intensity with precision shooter controls to let you control the action and overcome insurmountable odds.New Damage System- New location based damage system allows for targeting of key weak points, blasting off limbs, igniting enemies, or cripple and disable enemy troops.Character Customization- Choose a player class, customize your appearance, and tailor your own abilities and strengths. As you progress, so do Shepard&rsquo;s abilities.Improved Dialogue Mechanic- Improved NPC conversation system where Commander Shepard can take matters into your own hands &ndash; interrupting or using force to get the answer required.","reviewerName":"Karl Grosvenor","summary":"Pretty good","reviewText":"I bought this game because it's predecessor was so utterly fantastic,but although I find it enjoying it doesn't come close to the original,it's more linear,has much less exploration,less customisation it has a far more basic leveling system which I hate,also I hate the thermal clips,it has a weaker story-line and the music isn't as good,but if you're more into shooting than doing the usual running around exploring and customising then you will enjoy it more,for me though it's inferior,although vastly better than number 3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000F1YGMM","description":"Hunt like a pack, or die like a dog, in the Xbox 360's first mech warfare game. / Rated T: Teen Incredibly realistic next-gen effects Hundreds of items to earn","reviewerName":"J.S. Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"Thoroughly trained in English but all I can say is \"Eh...\"","reviewText":"I have been piloting 100-ton \"Mechs\" in fictitious environments for over a decade.  I began playing Battletech on a ~50 Mhz Pentium in a \"lush\" 16-color setting.Since then I have customized and outfitted hundreds of mechs within every title of the \"Mechwarrior\" mech-combat series.  I know the intricasies of mechanized combat.And yet still all I can say about Chromehounds is \"Eh.\"  The mechs are OK, the graphics are OK, the gameplay is OK, the options are OK...  It's all just... ...\"Eh!\"Chromehounds leaves the player to pretty much \"figure it out.\"  The instruction manual skims over a little bit of everything.  It's up to you to realize that the mech you build in single player is different from the mech you build online.  It's also up to you to learn that each country involved in the fictitious \"Neroimus War\" have their own parts, and to own all the parts, you must at some point participate in the online war from each country's angle.  It's also up to you to learn just what the various parts can (or mostly can't) do.  It's up to you to learn things like how to tell which of the three enemy Headquarters you must destroy (hint: it's the one with the enemy's flag painted on the side walls.)  It's up to you to figure out how to design a mech, and how to deal with all of the frustrating menus and the inability to move various parts without first deleting them and then reinstalling them elsewhere.Simply put, I've logged over 20 hours into this game and still don't feel like I understand it.  The online Neroimus War seems like it has amazing potential, but if it really does, I can't figure out how to exploit it!  I see other online members donating money in increments of ten million dollars, yet I have no idea what the purpose of doing so is except to earn an Xbox 360 achievement.  We elected a president, but I don't know what this fictitious character's purpose is.The quality of Chromehounds relies solely on the people you play with or against over the Xbox Live service.  I joined a squad (a requirement to engage in the war) and was hopeful as one member online explained to me the roles of the other [human] members.  A few days later when we were all online together, I quickly realized that I was surrounded by high school kids who had no concept of organized, strategic combat as one member raved about how \"cool\" we all looked with matching camouflage.  I shot him.Will you like Chromehounds?  Well, are you a do-it-yourself, mercenary-minded mech combat guru looking for the \"next big thing?\"  Probably not.  Are you looking for a new twist in team combat and only enjoy playing online?  Probably - for a little bit at least.  You'll learn quickly that the game gets repetitive even online, and that you make the same amount of money whether you're going 6-on-6 against other human competitors, or 1-on-1 against a computer-controlled AI opponent.  The effect on the tide of the war is the same in those conditions as well.Lastly, those looking for some quick Xbox 360 achievements - keep looking.  20 Hours in the game has earned me around 100 points.  Many of the remaining achievements are based on very long-term goals such as deploying on 300 missions, traveling 100,000 miles, or unique accomplishments such as destroying a number of headquarters without engaging the enemy, capturing a number of radio towers, etc.  They come merely with massive repetition, and a boatload of boredom to boot.Extra note:  The online issues that plagued Chromehounds from start have apparently been resolved.  I purchased the game in April of 2008 and with the exception of a few day-long breaks in play for server upgrades, have had no issues with the online portions of Chromehounds.  No crashes, no freezing, and knock-on-wood, no \"Rings of Death\"","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2008"}

I haven't experienced too bad of camera work. If i do i just push the button that will re-adjust it and that usually does the trick.This game is a lot like Mario 64 (go through the doors play each level 6 times to get all the stars doing different things for different stars) only instead of door ways you are going to the same galaxy. Thats what i liked about Mario 64. Different challenges on the same levels. Each area of the \"house\" (there is a kitchen, bedroom and such as they call it) has 5 galaxies some are \"bonus\" type where you get to do just one challenge. Like racing on a Ray through water in the sky. So if you didn't like Mario 64 you may not like this one because it's very very much the same.If you play it right you can get to the point of where you no longer really need to go to the same galaxy over and over to beat Bowser or Bowser Jr. That way you have more rooms of the \"house\" open as to not get bored playing the same levels over and over getting all the stars.There are commets that come into play making the level \"harder\" (giving your enemies more speed, or time frame and such) if you are standing on the main floor right at the start to your left there is a star that for 20 star bits will move the commet for you so if you don't want to play that round with the commet there you don't have to. But if you move it you won't get that \"extra\" star from beating a level with a commet. Up to you.After awhile it's kind of the same thing over and over, but like i said if you open up multiple rooms you can scurry around and do different galaxies for a long time. Mario is all about being the hero so why not make him save everyone? Given games are like movies you want to like the story line...so many people in distress for Mario to save.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2007"}

{"product_name":"B004P6IVPQ","description":"As Vincent, a man recently succumbed to the irresistible beauty of the game's titular diversion, players find themselves swept into a treacherous love triangle. Catherine's core themes-those of free will, of the delicate nature of relationships and the choices we make within them, marry perfectly with the intense, terror-filled gameplay that serves to accurately reflect Vincent's growing sense of anxiety. It is an experience wholly unlike any to come before it, and is certain to leave gamers talking and thinking about Vincent's tribulations long after the credits have rolled.","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"One of Atlus' best games yet; a serious game-of-the-year contender","reviewText":"Catherine is one of the most unique games that I have had the distinct pleasures of playing in a very, very long time. Made by the Atlus Persona team, the same people that brought you the critical darling Shin Megami Tensai rpgsPersona 3andPersona 4. Catherine may have the same awesome style and uniqueness that those games had, but it is an entirely different beast of a video game, one that combines several unlikely game genres into one. In Catherine, you have a puzzle game, a dating simulator, an arcade game, and a few other minor things that all add up to a dynamic, changing game.The story in Catherine is by far its greatest aspect. You've probably read the general premise of Catherine many times, but I'll put it simply here now. Vincent is a 32-year-old who is struggling with where he wants to go with his life. He's been dating a beautiful, responsible girl named Katherine for five years, who wants the relationship to get more serious through marriage and settling down in a family and he doesn't know what to do. Commitment scares him. To make his situation worse, he wakes up one morning next to a blue-eyed, blond bombshell named Catherine who only desires fun and thrills, and she wants him all to herself (and threatens to kill him if he cheats on her. She's crazy...). While struggling to make a decision about where his life is going, Vincent has to deal with the fact that he has supposedly cheated on his girlfriend (he doesn't remember anything about his nights with Catherine). On top of that fiasco, every night Vincent is plagued with a nightmare that he shares with many men who are in eerily similar circumstances to his in the city. If he or any of these poor, middle-aged saps with commitment/faithfulness issues die in their nightmare, they are found a dead husk in the morning, and the intrigue just grows from here.Whew, it's sort of hard to pack all of the essential information about the premise quickly, isn't it? Trust me when I say that the story only gets more fascinating and gripping from there, and it goes quite far by the time you finish the game. Every single character in Catherine is exceptionally well-written, likable, and excellently voiced. I found myself loving pretty much every main, supporting, and secondary character, as well as the fringe ones you never quite figure out the mystery behind. Also worth special mention is that the characters grow and change throughout the game because of the events of the story, lending a sense of real growth and dynamic realism to the writing. How many games do we play and the characters stay static despite all of the life-altering events that happen to them in the story? Catherine's characters are so realistic and well-written. There are also eight different endings, with three of them being \"true\" and they're all equally spectacular. I know I will really sound like a broken record by the time I'm done here, but I honestly cannot praise the writing in this game enough. It is worth mentioning all on its own and really goes a long way to making this a five-star game.It's rare you play a game that encourages such introspection and really makes you meditate on your own values, beliefs, and what is right and wrong like Catherine does. How many video games tackle issues such as cheating on your significant other, what constitutes betrayal in a relationship and who really is at fault, whether freedom or order are more important in life, the value of committing to someone you love that may not be your \"soulmate,\" and the list goes on and on? More importantly though, not only does Catherine tackle these sort of deep themes and subjects, it does so with extreme aplomb, without ever once resorting to the typical Japanese/Anime tendency to be preachy and shove a certain viewpoint down your throat. That's a huge plus for me. It's very mature, neutral, and well-grounded. I bow to Persona Atlus Team for their incredible writing and focus in this game.The art design is spectacular as well. I personally enjoy anime myself, in part because of my wife's influence, who loves it so much. The game features cinematic portions handled by Studio 4C, a reputable anime studio, and they are all awesome. This game would easily be my favorite anime if it were a TV series, and the series were like the cinematics. Catherine's in-game graphics are awesome as well, detailed despite being in the anime style and are truly a sight to behold. The character's expressions are priceless and really do a fantastic job of conveying their inner feelings without feeling overwrought like many animes tend to do (this also includes the awesome voice acting). The daytime environments, mainly the bar, really scream detail and have an awesome charm to them that puts you there. In the nightmare world, the graphics are suitably creepy and bizarre without being totally off-putting.All of this also extends to the sound design, which really compliments the uniqueness of the visuals and story. I already praised the dialogue writing in the game, but it would be all for naught if the voice actors didn't do a good job. Well, worry not, because they do fantastic. In fact, I know for a fact I've heard all of them in anime series before, so they're clearly veterans in this style. Normally, anime entertainment can really turn that \"cheesy knob\" up to eleven in the voice acting/dialogue and sound design departments, but Catherine's fictional universe and characters feel just as real, down-to-earth, and relatable as games likeMass Effect 2do. The soundtrack can't go unmentioned either, as the eclectic combination of classical music, smooth jazz, and awesome rocking tunes add up to what is my favorite soundtrack of the year (up there withPortal 2and Bastion, at least). As of right now, the first-printing of the game comes with its own soundtrack, which is awesome. Thank you Atlus, for spoiling us even further!The gameplay is really strange in Catherine, but works very well. The nightmare levels are essentially block puzzle games, where you have to push, pull, scoot, climb on, link, etc, blocks in order to get Vincent, who is clad in boxers, has sheep horns, and is holding his pillow, up the nightmare block tower to avoid falling to his doom. On occasion there are boss levels which ramp up the already challenging, intellectually stimulating puzzle-play up to even more adrenaline pumping highs. This game is not easy by the way. Even on easy, it will give you a run for your money. I'd recommend playing on easy your first time through just to get the most out of the story. Later, up the difficulty and playing the game to get a higher score is an addicting blast, and very reminiscent of run arcade games. In between nightmare levels, Vincent can talk to other men, who all appear as sheep, about their problems, attempt to encourage them lest they die and disappear from the game altogether, and learn new block-puzzle techniques. It's all extremely well done. The pacing in Catherine is fantastic. Much like another exceptional puzzle game,Portal 2, Catherine introduces new mechanics nearly every level rather than just making it arbitrarily harder, and this keeps the game feeling wholly fresh throughout the entire experience. I never once grew bored of any gameplay mechanic and was equally entertained throughout the campaign, and I really have to praise Catherine's developers for this.The day-time sequences comprise of Vincent drinking at the bar with his closest friends. From here, you can receive and answer texts from both Katherine/Catherine, drink and hear fascinating trivia about your drinks, talk with your awesome friends, as well as visit with others in the bar, choose various tracks on a jukebox, to to the bathroom to look at sexy, scandalous pics from Catherine, and even play a retro styled arcade machine meant to help you get better at the game's block puzzle gameplay. All of these are very well implemented. Like other Atlus Persona Team games, time is a factor. A customer may say totally different things depending on when you talk to them. Some time passes by, maybe the alcohol has loosened their tongue and made them more open to share details with you. Most bar patrons are familiar sheep from your nightmares and have complex problems that you can help them through. You can actually save these peoples' lives that way, and some may even die and disappear from the bar and the dreams if you miss them even once or miss a critical cue. This gives the game a sense of consequence and impact that really makes you care about the world. It also gives the game a beautiful sense of realism that is missing too often from games. You can't make a wrong decision in the game, you can't manipulate the morality bar, and consequences of your actions stay until the end, of which there are eight different ones. It's awesome.For me personally, I think Catherine is a definite game-of-the-year contender. It's a game that executes all its different styles of gameplay, even those I don't normally care for, so well that I enjoyed every single second of my time with it. I played this game all the way through my first time in two gaming sessions, and took about 10-12 hours. My wife was huddled up next to me the entire time, her attention firmly fixated on the story at hand, while giving suggestions during difficult puzzle sequences. Any game that bings me closer to my wife always gets an extra thumbs up from me. I know for a fact she loves Catherine just as much as I do. I would eagerly play through the puzzles trying to get a high score (something I normally don't care about), just to devour more of the (dare I say) near-perfect story. Catherine is a game with a story so good, you just have to experience it for yourself to see what I mean. This game addresses deep, complex issues without ever sounding preachy. I love that. Instead, it just presents a very realistic story with multiple endings, some of the best writing in any video game of recent memory, all while being an extremely fun cocktail mix of excellently-implemented video game styles, all of which has an insanely high amount of replayability. I know this review is pretty much wall-to-wall praise, but in this case, it actually applies. Catherine is amazing. Buy it, take in the awesome story, and welcome to the awesomeness of the Golden Playhouse!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2011"}

The dual screens, voice recognition, WiFi capability and touch screen have been included to give gamers new ways of playing and interacting with their games.  Games such as Wario Ware Touched, Yoshi Touch & Go and Feel The Magic are on the cutting edge of gaming, pushing boundries and expanding what we think of videogames.  And they are only the tip of the iceberg.  It's an exciting time for gamers in general and Nintendo DS gamers in particular.I've had my DS since launch and have been enjoying it's fresh take on gaming ever since.  The integrated PictoChat is a fun diversion in airports and being able to play multiplayer games without wires is a blessing that only those who have been teathered together can fully appreciate.  Battery life is long and quick to recharge.  Some people have complained that the screns are sometimes hard to see, but I have not experienced that problem.  In fact I find both screens easier to view than the GBA-SP.The only complaint I really have with the DS is that the stylus is a bit to short for my hands.  But I've found that a good Plam stylus works just fine with the DS and suits my hands much better.  Aside from that I'm enjoying the revolution that the DS is bringing about.

I've never played the guitar but always thought someday my son may enjoy playing it when he gets a bit older.  Well we've played Guitar Hero and Band Hero on the PS3 for years now and really enjoyed it.  I'm pretty good at that guitar on there if I do say so myself.  I've always thought about that guitar sitting in my basement collecting dust and wondered if I'd be any good at it if I actually had any clue how to play it.So, along comes Rocksmith 2014.  I thought what a great way to give this guitar a whirl.  I'd never pay for lessons and didn't really know how to go about learning to play on my own.  I wiped the dust off, set up the game and gave it a shot.  Wow!  I can't believe how much I'm enjoying this.  I haven't spent a ton of time on it yet but I've learned quite a bit already and it's really easy to get started.  I really like the amount of songs that are included for free and the ability to download more if desired.  I think it's a great mix of songs too.I like how you can learn to play right from the comfort of your living room in private.  Maybe someday I'll share my new found hobby with my family and friends but for now I'm gonna keep on practicing.  I'm having fun learning and feel as though I'm actually doing pretty decent.I would recommend Rocksmith 2014.

{"product_name":"B002I0KOSI","description":"","reviewerName":"M. MacMahon","summary":"Some Bad Design Decisions Can't Cloud Infinite's Excellence","reviewText":"Infinite is a \"Shock\" game through and through. If you liked System Shock 2 or Bioshock 2 you should have a lot of fun here, despite some issues. Combat is much improved and really fun throughout. Lots of the same old guns and powers but with new twists like the skyline system and clothing options. Story is social commentary done really well, a specialty of the series, and it keeps you moving from one Disney World style set-piece to another to see what's next. The core of these games is exploration and Infinite doesn't disappoint, you'll be thrilled to see what's around every corner.Faults of the game are rooted in a few poor design decisions. For one, no quick-save. In an exploration-focused game you really want quick-save so you can explore, save, then start combat. I can;t tell you how many times something happened that made me reload the game only to have to open all those desks and barrels all over again. Secondly the checkpoint system is poor and infrequent. The game warns you when you go to quit about how long it has been since the game saved and numerous times I was looking at losing 30 minutes of progress if I quit, despite having just completed a section or sat through a cutscene. Adults have responsibilities developers, we sometimes need to quit the game right away.Last fault is one a lot of people might disagree with but I find having a constant AI companion a little annoying. Yes Elizabeth is a good character but she still talks over other dialogue, rushes me when I'm exploring and distracts me in various ways. Also it seems like every couple minutes she is throwing me money or something else, which grows repetitive. It's not the end of the world by any means but I found myself annoyed by her presence as often as I was charmed by it.Bioshock Infinite is the ultimate in Disney World exploration and modern FPS combat, however. The annoyances listed above, especially the save system, knock a star off the score but don't change the fact you need to own this game if you like games of this type. It's the pinnacle of the genre in visuals and story, and a great ride.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"Casual MMO player's dream come true","reviewText":"I've played a lot of online games over the years, and used to consider myself pretty hardcore. Now I've got a job, got a family, and well... have grown out of it a bit. Not totally, but enough that I simply don't spend hours every day (or week... or even month) on games. For the record, I know what an MMO is- I've played WoW, Aion, Rift, SWTOR- gotten geared, raided, PvP'd, even been a guild leader. So yes, I've been there and done that. I also played GW1 since beta, though to be honest I never saw that game as a 'real' MMO since almost everything was instanced with a very small player limit. Like GW1, GW2 definitely favors players that don't have all day to play and grind.So what's a casual player? I like to define it as someone that's got a life, because quite frankly it's difficult to be hardcore unless you don't. Unlike most other MMOs (including all the aforementioned titles) there's not much competition for loot, no large time-intensive raids, and little need to grind either experience or gear. You can PvP at any time and any level, and the game auto-scales you up. Higher level players can do lower content or help their friends, and it scales them down so they still get exp and loot. Even in terms of abilities, it only takes a few minutes to acquire all basic skills- which are tied to weapons. If you helped in a kill or event, you get the reward- simple as that.This isn't to say that you don't grind at all, but that it's far less of a factor than in other games. You simply can't become overpowering in this game; there's no ultra uber legendary lewts that let you 1 shot anyone or grief players endlessly in PvP because they're hopelessly outmatched. Don't get me wrong- if you're a good player you can still dominate someone that isn't, but you'll have to work at it. You can't just push the 1 key and /lol at them. If you don't have a lot of time, you can still get good gear. In fact given enough random spontaneous play you can in fact get the best gear. Oh, yeah, and there's no subscription fee, so it's not like you're paying every day you don't log in. Generally speaking, GW2 is a very forgiving game and doesn't waste a lot of your time. You can teleport to any waypoint for a nominal fee, instantly. There's gathering and crafting, but you don't have to spend hours and hours doing it to get something useful. There's instances and PvP, but you don't have to do any of them to get geared. You can log in, run around and explore a bit, maybe do some story quests or events, log off a half hour later and still advance and feel like you've accomplished something. Very few other MMOs let you do this- at the minimum most force you to run instances to get anything that isn't absolute garbage. Despite it's name, GW2 also really appeals to lone wolves that want to just run around on their own, yet also like to see a persistent world with a bunch of real people in it. You don't need to join a guild, and aside from a handful of perks it isn't even that useful.For those that DO have all day and want to be rewarded for grinding... you are to a point, but it's pretty similar to the original GW in that aspect as well. Levels do get you additional traits which make you a bit more powerful, but not overwhelmingly so. You can also unlock new skills, but since you're limited in how many you can have on your bar at once, and none of them are overpowering, it doesn't matter much. You can grind for items with cool looks, new dye colors, titles, and other vanity fluff. Cool, but it isn't going to give you the power to 1 shot everything. If you can deal with not having an IWIN button, then this won't bother you. If you want to become all-powerful, then this might... but then again it might not. On the surface it sounds less cool, but I've seen games that allow ridiculously overpowered characters to mingle with noobs, and it's not much fun for either side.Make no mistake though, all this doesn't mean the game is a PVE faceroll where you just beat down mobs and pickup loot. There are quite a few events and encounters that will test your skills (or require assistance). If you don't know what you're doing, don't be surprised if you die a lot. The good news there is you really aren't penalized much for that- you just have to pick a point to respawn at and possibly repair your armor. The costs are very reasonable, unlike certain other games. One interesting thing about GW2 is that there's no healing classes- everyone has healing skills and can pretty much keep themselves up. Some builds are more party oriented, but mainly just in buffs. This means you really don't need a 'balanced' party for team play and aren't stuck spamming for hours looking for a healbot.A few other interesting notes: there are far more area 'events' than quests, and you find most of them by just running around. Each race has a different story quest line and starting area, and the areas are very attractive and distinct. The graphics, sound, and effects are all excellent- as good as any I've seen in an MMO. There's also a nice amount of character customization, without going totally and bizarrely overboard. Overall, the game rewards exploration and is pretty easy to pick up and play, but a bit harder to master. It is essentially GW1 with more MMO aspects: exploration, higher level cap, somewhat more meaningful armor stats, a few more skills and combos, crafting, a lot less and less restrictive instancing, and a much larger world. There's also some things that GW1 sorely lacked, like mail and an auction house. Overall, I like this game and would say it really appeals to those that simply can't play all day and night. As someone who once did exactly that, it might also appeal to someone that does and is simply sick of grinding.Pro:Limited grindingChar customization and race-specific content is well doneCan progress despite spontaneous and low time spentGraphics and sound are amazingRewards exploration, and has a lot to exploreAllows both veterans and new players to enjoy groupingAlso appeals to lonersNo subscription feesCon:Not much in the way of 'endgame' contentYou can't become overpowered, if that's your goal in lifeSomewhat limited total skills & number of skills active at one time","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2012"}

Super Princess Peach for the DS finds the usual damsel in distress in the hero role this time as she's on a mission to save Mario and Luigi from evil clutches.  The game looks like a typical 2-D side scroller featuring Peach, but there is a bit of a change up in gameplay thanks to some of Peach's special powers.  Peach has something called a vibe meter, which depending on how you use it can perform different abilities based on her emotions.  While this adds a nice new dimension to the tried but true gameplay, Super Princess Peach fails to live up to the Super Mario Bros. level of excellence.  This is because the game is way too easy to breeze through, and the levels themselves are relatively simple to navigate as well.  The lack of challenge hurts the game, but there's enough redeeming factors here that help make it a very good game.  After defeating Bowser, bonus levels are unlocked that do offer a bit of challenge that add to an already solid game length, and the game has a charming, colorful look to it to boot.  All that help elevate Super Princess Peach above the pack of side scrolling adventures for the DS, but the game is ultimately disappointing for hardcore Mario fans or gamers looking for something challenging.  All in all, Super Princess Peach is fun and charming platformer while it lasts, but don't expect another Mario Bros. game here.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2007"}

Garrelts","summary":"Glitches, Glitches, Everywhere","reviewText":"Mercenaries 2 is the poster child for a flawed gem. Whether or not you can tolerate the flaws will dramatically impact your view of the game. That's part of the reason why review scores for Mercs 2 are all over the spectrum.The premise of Mercs 2 is relatively simple; this game isn't about story per se but does feature a somewhat entertaining if not clich&eacute;d storyline. You'll start by picking one of 3 available Mercenaries hired to rescue a certain General by a rich Venezuelan. Shortly thereafter you're betrayed by your employer and promptly shot in the butt. Thus begins your quest for revenge and the basic premise for Mercenaries 2.Situated in Venezuela the environments are varied; everything from cityscapes of Caracas and Maracaibo to the jungled mountains of the Amazons. The bonus of all the nice scenery is that much of it is completely destructible. And that ability to wantonly destroy your surrounds is what ultimately Mercs 2 is all about. Graphics are largely improved from Mercenaries original outing. Though the graphics in Mercs 2 pale in comparison to other graphical powerhouses of the current console generation. Make no mistake though, the scale and destruction in Mercs 2 will impress all but the most biased graphics connoisseurs.Mercenaries biggest detraction is it's apparent complete lack of beta testing. The game as is has been patched and is still so utterly full of bugs and glitches that it becomes difficult to play at times. Glitches vary from the funny: randomly floating objects and enemies; to the weird: enemies will stop shooting at you while you can still shot them; the the frustrating: game freezing and objectives becoming unattainable.It's difficult to convey just how many and how frequent glitches can and do occur. I'll give a rundown of some  of the glitches I've encountered:- High Value Target fell through the map and was inside a building he shouldn't have been able to enter. Required restart of mission.- Helicopter frequently gets stuck or lost preventing the collection of items. Requires patience.- High Value Targets kill themselves frequently. Requires restart of mission if playing for the 'Aces High' Trophy.- The in-game physics will cause you to lose challenges frequently because you'll either crash or loose the payload of your vehicle.- Enemies stop attacking you. Can be viewed as a bonus as this makes the game extremely easy.To further add insult is the frustrating design choices by the developer. Failing a mission or failing to collect a High Value Target alive requires you to either quit the game completely and reload you last save file. Or in the case of certain missions, you'll be MedEvac'd to your base only to lose all of your weapons and have to trudge halfway across the map back to the point where you were killed. The ability to instantly restart a mission or a load data function would've been nice.Another problem with the game is the yo-yo'ing difficulty. Enemies will at one moment be completely brain dead, virtually running into your bullets and then next they'll be using RPG's as sniper rifles from 1200 yards away.All in all what saved this game for me was the fact that it's undeniably fun. The premise of wrecking havoc in the air, on land and sea across a huge varied landscape is still appealing. Unfortunately the lack of polish is ultimately what keeps this game from being great.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2009"}

The graphics are beautiful.  Draw distances are incredible with great vistas and scenery.  I like how the terrain gets tore up with every lap (similar to Motorstorm).  Controls are easy to learn and very responsive.  The physics aren't meant to be totally realistic, but that's the fun of this game (implausible, impossible, and unlawful).  It's got multiplayer.

The game revolves around stringing together long sequences of tricks and catching a massive amount of completely over-the-top air in some seriously gorgeous environments.Downloaded the demo and that was just the start of my PURE addiction. I play the hell out of a demo for a week staight. When finally I got my hands on the full game, it was like crack. The levels get sicker and sicker as you go through the single player, and multiplayer is just as satisfying. Basically you got 3 game modes; race sprint (smaller tracks with smaller jumps), and freestyle. Freestyle is funnest multi. because it's a race to see who can get the most trick points. The tricks by the way are pretty insane especially as you're turbo proggresses. So with that there is some strategy involved. Graphics are solid, sounds good, plays great. I fyou like Burnout series, I think you'll be satisfied with PURE.Gameplay: The trick system is fantastic and fluid. It's easy to string together huge tricks that bring a smile to your face the first few times.Graphics: Stellar. Everything looks fantastic, from the bikes to the riders to the environments and the mudslinging.Sound: Something I didn't hit on, because it can all be said here. Very simple, with a decent soundtrack and believable engine sounds. Pretty much all there is to it.Entertainment Value: Great for a weekend diversion. You'll have an enormous amount of fun for the first hour or two. Most gamers will probably find a steep decline in fun factor after that, when you're performing your 300th no-hander.Learning Curve: Simple to learn and fairly simple to master pretty much sums it up. The difficulty comes from memorizing the tracks and the different routes you can take.

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.PlayStation Network support including PlayStation Trophies.","reviewerName":"Jesterkloun","summary":"Singularity, way overlooked!","reviewText":"I bought this game because I was told it was very good and overlooked, and I would have to agree. The game itself is rendered beautifully and looks gorgeous, the controls are tight and fun. And the time manipulation is done very well.  The only thing about it I didn't like was it was short.  I beat it in around 5 to 6 hours and felt that just wasn't enough.

I had IMMENSELY enjoyed BALDUR's GATE I & II and all their expansions, a well as the ICEWIND DALE series. I had been enchanted by the best cRPG ever, PLANESCAPE TORMENT. Now the same game developers were delivering a 3D, cinematic version that would make total immersion inescapable! Right? Wrong, oh boy, so WRONG!Measly henchmen replacing our deliciously diversified company, nauseating camera movement, infantile designed objects, slow battle movements, low polygon characters and bland storyline. Now, NWN had its virtues, no doubt. It was such an original approach that games like WOW and OBLIVION borrowed heavily from its innovative concept of a Third-Person cinematic RPG. Nevertheless, it suffered from raising the expectations bar too high - and then not delivering but a fraction of its obvious potential. It eventually got accepted by the MODing community that created numerous ingenious MODs that saved the day.It has been over a year now and NWN2 does not seem to take off. It is as if no one wants to concern himself with it. And for good reason.The much higher system requirements do not translate onto the screen. There are improvements of course but not by much. It feels more like an expansion than a sequel.The camera movement is even worse. Much WORSE! Supposedly it positions itself in the best angle, Well, I found myself spending more time repositioning the camera than the interacting with the characters!Does it have bugs? Enough to make a horror B-Movie! Patch after patch gets released and the damn thing still stutters and freezes and crashes. Another fine example of an untested product rushed to the market unfinished. While traveling everything seems fine. When the battle heats up, though, and spells fly left and right all hell breaks loose. Tweaking the video and graphics settings helps but does not eliminate all problems.All in all, a game to avoid if a cRPG fun.

The triggers are very responsive and the touch pad is a nice feature. Most games use the new optional controller very well, however some games didn't get it right. But it is very dependent on the game mechanics. I had to purchase replacement rubber pads for the thumb sticks because in a few months of regular use they started to wear down to the plastic beneath. I also wasn't crazy about the indented thumb sticks, I rather they be raised like the last controller. The replacement rubber pads available on Amazon are cheap and work well and raise the pad for easier and better grip.The only issue I have with this controller is the charge doesn't seem to last as long as the PS3 controller, and the rubber thumb sticks wear down incredibly easily. Besides that, it's an amazing controller for an amazing system.Also, this controller can be used with the PS3 as well.Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2014"}
{"product_name":"B007UM59AC","description":"","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Sorry Ninja Theory","reviewText":"I am one those people who was upset upon seeing this game's first trailer. I like Ninja Theory and their game Heavenly Sword, but I was not impressed by the way they changed Dante. Because of that and because Capcom has cheated me in the past, I didn't buy on day one. But now that the price has dropped I have gone through it and this is what I feel.*************************PROS************************************-Story: This is the strongest point. I know most fans don't care but I have always wanted a good story in DMC game. I have to say while I really want Capcom to finish the original DMC story, this DMC has the best story and story telling so far. Just loved it. I would give this game a five star just for its story and the action.-Heck&Slash; Action: DMC3 is still the king when it comes to Heck&Slash; action, but the action in this game is not bad either. I loved the wide variety of combos you can perform with Angel and Demon weapons. It is also easy to switch between the weapons so no complains here.-Characters: This is where Ninja Theory shines. They are really good at designing and giving life to characters. This is why I loved Heavenly Sword and was able to tolerate Enslaved. This studio is really good at making unique characters with memorable persona. Bravo Ninja Theory.-Moves video tutorial: I am happy they decided to keep this feature (basically short videos showing each moves). It is important for average player such as myself so I know if I am pulling out a move correctly or not.-Weapons: Again loved the combination of Angels and Demon weapons, but again DMC3 is still the king and Pandora's box in DMC4 is still the best weapon.-Certain enemies and Bosses: I didn't like design of many enemies and bosses but certain enemies and bosses are well designed and well drawn. I enjoyed some boss fights (no spoilers).-Limbo art/concept: Really liked the concept of the Limbo world. While graphically this game is not the best, it still looks pretty good.-Platforming: Limbo worlds and use of weapons also makes platforming a great feature in this game. To best to my knowledge this is the first DMC where I enjoyed to the platforming.-Upgrades: Upgradable weapons, skills and character adds RPG element to this game like previous DMCs. Great.Replayability: I replayed each and every previous DMC because I liked Heck&Slash; gameplay, different difficulties and 100% upgrade completion. Same is true for this one.*************************CONS************************************-A step backward: So sad that this game runs at lower fps and has poorer graphics than DMC4. Don't see why they would do that.-Virgils downfall: Like Europeans we should have been given an option to get it free with pre-order. So ticked off about this.-No lock on: You must fix this for future DMC games-Missed opportunity: They should have made this a spin off rather than a reboot. In other words continue the old DMC story in DMC5 and start this as a new series. A horrible decision that has hurt the sales of this great game.*************************CONCLUSION********************************This is a great game and I hope Capcom gives Ninja Theory a second chance to make a sequel but more importantly I also hope that they continue the previous DMC series. If you are a DMC fan who is still angry with Capcom or Ninja Theory, I suggest that you put that anger aside and give this game a shot, especially now that it is a bit cheaper. I will say it again the story and plot really kept me going.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2013"}

You perform different surgeries on people.The game falls short in many areas. For one, I found the difficulty to be a little too high. This is because you might not figure out which tool to use exactly until it's too late. Even then, sometimes the characters will talk at the top of the screen and say things moments before you need to do them. You have the special power to slow down time when you are performing. Sometimes they will just screwm out to you to use this power, and if you don't your patient dies within seconds.Another thing, sometimes the game becomes more tedious than fun.

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or fighting the good fight solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house.Key Game FeaturesSpecial Controller Included- Designed with input from the Capcom development team, the Wii Classic Controller Pro is included in this bundle.Hunt Together- In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone.

Thus enters Umah:the very feminine,very sensuous,very partially dressed vampire(yeah,I LIKE Umah!)As for Umah,and Kain and all of the other characters,they are excellent;visualy.The graphics of Blood Omen 2 is great eye candy;not so much in the fantasy sense of Soul Reaver 2,but in more of a macabre,industrial sense.But that only helps to emphasize the nature and storyline of the game.Both the storyline and voice-acting are first class(would you come to expect anything less from this series?)The gameplay is very easy to get the hang of and so much fun!-pick up a guy by the throat!lop off a guy's head from behind!-Very sadistic yes, but very addicting!As for all the whining over quoate/unqoate\"way too easy block and switch puzzels\",hey,they're more than welcome in my book!I'd rather dive straight into the action and learn more of the great story than burst my brain trying to solve some puzzle!Just on a quick note,I thought there were WAY too many puzzles in both Soul Reaver 1 and 2!And let's face it, most of us only solved those puzzles by looking in a strategy guide cause we couldn't figure them out ourselves!So bring on the easy puzzles say I!All and all,this is a great game that you should definatly buy esp. if you are a fan of the series!As for the one reviewer who wrote that \"it doesn't play as smoothly as the XBOX version\",I hope he realizes that you can only play Blood Omen 1 and Soul Reaver 1 and 2 on Playstation.After all,Sony started this great epic legacy......NOT Bill Gates!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2002"}

All over the web it seems that this one is most highly praised.  This review is for someone looking for a racing game where the vehicles behave even somewhat realistically.  The cover of the box reminded me of 4X4EVO and 4X4EVO2 which are games I played on a PC with steering wheel control about 7 years ago.  I really like those games and was hoping this was similar.This game does allow you to race.....that is true.  It can also be a lot of fun.  The problem is this.  I can't begin to tell you WHAT you are racing.  Maybe if we called it a hovercraft or a jet truck or a spaceship/truck hybrid, it might help.  Any resemblance to the way a real truck, or any real world vehicle for that matter, behaves seems to be out of the question with this game.  The graphics are good and scenery is very realistic.  That is when you can see it.  The trucks move at an impossible pace.  They have turbo boost and when you play against the computer trucks, you will find that if you do not use your turbo boost to the maximum, you will not keep up.  This causes the truck to move at relative speed of what seems to be 150 miles an hour through what is usually woods.  Almost nothing stops the truck as far as terrain or turns in the road.  Trees will stop you.  Trees will ALWAYS stop you.  Any tree you hit will make the truck crash and cause you to wait until you can resume.  Now, on to the flying part.  If you really compete with the computer trucks, you spend anywhere from 30% to 50% of the time in the air.  You can control staying in the air longer or shorter (HHMMMMM what is the physics of that?).  You can STEER in the air???!!!!!  You can land after being 50 yards in the air and just keep on going as though that would not cause any damage, but don't hit that tree....you will stop dead in your tracks.This is definitely a very fun \"jet car/truck flying amphibious hovercraft spaceship\" racing game.  No realism to speak of.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00000JNHJ","description":"What's more fun than a barrel of opposable-thumbed simians? How about the silly--but  challenging--Ape Escape? While not the first game to offer enhanced control with Sony's  dual-stick analog controller,Ape Escapeis the first game to require either an analog ordual shock controllerto play. That requirement  ensures that players will have full control of their hero, Spike. One stick moves Spike in any direction,  while the other swings his monkey-catching devices.InApe Escape, a circus monkey named Specter stumbles upon a scientist's prototype  intelligence-enhancing helmet, turning him into an evil monkey genius. As Spike, the professor's young  friend, you must travel through time to clean up all of the monkeys Specter has sent back in his attempt to  repopulate the world. If that's not enough to make you laugh, then chasing his goofy monkey minions as  they scurry from your clutches will certainly tickle your funny bone. You'll discover a variety of gadgets to  help you in your quest, including monkey radar, a slingshot, and a propeller for flying. Spanning 25 huge  levels,Ape Escapeis approachable for novices, and offers added challenges for veteran gamers.  One such challenge is to lure a dinosaur near a rocky cliff, and then jar the monkey off his back and into  your net. Note: no monkeys were harmed in the creation of this game.--Jeff YoungPros:Unique control scheme brings new challenge to the PlayStationMassive game has plenty of replay valueCons:Unique control scheme requires some ramp-up time","reviewerName":"Destitute","summary":"This review is deditcated to my Ape Escape disc. 1999-2008","reviewText":"Ah, the year was 1999. While Sony and Nintendo were clashing, people thought that 2000 would be the end or at least the end of their computers. SpongeBob SquarePants began to reign to over kids, along with Pokemon. And some people were wondering why their Ape Escape game wouldn't work as they threw their non-Dualshock controllers down on the floor, while I was hating the game for not knowing how to play it. However, when I got it together, it became one of my favorites until its demise in 2008, when, wanting to make an ISO of my aging disc, I found it with a huge crack on it, under unknown circumstances.So, now that I've got a little of my nostalgia out, onto my review of this unique little game.GRAPHICS: Blocky, polygonal, and furthermore, colorful. In other words, it is the typical PS1 game. Nothing like a PS3's,  but who cares?MUSIC:  A big kudos to the people who composed to the music, because even after ten years it is still fun to listen to. Catchy, synth-like riffs fill this level, each level having a unique soundtrack. What's also cool is when you crouch, some of the instruments cease.SOUND/VOICE ACTING: The sounds, while sort of primitive, are also catchy. The swoosh of the net will be music to your ears, along with the footsteps and other stuff. The voice acting, while so-so, is actually the best voice acting in the trilogy. I wish the cast would have stayed for 2 and 3, but oh well.STORY: Simple, but pretty original. Specter, the most popular monkey in the monkey amusement park, finds the Professor's Peak Point Helmet, which enhances intelligence. Once he puts it on, he wants revenge for being locked up in there, so he makes more, gives them to all the monkeys in the park, and he raids the Professor's lab to use his time machine to rewrite history so apes can rule the world. Now only Spike, who kind of looks like Yu-Gi-Oh, can capture the monkeys, defeat Specter, and save his friend, Jake, who is under Specter's control.GAMEPLAY: Now here's where the game truly shines. Before I talk about the actual gameplay, however, let me discuss the controls.The Dualshock controller had been out for a while, but was still unneeded to enjoy the game. All it provided was vibration, and the ability to play with the analogue stick, the right stick as useful as wisdom teeth. Then Ape Escape came along and changed everything. Those without DS controllers had to get some to enjoy this game, whilst many tried to figure out the layout. The directional pads were only used for the camera, while the triangle, square, cross, and circle buttons were just used to change gadgets. It was then where the right stick, the L3, and the R3, (the latter both not having a title yet. It was just `push the left/right stick down like a button,) finally got their chance. This paved way for more functions for the Playstation controller.As for the gameplay itself, it is a blast, even if it's your 10th play. You time travel to many eras, your mission being to catch the apes. You also got gadgets, which help you solve puzzles and catch some out of reach monkeys. You start off with a stun club and a net, but you later get a total of nine gadgets, each having their unique function. The apes themselves are diverse, with each color of pants they wear representing their abilities. Some move so fast that you must catch them via stealth. After all, this was made a year after Metal Gear Solid came out. You don't have to catch all the monkeys in the level (some you can't until later when you got a different gadget,) but if you do, you can play the level with a time trial, which gives you nothing, but is fun. You also need to catch every single ape if you want to catch Specter. Your health is represented by cookies. You can also get Specter Coins, which allow you to play three different mini-games once you get the required amount. There's a skiing game, a boxing game, and a space shooter game, the last one the best IMO. There are also two racing levels where you race the brainwashed Jake for Specter coins.As for bosses, there are none until you get to Crumbling Castle. It's a shame, because the bosses are fun to fight. Instead, the game relies on enemies to keep you at bay besides the apes. You can't kill the apes, but you can kill the enemies and get goods. You'll have to search everywhere for those damn dirty apes, from the ocean to the Ice Age to even inside a dinosaur.Ape Escape, overall, is quite a fun game. It's not too hard, but it's still entertaining. This is a must buy. They also remade this game for PSP, but I never tried it. But I think AE is best on the big screen with a controller.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2009"}

Dante adds a lot of replay value as he has 4 diff fighting styles and 3-4 diff swords.  I can't wait to replay this on a higher difficulty and try different combos out.  The boss battles are the funnest part of the game.  Regarding the backtracking you experience with Dante, it's not that bad as it goes pretty quickly, but it would've been nice to see new settings.This is my first DMC game and I'm halfway through it. I saw the commercial for this a couple months ago and thought it was more of the same old same old so I passed it up.  Well, I wound up picking up a used copy now that they've come down in price and am I ever glad I did. I've finished the original Ninja Gaiden on Xbox and really enjoyed that, but never replayed it because the environments were too eclectic for me--nothing was cohesive or made sense.  The environments in this game are really nice as you fight in castles, forest, snow...some parts even seem ethereal. But what gives this game replay value is the combo system.  It mainly revolves around hitting your opponent in the air, further flailing away at him before pulverizing him into the ground.  It's a familiar formula but what's innovative in this game, is that you have a gun that helps keep you aloft, and a devil hand that just punishes your enemies. The devil hand is really innovative as you can pull enemies towards you or pull yourself to them, and it unleashes wicked attacks on different enemies and bosses, which never get old.The graphics are definitely HD, but not photo-realistic.  It's what you would expect from a Capcom game as are the menu interfaces.  Some may find the puzzles a little challenging but they are not too too difficult (I'm still playing on easy). I still haven't played the 2nd character yet so that should add more variety in terms of gameplay, but I'm already impressed and look forward to playing the game, which is what it's all about.  So if you like games like Ninja Gaiden and God of War, you should like this.notes: There are a lot of cutscenes which you can bypass, but they are really well done. The camera sucks at times but aren't a dealbreaker.  Skills and abilities need to be bought and it seems you'll never accumulate enough for everything. You can also rev your sword like a motorcycle (aside: I have an '07 R1, which is the most reliable/best looking bike ever, imho) making it glow red hot and when attacking will emit flames.  You can only save after you finish a level, but when you die fighting a boss, you continue right there; I was initially concerned about having to replay the entire level, but that's not the case.  Definitely a buy if you can get it for around $20.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2008"}

Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course.

Maybe he shot his eye out with his  Red Ryder 200-shot Range Model Air Rifle, so you don't have to kill him.

Once enemies are dead, they're permanent floor decorations. To earn new weapons and abilities, you have to keep progressing, and that's why you'll never want to keep progressing , and that's why you'll never want to put the controller down. In fact our inability to pull ourselves away from the controller for hours prompted my girlfriend and i to nickname this bladder's gate. But that isn't the only reason you'll wet yourself. The dark and glommy dungeons hold plenty of surprises to make you jump. And slicing them to bits is a bloody sight to see. Who knew that a zombie can still attack after you slice his body in half? These thrills are best experienced with two players playing cooperatively. USing different classes fighters, sorceress or archer to complement each other's weaknesses  is fun in an I ve got you back sort of way, and it makes it easier to beat the game too. Sometimes it's hard to distinguish the two characters apart, despite the sharp graphics. In the middle of fights you can  get lost in the carnage, and blocked sites lines caused by dungeon decor add to the confusion.

Weapons of mass destruction, deployed with complete impunity razed the land in the blink of an eye. The dire situation forced the two opposing factions to negotiate a cease-fire and an agreement was quickly reached, but although the war may have ended, its effects remained. With the deteriorating environment, Earth's population was drastically reduced and those who survived lived a confined existence trapped in underground cities. Eventually countries joined together to form the Greater United Nations and turned their eyes skyward, to space. With the establishment of the USTA, the Universal Science and Technology Administration, man began to seek new worlds beyond the stars.AD 2087...The first year of the spacedate (SD) calendar. Thanks to the success of Professor Trillas Bachstein's warp drive experiments, mankind's dream of a spacebourne existence has inched closer to reality and the USTA secretly began to implement its SRF project, the Space Reconnaissance Force. Now it is SD 0010, and the first official SRF mission and your adventure has begun.CharactersPlayers ofStar Ocean: The Last Hopewill meet and interact with a wealth of characters from different parts of the galaxy, each with their own history and weapons of choice. Just a few of the more prominent characters to familiarize yourself with include:Edge MaverickAlthough generally possessing good judgment, this young Earthling commander of the maiden deep space voyage of the SRF ship the Calnus, can be reckless. His signature weapon is the sword.Faize Sheifa BelethA young Eldarian committed to etiquette and logic, and capable of astounding feats of engineering, Faize is always honorable of those possessing abilities he lacks. His signature weapon is the rapier.Reimi SaionjiThe kind and levelheaded navigator of the Calnus, Reimi was born in an aristocratic Saionji family and has a shared history with Edge back on Earth. Her signature weapon is the bow.Lymle Lemuri PhiOrphaned on her home planet of Lemrick long ago, Lymle is mischievous, but friendly and inexplicably retains the appearance of a young girl. Her signature weapon is the wand.Gameplay and CombatAlthough Edge Maverick is the main character inStar Ocean: The Last Hope, players will of course experience gameplay action in the form of a number of different characters and utilize the signature attacks assigned to each. The game features a real-time combat system which allows for up to four party members to remain active in battle at a time. Improvements to the game's combat system include 'Rush Mode,' where players can switch out active members of their combat groups for reserve members in real-time; 'Sight In/Sight Out' which allows for timed evasive and counter moves against enemies; and the BEAT (Battle Enhancement Attribute Type) system, through which players can change a character's fighting style at will. Other actions players will master through gameplay include piloting of the spaceship Calnus, a first in theStar Oceanseries; item creation in the form of weapons, healing items and accessories; and Private Actions (PAs), a cause and effect relationship between character in-game actions and the acquisition of new abilities and scenarios.

Star Ocean is a game that, with slightly better writing and development could have been one of the best games of the decade.  But it consistenly falls short.Let's take a bit of a look.The game is graphically beautiful.  Full appreciation is due to the artists and animators.  Not just for wandering around the vast multiworld universe that is the setting for the game, but fight animation is also lovingly detailed.  Everything is great except for facial expressions.  The characters are usually deadpan, and Reimi has a distant stare that is positively chilling.The story is intricate. Edge and Reimi start out on Earth's attempt to find a colonizable world in order to save the human race from the ruin of a war torn planet.  They meet a number of different alien races enlist characters (you wind up playing 4 out of a set of eight characters).  Eventually they meet more villanous aliens, uncover a plot to end the universe and have to defeat an evil mastermind.  Initially the game is linear, but gradually non-linear elements (such as quests) are introduced and you will do a lot of planet hopping.  To some degree there's too much story.  The worst example is the infinitely long closing sequence, which is unavoidabe and unstoppable.Interplayer relationships are interesting as the characters are all quite different.  Acting, however, is spotty.  The worst example here is the crisis Edge goes through when his actions result in the destruction of a planet.  Not his fault, but he spends endless hours whining and beating on himself (massively overacted) before he gets back on trackGameplay itself is the real problem.  The characters are irritatingly difficult to steer, and the precise position needed to accomplish something can be quite elusive.  This can get on your nerves.  For all the complicated battle options most battles are repetitious and frankly, the bosses are too easy.  Or so they are until suddenly they get way to0 hard.Battle trophy hunting is an important part of character building since you need enough trophies to remove the experience cap and get more than a small handful of things to say while killing mushrooms.  Some of these are a matter of pure luck(kill an opponent with exactly the right anount of damage)or really aren't much of a challenge (run away 20 times).  None of the other collectables are that hard to get, but they are easy to miss if you don't know that some place is about to be destroyed forever.  Which means you will have to play the game at least twice to get the accomplishments.  And while I don't mind playing the hack and slash endgame for hours on end, the last thing I want to do is live through Edge's tantrums again.I have a number of other grumbles, but no doubt you have already figured out that this is a very playable game that simply doesn't live up to its potential.  It is a pleasant pass time though so I would recommend it anyway as a good value for the money.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2009"}

This controller will require you to stand/sit fairly close to the TV in the room or to the Xbox (whichever is closer to you).

{"product_name":"B0050SZC5U","description":"","reviewerName":"Genryu","summary":"Not worth picking up","reviewText":"When I first heard about Diablo 3 I wasn't looking for much. Just a solid update to and improvement upon Diablo 2, the game that I and all of my friends spent hours everyday playing when we were kids and is lauded as one of the best of its generation. Blizzard didn't really take the &#34;Don't fix what ain't broken approach&#34; entirely to heart because they pretty much re-did everything from the ground up. Some of the changes were for the better but in my opinion most of it was for the worse.StoryThe story is largely predictable and frankly just not very engaging. I didn't particularly care about any of the characters nor did I ever care about the main plot events. It just was very formulaic for a action-adventure RPG to the point of being cliche. Most of the quests really felt like chores more than anything else, and there were only a few very cool moments that asked you to do something different. I think Blizzard sort of was resting on their laurels and hoping the Diablo name would sell their game, but contemporaries have caught up and I could easily recommend a variety of other action-adventure RPGs that offer a far more engaging story. The first time I was playing the game I felt like I was playing it mostly to finish it to keep going to the higher difficulties where all the loot is.GameplaySo what Blizzard did this time around in what I believe is an effort to make Diablo 3 easier to pick up for new players is to take out point allocation and skill upgrades from the players hands. What this means is that whenever you gain a level your points  are automatically picked for you based on your class (barbarians get more to strength, wizards get more points placed in intelligence). Same goes for skills, so you don't pick what skills/skill trees you want to focus on like in most other RPG games. They automate the whole thing for you. I think they did this so you can focus on just messing around with different skills and not how to &#34;plan out&#34; or &#34;focus&#34; your character.Good idea in theory, but in practice what this means is there's really nothing unique about your character at all besides the gear they have. Gear becomes the #1 most important thing in the entire game regardless of what character you are and what class you are. Damage for all the classes is directly tied to weapon damage, so whether you're a witch doctor or a barbarian you need to find the biggest item you can carry. The skills between the classes themselves are diverse enough, and there are some genuinely cool and fun attacks you can use with each of the classes. I especially like the barbarian seismic slam and the wizard's slow time abilities, but eventually the novelty wears off. This is about the 1 redeeming area of the game and there is 1 golden period when you have decent gear, the enemies aren't ridiculously strong, and the game feels balanced and you can just focusing on slaughtering the demonic hordes as a hero. Definitely had some great times in this golden period, but alas it doesn't last very long. So you'd think then that if gear is so important Blizzard would have a efficient system to keep players engaged and competitive with loot right? You'd be wrong.The Loot SystemWeapon and Item drops in Diablo 3 have to have probably some of the worst mechanics I've ever seen. I've played the game on and off since it came out, and put in probably a good couple hundred hours overall with most of them spent on the higher difficulty levels. To date I have not found a single Legendary item during the entire time I've played the game. This is not uncommon either, there are plenty of forums on blizzard with players complaining about just this. This could be because I don't have enough &#34;magic find&#34;, but eventually after gaining enough nephalem valor (extra magic find after you beat a champion monster mob) I'd expect at some point in the game to get at least one legendary item. Out of the stuff you do find, most of it is junk or you can't even use it. I regularly find wands that give +100 strength or maces that give +100 intelligence when I play with my wizard. What kind of sense that does make to you? On the off chance I do find something decent, it's usually something for an entirely different class. So why did Blizzard put in such a non-sensical system? To promote the auction house of course.Blizzard's auction house is their way to regulate trades and create a economy where they always come out the winner at everyone's expense. Prices are always ridiculously high, with most of the decent items costing millions of gold (trust me, that'll take you a while to get unless you find something decent to sell or spend a lot of time gold farming). Whether people are buying stuff in the gold auction house or the real-money auction house Blizzard gets a cut of the profits. And the money you may get from the real-money auction house can only be used to get more Blizzard stuff, unless you're willing to give up even more of a cut to blizzard to get it out through paypal. Whatever option you pick, Blizzard wins, kind of like a Casino actually.MultiplayerPlaying with other people is managed decently when you're working through the campaign, except that difficult scaling becomes a issue when not everyone is at the same level. Weaker players in the party will have a tougher time and might not be having much fun because they're just too weak to really kill anything (probably due to their lack of good gear thanks to the poor loot system), and the stronger players in the party will just feel overpowered. The other big downside is that your &#34;magic find&#34; (probability increase in finding better items) is averaged across your party. So if you're playing with someone that doesn't have much magic find but you have a lot, you're going to end up with a lower probability of finding good items and he'll be better off with you. Kind of encourages you in that sense to play on your own to maximize your chances of finding decent items. Competitive multiplayer is still non-existent, with no real ETA on delivery from Blizzard. Though at this point there's no reason to wait since a) most of the people still playing will have 10x better gear than you do meaning you're probably going to lose because you didn't spend enough money/time/energy into hunting for items as they did.ConclusionThere's a reason my entire friends list completely dried up within a month. I logged in a few days back to see if anyone was still playing, all it showed was that no one had logged in since the end of the first month. I even created a public game to see if anyone would join, and after a few hours I gave up waiting and quit. To it's credit Blizzard has been trying to respond to feedback and improve the game. They decreased the difficulty level in Inferno mode, put in new game mechanics, and generally have tried to improve the game with tweaks. Maybe they have mitigated a number of the problems raised thus far, but a quick look at the forums tells me that's hoping for too much. At the end of the day Diablo 3 is still broken on a very fundamental level that it is pretty much beyond repair. Diablo 3 is definitely not a worthy successor to Diablo 2, and at this point is not worth your time picking up and playing over all of the other great games out.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2012"}

I bought it without seeing the reviews just because it looked like it would be good.  I like playing as a female character and since they had a female elf I was going to get it.I am a single player gamer and was a little worried that the ai would either be overpowered or underpowered.  Well I have to say that the ai is really good.  The battles are many times overwhelming and either have a troll or a special orc or mini boss thrown in and when I am down my computer controlled companions are always there to revive me.  Also I was a little worried that the enemies would always run to the computer controlled companions.  Well they notice me and we all fight as a team.The combat is very tight.  There are some cool finishing animations.  There is mellee fighting, ranged fighting, special offensive and defensive powers, and a skill tree to add powers and abilities like dual wielding.  There are a lot of enemies, and cool mini bosses, and cool bosses.The characters can be altered to your taste in mirrors in town.  There is one in Bree.  This is pretty cool because my elf is smokin hot!There is a lot of loot and it is really good loot.  It is cool that the way you equip your character shows in the cutscenes.There are dialog trees.  This is pretty cool.  I read where some reviewers though the dialog tree didn't matter to the outcome.  Well maybe but you feel more involved by picking what to say.  Also you can learn more about the story.Now I think one of the reasons this game is so cool is because it is a new story.  It has all of the Lord of the Rings themes, but is brand new.  I love the Lord of the Rings, but was not getting into the games because I already new the story and now I have this great game with a hot elf character with great combat a great world and a new story!  And the story is really good.  These guys understand the Lord of the Rings and how to make a new story that feels like it is really part of the Lord of the Rings.Also the graphics are great.  Probably close to the best I have seen.  The character models are great looking.  The enviroments are beautiful and the enemies are great looking.  Also I have noticed when I was in a cave I could see the characters breath.  Pretty cool effects like this and rain falling.I have no complaints with this game.  Probably the most fun game I have played this year.  Rage was fun too, but I love getting a new Lord of the Rings story.Also no bugs noticed.  Usually with a third person game I notice something in 12hrs, but not this time.Now when I first started I was a little disappointed because the game seemed too easy whenver I was dying I would get revived.  Well then I got to the 1st boss and 2hrs later beat him after dying 20 or so times.  I then realized exactly how the revive worked.  You have to go near the character and kind of kneel by them until a circle goes around a (x).  Now with easier enemies you will get revived a lot, but with bigger enemies, bosses, or huge mobs, while you are trying to revive you will often get killed.I have noticed this game is pretty challenging but it makes you think of your strategy and usually trying it a different way helps.  So I like that.Thanks,Kevinedit 12/27/2011Have noticed some of the bugs others have experienced.  I am at level 6-1 and am unable to continue because I am in an area where I cannot leave and nothing happens.  Also I have had it freeze, not recognize me and go after the other characters, and I have been suspended unable to move under the graphics.  Also If you get in a corner or a tight spot the character will sometimes jump back and forth from different parts of the screen.  I was hasty to provide the 5 star review.  The game is kinda fun but since I cannot continue I am going to try and start over and hope I can get it to work.KevinI deleted my save files and started over and this is a solid game at the begining.  They really nailed the look of the graphics, the character models, enemies, npc's, all look like authentic lord of the rings.  Also no bugs at the beggining.  No slow down or any of the issues I noticed later on.  So hopefully I can finish it this time.Kevinupdate 12/30I was having  a lot of fun and doing much better than my 1st playthrough.  I was really kicking some butt and then I got killed on level 5-2 mirkwood.  When the game came back the orcs werent there and my mission was to kill radagast.  Well same thing I was in a undergound area that I could not get out of and no enemies or places to go.  Too bad it is a really good game and the second time through noticed no bugs until this game ending one.I can't believe this never came up when they were testing it.I think a few days ago it downloaded the update but since I started a new game since then the game still doesn't work.Kevin","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2011"}

The A.I. was kinda a disappointment since I could tell my squad where to go in a firefight and I would stand up my guys would not get shot at since all the fire would come at me.  Sometimes I wouldn't try to flank but just suppress the enemy with my guys and pick off the enemy with head shots even when they were crouched behind sand bags. I had some enemies displace and come a couple of feet from me or right toward me. The graphics just didn't seem on par with a game that has been delayed so much.  I thought the slow mo aspects would be way to often but I found myself not being able to get enough of it.  Story wise I loved this game being a fan of the previous installments.  I still hope for another installment for the series considering it is a good series deserving to go on.  Multiplayer for me was a giant letdown and I found myself wondering what were they perfecting in this game for the last couple months of delay.  Fans of the series will probably buy this game no matter what I say and if you like it that much than that's good.  For me this game is a 5 star rental and a 3 star buy and just not good enough to buy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2008"}

Just the same, I've very much enjoyed the console.  This particular bundle comes with the game \"Daxter\" (a Jak and Daxter title set between Jak I and II), and a UMD sampler of Family Guy episodes.  It also has a small memory stick, just to get you started.It's interesting how the console wars have played out:  Nintendo's DS is, like the Wii, an excellent gaming device, but little else.  The PSP follows closely in the PS3's footsteps by trying to be less of a gaming console and more of a media player.  It's much bulkier than a Zune or an iPod, but if you're someone who plans on playing games, you can't ask for better.  The PSP's screen is bright and colorful.  Its \"cartridges\" are actually tiny optical discs called \"UMDs\" (for \"Universal Mini-Disc\"), but Sony planned ahead and assembled them in plastic cartridge cases to cut down on dust and scratches.  The unit runs for a decent amount of time on the batteries, varying depending on how bright you set the screen and whether you're playing a disc or reading directly off a Memory Stick.And that's where the potential grows:  by using Memory Stick technology to enable you to store files, you're now capable of putting together a collection of just about any media you wish:  I have a small stick of photos and a large stick for videos that also holds my savegames.I've been very impressed by the quality of most of the games I've played on the PSP, and I was pleasantly surprised at how many games there are out there to choose from--I really had no idea.  All the same, there are cons:  UMD movies never really took off, so they're on their way out as a format.  While there is wireless networking, it's really not good for Internet use:  online multiplayer gaming works fine, but the browser is not so good, and trying to type even a password to log into your e-mail can get downright infuriating.  You can subscribe to RSS feeds and read content using the PSP, but it's going to take you some time and tinkering to get it going.There are some interesting extras to the PSP, however.  Not only has Sony been trying to improve the quality and features with product updates, but the integration with the PS3 is pretty tight:  I can sit at home and access media files through the PS3.  I can read shared media on any multimedia server in my home network (for instance, my Vista machine has made it very easy to listen to my music collction).  I can use a media reader to transfer files of any kind back and forth, I've used both the PS3 and a PC to buy games online and download them to the unit, and as if that isn't enough:  if I load a PlayStation (PS One) game into the PS3, I can play it from anywhere--even away from home--by \"connecting\" to my PS3 over the Internet.  I'm not sure why only PS 1 titles work, but it's still an interesting extra feature:  I actually have some pretty good PS 1 titles still around.If you're looking for portable fun, and you have a PS3, the PSP is really the logical choice for you.  If you have no interest in media, or you're thinking of something for smaller children, you might want to go with the Nintendo DS:  it's a little less fragile, and there are more games for all ages.  As for this grown-up gamer and his 9-year-old daughter, we've had a hit on our hands.Some add-ons you should consider:  a larger Memory Stick, a plastic carrying case (the official Sony case is bulky, but very good), and if you want to have some fun on the big screen, you can buy an audio-video cable to connect to your television (again, Sony's brand-name has turned out better than the aftermarket cable I tried).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2009"}

A legend on the PS2, and now making its debut on the GBA. I've heard so much about this game, I simply have to try it out myself. So, it goes that I spent $35 from my latest paycheck on the game, and thankfully, it didn't disappoint.To be honest, I'm not a keen fan of RPGs, primarily due to the need for repetitive, randomized battles just so that your character can level up. There are a few exceptions, like X-Men Legends for example, that incorporated these battles into the story seamlessly, making it less mindless. But the majority of RPGs still rely on such battles, and Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories is not an exception.Fortunately, the Kingdom Hearts brand is more than just repetitive battles. The fact that it incorporates a card-based fighting system makes the exchanges a little more interesting than merely just swinging your weapons all the time. The need for specific cards during battle means that building up a deck is important. Different stages, or \"worlds\", as witnessed in this game, require different strategies, which means it's not a good idea to approach them with only one set of cards. The cards also allow you to do combos and special attacks, which will please fans who enjoy a more advanced form of fighting other than mere melee.Of course, card-based fighting also means that fighting itself is restricted to what cards you've. Some argue that this takes away the spontaneity of battle. To a certain extent, this is true. Also, while the system calls for strategized battles, the battle will become so intense towards the end that you simply won't have the time to plan. These take away the intention of the system. Still, it's not to that much of a problem that it'll take away your enjoyment of the game.It also helps that the graphics for this game is really good. You should already know that Kingdom Hearts incorporates characters from Square and Disney, so apart from enjoying the beautiful backgrounds in the various worlds, you also get to see great renditions of familiar characters like Aladdin, Ariel, Donald Duck, Goofy, Pinocchio and Winnie the Pooh. If you've a lady who's not very keen of you playing games all the time, these should convince her to let you have a go!The audios is this game are also enjoyable, even though they're mostly rehashed from the original Kingdom Hearts. Each world has its own set of music, and they generally complement the mood of the world nicely. A minor issue I had is that somehow the music tends to turn softer at times by itself. This happens for a period of about a few seconds before reverting back to normal. It's not a big issue, but it does bother me because it happens so often. The again, it could be the game, it could be the catridge, or it could even be my GBA.In summary, this is a game that I'd recommend for gaming fans who like a good RPG. It'd have got a higher score if the dialogues weren't so cheesy, and if it had added some puzzle elements. Still, a great game overall, and the fact that it unlocks an additional mode after you beat the game just makes it all the more good for replay value.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2005"}

(Remember that awful game where you ran around with a cow launcher??) &#34;The Stick of Truth&#34; is truly the first game where the creators were able to capture the humor of the show, while also providing a really fun and engrossing game.Imagine playing Skyrim with Cartman and you kind of get what's going on with &#34;The Stick of Truth&#34;. You play as a customizable new kid who has just moved to South Park. You meet and make friends with Cartman, Stan, Kyle & Kenny, each leading their own faction of warriors, elves and wizards in search of The Stick of Truth. You take part in a variety of missions, gain skill levels and get more power the more missions you complete. It's a standard role playing game that you've probably seen a bunch of times, but with a unique South Park flavor.If you are a fan of the show, you will love the game, simply because you can run around and explore the town, meet all of the characters from the TV show, and it's highly offensive. If you aren't familiar with South Park, I don't know this would be a title you would want to pick up. Sure the game is a fun to play, and can be challenging at times, but it's the game's sense of humor that pushes the rating to five stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2014"}

Well that is what we have here with Origins.  It is very similar to Arkham City... in fact the city is almost identical.  Well Gotham is only so big so it makes sense to be the same layout right?  Not really.  In Arkham City, the worst areas were walled off while the rest of the city was left as normal.  So this is prior to all that craziness but still the same boundaries and layout.  So in many ways its a rehash of the previous game as far as layout.  However this time the environment just seemed to lack the same feel.  Not sure if it is less detailed or if since I have already seen everything if it just felt less exciting.  Either way something was missing.  I did really like the way they did fast travel and how they used the Batcave which were much welcome new additions.Combat was top notch as always.  They stuck with the formula that has done so well and added a little to it.  Boss fights are also much better this time around as you are not always fighting the huge brute the exact same way a dozen times.Unlocks.  Here is an area I think the game regressed. To get points and certain skills/unlocks you need to perform some very specific tasks just like the previous games... however this time you have to do it in a very specific order.  It made things feel a little more 'planned' and less 'spontaneous' earning stuff by just playing the game.  Instead it made me go look up what it wanted and try to get into a situation that I could knock out that challenge.  I also felt some of the tasks required a little too of a 'perfect storm' to be able to complete.  This meant that whole tree was held up until I could find a place to set up the conditions they wanted.Story is great and I loved how they used characters that were not as well known or those that had not been in previous games/movies.  Voice acting to me was great.So I did not like the re-used environment and I did not like the unlock system.  In my opinion it is the weakest of the 3 games but still really enjoyed it.  If you liked the first 2 games and want more then this is it, its just not as great as it could have been.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2013"}

{"product_name":"B007FQUEZ8","reviewerName":"w r e c k l e s s","summary":"A great collection of 2 stellar games","reviewText":"Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty\"Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty\" didn't quite end up as people expected. The opening section takes place on a Tanker being infiltrated by Solid Snake, who's on a mission to get evidence of a new Metal Gear. This acts as a 1-2 hour prologue to the main part of the game, which takes place on the \"Big Shell,\" a huge oil rig-looking structure with multiple connecting platforms and pathways. Despite the cover promptly displaying Snake's mug, what players got instead during this section was Raiden, a less gruff, less battle-weary, very \"green\" rookie soldier with distinct long white hair. I dug him. One of the things I like about Raiden is how he's introduced. At the beginning of the \"Big Shell\" mission you aren't sure who he is. Is he a clone of the Big Boss? Is he a re-imagining of Solid Snake? In proper \"MGS\" fashion, the answers only slowly reveal themselves all the way up until the closing credits. The big upgrades to gameplay over the previous game include a first-person perspective for aiming, along with useful maneuvers like hanging off the edges of structures to avoid detection, etc. There's also a fun dog tag collecting sub game where you can hold up/threaten enemies into dropping their tags that then unlock items if you collect enough. This game hinges on its story, and it's mostly thrilling all the way through, despite an ending that goes a bit off the rails. \"Sons of Liberty\" doesn't reach the greatness of the first game. That's not to say it isn't entertaining as hell.Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater\"Snake Eater\" is the third game in the \"MGS\" series, but the first game chronologically in the timeline, and takes place during the Cold War in 1964, where \"Naked Snake\" is tasked with stopping a nuclear-equipped tank in the jungles of the USSR. It's important to note that this is not the same Snake from the previous 2 games. If you're familiar with the mythology then you no doubt already know who he is. The story this time isn't quite as serious, and actually has a \"James Bond\" inspired opening credit sequence. There are still harrowing moments, as when Snake gets captured by Volgin, etc. Three characters in particular besides Snake are allowed an unusual amount of depth: young Ocelot, who later becomes one of the series' main villains and here first develops his obsession with revolvers; Eva, a seductress and spy whose loyalties aren't altogether clear; and The Boss, the legendary female soldier and former mentor of Naked Snake. What's new to \"Snake Eater\" are the systems that maintain Snake's health, which include eating food scavenged from within the environment (snakes for example) and curing yourself after taking damage (like removing a bullet with a knife and then applying the appropriate medical treatment). Also new is the ability to change camouflage on the fly to better blend in and help avoid being spotted by enemy patrols. These are great additions. I enjoyed \"Snake Eater\" more than \"Sons of Liberty.\" The boss battles are better and more numerous (the best of which is the sniper The End), and the story never falters. Is it as great as the first game? Maybe not, but then few games are.Vita version:This Vita collection includes the \"Substance\" version of \"MGS2\" (including: Boss Survival, Casting Theater, 300 VR missions, and 200 alternate missions) and the \"Subsistance\" version of \"MGS3\" (including: \"Metal Gear\" and \"Metal Gear 2,\" skill challenge missions, side story missions, and a new user-controlled camera). \"MGS3\" on Vita looks and runs much better than its 3DS counterpart but doesn't include the ability to crouch-walk as on 3DS. The analog controls work mostly well but can be a bit finicky here and there when extreme precision is needed. The only real omission is an upgraded \"MGS: Peace Walker,\" which is included with the console version of this collection. When all is said and done, this is one of the must-have Vita releases.--- 5 STARS ---","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2014"}

I really loved it then, but in the excitement of a new game (and having an excuse to put off school work) I rushed through it.I pick up the PS3 version when it came out thinking that it would be nice to go back through the game at a more even pace and try to appreciate the RPG elements of the game rather than just the shooting.  Boy am I glad I did.  Playing through Mass Effect 2 for me ranks up there with the my first read through of the Lord of the Rings trilogy when I was a kid.  It is really that good.  Here's why:- The shooter part of the game is solid.  Weapons have a nice feel, bullet impact is satisfying, and it can be tactical if you want it to be (set the difficulty high).- There is so much intelligently-written content:  The characters are likable and realistic and have very interesting back-stories.  Sure, there are plenty of sci-fi cliches here, but just when the game seems to be falling deeply in to one it surprises you.  And makes you stop and think.- The moral choices you make actually feel like they have weight.  I don't think I could say that for any other game I've played and I've play many.  The paragon (good-ish) vs. renegade (bad-ish) seems simple enough at first, but as you surf through dialogue trees you'll soon realize how much subtlety there is and the more you get into the role-playing (literally speaking) of the game, the more rewarding it is.And there were a few very minor things about the game that I did not like:- There often is not a dialogue choice for what you'd really like to say- With PS3 version there can be some choppiness during cut scene (not enough to be distracting)- At times the story feels a bit linear, though the included extra content helps lessen thisOVERALL:- I can't say enough positive things about this game.  For pure, hardcore shooter fans (of the Call-o'-duty variety), the combat in this game will be satisfying, but you might find the pacing a bit slow.  For Adventure/Action/RPG/shooter (half life-type variety) fans this game is a must purchase and the PS3 version is as good as the PC (and probably the xbox version, though I haven't played that one).  Plus, the extra content included with the PS3 version makes the game even better and longer.  I'm trying to get as much school-work done as possible before Mass Effect 3 comes out.  Kudos Bioware, keep making games this good and I'll keep buying a copy for each system I own","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2011"}

The controls and combat system seemed confusing and I didn't have the slightest clue what I was doing. After about 5 hours of play I finally mastered the controls/combat system and I eventually figured out how to travel through space to different locations, how to mine planets for their resources (that was a unique feature I discovered by accident but it comes in very handy), how to navigate the inner workings of Normandy, your flagship, how to upgrade weapons, armor, etc, and how to access the codex which is like an encyclopedia for everything in the Mass Effect universe. Yes, there is a MASSIVE amount of stuff to learn, and the game has a fairly steep learning curve, so patience will be necessary in the beginning. Once you get the hang of everything it becomes incredibly enjoyable and you'll be completely immersed into the mass effect universe.

So with that the only shooter I use to play was COD. Its fast fun and easy to pick up and just play a quick game. The maps are a fair size, but not really creative this time around. Now for some reason to me MW3 is better then Black ops online. ( I know they are made by different companies) I loved BO zombie mode and only played  it for that mode. But MW3 brings back memories of how fun COD can be. Now that is the good and bad of mw3, it feels too much like mw2. I know they cant change much but they need to change something anything to make me feel like I got my money worth.I always wished COD offer more things for the players too do then just shoot each other with guns. Like take up classes like Battlefield was doing on the PC. But since I Dont like pc gaming I never gave BF a chance. Then BF came too the Consoles with bad company , but I still didn't give BC a chance . Because I was playing COD and there was only room for one shooter in my life at the time. Finally when bfbc2 came around I gave it a chance and loved it. so when I herd BF3 and MW3 was coming out around the same time I didn't know which one to get.Turns out I picked up BF3 at a midnight release  and my plans was not to get mw3. I wont go into detail about how much more I enjoy playing bf3 more  then cod. But even with me thinking bf3 is great something was calling me to get cod, maybe it was the hype or I was feeling guilty for leaving mw3 behind. But I brought it and turns out Its just the same old thing fun to pick up and shoot stuff, but after playing bf3 it just feels like cod is missing alot of features.while writing this review I didnt know if I should give it 4 stars or 3 stars.well I am going give it for because even if its the same old shooting its still fun and easy to pick up. Plus it has split screen so I can play with my little brother. You can also play cod alone dont have to worry about having a good team like you have too on BF3.Anyway I think any old cod fan will have a blast with this game , but when the next cod comes out. PLEASE have a new engine and something new for me to do. or forsure next year you wont have my money.Edit 1/19/2012This game has soo much lag I cant even play it , dont say its my connection its not. I can play halo and bf3 even crysis 2 online without any lag at all.I cant give a game a good rating if I cant play it wtf.glad I still have my bf3","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2011"}

That includes the main board, Wii Fit disc software, batteries, manual and 4 foot extensions if you have a thick carpet.You can make your goals of much poundage you want lose in a certain period of time, then Wii Fit takes care of all the monitoring for you. There are four types of exercises: aerobics, balance, strength training, and yoga.  You'll be assigned your own electronic personal trainer.  Surprisingly enough, the trainer is also very knowledgeable and very willing to share his or her wisdom in physical training. Do not expect it to be the same as going to a gym.  Be realistic, it won't be the same as paying somebody to train you and use all the gym equipments.  Nevertheless, I have never sweat so much on a video game other than Wii Sports boxing.You can do running as if you are doing it outside of your home. Along the way you'll meet people you know (Mii's you have created) like friends & family members, dogs, waterfalls, and characters like Mario, Luigi, etc.  There is a game that is similar to \"Monkey Ball\" except you are doing it with your whole body instead of a handheld controller.

{"product_name":"B0050SWZHS","description":"","reviewerName":"1Dub79","summary":"Much respect for Tier 1 Operatives","reviewText":"SinceMedal of Honorcame out in 2010, some people liked the game, but many didn't. The game had a gripping campaign, average graphics, and multiplayer was unfinished and had many glitches. After two years, here comes Medal of Honor Warfighter, which has a heavy emphasis on Tier 1 special force groups and is armed with the Frostbite 2 engine.CAMPAIGN/STORY: Many people say the campaign is between 3-5 hours, which is on normal difficulty. I would say between 7-9 hours on hard difficulty. The missions in the campaign are based on real events and are set in various parts of the globe, such as Bosnia, Dubai, Pakistan, Philippines, and Somalia to name a few. Fire-fights will take place in various types of settings, such as a jungle, a destroyed hotel, caves, a flooded town, alleys, the desert, and ruins. Players will play as characters Preacher and Stump. Preacher returns from the previous Medal of Honor. In Preacher's missions, players will see other familiar characters from the previous game, such as Dusty, Mother, and Voodoo. Preacher's missions are more covert and adventurous. Most fire-fights on his missions are mid to long-range. Stump is a new character, who is a former Recon Marine, turned SEAL. Since Stump is a part of DEVGRU aka SEAL Team 6, many of his missions involve close to mid-range fire-fights. Not to spoil it, but one of Stump's missions will be re-enactment of a very familiar SEAL mission.GAMEPLAY: The gameplay is a cross between Battlefield 3 and COD. The controls are like COD. The gameplay is very serious and authentic. When I say serious, I mean it takes out the COD-like Hollywood effect and puts players into the boots of the Tier 1 Operatives, who performed these missions. The game does not play as easy as the previous Medal of Honor, ESPECIALLY on hard difficulty. With that being said, when playing on hard difficulty, being tactical is a MUST. Take your time! Shoot! Get cover! Repeat! Enemies move much smarter and are tactical. Some may flank you. Others may ambush you, hide behind cover or even go into prone. The WORST enemies are the ones with flashlights attached to their weapon. In other words, you WILL get cut down, if not careful. Fire-fights can be very intense and sometimes elongated because of the likeness to be suppressed by heavy enemy gunfire. The close-quarter battles are the most fun, but be careful, when engaging enemies. Also, in hard difficulty, prepare to run for cover because enemies love to toss grenades.The AI of your team is ok. They are constantly firing at enemies on sight. This team knows how to put rounds down-range. Sometimes, being in cover and seeing them engage the enemy is cool. They take needed cover and will remind you to do the same. Just like the previous version, ammunition can be retrieved from any teammate.However, they are not always aware of all enemies around. For example, there are times, when the team will just let an enemy just run past them and straight to you. This doesn't happen all the time, but do NOT heavily rely on your team to take out all enemies.A new feature added to the game is door breaching. Of course, this is a welcome feature for all of youTom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegaslovers, but this game adds more variety to the technique. Players can unlock new breaching techniques, when getting four straight headshots on enemies, upon breaching a door. The given breaching technique is the basic kick. Afterwards, players can unlock six additional techniques, such as the crowbar, door knob charge, flex linear charge, sheet charge, shotgun, and the tomahawk. It is cool seeing how each breaching technique is done. Once unlocked, any can be used, when given the opportunity to breach a door. Once a door is breached, the game goes into slo-mo.Driving vehicles is another new addition to this game for more variety. The view is in first person, of course. Driving vehicles are very basic. Just press the R2 button to accelerate and L2 to brake. Players can also press the left or right sticks to look from side to side, while in the vehicle.GRAPHICS/VISUALS: Between this game and the previous Medal of Honor, the graphics are a 180. Colors and textures are more polished and vivid. Weapons show realistic wear. Not to mention, the red dot sights look very authentic, as well. Thanks to the Frostbite 2 Engine, just about every surface can be manipulated by gunfire or grenades. I just love how grenade blasts sends dirt, water, and other debris flying in the air. It is a thing to see. On one driving mission, the visuals will make players feel as if they are really driving. Seeing your surroundings in the review mirror is GREAT detail. Also, on another the driving mission, players will see all kinds of dirt and mud fly onto the windshield and the windshield wipers wiping it off. Not to mention, how the vehicle shows realistic wear, based on what objects they may interact with, while on the road.When scoring a headshot, players will see two skull icons. For example, if a player shoots an enemy in leg and then manages to shoot them in the head, the white skull icon will come up. If a player shoots an enemy in the head with just one shot, then a red skull icon will come up. Nothing feels better than seeing the red skull icon show up. It's not easy to get those, though.MULTIPLAYER: The multiplayer lets players play as 12 types of Tier 1 operative forces across the globe. All cannot be played at first, they have to be unlocked. The coolest thing about unlocking the different special force groups is seeing what types of weapons each operative force has. Not to mention, each has their own type of offensive/defensive killstreak. Weapons can be vastly customized alaTom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier, including camouflage. When I first played multiplayer, I did not like it. Now, I do. It is not like playing COD. It is more tactical and more rewarding to learn how to play. Teamwork is very essential. Many times, fighting alongside team members is commonplace. In fact, it will feel as if players are playing on the campaign.SOUND: For all of you Battlefield 3 players, who love to hear the sound of authentic gunfire echoing, authentic sounds of weapon re-loads, and the realistic sound of explosions, you'll find that on this game, as well. All of these sounds become magnified, when fighting in close-quarters. Hearing bullets lay into enemies is like music to my ears.TIER 1/HARDCORE MODES: Upon completing the game on Hard difficulty, players will unlock these two modes. The TIER 1 mode is automatically on Hard difficulty, but there is no HUD, whatsoever, which makes gameplay increasingly difficult and realistic. On Hardcore mode, it is on Hard difficulty, but if players are killed at any portion of the game, they will have to start the level completely over.VERDICT: Despite what some may say, this game has it all. For those returning from the previous Medal of Honor and liked it, you'll love this. For new Medal of Honor players, you'll love this game too, if you are willing to step out of your COD box.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2012"}

R. Jeanclerc \"Reader, Listener & Obsessive...","summary":"Great Racing Fun, but Almost Too Much of a Good Thing","reviewText":"Need for Speed Underground 2 (NfSU2) is the latest installment in a long-running series of EA racing games.  The \"Underground\" element wraps the game up in a world of nighttime drag races and super-tuned and modified import coupes ala \"The Fast and the Furious\" movies.The most engaging part of the gameplay is the career mode, which allows you to build your reputation and your bankroll by entering events found throughout a sprawling urban landscape.  All of the now-familiar features are here:  a variety of race types, a huge selection of cars and options to be unlocked, purchased and installed, etc.  There's a lot of straight-up racing fun to be found on these streets.The graphics are really good;  not Gran Turismo good, but close.  The cars are especially fine, and you've got ample opportunity to examine your customized baby.  You'll occasionally get a mini-mission to have your car photographed for a magazine cover where you control the background, \"pose\" and camera angle.  Sure it's kind of a silly way to build your bank, but not a total waste after you've spent an hour selecting the perfect color scheme and combination of paint and artwork for your car.One minor gripe about the graphics is the lack of options for camera angles.  Given how big the city is, the always-nighttime gameplay and the fact that some shortcuts and objectives are tucked away between buildings, it can be tough to spot things.  I feel the other reviews when they complain about long times searching for this or that between races.  Another minor problem is the perpetual nighttime during gameplay.  Coupled with the brightly lit and highly detailed environment, it's sometimes too much to look at and the car can actually get lost in the overall scene.The controls are intuitive and well-designed.  One of my favorite features is the ability to use the right analog stick as the accelerator and brake.  Couple it with a manual transmission (shifting uses the L2/R2 buttons) and you've got a great amount of subtle control over your car.  It's not as good as playing with a wheel and pedals, but it really beats the usual x-and-square two-button setup (which is also available at all times if you prefer).Does it play a lot like GTA-lite?  Of course it does;  it's meant to do so.  There's a plotline running through the career mode focused on getting revenge on the rival who did you wrong before you landed in Bayview.  It's not as deep or sequential as the GTA missions, so you're free to do pretty much whatever you want in whatever order you want.  This can be good or it can lead to a lot of aimless driving around.The game also struggles a little bit with identity - what game does NfSU2 want to be?  It's not an exact sim like Gran Turismo, although you can certainly tune and tweak your car's performance options all day long if that's your thing.  The race action has a big-time arcade feel, but it's not simply an arcade racer because of the GTA-esque missions in career mode.  During some lulls in the action, you may find yourself wanting to pop this out in favor of one of those other games instead.Nonetheless, the good easily outweighs the bad in this good-looking and ultimately exciting racer.  It does a very nice job of satisfying fans of all flavors of driving games:  arcade, sim and mission.PROS*  Beautifully-rendered cars (and SUVs) that can be exhaustively customized in terms of looks and performs*  Exciting racing action with very little learning curve*  Well-designed controls make the most of the PS2 controllerCONS*  Too much time getting around the huge environment*  Notable lapses in realism, i.e. gigantic crashes with no consequences;  no cops at all (I guess then it would simply be a GTA clone)*  Lots of product placement gets a bit heavy after a while - meet me at Burger King, the garage is next to Best Buy, I'll call you on my Cingular wireless, etc.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2005"}

E Jackson","summary":"the final NES Mega Man game","reviewText":"Mega Man 6 marks the conclusion of the popular series on the NES.  By this point many fans were getting tired of the same old formula, however I'm an exception in that regard- a winning formula *never* gets old in my opinion.  I've always felt this way.  You could release 20 games in this same exact style and if I like the idea, I'll continue to play.However Mega Man 6 does have some minor issues.  The biggest being the emptiness you occasionally encounter in some of the stages.  It's more like large sections that feel like filler to dash through, which is a shame.  It reveals that Capcom was indeed running out of ideas by this point and simply putting MM6 on the market because it's Mega Man and it'd sell on the name alone.  The bosses aren't nearly as threatening as previous games either.  About half of them can be completed with little trouble, while the more aggressives one can be taken down by dashing around like crazy.  Not a problem however.  Easiness is rather encouraging after the struggles I had in, say, Mega Man 4.Pretty catchy music but nothing that blows me away.  The weapons are decent enough, but again, I can take or leave them.  Probably the most noticeable sign that Capcom was running low on ideas is, if you've ever played Mega Man X3, there's a Blast Rhino and Volt Catfish stage.  These two stages have similar enemies and design as a couple from THIS game.  So there you have it- a decent game that I'm being generous with giving it 4 stars when it probably deserves less, and a 5 is totally out of the question.  Fun, but the X series caught on soon after as gamers anticipated the Super NES Mega Man games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2012"}

I just recently played the game and i was really impressed  with the grafix and story of the game.  The weapons get better and choosing power ups is awesome.  It could only require 1 playthrough but i had to play the game on hard and not use a Vita Chamber.  This game should be played by all that enjoy a first person shooter for 100% chevo completion.  I heard their are 2 ending but i chose the good side both times.The bad: their are too many terminals than can be hacked in the game.  If you save your money you can just pay for the hack instead of the puzzle that is required.  Later in the game, you can have a tool that hacks the terminal but it is a 1 time use and you can only carry 5 at a time.  Terminals to be hacked are Security cameras, Turrets, Fliying Bots, Vending machins, Health stations and some doors.  You can just destroy the Terminal but if your playing on hard, they come in handy as they can kill splicers or do most of the damage.  Not to mention Big Daddys that require lots of ammo to kill.The game is set from the 1950's so dont expext high tech weapons but the plasmids make up for it.  Some of the weapons are revolver, rocket launcer, napalm gun, harpoon Gun, Shotgun and Harpoon Gun.  Each weapon has 3 types of ammo and each with a good use and chooting style.  Each of the weapons can be upgraded twice and they work better and looke better too.You must play this game and i hope this helps","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2010"}

Don't blast an arcade racer if you expected a sim!!","reviewText":"First of all, let's get something out of the way. This is NOT a racing sim; if you are look for a sim, get GT5. I see a ton of reviews that are unfairly negative simply because the reviewer/player did not take the time to research the game properly before purchasing. This is an arcade racer people! As long as you manage your expectations appropriately, this game will NOT disappoint.After playing the demo, I was not really blown away, but I decided to get this game anyways since I thoroughly enjoyed NFS: Shift, Burnout, and Split/Second. I felt confident that Criterion would pull off another gem, and I am not disappointed at all!At it's core, this game is an arcade game with very little customization options, which suits me just fine. I had never really enjoyed tweaking every last mechnical component to get the most out of the car (as you would do in past NFS or GT games). I just want to drive fast and take other drivers out, and this game let's me do just that. The best way to describe this game is a perfect mixture of Burnout Revenge and NFS: Shift. You are given an open world with various race types, and you earn experience by chasing down racers or shutting down racers, and the gameplay is fanstastically fun. The licensed cars are a ton of fun to drive, and the environment is beautifully-crafted with amazing detail, even with weather effects such as rain and thunder. In terms of visuals, Hot Pursuit is on par with that of Split/Second, which is another awesome arcade-style racer. Evading police units or taking out racers is amazingly exhiliarating. This game adds a level of depth and strategy by providing various tools such as spike strips, roadblocks, EMP, and jammers, which makes every race a unique experience.Online gameplay is pretty solid as well. Match-making is quick and provides unexpected outcomes every single time. My favorite mode, \"Hot Pursuit\", allows you to join 2 teams of 4, cops vs. racers, where the winning team gets extra bonus \"bounty\". All bounty collected online is combined with your career, which is great. There are other modes such as basic race and \"interceptor\" where you go head-to-head against one other player. These seem plain comapred to \"Hot Pursuit\" by far.In conclusion, if you are a game of arcade racing games and love to drive fast without needing to waste too much time customizing your ride, this is the game for you!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2010"}

Gamers assume the role of Marcus Reed, a former criminal turned cop, and use and abuse their authority to hunt down the murderer of Marcus' mentor while also cleaning up Manhattan neighborhoods from Harlem to Chinatown. Undercover investigations weave players through a murderous web of gangs and deceit as they battle crooks, Marcus' past and everything else the city throws at them.","reviewerName":"Marvin Powell","summary":"Somewhat Entertaining, but Ultimately Mediocre","reviewText":"Description of this game in one word: Mediocre.Okay, so most people expect a Grand Theft Auto copy when they think of True Crime: Streets of LA as well as this version, as well. In many regards, it is set up to be a similar game. But in all honesty, it just can't compare. But then again, what game can compare to Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, one of the best games ever made. And the Saint's Row franchise is the second best sandbox shooter out there. So, does that make True Crime: New York City the third best? I don't know, but if Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a 10 out of 10 and Saint's Row is about an 8.5 out of 10, then I'd have to say this game is maybe a 6. That's slightly, barely above average. In really, this game is just that. Average. Obviously, there's much better third person shooter/driver games out there, but I've also played much, much worse (like Crackdown).You play as thug-turned-detective Marcus Reed, trying to take down the major criminals of Manhattan island, as well as avenge the death of a fallen ally. You have a cast of colorful (but somewhat formulaic) characters to help you along your way. You can upgrade your stats and abilities via Detective ranks, starting out at 5 and going up to Rank 1, the highest detective rank (you can get in this game, anyway). Each rank boost unlocks new vechicles, weapons, and skills. Unfortunately, health is not one of the things that gets boosted. Manhattan island is completely street accurate, making it a HUGE video game city to explore, possibly the largest single city in any sandbox video game ever. Along Manhattan are various shops you can go to for various things. It's also unfortunate, though, that most all of them are not indicated on your map and aside from the gun shop, the ones that are are unimportant.As you explore Manhattan isle, you'll always get various police reports of crimes going on everywhere in the city. Aside from the main storyline missions, your job will be to clean up all 20 districts of the city, one crime at a time. Crimes generally start out small, based on how bad crime is in the district, and goes up as you improve the area. You'll start with Level 1 crimes like stopping bums from fighting and observing domestic fights and work your way up to Level 3 crimes, like stopping bank heists, taking down counterfeit money labs, and wiping out entire street gangsm at war. The amount of crime going on at any given time depends on how bad crime is in any district. If you're in East Harlem, for example, crimes will be happening all the time. But if you're in a safer area, like Midtown, however, crimes will be far less frequent. Each crime earns you Career Points that will affect your ranking boost, as well as your salary. Also given, is the oppurtunity to be a good cop, doing things by the book and ethically. Or a bad cop, playing by your own rules, and being ruthless, as well as lawless. Either method is your own choice. Also in the game are street races and fight clubs, scattered throughout, as well. They are part of cleaning up the city, as well. And you can buy different cars and fight techinques to help you on your way.So, with that said, here are all the good and bad points of True Crime: New York City.PROS:- The somewhat large number and diversity of crimes helps against repetition. Although some repetition is bound to occur.- Good enough balance between storyline missions, car races, bare-knuckle fight tournaments, and free-roaming crimes to take care of. There's always something to do.- The story is fairly good, making you want to play through the game to it's end, at least once.- The Street Races are actually quite fun (when the other cars aren't bumping into you, that is)!- The only video game to have a fully, street-accurate representation of Manhattan, New York City.- The Subway system (which actually has a different underground subway station for EVERY location) is a great way to get around the massive island of Manhattan, and most times, is much more effective than driving. Plus, it's cheaper than real life! In other games, it wouldn't be necessisary, but here, you need it.- A pretty decent number of weapons available, with various damage levels, firing speeds, and accuracy.- Pinpoint Targeting allows you to go for lethal shots or neutralizing shots, that stop a criminal in his or her tracks without killing them. However, you'll have to be at, at least Rank Level 3 to really take advantage of this.- \"Bullet Time\" fine aiming that slows time down to allow you to get in your precision shots.- The cars are pretty diverse and have fairly diverse stats.- This game actually has what too many sandbox titles skip on; First Person car driving! I especially like that as I really prefer to drive in the First Person view.- Good enough music soundtrack. Many Hip Hop and Rock songs from A-List talent, like Nas, Jay-Z, and My Chemical Romance, to name a few. Also, Blue Oyster Cult's \"Don't Fear The Reaper\"!CONS:- The multi-button controls are very confusing, at times.- Confusing double confirmation setup for selecting or buying things- The car physics are, for a game approaching a realistic type of feel, embarassingly unrealistic- It's way too easy to get to Detective Rank One and no increased difficulity between Ranks achievements- Button mistake/glitch in the Station Change and Car Horn (both being the Right D-Pad, instead of the horn being Down D-Pad) in motor vehicles- Sometimes, certain weapons are required for missions that you won't know about and can't get during the mission time- Sometimes, it's required to be non-lethal in crimes, but you aren't told when- Some Crime Alerts are much more important than others and can't be ignored, but you aren't told which are more important than others- No regenerating health in this game, in which it would be truly helpful!- The Map is off scale, which makes the pinpointed shops really out-of-scale with their location, making something that looks close by on the map actually being multiple blocks away- There's no actual clock in the game (at all), especially bad considering stores actually close at night!- Every single shop in the city has something different in them, which makes finding what you need in a city this big, a MAJOR hassle!- You can NEVER find the important things you need because most shops, including food/health stores, are not indicated on your menu screen map!- The traffic is really screwed up and almost always goes one-way, even in five-lane streets! (Meaning either dodging oncoming traffic, or being blocked by slow-moving vehicles in front of you!)- The weather system is off (it rains WAY too much! I thought this was New York, not Seattle!)- The clothing feature is pretty useless (The clothes all suck!)- Small and Major Crimes still occur in \"Cleaned up\" neighborhoods- It's way too easy to be a Bad Cop and much too hard to be a Good Cop- No real \"Landmarks\" to actually explore!- The weapon weilding and inventory system is pretty confusing- Weapon selection is set up very pretty poorly- You can't keep any weapons you get off of dead bodies- Most vehicles are very, very fragile and constantly need to be fixed at an Auto Shop- The cars have no names!- Shooting the enemy's tailpipe of their car can result in your Instant Death!- Horrible graphics- Much of the street-accurate Manhattan is just filler- A Random(?!?) In-Vehicle Music PlayerCONCLUSIONIn summary, True Crime: New York City is a fair GTA clone, but it's not really a serious competitor for the Rockstar title, at all. While they do make a good attempt at a quality game, the whole thing itself falls short of worth owning. Maybe a rental, and worth checking out if you're a fan of Sandbox shooter/driver games like me, but I can't really say it's worth owning. Unless you can get it for under ten dollars. It is, I'll say, at least better than the Scarface video game they released on the PS2. That game is much worse. True Crime: NYC is worth a nice check out for it's story if you've played everything else, but with so many problems and glitches in it, (the glitches I really didn't go into in much detail, but there are quite a few) I can't really say it's worth anything over Three Stars. Or a 6.5 out of 10. A nice story, good game elements, and a clear showing that some work actually went into this title, but at the end of the day, it still falls short of success, and has trouble being worthy to hang with the GTAs and Saint's Rows of the sandbox gaming franchise.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2009"}

I also had the previous systems for nintendo, including Gamecube, so I thought I could do without.I read about some of the exclusive games for Wii and I was curious to see how good it really is.  I ended up with a lucky deal, the console like new with a charger, games and 2 controllers all for under $100.  The Wii resort and sports were okay, fun but not that impressive.  Then I got Mario Galaxy and I can't stop playing it.  The 2 control idea is actually very fun and not annoying at all.In addition to all the Nintendo games I can play now like Donkey Kong, Zelda, and Wii Fit, the online store offers many of the old titles that I love from N64, SNES, NES, Sega, and a bunch of others.  My gamecube games are all playable on the Wii too, so I can now sell the cube for some money!One other thing that impresses me is that the Wii has HD capability.  If you buy a component cable instead of the original composite cable, the picture will be incredibly improved, almost like that of the PS3.A couple of things I did not like were for one: the games in the Wii store are very fixed on price like all games on N64 are $10 even games that should be cheaper, SNES games are $8.  In particular, pricing was an issue for Final Fantasy IV: The After Years (a game I've been dying to play) because you purchase the original story for $8 then each individual character story costs $3 and there are SEVEN. then there's the conclusion that also costs $8, totaling $37. Ridiculous because you can get the entire collection on PSP (new) for $25. Also they still need to add more games to the store because the selection is not perfect yet.In my opinion, some games are a bit overpriced, but not bad if you only buy some faves. But let me say this, the PS3 store, even though they offer many free stuff, are actually worse, in general.  But let's leave it at that.Bottom line, if you're a Nintendo fan and you're skeptical like I was, trust me, it's the best value for a system of the 3 (xbox, PS3).  You can play great games, use Wii ware apps similar to PS3s, and surf the web free.  It's really kind of fool proof because it is such a great value as a console.  In fact, I would give it 4 stars for the draw backs in the Wii Store, but I didn't pay enough to do that :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2011"}

Here are my thoughts on the SteelSeries Sensei Wireless Laser Gaming Mouse;Pros+ Textured rubber sides help keep your hand on the mouse even during the most frantic gameplay.+ Non-sweat surface is smooth while offering a good grip and is easy to clean.+ Steel Series logo and scroll wheel LED's illuminate a nice soft multicolor glow without heating up. They also have multiple levels of brightness and different lighting effects to choose from.+ Perfect mouse size makes it easily usable by both small and large hand types.+ Mouse lays flat in the charging base creating a perfect connection.+ Instantly adjust your DPI with the click of a button.+ Illuminated charging base notifies you when the mouse is beginning to lose power.+ Comfortable ergonomic design usable by both left and right handers.+ Usable as both wired and wireless.+ Quick and easy installation.+ Smooth glide movement.+ Lightweight construction.+ 8 programmable buttons.+ Quiet scroll wheel.+ Sleek design and simple look.Cons- Mouse uses Steelseries Engine 3.  If you have another Steelseries device that uses Steelseries Engine 2 it's incompatible with Engine 3 which forces you to run two different programs to customize your key binds and lighting effects.  For example I have theSteelSeries Apex Gaming Keyboardwith which I ran into this problem.- Non-standard USB plug on the head of the mouse so you can't just use any random USB cord.- Quite expensive with a list price of $159.99 and the overall construction feels a little cheap.- For a FPS player this mouse is great, but for an avid MMO player I feel it lacks buttons compared to many other gaming mice on the market.- No left-right click on the scroll wheel.- May be a bit too light for some users.The \"SteelSeries Sensei Wireless Laser Gaming Mouse\" is a solid and well designed mouse aimed towards the gamer but still usable by all. I actually began using this mouse at work as it has just the right amount buttons for my daily desk routine. Overall, the mouse has a comfortable ergonomic shape, numerous buttons and incredible accuracy. However, I do feel that this gaming mouse is better suited for the FPS player over an active MMO player due to its lack of buttons. The \"SteelSeries Sensei Wireless Laser Gaming Mouse\" is a respectable multi-functional gaming mouse which should please most average players while being equally functional for everyday use.  My only real gripe is the high retail.  However, if you're willing to drop the extra cash for this mouse chances are you won't be disappointed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2014"}

Includes a DVD remote control and an infrared receiver that plugs into an Xbox controller port.Note: this item is required for DVD movie playback on Xbox.","reviewerName":"Jeff Johnson \"Jeff Johnson\"","summary":"Does not play all DVDs, easy setup + controll","reviewText":"How this works is there is a little adapter, which plugs into any of the controller ports like an X-Box controller, then put two AAA batteries into the remote. Beware, because remember the X-Box is more like a computer and less like a DVD player. Why do you need to know that? DVD players can play any DVD, but computers only play DVDs with the country code of \"1.\" 1 is the country code for the DVD, which means that it was made for North American DVD players. So look at the back of your DVD cases down near the bottom where it says Dolby Digital look for a giant \"1.\" That means the X-Box can play it. Pretty much all DVDs come with the \"1,\" but some popular DVDs like Gladiator and the Simpson's Boxed set do not have the \"1.\"","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2001"}

{"product_name":"B00005TNI6","description":"Final Fantasy Xis the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"CG","summary":"Complex, Fun Role Playing Game","reviewText":"I enjoy role-playing games, and have for well over a decade. That being said, I'm not the kind of person who likes to have to learn entire new sports games or languages to figure out a game.FFX does not require that you learn all of its minutia to complete the game, but its amazing graphics and captivating storyline make you want to learn more and more about Tidus, Yuna, Wakka, and the other main characters. With the upcoming FFX-2, learning about Yuna in her first game will become all the more important.As much as I enjoy the lush graphics and amazing storyline, it seems that FFX is continuing a trend that began with FFVII and continued. The trend to which I refer is the gradual decline in fighting and increase in short dialog sequences that are not possible to skip. In FFX the first 2 hours seem more like the FF movie than a video game. This is great in terms of graphics, but bad for those of us who like to tear into the battle schemes and destroy some baddies!All in all, another great game that raises the graphical and plot bar for all other RPGs.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00004UE0V","description":"Lewis Carroll's 19th-century fantasy has been reinvented many times, most famously by Walt Disney. And now American McGee, one of the designers behind theQuakeandDoomseries, issues his addition to the Looking Glass legends withAmerican McGee's Alice. Players take on the role of a wiser, more industrious heroine who sets out in this third-person 3-D action game to free Wonderland from the tyranny of the Queen of Hearts. Alice will confront a host of weird creatures in surreal settings and solve numerous puzzles through more than 15 levels of gameplay.","reviewerName":"Knewace","summary":"American McGee's Alice","reviewText":"Alice is a third person game inspired by the Lewis Carroll classic. It is built on the quake3 engine, I played it on the default OpenGL video mode and it runs great. At first i did not like the game and did not finish it, but now i love it. The level design is excellent it is one of Alice's great strengths, The level design sure is fantastic and surreal, there are lots of unique touches to each level to keep things fresh. I did not like the weapons and the combat in the game but there are lots of puzzles in the game which are fun to solve. Alice is a really good game. The graphics are dated today but the gameplay is sweet. Buy it you will not be dissapointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2002"}
{"product_name":"B000FQBPCQ","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Great, Involving Gameplay for All Ages","reviewText":"Zelda Twilight Princess has been eagerly awaited by legions of Zelda gaming fans. This version features a more adult Link who rides a horse, swings a sword and saves the day.The title is available for both the GameCube and the Wii, and there are definitely some advantages with the Wii. First, you can see the game in 480p, which is DVD quality. It's not quite high definition, but it's still quite nice! Second, you get widescreen, which means you get much more game to see on the screen. Finally, you get to use the motion sensing controllers on your Wii to swing your sword, go fishing, aim your slingshot, and much more.First, the gameplay. Most gamers will be thrilled to hear that Link is less cartooney in this game. That's not to say it's a mature title - it's still a game without blood. You kill evil enemies who vanish in a puff of smoke. You go on a variety of quests, and it's very much good-against-evil. Rather, with this Link you're not a little 6 year old on a toy sailboat. Your Link is in his late teens, has his own house, owns a horse. He is harassed by three little tykes, but there's a certain young lady whose large eyes catch at Link's heart.In no time at all Link is out in a world which is not all butterflies and daffodils. There are dark things afoot in Hyrle. The land is covered in twilight, and you turn into a wolf to deal with the shadows. Your senses serve you well in this realm. It's not too scary for kids - but it gives the game much more depth for older players.The graphics are rather impressive for a Link game. Remember, the game is still a cartoon, so you're not seeing detailed tanks or the pores in the characters faces. The world you are in is stylized. There is plenty of detail in 480p - or even in regular TV resolution - to show the orange pumpkins, green vines, and fluffy white chickens which make up Hyrule. The water ripples, the dust billows and the fire flickers in the fireplace.How about the sound? The Link games were famous (or notorious) for the silly noises characters make. None talk. I suppose this makes it easy for them to convert the game to every language in the world - they just change the text out and are all set. Also, you can change your name and your horse's name without any speaking issues. The voices might not know how to pronounce \"Shadowfax\".Gameplay is just amazing in its length and depth. There are numerous worlds to traverse and dungeons to delve into. There are the standard collection of mini-games, quests, things to collect, puzzles to solve. You could easily play this for months and not be done. This isn't a game to race through to say \"I solved it\" and move on to something else. It's a world to immerse yourself in, to get to know every hill and dale, to track down those secret locations.I really like how the Wii controllers integrate into the game. It's not like you are using them constantly, getting exhausted with hand movements. Instead, you do a fair portion with the regular joysticks for fine movement. The joysticks are used in a more general way, for sweeping sword attacks or relaxing fishing. You can use small movements if you want - but it's much more fun if you get into the spirit of things and swing away. Just make sure you have that wrist strap properly connected!Downsides? The little \"he he he\" voices can get annoying quickly, especially if you are stuck on a puzzle and they are tormenting you. Sometimes the checkpoints send you back further than you might like.They do a good job of giving you little nudges if you get stuck, helping you figure out your way through the puzzles.In general, I think they struck a great balance between \"tame enough for younger kids\" and \"in depth enough for older players\". There are a lot of teen and adult Zelda fans out there, and they'll be quite pleased with what the game offers. This is definitely one of those must-have for gamers who like adventure games even the slightest!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2006"}
