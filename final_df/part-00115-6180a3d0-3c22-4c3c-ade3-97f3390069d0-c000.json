{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"Ferdy","summary":"Not What I Expected","reviewText":"LA Noire is a visually beautiful and very realistic looking video game.  The characters, locations, vehicles - everything is stunning. Beyond that, the game has some major issues.  I was excited at the prospect of getting to question suspects and really become a detective in solving a case.  The trouble is that the questioning does little to change the game play other than changing the suspects' responses.  Regardless of how well or how poorly your \"interrogation\" goes, the investigations all turn out the same.  It gets quite repetitive early on with every case ending in either a foot or car chase.  The main issue that I had with the game, however, is the amount of time each segment spends \"loading\".  You play the game for 2-3 minutes and then have to endure another 1-2 minutes of loading.  It really gets old especially when you're just about to start a chase after a suspect and have to sit in \"loading\" mode for 2 minutes.  It seems that the game developers spent all their time and energy on the graphics for this game and not enough time went into crafting the story and playability of this game.  So, is it worth buying?  I would suggest going for a used version or renting this one rather than buying.  I'm glad that I had the chance to play it just for the stunning visuals but it's not something that has any real re-play value. There are better games available for the money if you're looking to spend $40-$50.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001YHX4B0","description":"Blurring the borders of good and evil, this cinematic and stylized adventure stars Bayonetta, a heroine bent on sending supernatural forces to the depths of hell. Armed with her four enchanted guns known as Scarborough Fair, she battles both monstrous behemoths and angelic enemies. By combining special magic attacks, summoning primal forces and unleashing devastating weaponry, she impressively punishes anyone who gets in her way. From its fluid and intuitive combat system to its gripping story line, Bayonetta is one action thriller that won't disappoint.Unleash your powersView larger.Amazing graphicsView larger.","reviewerName":"Review Lover \"ReviewLover\"","summary":"Meh....","reviewText":"I am reminded of that house repair scene from the movie \"Elvira: Mistress of the Dark\", where Elvira advises one of the conservative neighborhood kids, to \"grab a tool and start banging!\". Anyone can pick up Bayonetta and clear the first few levels without breaking a sweat - it's an easy game to get into.Overall, it's a strange fish. On one hand, the demented coolness of the game's design ( at EVERY level: where else would you play as a woman who wears her own hair, murders Angels, lives on a plane of reality between heaven and hell, has amnesia, and has no need of gravity, but does require spectacles and a mafioso chauffeur?) and the immediacy of the gameplay could make it a total winner, an instant classic.On the other hand, the elitist combat system and the rough-in-closeup graphics spelled doom for many games before it, so why bother with purchasing this one?Furthermore, isn't the PS3 choc-full of story-driven third person action games anyway? As in, besides the highly original game design, what is there to really set Bayonetta apart from her competitors?As it turns out, not a lot. But it's really a question of personal taste, and you, like me, may find Bayonetta just isn't what you were looking for. Or like the majority, you may just love it. Read on...GRAPHICS: 3/5The entire game design is exquisite: from characters to bosses, to NPCs to lowly enemies, the level of detail crammed into everything which moves is insane. Bayonetta herself is beautiful (although the hair-as-clothing thing is gimmicky and dull after a while, particularly when it adds nothing to the story or the gameplay) and the animation is excellent - not just simple mocap, the game's creators have gone to great pains to ensure that every character in this game moves with a personality and signature of its own.The backdrops are weak - lo-res textures slapped on to low-poly roughly modeled walls, cars, etc. - and for much of the time, the overcomplicated enemy design and sheer volume of individual elements on the screen will make it difficult to see what you're actually doing. The camera often works against you: redeems itself during cool wall-walking sequences, only to revert to its unhelpful self during the next major battle. Overall, visually, Bayonetta is a bit of a mixed bag - albeit an extremely well-designed one - but come ON, Obsidian. Camera issues shouldn't happen on prestige A-list releases in 2010.SOUND: 2/5The voice acting stinks and the game does little to set itself apart aurally, other than repeat a hideous discofied version of \"Fly Me To The Moon\" during one early battle sequence. Standard battle clashes and grunts abound, there's nothing new here. While the audio elements of Bayonetta are bog-standard, there's little to actually criticize - but it's a real missed opportunity to provide a fully immersive gameplay experience.PLAYABILITY: 3/5An extreme awareness and mastery of the game's complex control system are required to really make a dent in the hordes of angels you will be asked to cut down. This is where Bayonetta loses its appeal somewhat - the nature of the gameplay is dictatorial, and doesn't really allow you to think outside the box and come up with a strategy which suits the player. As with the Devil May Cry series before it (try to spot the parallels! There are MANY!!), there are places where Bayonetta is too demanding for its own good, and you really do need to be in the mood for its rigors. Failure to dodge successfully is punished with a disproportionate loss of health, and the price of health items is ridiculously high, when taking into consideration the even-higher cost of weapon upgrades, which are a must for game progression.This is certainly a game you can pick up and put down - but also a game which severely punishes the user for doing so. Bayonetta is not for the casual gamer, yet its game mechanics and short levels belie this fact. You'll need a lot of dedication before mastering its intricacies, and you need to do this to minimize the levels of frustration you feel while playing. Whether you enjoy Bayonetta's personal style, and can accept its occasional graphical and aural shortcomings during this learning process, is very much up to you. Me, I like a little more encouragement in the form of interesting characters or cool plots, if I'm to stay engaged at this level (Devil May Cry 3, InFamous, Resident Evil 4&5, etc).Oh! One final thing: even with the game data installed on my PS3 HDD, the Load times are RIDICULOUSLY often, and RIDICULOUSLY long. Get comfy....LASTIBILITY: 2/5Besides enjoying the game's design and the overall sense of participating in a crazed dream, there's little to bring you back to the town of Vigrid or to Bayonetta herself. Completist players may choose to run through the game twice, just to grab everything, but beyond that, Bayonetta is very much a one-trick pony. Story-wise, there's not much new on offer, and in the worst case scenario, your frustration may force you to return the game before completing it once.OVERALL: 2.5/5Bayonetta suffers from the same issues as Devil May Cry 4 before it: it's essentially a souped-up PS2 action game with superficial graphical tricks, that is too demanding for the rewards it offers. It's tough to stay engaged with the repetitive combat and demanding control system, simply because Obsidian hasn't put enough personality into its heroine, or effort into the game's plot. Yes, it is enjoyable - but for my money, I'd either rent it first, or else put my $60 towards a PS2 and Devil May Cry 1 and 3. Those games were as tough, as demanding - but with a personality and a plot all of their own. Bayonetta IS good - but sadly, not good enough.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2010"}

It's time to kick, punch and pummel those polygons, available only for the Game Boy Advance.","reviewerName":"Sixto Limiac","summary":"Not a Revival of Tekken Paradise and No Where Near Justice","reviewText":"Let's freely admit it.  Profess it!  THE FUTURE IS HERE!  Technical advancements are screening throughout the world, and not I`m not rambling about nanomachines or emigrational space travel, I`m aimed at the Gaming Industry (note the capitalization.  Oh yeah, it's that huge.)  Face it, the GBA -- in all its rights -- comprises extraordinary brilliance.  Many deemed Tekken's conversion on  the GBA to be an ungodly Fighter, and get this (you can bite down on your pillow now), they were absolutely, positively on que.  Bashed in it are horrendous moments of frustration.  Okay, so the greatest future isn't actually here, and by the effort of Namco, gaming is not at its finest.No, Tekken Advance is not a revival of the Tekken paradise, but it thrashes Mortal Kombat in every direction.  With GBA limitations, the leap from the massive 3D environments to 2D was Namco's hardship.  The GBA tries its best to capture the essence of Tekken and crashes.  Consisting of only 10 lousy fighters, the controls on each character have obviously been tweaked into a condensed format.  Single punch, kick, throw, and tag buttons are dished up on a skyrocketing discomfort level.  Because of the lost of the essential control scheme, the moves list was trimmed down to simplified, sluggish combos.  Worst, the AI is a recurring challenge and heavy with bevy combos.  Missing the intensity of a hardcore fighter, the repeated combo-jumble fighting proves to be nothing more than a disgrace. On a happier note (the reason for that extra star), the controls are extremely responsive and the directional pad is just as splendid, letting players easily walk, dart, hop, and backpedal.  On the whole the gameplay tries to deliver an adequate amount of mayhem.  Easily unraveled by the range of modes from previous installments, such as the Arcade, Survival, and Tag Battle, this repulsive remake deserves no credit, because this one was never meant to be.Graphically, Tekken Advance looks to be infected with a deadly case of visual disgust.  Look at this thing, it keeps a doleful cast of pre-rendered fighters who have faces of callousness.  The colorful backgrounds are ruined by jerky animation and smudged texturing.  Even when combos go a-thundering-in, the graphics transform into a squalid pigpen.  Tekken Advance, by screenshots, appeared to have taken complete usage of the GBA's full capacity, but is nowhere linked to the mighty emphasis of past games.  Tenements of the franchise strictly belong to the console market, and Namco falls extremely short to do justice on their handheld attempt.  Mark my words, 3D Fighters belong on specialized 3D formats -- otherwise known as the PS2, GameCube, or X-Box.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2002"}

In fact they seem to be worse than BF3 with clipping and glitches to be found everywhere.I enjoy playing the campaign in shooters while many others go right into multiplayer. I have nothing against that but I prefer to experience both to feel I've gotten my money out of a game. The campaign in BF4 is terrible. The missions are hit and miss and uninspired, the story is terrible and the characters are boring stereotypes with no character development. In fact the majority of the story makes no sense any almost no explanations are given for characters at all. A game of this magnitude should have top notch online and offline play and this one doesn't.Online play isn't bad, considering this is a game made for next gen with 64 player maps. The PS3 and 360 consoles are limited to 24 player maps, but that isn't bad. The maps I've played so far are interesting with lots of firing positions and hide spots. I've not found camping to be as bad as BF3 but I assume its just a matter of time. The ability to spawn in different areas is an improvement over BF3 though. The classes are the same and the guns are new, but really no different than anything previous.I don't think this game was worth the $60 I paid for it. Which is similar to how I felt about BF3, yet I bought BF4 anyway. I will keep it around to see how multiplayer develops but at least on the PS3 the game just feels like more of the same, or worse, just average. I am hoping that CoD Ghosts will be able to give me my FPS fix when it releases next week. I wish I'd saved the money and just waited a week.

Now comes an addition to the roster: Rubi Malone who is the featured gun-for-hire in Bethesda's WET, an highly intense 3rd person shoot em up that may seem derivative as it had borrowed from previous games; stranglehold, tomb raider and even prince of Persia but there's still enough originality to stand out on its own mostly due to the fact that it's one of the first games to pay homage to the grindhouse genre. (Grindhouse are B movie exploitation films that for the most part consist of violent revenge flicks, kung fu films and Blaxploitaation cinema.)After a few introduction gunfight scenes/playthroughs (the freeway chase comes to mind.) the game's story really takes hold rubi is paid to apprehend an aging mobster's son only to find out that she has been double crossed and is now out for revenge.The gameplay itself is basically utilizing two hand pistols, shotguns, sub machine guns and a crossbow while demonstrating a few acrobatic skills. (running alongside walls, swinging on overhead bars, rebounding from enemies and navigating a few environmental puzzles.) The more stylized moves you can pull off, the higher your score tallies at the end of each stage.(To break the monotony, rubi uses a sword for melee attacks ala kill bill)That being said, it's important that you attain a high score so that you can purchase upgrades be it weapons or acrobatic skills. These definitely will come in handy as the game further progresses.The game itself is very reminiscent of directors Quentin Tarantino, Sergio Leone, Robert Rodriguez, John Woo and to a lesser extent Don Siegel which is a complement within itself. (there's even an Asian rock lounge scene that was inspired by QT's Kill Bill.)When it comes to aesthetics, despite the cool film scratch filter (it makes the game look as if you were actually playing a Grindhouse movie.) the graphics are somewhat dated and rough around the edges especially in regards to the in game characters. However, the voice acting and especially the psychobilly soundtrack makes up for the lackluster eye candy.Unfortunately,  WET has garnered a few not so good reviews X-Play had given it two stars but that's nothing new since they are notoriously known for awarding low scores for games that were actually fun. (Darksiders and Jericho come to mind) sometimes, I think they only play most games for under an hour only to give harsh rush judgment opinions.One caveat, if you are expecting some kind of epic ending you may be in for a disappointment because once you go through a final boss battle that consists of a few quick time events, that's it. Unapologetic and abrupt with a usual question mark before the credits roll. (Great ending song BTW!!)If you are looking for a bargain priced action shooter, you can't go wrong with this  game.In a oversaturation of shooter games, Rubi is a Diamond in the rough.Bottom line: Get WET!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2010"}

The reason: there is a new Metal Gear, codenamed Ray, as it's cargo. Just as our boy Snake gets on board, the entire ship is brutally taken over by terrorists of Russian decent. Just as Snake makes his way to the bowels of the ship where it's cargo is being held, and after a moment of intensity between the Marines and terrorists, Revolver Ocelot jumps into Ray and sinks the ship killing everyone and spilling oil everywhere.... skip a few years ahead and we find ourselves controller a new comer named Raiden as he sneaks into a huge facility in the middle of the ocean called \"The Big Shell\" which was built to contain the oil spill Ocelot caused..and which has also been taken over by Russian terrorists. Raiden's original mission objectives are to rescue the hostages of Big Shell, but as the game moves on Raiden must stop the demented FOXHOUND unit and put an end to the Metal Gear Ray project.For once you can go into first person view to manually aim in MGS2: Substance, which is really helpful. You can jump over railings and hang over ledges to hide from hostiles, you can roll to knock them down, and you can do the infamous melee combo to knock 'em out. Both as Raiden & Snake you collect a lot of weapons including a tranq gun, a SOCOM handgun, an \"adult entertainment\" magazine, an assault rifle, chaff & frag grenades, a sword and many more. You can actually swim in this game which is a real plus. Now you can \"hold up\" terrorists for their dog tags... not really important but pretty fun. At one point you'll find yourself running around disarming bombs all throughout Big Shell which was kinda fun.. thought I'd mention that.Oh yes, this is the first game where if you take down an enemy or are spotted, back up actually comes. They use radioes to contact each other, and if you are really good at aiming, can destroy their radio. It was a neat little idea.What really seperates Substance from the original Sons of Liberty is it's huge VR mission system, and the mini games \"Snake Tales\". We'll start with the VR missions - there are probably over 100 of them since you have to play a bunch with Raiden, Snake, Pliskin, Snake in different suits, etc. These missions can range anywhere from \"use stealth to get to the end\" all the way to \"snipe all the enemies who come near the curry\". If properly completed you unlock a mini game where you can skateboard as Snake.. meh. \"Snake Tales\" stars Snake in various missions on Big Shell.. thats really it.I'm gonna be straight with you guys - MGS2: Substance has amazing graphics and even better music. Everything in this game looks so real and textured.. it's really beautiful for the PS2. I mean seagulls actually do their business on Big Shells roof and you can slip on it, how much more realistic can you get?? The music is superb.. words can't even explain it. Sometimes you'll feel depressed (when he time calls for it) orfeel pumped up for a big battle through the music..truley helps the overall feel & atmosphere of the Substance.Characters... FOX-HOUND (and MGS2 in general) have some real entertaining characters to say the least, all with a fictatious background that is pretty miserable to say the least. The best is Fat Man because hes fat, roller blades, is funny, and plants bombs all over the place. You'll meet up with a familiar ninja ;), the daughter of someone who died on the Marine tanker, Otacon's sister who is just as lame and annoying as Otacon himself, and many more.The only downfall is the length of the game and the story near the end of the game. The ending was so confusing I don't even get it... as your running around your getting codec calls from Colonel Campbell saying, \"Go ahead and take a rest, I'll save your game. Turn it off.\" or \"Hari Kari Siscors 69!!\"... then it turns out everything is a VR mission? Lame. Also there is A LOT, and I stress A LOT, of talking in this game. It's rumored that about 2/3 of the actual game is talking.This review is too long for it's own good, so I'm gonna sum it up now - if your a fan of the Metal Gear Solid games or if you really enjoy sneaking around...or talking....you have to play this game. It's fun, has awesome graphics & music, and it's a pretty cheap game nowadays. Go for it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2006"}

Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"James P.","summary":"Not enough to turn things around","reviewText":"This game was a good effort, but it wasn't enough to turn things around for the Turok series.

I did not purchase Battlefield 4 on release day as I wanted to hear some reviews first. As the reviews were initially horrible, I was thankful I went with Ghosts first. After the game updates and patches were released I started hearing the true story of how good this game is.What they did Right!+ Spectacular graphics. Very realistic and the attention to detail of the little things and objects in the environment were amazing.+ Decent story which kept me interested, yet not deep enough to get confusing.+ Solid voice acting and over-all game flow. Keeps interesting and moving along well.+ The weapons are great. Each level has a weapon or two which is hidden, find it, unlock it and use it.What they did Wrong!- Way too Short. Seems like they cut the game up so they could have a bunch of add-on levels.- The 3 endings are all bad and very anticlimactic. Disappointment and left you wanting more- Your squad mates get in the way often. If you find a nice spot to duck in, a squad mate can push you out of that spot if they are programmed to go there too. Also when walking down tight halls, they can push you or you can get stuck.- Too often you're just waiting around for the other characters in the game to stop talking so you can move on to the next area.- Lots of glitches with trophies. I had to reload and replay a few levels, then like magic like 8 trophies which should have popped earlier popped. Besides that, it is a solid stable game (after the update). It did not freeze up or shutdown on me once.Over-all, I enjoyed it move than Call of Duty: Ghosts because I enjoyed the realism and spectacular graphics and lighting effects.Very highly recommended.PSN: adrielaugust","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2014"}

Another little cute set up is that instead of having a colored wii remote and a white motion plus block connector on the bottom you now just have a one color remote without it looking a little disjointed a big plus.

{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Mathew Reuther \"author\"","summary":"Highly Touted, Hyped, and Oh Yeah: All-Too-Often Unplayable","reviewText":"The game is reasonably fun (three stars, might push into four) but it's completely unplayable. For a game where you kill creatures and collect loot, you'd expect that you could just pay sixty bucks and do so. Not so much, actually. The fact that this game is Online ONLY means that as longs as the servers are running well and turned on, you may play. But should the company decide to shut off access to the game for any reason, you have a worthless piece of software on your hands.To be brutally honest in single player this game is no better than Torchlight (which retails for far less), and I strongly suspect that Torchlight's sequel (to be released in 2012, for a third of Diablo III's price tag) will at least equal it's co-op with the addition of multiplayer action to that series.I cannot recommend buying this game (which is honestly rare . . . I can only think of a handful of other titles in the past couple of decades that I felt this strongly about) at this point.This is the largest failure of the single player portion of a game due to technical reasons (note: not game design ones, I've seen enough in the Beta which was playable to know that it's an average action-RPG, hack, slash, loot, that's what they're all about) that I have ever seen. It rivals the worst of the multiplayer debacles I have witnessed as far as launches go, however.As a longtime fan of the series (I played the betas and release versions of Diablo and Diablo II) I can say that I am deeply disappointed.If you have 60 bucks and have already purchased a load of other games and really just can't find anything better to do and really absolutely MUST buy? Drop the money. If not, don't bother. There's a lot more games out there that offer you better, more innovative gameplay and do not cripple you by forcing you to always be online.(This review is being updated as the release continues.)Day two shows improved uptime, but reinforces how glaringly poor a decision it was to rely upon an online-only model. Server performance is wildly variable. Playing in single player mode, a gamer can find themselves rubber-banding across the screen and unable to properly enjoy the experience. (At this time I think that people engaging in Hardcore game play are quite simply insane.) There may be a greater opportunity to play now than there was on the release date itself, but the fact of the matter is that the technical experience is greatly sub-par for the genre. This review remains a one-star as a result.(continued again)The end of day two on into the third day of release shows massive lag issues continuing randomly when starting new games. You can swap characters from being \"lag-free\" (no more than moderate latency) and end up hopping and skipping all over the screen as you move between the stash and the smith with the next character. A single player experience in a normal game in the genre is latency-free because it is handled locally. You don't happen to just die because the server hiccups. (Like I said: if you're one of the people playing hardcore I'm convinced you're a madman at this point.)Even should this issue be resolved, there's still the persistent fact that if you are not connected to the net for any reason whatsoever (and that does happen, as I have stated above) you simply cannot play. This alone knocks points off the game, and as Blizzard has no intention of changing that, I see no reason why this review will ever rise above a three star. (And at that point I'll be generously forgiving its mediocrity combined with its technical faux pas . . .)Further gameplay has revealed more mediocre skills and a distinct lack of balance between classes. Some of them are an absolute breeze, never even being touched. Others are forced to get in, mix it up, and get slapped around . .  go figure which one is which . . . unless this somehow miraculously changes deeper into the game I anticipate some of those achievements will be pretty difficult to unlock indeed . . .(final update)Day three. Continuing issues. Major latency problems. Client/server asset disputes. Random errors preventing connections. Disconnects still abound. (Mind you we're seeing these issues NOT during prime time . . . so supposedly when the load would be lighter they STILL suffer from these problems.)The game gets a three star rating from me, period. It lost a full star for the technical issues. (Those issues will never go away. they are not launch issues. They are design decisions deeply ingrained in the way Blizzard has chosen to do things. I am not reacting to the bad launch. I am seeing where this will continue to be a problem forever.) It gets a total of four stars excluding technical issues because it is decent and entertaining, but it is by no stretch a five star game. For that you need a lot more than Blizzard has given us with this title.My final say is this: if you really need a new Action RPG and cannot wait for something better, then go for it. I would suggest the following titles be purchased before this one, however: Torchlight, Borderlands (plus all DLC/GotY edition), Titan Quest (plus expansions) and, if it's released by the time you read this review, Torchlight 2. ALl of these cost less than D3 and are at least as good if not better games, and none of them have the technical issues that D3 has.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2012"}

The nice feature for this is you will hardly see a patch as its all in house and they know everything that is going on in the game. Also this will prevent hacking that is so prominent in the older titles.Now to the game play.This is a hack in slash game that its main game play is collecting the best stuff to do it again, but harder difficulty.  What is nice about doing this is you can play up to four people and the game makes it harder per person that joins.  Also the map generator is still in the game as in previous titles, just not in main story mode places.The the auction house is really nice if you just cant find that level 30 item you need because you cant find anything better then what you found at level 18.

Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"Great action thrill ride with a good story for dirt cheap!","reviewText":"I'll admit honestly I was not a fan of the original God of War. All my friends felt as if I was \"whacked\" for not seeing it as the best game of the year. They might have been right but the point was I hated playing button mash mini games just to beat the bosses and Kratos seemed like a muscle bound tough agro kid on roids.Yes he has a good reason for being angry, psychotic, and sad. Ares made him kill his own family. This is why he agreed to help the gods if they wiped his memory of what he had done. Yet throughout the whole game Kratos was a prick. Imagine the jock you knew in high-school that stuffed you in lockers just for fun, add red paint over part of his face and bam, you have GOW's protagonist!Fast forward and we come to God of war 2. The thing the second GOW does better is everything is balanced. You do not have to tap the \"o\" button quite as many times to rip a head off or ram your weapons down a Minotaur's throat. The button mash sequences also seem more forgiving and in most battles it seemed like if you got the sequence wrong enough it would finally make the combination easier.GOW 2 like its' predecessor has a good story line. Kratos is tricked by Zeus and loses all his powers thus must get the help of Gaia and the titans to regain his throne. While this may sound straight forward and lack luster the way it is done is truly brilliant.The areas are much more expansive and awe inspiring and between levels sometimes requires you fight ariel foes on the back of a fiery winged Pegasus. Puzzles are normally a bit tough but in a fun way. A little common sense can take you a long way and it is normally the simplest solution that is the right one.As before you get to upgrade your weapons by collecting red orbs and as before you have heavy attack combos (less swings but more devastating) and light hit combos (farther reaching, more strikes, but do less damage.)For those like me who  were frustrated \"normal creatures\" could kill you cheaply with a single attack there is less of that now. Whereas before you seemed forced to slay the monsters a particular way now it is your preference. You can still do instant brutal elite kills if you mash all the right buttons but you can also opt to pummel them by throwing your chained blades around until your foes hit the dirt. Yes, GOW 2 is a bit more forgiving on the casual gamer. While it is challenging is does not feel impossible. This is further implemented by more check points and save points.As you can expect there are spells and other weapons. The barbarian's hammer is a slow but high damage slugger and you can also do feats such as slowing time, summoning shock bolts, boosting your attack proficiency by utilizing rage of the titans, Icarus's wings allow you to gracefully glide over longer distances, as well as turning foes to stone by using a gorgon head. None of this is super innovative but it is fun.One thing GOW as a series can be commended for is it truly is like those 2d plat-formers of the past. You do a lot of sliding down ropes, net climbing,swimming,jumping from plat form to plat form, pulling levers, and falling to your demise down bottomless pits. It's good to know the team saw the greatness of super mario bros., the old castlevanias, as well as Contra. To take what we loved about the retro age and apply it into 3-dimensions is admirable.So is Kratos anymore sympathetic to the audience? Likely not. This game comes off as being so manly it is extremely homophobic in its' over the top violence and blatant nudity but it is all so well done no one will care. The music and visuals are stirring and vibrant able to compete with today's top dogs in the action genre even though by most standards the ps-2 is a dead system.If you have a ps-2 collecting dust there is no reason to neglect it any further if you have not purchased GOW 2. I got my copy for $9.95 and its' a greatest hit. Even if you are a penny pincher this game will not set you back one bit. Considering most of today's games can range up to $60.00 a pop this is a literal god send if you're bored and don't have much money to throw around.Pros+More forgiving to casual gamers unlike its' predecessors.+Better enviormental designs.+Puzzles are fun and not overly complex+Button mash mini games are easier+A large assortment of cool bosses. Also expect to see some familiar faces from the past.+Old school plat-former action brought perfectly into 3 dimensions.+A riveting story of tragedy, betrayal, and loss that uses Greek mythology as an effective back bone.+Aphrodite and those two sultry kinky muses. Nuff said.Cons-Kratos is awesome but he is still a jerk. This is not a role-model for adults OR kids. He has likely spawned some \"Kratos spaz-boys\" across the internet with the maturity ratio of 9 year old boys who got done watching Rambo movies back to back. Still I rather deal with Kratos imitators than those annoying new-wave Joker nuts.-I love the violence and nudity but I am able to admit it is a bit over the top. This game has a big case of \"homophobia extreme\" making you question if Kratos loves men in togas but still screams at the top of his lungs he is the best gift to women since Casanova. Doth protest too much Spartan?_If you liked GOW for the fact it was teeth gnashing hard GOW 2 may let you down a little in the challenge department.-There are more puzzles so if you are an action junky I understand your pain. Despite that this is still a thrill-ride so don't pass it up regardless.-Some gods and goddesses do not have much to do with the actual story. Aphrodite is seen in a messed up vision sequence in the beginning and Hades is in a battle scene with Titans but does not pop up later. If some of the deities were not important why even have them listed in the manual?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2008"}

All of the recent reviews on Amazon pretty much have the same short, vague, generic script.  They appear to me to be fake.  If you look at the profiles of the people, you can see they either copy-and-paste the same brief language on multiple products (ie, \"Bought this [insert type of product] for my son and he loves it...\" etc), or they only posted the one review for this game.  I have no idea how to report this to Amazon since I don't know if it violates any sort of terms of service or could even be remedied, but it is pretty messed-up since it defeats the entire purpose of allowing comments on a product.SO... all I can say is read the slightly longer reviews if you are interested in this game.  Maybe not mine because it is now novel-length, but basically I would suggest taking a random sampling of reviews for the game by looking at reviews with SPECIFICS as to why people liked or hated the game.  The game still sounds like it is not worth paying the price for.**End of final update, 1st update below*****1st Update 11/29/13**I sold Ghosts last week and it is gone from my home, for which I am happy, and I have deleted the information from my PS3 so zero space, physical or data, would be taken up further by this game. Do not buy this game for $60. I tried and tried to find a way to make this game fun, and just could not. I changed this game to 1-star overall too, since it is simply not a well-made (solid) game in terms of its basic game play.People can keep whacking my review here, but not even a \"COD fanboy\" should be supportive of this product, if anything they should be even more disappointed. Perhaps IW have since released enough patches for the game to make it is more fun then it was last week before I got rid of the game, but releasing an unprepared game itself is enough reason to not support a series further.Campaign mode was terrible for reasons I mentioned below (I did not bother finishing it), Extinction was immediately boring and made me miss the offline challenge modes from MW2 & MW3 even more, the free DLC map that came with ordering through Amazon did not work for online multiplayer with the main rotation, the online maps are at PS1 levels in terms of load times, even the bots which I thought MIGHT be the saving grace for a few more weeks of this game were difficult to kill since once again the screen just seems SO zoomed-out and hard to see guys.It is truly a remarkably crappy game considering it is a billion-dollar game, I think. And I am SURE they are well aware of it, and maybe like the big banks they just don't care since people will still buy it and sing the praises.This and Homefront are the two biggest wastes of money I feel I have ever spent on a major brand video game (or game with major advertising blitz) (since the PS1/N64 days). I have been playing FPS games since \"the old days\" (Wolfenstein on the computer, then Medal of Honor on PS1), so maybe a decade & a half now, and I realized the same thing as with Homefront: this was not fun. It was not a fun game. And a game that is not fun is not a game worth paying hard-earned money for.**End 1st Update, original review below**Original review:After having played a bit since its release date both offline campaign mode and online mode, I'm just already tired of this game and wish SINCERELY I had not spent $60 on it. It MIGHT be a fun-enough $20, I guess, but unless you are a diehard fan of the series, this is definitely not worth paying $60 for new, particularly if you are more of a casual gamer.My pros are: 1. the multiplayer maps look pretty and the height & added interactive map features of many of the levels are cool, 2. the player customization is cool.  That pretty much concludes my positive thoughts, unfortunately.Campaign:Call of Duty: Ghosts gets pretty much the same review as Homefront, which was the previous biggest video game ripoff I've played.

Korea was already taken previously by Homefront as a good new enemy...?) and you're basically playing every level from every other game you've ever played in any other FPS game.It feels like these games are becoming more and more you are just a spectator, playing an interactive movie. That was my problem with COD MW3 - you just back off and let your squad do all the work, and it's not as though you have much of a choice. You get hit once by some random bullet you don't know where it came from, and you have to hide so you don't die, and then either it happens again once \"blood vision\" goes away, or your squad has all the fun for you and kills everyone. AND YOU GET HIT BY RANDOM BULLETS OFTEN, so you are thus having to HIDE often to keep from dying.And the amount of times my squad would get in my line of fire drove me CRAZY.  When I wanted to, you know, play the game, like, shoot the bad guys with my guns, my squad would run in front of me a lot of times, making me shoot them as well as the enemy.  More then a couple times did I get whatever the \"friendly fire will not be tolerated\" is screen.  That felt like Homefront-levels of AI poorness of quality.Getting repeatedly killed by sharks was both an extremely random addition to the game (though not as random as controlling Lassie) and really really irritating.  The prerequisite chopper and tank levels are also irritating and you can't wait until they're over.There are so many levels where they just kind of throw you at them, throw you into them, they last a few minutes, then they are over as quickly as they started, leaving you going, \"...ohhhhkayyy...that level happened and is now over...\"  You never fully get immersed into the game, and you end up feeling like you just want to play it to beat it so it's done and so you are then one thankful step closer to chalking the game up as a financial loss and pawning it/trading it in.Ultimately, like Homefront, the campaign mode is hard enough in the wrong ways that it is tedious and simply unsatisfactory.  The high point for me was probably the semi-stealth jungle portion, which lasted about ten minutes, but they were somewhat enjoyable ten minutes.  I just killed everybody.  It made it fun, I was in control of the game for that period without my AI fellas taking over and doing everything, and the enemy didn't automatically see me because I was, well, in the jungle.  But then I remember the shark part and go back to shaking my head and thinking about the $60+ I spent on this game again.Multiplayer (Online, ugh):The way they did the maps in multiplayer, it is like Battlefield in that... you cannot see your enemies. This game is far worse than any other I've played online in how you die extremely quickly. Half the time you never see the person who shoots you.  It seems like it is full of either snipers or stabbers.  I doubt it would be very hard for a first-time player to get 100 deaths in their first 8 times trying.The people who enjoy sprinting through levels stabbing are as always incredibly annoying - that is about as cocky as you can get, and seems like either a twisted way to approach a video game, or perhaps desperate I suppose if you're sick of getting quick-scoped. And Quickscopers in this game... ugh.  You just see a person and you die.  It's just not that fun.  It is WAY too easy to die in this game (that goes for campaign mode too).  \"Realism\" should always be balanced with FUN in video games, with fun always being the key goal.  And frankly many of the kills I have gotten have been by me spawning behind someone who obviously has no idea I am suddenly there.  It's not a satisfactory way of killing someone, but then you figure it happens to you every other time so whatever.  Ugh.I find myself \"rage-quitting\" often, because this is a VIDEO GAME and I bought it TO HAVE FUN, not to constantly get screwed.  They MUST make these games for people who are more CASUAL gamers too, besides people who apparently have the time to just do nothing but play these video games online for hours and days at a time. Seeing some of the score and point skews of the winners is pretty pathetic.  I'm sure people cheat with this game, but who knows how, and who has the time or energy to really investigate much further, other than to just report sociopathic people (why else cheat, and then try to justify it and make it the problem of those who play honestly, as all cheaters do?) who are clearly too good, of cheating.If you are a casual gamer, like you just like to play every few evenings a week for a couple hours, you will not enjoy this game for its multiplayer - do not spend $60 on this game.  It's been literally just one week since the game was released and there are already players at the very least at Level 58 that I have seen.Multiplayer (split screen, boo!):One of the biggest disappointments of all to me personally, is that they got rid of the offline multiplayer challenge modes that made COD MW2 and 3 so fun and re-playable for those of us with actual friends in the real world we like to hang out with and play these games with. Instead they brought in some zombie-like alien mode that I have not yet tried because what is the point.  Playing next to a friend the screen feels like it's zoomed-out somehow, maybe because it's more stretched wide, where it is just more difficult to see.Further thoughts/rants:I don't know if it's the developers or who, but this game is another over-priced disappointment, for me the biggest one since Homefront. The graphics do not seem that impressive, everything else is pretty unoriginal, and online play is pretty bad unless you have some mega-100\" giant screen or I guess are a person who gets to just play all day and is on high volumes of caffeine or something.Angry review. I won't give this one star, because it has enough different things that you can play through and it is a way to spend time, though not perhaps the best way to spend time.  And for those people who may read this review and say the game is NOT for \"casual gamers,\" so why I am knocking it so much, I paid the $60 for it like you did, so the game is just as much for me as it is for you.Bottom-line:Not worth the money at $60. I would not be happy with having spent anything more than $30 on this game.  It's fun in that: it's a new COD game. That is all. Nothing more. At all. This was not a step in the right direction, other than the size of the maps online and the player customization. The size of the maps online are great. Except you can't see who is killing you.As always, I don't care what series a game is, I have pretty much tried them all, owned a few, and I only have loyalty to whether a game is fun or not, and worth spending the cost at the time.  I realize I pretty much just make fun of this game a lot here and do knock it heavily, but it is with disappointment and frustration that I do so.  I would have much preferred the game being fun, re-playable, and worth having dropped $60+, and it was just not much of any of those things.  This game is pretty bad.  And that is pretty disappointing.  It feels like a prettier version of Homefront, with some elements (and levels) \"borrowed\" from GoldenEye Reloaded.  It will, once again, make me think twice about purchasing games brand new.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0016BVYA2","reviewerName":"Pikminfan \"bobsworld3\"","summary":"A welcome return to Rapture","reviewText":"It's almost difficult reviewing Bioshock 2 on its own merits given its similarity to the first game.  The resemblance between the two isn't necessarily a bad thing though seeing as how solid and polished the original Bioshock was.  But if you've played through the first game you have a pretty good idea what to expect here-sadistic splicers, upgradeable weapons, an arsenal of plasmids, unique gene tonics and a ubiquitous dictator-type figure.  Luckily  though, Bioshock 2 has a few new tricks to add to the familiar mix as well-even if they are somewhat minor.The main additions to the game are two-fold.  First are the Big Sisters, screeching \"boss\" type figures that attack like banshees when you've rounded up all the little sisters in the area.  They're not really that difficult (especially with any metal piercing weapons you have on hand) but the fights are exciting and fun none the less.  The second change to the game comes in the form of Adam collection.  You still kill Big Daddy's like in the original game (an entirely more satisfying experience than should be allowed) and collect little sisters, but now there are a few more steps involved for maximum Adam collection.  These extra steps get a bit repetitive and tedious after a while though especially when you're several levels deep in the game. I groaned a bit toward the end when I had to round up yet another trio of Little Sisters-knowing all the tedious steps involved in the process.  I suppose you could add the ability to play as a Big Daddy as another new feature of Bioshock 2, but this doesn't really add to or change the experience enough to notice a significant difference.There are a few new weapons in the game too-of which I found the drill immensely satisfying.  (It's a lovely way to teach splicers a lesson or two about attacking you head on)  There are new plasmids and gene tonics as well, but nothing remarkably different than those in the first Bioshock.All in all-despite the feeling of Deja Vu, I really enjoyed this return to Rapture and will definitely play through this game again.  Both games in the Bioshock series are incredibly polished and in my opinion give a resounding \"YES!\" to the idiotic question \"are video games art\".  Every object, every environment, every effect in these games is a real beauty to behold.  Add a haunting score and a sense of atmosphere to that mix and you have a truly immersive experience.  I'm really looking forward to where they take this series in \"Bioshock Infinite\".","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2010"}

When you start the game, you choose either to play the role of a boy or girl, and depending on your choices, the hero will grow up to be tall or short, good or evil. Players can get married and have children; female player characters will become pregnant, which will then be reflected by their physical appearance.Early in the game, players are presented with a stray dog for a best friend, who will need to be fed and loved, and will accompany the player throughout his or her life. Depending on the player, the dog will change appearance and assist him or her in various ways, such as alerting of impending dangers and attacking enemies.Players inhabit the world of Albion and are free to roam the land to as they please. Players can use different expressions to communicate with others, such as taunting and laughing, and even belching or farting.As the players grow, so does Albion, reflecting the choices that were made earlier in the game. Every house, hut, castle, and dungeon can be purchased if the player wishes. Players can buy up all the land in a town and can become mayor, king, and even emperor of the entire land.Fable 2 presents a dynamic and free-roaming world that doesn't demand a player to take any one set path. At the same time, players seeking a plot line will find an epic story and quest that they can follow if they wish, along with many side adventures.Fight Using Different Weapons and MagicFable 2 introduces a new combat system that allows for mastery of hand weapons, such as swords, long range weapons such as cross-bows and guns, and, of course, magic. Players improve at each discipline with time, and can combine different combat styles when they fight. Other advanced design features include tactical positional advantages that can bring new strategic elements into combat.Bring Other Players into Your WorldFable 2 has a multiplayer mode that allows you to bring other players into your own world. Consistent with the rest of the game, the actions of these other players can be permanent and affect your world. You can explore and fight together with these other players, share treasures, and even fight each other.Note:Fable 2 will not ship with Online Co-op mode.

Fable 2, the sequel to the overhyped/underwhelming Fable on the original Xbox, is the kind of game where there's so much stuff to do it almost seems daunting in fact and it feels like the more you do in the game, the more options and areas become available. The game wasn't as massively hyped by creator Peter Molyneux in the press as last time though because of the notoriety that game got, Fable 2 is certainly a game with big expectations. Does it deliver? Not everything but what it nails, it does with gusto.Story: The story in the game isn't really all that special and seems more like a means to and end but essentially you play as \"Little Sparrow\", that being your nickname your sister Rose and many others will call you throughout the game. Starting out as a youngster, you do some menial and gameplay-introducing mechanics till you can afford a magic wish-granting box. When your wish of going to the illustrious and grand Fairfax Castle comes true, it turns into tragedy and you're told that you are part of a great destiny: of defeating the evil Lord Lucien from destroying the world of Albion. But just because you get to save the world doesn't mean you have to be nice to people about it and however you decide to interact with people is up to you.Graphics: Fable 2's graphics are pretty stellar in terms of art design, the color palette (some of the farms you find by exploring are downright gorgeous in their scenery) as well as the occasional cutscene look stunning and seeing the beautiful snow in the opening part of the game or the moody rainy towns and even one creepy bog, the game looks charming. However, the character's themselves didn't get some of the same treatment as designs look a bit ugly, rather cartoonish and suffer from a couple of flaws like fade-ins, framerate stutters and the like. Again, it's a bit of a dated game but there's moments where you'll go \"wow\", like seeing a sunrise.Sound/Music: The soundtrack starts off in a rather majestic fashion where Danny Elfman composes the main theme over a grand cutscene and from then we switch to Russell Shaw for another great soundtrack. Lively RPG-like music with full orchestra and it's a soundtrack worth buying. Even the voice acting is great with everyone speaking British accents and there's even some lines that are quite funny. \"Friday is poker night\". However, some of the NPC dialog is repeated waaaaay too much and one sidequest I had to do was bring people to these big talking doors because he wants an audience. Fair enough only I have to bring 10 of the talkative buggers and since they were all in love with me, nearly everything that came out of their mouth was \"if only you loved me enough to buy me a ring\" or variations thereof. It got old unbelievably fast and I was more than welcome to kill of them wants the door was satisfied.Gameplay: The big thing touted in Fable 2 is the ability for choice and rather than have good or bad decisions a la harvest/rescue the Little Sisters in Bioshock, Fable 2 gives you a bit more options from picking a boy or girl, an evil bane on the entire world or a saint. And if you're like me, you're somebody who doesn't mind the debauchery once in awhile but does want to rid the world of evil. They can't have fun, I can; that's the law in my Albion and they'll abide, damnit. However some gameplay mechanics could've been ironed out since eating veggies is good for you whereas meat will make you fat, with both tying into your Pure/Corruption meter. Raise rents too high and you're a punk landlord but keep em low and you're the right kind of owner. There's many ways to play the game though, like I said, you don't have to explore everything but it's nice to give variety.In the age of huge combo lists and button mashing a la Devil May Cry and Ninja Gaiden, in comes Fable 2 which is quite elegant in its battle system but above all, it's simple. X is your sword, blocking and your flourish moves (slow motion super attack basically), Y is your ranged weapon while B is your magic. It's all very fast learning and in no time you'll be pulling off the combos than unleashing a level 3 spell. The magic isn't done by selection but rather by charging since you put a spell in 5 available levels depending on how powerful they are and holding B will fill up the meter granting access to the higher ups (similar in a way to Cyan's Bushido moves in Final Fantasy VI). So you can level one slow time, hold for level 2 raise dead where you can be your own necromancer and call upon some ghostly buddies and hold more for a wide fire attack. It's not really filled with multiple combos and special moves but it gets the job done with purchasable upgrades for bigger damage, counter attacks and the like.If there's one thing that will probably eat up your time the most in Fable 2 is property owning. Be friends with an owner and they'll bring the price down, allowing you to buy it and either move in if it's a house or rent out. It works quite well with some particularly expensive properties found in Albion though outfitting it with better furniture than re-selling it is a nice treat. One aspect that also ties into property owning is families where you can marry and get a wife or husband (or both) and own a house together. While your spouse is a bit too demanding and sometimes gets strangely dissatisfied over everything (like in real life), it's nice to come home to a family and yes, even have sex with them. Though the child's bassinet is in the same room so that makes things creepy.Does Fable 2 have problems? Yes. Be a big slut and you'll get an STD only what does it do? Nothing, just adds another 1 to your menu. The expression mini-game is a bit too tiresome and it's way too easy to spam an expression in order to get a gift and not to mention this game is found in the moneymaking jobs like bartending and woodcutting. The latter's tedious while bartending, a massive paycheck in the waiting kind of job, is far too easy to make the big bucks. Then there's the whole \"turn system off, leave for awhile, turn back on, money pours in\" system. Don't play the game for months and you can come back and be richer than anybody.The dog might work for people or he's just useful but not lovable (but being a 2 dog owner, I find it loveable), the main quest is dodgy and not really interesting and some things would've benefited from more time or just simply better implementation but you know what? I have fun playing this game so it's one of those weird works-in-spite-of-flaws type of games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2008"}

Even back then this game drew me in and made me want to keep playing to find out what happened next.  Unfortunately since I didn't own this game and I had to rent it from a local video store, what are those right?, I didn't get to experience the story in any coherent fashion.  One week someone would save over my progress and the next someone would be so far ahead I had no idea what was going on.  In one case this was helpful as someone did a power play and got to level 99 with all the good weapons so I was able to find out how the game ended.In any case I decided to pickup this up and see how they did with the remake and finally get to play the whole story.  I think they did a good job of remaking the game while keeping the spirit of the original and pretty much sticking to the original story that was good to begin with.  In this version the main plot points are there and I believe there are only a few scenes added to clarify the story in some parts.  The story is still epic / simple, which is good in this case because it makes it easy to follow, but there are some twists that aren't obvious especially if you haven't played the game before.  It's also important to remember that when this came out not many games where attempting to have complicated stories that had hero's and villain's that were much more than one note.Another issue that I hear about a lot in relation to this game is the difficulty. Make no mistake, this game will punish you if you do not pay attention. Especially later in the game. When I was playing I would sometimes get the sense of dread I get when I play the Soul's games. Like that game though mostly if you die, it will be your fault.  Either you did not have high enough levels or you didn't figure out what the enemies weakness's were.  Now there are a few cheap shots and tricks to some of the bosses that are not obvious, but once figured out either by trial and error or giving in and looking up the strategy, to save the DS from becoming a Frisbee of course, it's easy enough to get around the stumbling  blocks and keep moving.Also in this game the player can acquire \"augments\" from fallen enemies or departed allies. I only found a use for one or two of them and I'm guessing what you end up using really depends on your play style. I would recommend though that you wait until you are near the final party line up to start assigning them.  Even though you have a semi stable line up for most of the game, you can end up losing a augment you like because the story takes a character away. Once the augment is assigned it stays with whatever character you assign it to.One problem with this system though is that, for whatever reason, the game does not tell you what the augment does without equipping it first.  This can only be done once on one character and then you can see what it does. Some are self explanatory like counter attack and abilities that you used with other characters that were in the party but others are just kind of vague.  It's simple enough to just equip them and then reload to a earlier save game if you don't like what it does, but I think it's just an extra step that was not necessary.Finally there is a wireless capability with this game that deals with one of the creatures that Rydia is able to summon.  I didn't use this feature at all so I cannot comment on it other than you can raise the creatures stats by playing various mini games or by having duels with other people who have the game.In conclusion if you like old fashioned JRPG's that have a good story and are challenging or you are looking for a game that has Dark Soul's vibe to it, consider checking this game out. mac","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2014"}

Controlling a motley crew of renegade characters, you must hunt down the TimeSplitters across a variety of environments, such as the gangster-filled 1920s, the lush jungles of Aztec temples, Soviet military installations of the cold war, and futuristic robot factories in space.The game delivers an involved single-player and a cooperative story mode, with a complex narrative, multiple objective-based episodes, and animated cutscenes.

The Mapmaker has been enhanced, opening up even more potential for the advanced gamer looking for customizable game scenarios.","reviewerName":"Miketheratguy","summary":"Tons of options and unlockables combined with solid action.","reviewText":"THE SHORT: A pretty good story mode, and tons of things to unlock in the addictive challenges and combat modes- all of which can be played alone or with multiple players. Decent but limited mapmaker.THE LONG: I flat out didn't like TS1. The single player or \"story\" mode consisted of running back and forth for fetch quests, and the mapmaker let me set up corridors but gave me just a tiny handful of patterns to design it with. It was fast and it was pretty (minus the overly stylized goofy characters) but I didn't think it was much of a game.This first sequel improves on almost all of what I had issue with. For starters, the game's just as pretty and runs very smooth and very fast (keeping fairly consistent in multiplayer as well). The storyline is better too- it's like Goldeneye with actual mission goals that change or grow as the level progresses. But I personally had the most fun with \"arcade mode\", which is multiplayer combat. I want to specify here that this is where the game excels over such titles as even the much hyped Halo (and even more recent games): like Perfect Dark, this is one of the very few games where I can play multiplayer matches against computer opponents. If you're like me you don't always have enough people around for 16-player, 4 system links and whatnot. Frankly I usually prefer to play alone anyway. And in this way, Timesplitters 2 accommodated me.For example, like Perfect Dark, this game features some levels that I liked more than others and so, not wanting to play the story mode, I wanted to just jump into that cool level and fight some opponents. This game allowed me to do so, picking not only what opponents I fought but also how tough they were and what weapons were used. In addition, I could set parameters such as time/kill limits, and by the time I unlocked them, could choose among more than a dozen different combat variations such as \"Flame Tag\". In other words, this game lets you play multiplayer, storyline stuff, or plain old combat- with or against other humans in each case.There are loads of unlockables, as well. There are more than 100 different characters in the game, with at least half of that number representing legitimately unique and interesting choices. Each has their own stat rating such as speed and accuracy, and some characters such as robots have extra advantages like immunity to fire. This adds even more strategy to deathmatches but can be turned off as well.In addition to unlocking the characters, you'll be unlocking goofy cheats such as pirate hats or practical things such as new levels and combat modes. This is one of those games where every level, challenge, or combat scenario rewards you with new stuff once completed, so there's a very satisfying feeling of constant progress and perpetual motivation to try to meet each goal. Some of it is tough- sometimes tuned to be just barely within your grasp, but there seems to always be other stuff to accomplish if you get stuck. For each of three nights, I went to bed satisfied that I unlocked some of the cool stuff I'd wanted, then played the next day and opened up even more. It was addicting.Thankfully, this was all set up within a very pretty package. The stylized, exaggerated look from the first game is still here for those that liked it, but for people like me it's nice that characters are a little less goofy looking. And with more than a hundred, it's easy to develop favorites. The graphics during gameplay itself are solid and the game moves quite fast for being several years old, even during multiplayer combat with ahandful of AI opponents thrown in.And again, that's where the game gets its highest marks from me. While the storyline is interesting enough and fairly engaging in its disparate levels, it was that combat that made me keep playing this game. By the time I played through most of the basic and \"arcade league\" challenges, I'd unlocked around 15 different deathmatch types- modes such as capture the flag, king of the hill, last man standing, and more bizarre stuff such as monkey helpers- in which the person in last place gets monkeys with heavy weaponry. When you figure that you can pick from a dozen or so stages, add up to 10 AI opponents whose difficulty you set, throw in weapons of your choice, and then pick the score type and combat parameters, that's a huge amount of customization. As I said, it's a level of single-player control and immersion the likes of which I haven't seen since Perfect Dark.Controls feel natural and very intuitive, the graphics and sound are appropriate (and downright amusing) and the options are very thorough. The pace of unlocking stuff is great, with a couple dozen hours of perpetual new stuff. Altogether this is a fine game, which at this point you can grab for just $10-15 bucks. Do it, especially if you're a guy like me and doesn't want to rely on a bunch of others to have some good interactivity with your first-person shooters.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2005"}

James Bond has the fast cars, the sexy, intelligent women, and the self assured skills that get him out of any jam.All the actors and actresses are here, and it makes a HUGE difference to hear John Cleese, Judi Densch, Pierce Brosnan and all the other voices speaking to you while you play. The likenesses are all very accurate too, so it really is like playing a movie.Where some previous Bond games were more like Rambo, this one is pure Bond. You get special bonus points for doing a special Bond Move where you defeat your enemies with a brilliant strategy instead of just blasting them. It's more Splinter Cell rather than Unreal II.The graphics are great, with little spider robots, slick cars, well done smoke and fire and other atmospheric effects. You really do feel like you're in a movie and not looking at a texture-mapped building.Gameplay is great, too. The enemies show some amazing AI in sequences. It might get a little used to the gameplay style, but stick with it. After a few hours of the learning curve (which a well done training level works you through) you will be totally immersed in this world.Replayability is just amazing, too. You go through once to get the basic idea of the level. But then you keep going through aiming for those Bond moments, and trying to ratchet your score up by doing it quickly and accurately. If you're able to get on Platinum Level in all missions, you unlock new bonusses.Everyone I know who has seen and played this game loves it, and we ourselves are quite addicted to it right now. There are stealth missions, driving missions, shooting missions, even ride-and-shoot missions. The cut scenes are great, too!I definitely rate this one a must-buy for any fan of the Bond series, and for any action gamer in general. Enjoy!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2004"}

Footprints will be left in mud, for example, but only until it rains and then they will wash away. Lara's shirt will also get wet, and she's more likely to lose her grip if she is standing on a slippery, rain-soaked ledge. When the sun comes out, her shirt will dry and the slippery surfaces regain their friction.In Underworld, Lara also has a lot more flexibility in how she makes her way through a level, as there is often more than one way to get from here to there. She can now climb walls with texture and rocky outcroppings to reach areas she previously wouldn't have been able to access.All of these additions have been made to give the game a non-linear, open feel. Players can interactive with the environment by doing things they find to be intuitive, and the game will respond in an appropriate way. When Lara interacts with trees, for example, she will push aside leaves using either one or two hands depending on whether or not she's holding something. These details give a lifelike, immersive sensation to the game.New Melee Combat SystemUnderworld introduces a new melee combat system that requires players to strategically strike with offensive, defensive, and evasive maneuvers. Lara can now attack enemies with different punches, kicks, knees, and other acrobatic onslaughts. Items lying on the ground, such as poles that were previously walked on, can be picked up and swung at enemies. Players can also perform a greater variety of actions with weapons; for example, Lara can now hold onto a ledge with one hand and fire a gun with the other.Realistic Enemy and Animal AIThe AI in Tomb Raider: Underworld has also taken a big step forward--both enemies and animals now make independent decisions based on their surroundings, employ ambush and squad tactics when fighting, and will retreat if deemed necessary.With updated graphics and a more immersive and realistic gameplay, Tomb Raider: Underworld will have both fans and newcomers excited about the newest installment in this popular video game-pinup franchise.Tomb Raider: Underworld is loaded with a new melee combat system, various weapons, and smarter AI for both enemies and animals.","reviewerName":"Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!)","summary":"Lara Croft's Return from The Hum-Drum Letdowns Of The Last Few Years","reviewText":"I was a major fan of the Tomb raider series since its first release around 1995 up until the dismal failure of Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness with all its bugs in the game.

The game has great action and the voice cast for the characters were picked perfectly but as you play you sometimes miss Nate Drake's witty sarcastic humor and smart mouth,  Lara has witty remarks with her enemies as well but sometimes it feels more like she's being condescending with an air of superiority against her enemies than anything else and that sometimes makes her a little dis-likable.

I never even write amazon reviews but the sad desperation of trolls who clearly have never played this game to come here and give it a one star, particularly notorious xbox trolls 'cough' Christian 'cough' has inspired me to expose them for what they are. This had one of the most appealing stories ever in a video game. The character development, dialogue, gameplay, and action sequences have all been improved. Not as dramatically as from 1 to 2, but by far enough to improve from a 9.5 to a 10. The landscapes were much more diverse and intense. The villain is much less generic and cliche' than that of both 1 and 2. If there was any room for criticism at all it would be that they did force more fist to fist combat on you, not much but it was noticeable. I simply have to chuckle to myself when I see things like the 10/10 review was 'bought and paid for' or people even bothering bringing up Gears of War 3, no doubt bitter that it wasnt even nominated for GOTY. Bottom line is if you played UC 2 for the amazing story and character development, which is the whole point of this franchise, then you will not regret a penny spent on this one. But dont even bother with my praise for it.

No games does online split screen shooter as well has HALO. The engineering packs/loadouts add a new dimension to the game. Sprint and roll makes the game much faster than it used to be. Not every game mode makes use of the loadouts so if you're a purist you've still got options. Some of the packs don't seem too effective on some game types but sometimes it's fun to just mess around. There's an invasion mode where you play Covenant VS NSDF and try and capture objectives. It's a lot of fun and a great new challenge. There are 3 more classes available with different engineering packs. I also played some firefight (like ODST, but with some new modes) and it was great fun. You can put a human player on the covenant side to make it even more challenging.HUGE NEGATIVE: No 4 player split screen in Big Team Battle, the Campaign, or Firefight. I expected this for the last two, but Big Team Battle has always had this option. 3 or 4 players split-screen Big Team Battle was what I'd do 90% of the time I've ever played Halo. It probably didn't run very well with the new engine, and that's unfortunate. Taking this away from the game took away A LOT of value for me. I should remove a star but there are still a variety of other options for you to play. I still think the game deserves 5 stars but the loss of 4 player split screen Big Team Battle really hurts the game's playability as a \"party game\".","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2011"}

This is not a world of goblins and barbarians, or any other such fantasy fare. Within the dark realms ofPrimal&#146;s alternate universe, gamers find themselves involved in an intricate and realistic story--enhanced by several subplots and twists--that makes them question the fine line between fantasy and reality.Primalis a story-driven game of exploration, combat, and puzzles, presented through the experiences of Jen and Lewis, a present-day human couple drawn into discord by eternal forces. While gameplay revolves around the events of the story, there are many personal revelations and surprises for the characters along the way. Essential to the game&#146;s core is the unusual and evolving relationship betweenPrimal&#146;s two main playable characters, Jen and her companion Scree, a gargoyle. Players can switch between Jen and Scree at any time and will be required to assess and utilize each character&#146;s strengths to succeed in various areas of the game.Primalis set within a huge environment featuring four expansive realms surrounding a central hub.

Lying in an emergency recovery room, Jen leaves her body and meets Scree, a gargoyle turned guide, and is drawn into Oblivion and the center of the demonic worlds where chaos and order fight a continuous battle.  Unfortunately, chaos is winning, and it will take Jen's special powers to restore the balance.Jen and Scree work their ways through four different demon realms all superbly detailed, restoring or creating order and improving their skills for the last titanic fight.  The game requires equal amounts of battle skills and thought - Only Jen can fight, but it takes Scree's talents as well to overcome some of the ingenious obstacles in their path. As the game progresses, Jen acquires special demonic powers in each realm.  The player switches between the to characters - depending on what skills are needed.Primal is a winner at many levels.  The characters, Jen and Scree, are delightful.  Jen is a rocker who is determined to work her way up and make good.  Scree, a spirit torn from his body and thrust into a statue, plays the part of the wise straight man.  The dialog between them is full of little twists and barbs, but it is clear that a great deal of affection builds between them as the story evolves.The realms of the story are immense and beautifully illustrated; their civilizations believable and interesting.  The only flaw in the world building is that there are only a few characters other than Jen and Scree that achieve any personality.  Animation and movement control are excellent.  This isn't one of those RPG's where the controller is the real opponent.Primal is rated as mature - primarily due to blood and violence.  Jen's language has a rough edge as well.  From my viewpoint, none of these factors is extreme - parts don't go flying everywhere, etc., but the Primal is definitely pitched to the 15+ age group.  Even so, this is really too good a game to miss.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2004"}
{"product_name":"B001NX4DUQ","reviewerName":"Nathan T.","summary":"Nice Attempt, Huge Potential LIST OF PROS AND CONS And MORE","reviewText":"3.5/5Is this game worth buying? Yes. However, I'm much more critical than most other reviewers so bare with me. This game is basically a knock off of GoW. You're probably like \"oh not this again\". But it's too obvious to not mention it. Even though it still does not hold a candle next to the awesome and epicness of GoW, even the first one, it has a lot of potential I am very anxious to see.Similarities with GoW aka God of War series:1. Doing special moves by pressing multiple buttons OR mashing one button.2. Certain action sequence is extremely similar. Example would be the slow motion grappling scenes, those that play GoW should be very familiar.3. Enemies releasing orbs of energy that gets absorbed by the heroine who is his own worse enemy.4. The gameplay in general, if you play GoW and this, you'll feel like this is the chinese knocked off version. It's good, but not there yet.Before I give pros and cons, here are some general advice to play this game:1. ALWAYS remember to talk to Virgil (your little shade helper, the blue guy that follows you around). Remember to talk to him completely whenever you see him. He sometime gives you stuff like relics.2. Absolving the damned is good for souls because you get to play the mini game. Punishing will only grant you +600 experience to. They both grant you an automatic +600 experience to unholy or holy. Absolving goes to holy and punishing goes to unholy.3. Unholy makes the scythe more powerful in terms of adding more scythe skills and holy makes the cross more powerful in that you get more powerful moves for the cross.4. Some magics I found very useful: Sins of the Father, divine armor, righteous path. Martyrdom is very powerful but is boring to use.5. All scythe skills are pretty useful, best get as many as you want and use them in a mix bag. There's no dud in this skill, only depend on your own personal gameplay type.6. Divine armor level 3 magic combine with ciacco's bile relic found after absolving or punishing clodia and talking to Virgil makes this game a cake walk even in the hardest difficulty.7. Remember to get all of the mana and health increase upgrades as you see fit. The tier 6 and 7 mana and health regens are very useful too.8. When you press the B button to shoot your cross, max out the skill so you can shoot more. It's the one on the left most side on the holy side, I forgot what it is called.9. You can open up two more relic slots, each located on the unholy and holy side. Do so.PROS:1. Since it is an adaptation of GoW for the xbox 360, and GoW happens to be extremely successful, the gameplay therefore is similarly addictive. Not as good, but similar.2. Graphics are pretty decent, but still gets beaten by the PS2 versions of GoW and GoW2.3. I really love the whole setting of hell, again, I'm really anxious to see much improvements to the point where it can closely be more comparable to GoW.4. I hear some complaints about how short this game is. If you're new it would take you about 9 hours and if you know what you're doing probably 6. However, good things should be left short and to the point. I'm glad it didn't drag on.5. A lot of check and save points. Don't believe otherwise, they can't possibly add more checkpoints to this game. They might move it so it is more convenient for you, but no game is perfect.CONS:1. Button mashing or patterns are always the same. That means it gets a bit old. I believe in GoW there are some slight randomness so that the next time you get a special event or attack, you have to look at the screen and make sure you press or mash the right buttons.2. They need to increase the beast riding awesomeness in this game. There's only a few scenes where you can ride some sort of monstrosity and most of the time it is very limited or the role is very limited aka three or so types of boring attacks and not enough action and explosion.3. More outrageous scenes. If this is the adaptation of GoW, they have to at least attempt to match it if not beat it in order to succeed.4. If you've ever watched the movie, the story adaptation for the game is not as smooth and acceptable. Acceptable means giving the gamer something that has more meaning and has more definition. Watch the movie, then watch the game. The game is very similar to the movie, just that the storyline is not as well entwined and feels a bit choppy and not as satisfying.5. More weapon choice. Dante only gets 2 weapons and it gets a bit stale.6. I'm alright with the graphics, but I expect much improvements. I've seen paintings and pictures of hell that scared me more. Hands moving around under the water isn't scary, especially with people that have cable TV. More with area interaction, find the most messed up people in the world and ask them for ideas.7. There are some commentaries on the artwork of this game, but personally I think the whole baby with the blade for arms is a lame and pathetic attempt. I remember the \"making the baby\" commentary, I would not accept credibility for such a lame design and concept art. Let's get a baby and chop off the arm and connect blades to there and make it look creepier! People that are phrased for such mediocre attempts are a good example of our society endorsing mediocrity. You do not have to turn to a professional to get an idea like that... most of the artwork in terms of monsters in this game is alright at best.8. When there's multiple enemies around you, especially air and land combination, trying to hit a specific target is difficult since it is on auto targeting in a general direction and you can't really aim.9. Magic attacks don't seem to have a secondary purpose other than the use for combat. Secondary purpose such as using it to help you overcome an obstacle that would otherwise be impossible without using certain magics. Other than divine armor for health regeneration, no other magic seems especially necessary, they're just there.10. Limit in magic use. I find even with ciacco's bile (mana regen relic) that without all of the mana upgrades, you find yourself very limited in the amounts of time you're able to cast magic. Even with max mana upgrades and points in tier 6 and 7 mana and health skills, I still find myself continuously attempting to conserve my mana and never really enjoy using magic to a degree of satisfaction....I'm just always running out of it.Does this game have a good re-playability rating? I would think so. Unlike what some people say, some of the cutscenes are skippable if you press some buttons. It still has a far ways to go, but I hope I'll be there when it meets my expectations. It still feels like a flimsy knock off","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"Joy","summary":"Take out the \"Final Fantasy\" in the title!!","reviewText":"Okay, This is just going to be a bottom line, to the point review.  I have been playing the Final Fantasy series for years and have played just about every Final Fantasy game from FFI and even some off titles like Tactics and Crystal Chronicles.  Now, when FFXI came out, I couldn't play it since I refuse to pay every month in addition to paying for the game itself.  When FFXII came out, I had mixed feelings but it still had enough stuff in it to make me keep playing and even though it really lacks in story, it's not a complete waste.  I still like a lot of it.So here we are now with Final Fantasy XIII and I can honestly say, without a shadow of a doubt, this is NOT Final Fantasy!  This is some random bare-bones RPG that someone made that is only a demo of a game.  A shell of a game.  That's how I feel about this.  It's unfinished.  This isn't the hard work of Square, the company Square who has always delivered 100 percent into the Final Fantasy series.  This isn't the work of that great company who delivered the masterpieces like FFVI, FFVII, FFVIII, FFIX, and FFX.  This isn't the company who put tons and tons of hard work into the towns and shops and talking to npc's.  Final Fantasy doesn't make you buy items from a save point.  Final Fantasy is about going to towns and going into shops and going up to the shopkeeper and buying the items.  And this certainly isn't the company who really delivered with battling and gameplay.  Fighting is no longer fun.  There is no more fun battling enemies anymore.  In FFXII, I accepted the A.I. but enough A.I.!  I want to control all my characters!!  It's not that hard to ask for, to want to be able to control all my characters in battle.  Especially in an offline RPG.UPDATE:  I have to add something here that I also just found out.  I found this on another site:\"This also echoes similar comments Kitase made earlier this month, when he said that it's \"very hard to make games on PlayStation 3 in the same style as the games in [FFVII's] era had. Making graphics will take an enormous time.\" He explained that's also part of the reason FFXIII is more linear than past Final Fantasy games.\"Okay, What you just read is completely unacceptable and just flat out laziness and stupidity!  So because we have amazing graphics, the gameplay has to completely suffer!?  I'm sorry but that's just total BS!  Excuse my language but this is just completely irresponsible and unacceptable for a gaming company who has always delivered 100 percent in the main series, especially before FFXI released.  Now, if I have to sacrifice gameplay for amazing graphics, then I don't want any part of it!!  Just bring back the old graphics but I know for a FACT that if they can spend years on graphics alone, then they can deliver an epic FF in every other area!  Come on!  This is pitiful.  Just downright sad and pathetic.This is just shameful.  For about twenty years, Final Fantasy has never let me down.  But this game is just a demo, just a demo of another random RPG with the words Final Fantasy on the cover.  If this was truly Final Fantasy, I wouldn't be rating it so low and having to write all these things.  But it's true, this is no longer Final Fantasy.  Everything I have loved about Final Fantasy is gone.  Sure, there are chocobos but you can't even ride them until late in the game.  The only thing this \"demo\" of a game has going for it is the graphics.  That's it.  Square are ripping all it's long time fans off and so many people are just buying into it.  I will NOT give in to their less than capable work.  If and when they return to their roots and give 100 percent of their time and effort into a true Final Fantasy, only then will I support them again.I know that Final Fantasy XII was a big departure with the totally different battling system and removal of random encounters but for them to completely change everything that made Final Fantasy what it is, well, there's just no excuse.  They just became lazy and are making money off of it.  Even Final Fantasy X-2 had more effort and work put into it.  Don't let Square make you a victim of their laziness.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0050SVNP8","description":"","reviewerName":"Joseph Sayre \"Venom Computing\"","summary":"Leave the travel ticket to Unova on your desk this time.","reviewText":"As one of those pitiable, old souls who played Pokemon when it was first released, back in the days of Gameboy, I've participated in every single rendition of the Pokemon RPG series, Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, Platinum, Ruby, Sapphire, Crystal, Fire Red, Leaf Green, Diamond, Pearl, Heart Gold, Soul Silver, Black, White, and now this: Pokemon Black 2.I do suppose you have to ask exactly what this is. Each rendition of Pokemon usually gets a name, and seeing as though GRAY might have been the color chosen, I can see why a sequel was instead used. But, again, what IS this game? Why does it exist? Is it better than Black or White? Is it truly a sequel? Is it worth getting for full price?Well, no.You see, the same answer should be said for all of the \"Sequels\" in the series bar the remakes, in that the same world, the story doesn't change all that much and basically, you'd get pretty much the same level of entertainment, with a few extras, playing what is basically an EXPANSION, for the cost of the full game. Black and White 2 are no different in this regard.Black and White 2 take place 2 years after the events of Black and White, if you haven't played the first game, don't worry though because the previous plot is not necessary to be known to enjoy the game, however, it does provide background that will add to B/W 2's plot. In this instance, you and your rival once again take on the baddies, and amass a team of super powered creatures to wage battle to save the world, and become the champion of Unova, and collect data on all the Pokemon ever.So what's wrong here? Quite simply, the game isn't fresh, it doesn't have the steam that its predecessors have, and that's due, in part to a few new problems the newer versions have.First of all the newer versions of the game like to get excessively lost in the storyline, now, this isn't so much an issue with some as it is with me, personally reading 10-20 minute monologues is tedious, and because nothing in Pokemon is ever actually \"said\" the developers constantly having you read a small novel whenever any kind of interactivity with NPCs is on the screen relating to the story is actually pretty boring. Sit down and read read read, with the occasional, step or something happening. The addition of the Xtrancseiver Has not aided this, and now many plot points come in through telephone calls that are often very inconsequential, and I'll admit annoying. Being able to see the character does not make it entertaining, this is in sharp contrast to the phone in previous games where you could pretty much ignore calls. I also think the tutorial steps in the games has gotten close to a lunatic level, everything must be explained, at length. Seriously, Gamefreak, give us our Teachy TV back , if we want tutorials we'll go there. There is simply no reason to stall a new game for an hour while you're forced to fumble about doing mundane stuff you've done in the previous games a thousand times in order to earn silence. Seriously, give us our running shoes, our stuff, and a lv 7 version of whatever we've chosen and start us off in front of our house with the tutorial crap out of the way. All it takes is an option in the start up menu after naming your avatar.The problem is that the main fanbase is returning again and again to be told the same thing, and its tedious, and unneccesary.The second problem is this generation's Pokemon, with the exception of a few, This might be the biggest set of uninspired nonsense so far, with Pokemon like Trubbish, Patrat, Woobat, and Vanillite to utter a few, combined with that, the weakest starters ever return in this game, with literally all three starters failing to capture even a tiny fragment of the magic the first few games hold. I can't explain how much more difficult this makes playing the game, since you won't run into pretty much ANY of the types the starters offer within the first few towns worth anything, and since the starters are so lame, you'll want to replace your \"special\" starter pokemon, almost instantly. Tepig is let's face it, a Pig, and therefore, however awesome his evolutions become, isn't all that good, but believe it or not is likely the best option, as Snivy has almost no potency or moves and is outclassed by gross number of grass types, and Oshawott is simply tragic due to his evolution and abysmal, well, everything. Of course this is an opinion, but do not expect any sort of metagame use like that of Charizard, Typhlosion, or even Blaziken from any of the new contenders, once again cementing use of previous pokemon created over ten years ago as the stuff people flock to. And this is surprisingly where Black 2 stands out from Black. Pokemon in Unova have been modified to include some of the other 600+ rather than just the Unovan-dex like in Black and White. While there just aren't enough good ones early on to make a team you'll stick with, this is par the course for Pokemon and through the game you'll have many opportunities to refine your team into a respectable crew of soldiers with which to do battle.Unfortunately save Black and White 2's additions to the Pokemon in Unova, and the inclusion of more interesting characters, it still feels more deja-vu than anything, the locations haven't changed much, and the ones that have aren't explored long enough to have memorable value, and so the game comes down with a case of repetition and thanks to its over exuberant use of monologue and tutorials, it REALLY drags through the beginning, hitting a height somewhere before the final, then completely falling flat again into the metagame, where there is surprisingly little to do. There are  a few extra towns you visited in Black and White, but nothing new, and the ability to get some ubers. Finally there is the Elite Four again and that's pretty much it.Nintendo WFC has gotten minor upgrades, but there isn't much to write home about, but online remains a steady, difficult set of powerful trainers and stingy traders, and while Nintendo have made trading easier, a search function would have been far more useful in trades if we could search by words we put in ourselves, I can't look up pokemon unless I've seen them, which means I can't trade for them unless I can see them in my game (since the search uses the PKMN field which is tied to your pokedex) So to reiterate, online is very good, but still has a long way to go, and for GOD'S SAKE GET RID OF FRIEND CODES.Black 2 and White 2 are great games, and are much better if you HAVEN'T played either Black 1 or White 1. Even if you have played those titles they're good games, they're free of bugs for the most part, and all of the things in the game are clear, easy to use and the series has refined the battle system to such an extent, I can't find a single hole in it. The story of Black 2, which is more mundane than that of the first game, the rival, who is much more relatable, doesn't do a good enough job to bring you BACK to Unova. The Starters still stink, much of the Unova Brood is rather pointless and you'll readily find yourself passing them by in favor of the injected oldies. The game simply talks too much and doesn't get going quick enough and when it does, it can't keep it up too long. Finally and most importantly, the Metagame is far too undeveloped, and most of the activities can be completed in a couple of hours, unlike Gold and Silver which had an ENTIRE SEPARATE REGION to explore after the first. The problem is everything comes to a head, and just finishes up all at once, leaving a few straggling things to do and only a few new places to explore. The thing is, Black 2 still feels like an expansion, not a new game, but it's far too insistent on pushing its story, which is not progressive, and only mildly interesting. There are times in the story where the game comes to a complete halt and you won't know why, forcing you to do something somewhere that wasn't communicated very well. The final nail in the coffin is how easy it is, there is practically no challenge to be had, your creatures will decimate almost anything, the game doesn't even really get hard into the metagame, with powerful trainers you'll easily take down included. Nothing stands out like the Red battle from Gold and Silver, the boosted elite fours of old, or even some metagame content in Black or White. Black 2 is a Pokemon game, but it's a bit of a bore to drag yourself through, it is an ok game, but it's hard for me to recommend.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2013"}

While there are great games out there that have been well-receieved like Halo, Doom, Madden '06, and others that've really shown a great depth of universal appeal. That has definitely also been the case with Mario. Since 1981, as Jumpman in Donkey Kong, Mario has been the most universal of all the video game characters and personas ever, and continues to develop with the times. That also has been shown with the Nintendo DS as well. The breakout success of Nintendo's latest handheld system has really been a great transition to how we play video games on hand with the stylus, and appeal of the dual screen action. Now, Mario is set to have that classic feeling all over again.New Super Mario Brothers for the Nintendo DS brings a updated appeal to Mario, loosely based on the classic 2-D games he has been widely known for from Super Mario Brothers 1, 2, 3. and Super Mario World from the Super NES era. The object is just like the object from before, as you play Mario or Luigi, and try to go after Bowser and Bowser Jr. from stealing Princess Toadstool a.k.a. Peach. The game features over 80 different levels of exciting, and enjoyable gameplay. The game includes the classic moves from previous titles like the ground pounding (Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine), and the carrying turtle shells to defeat Koopa Troopas and Goombas (Super Mario Brothers), as well as new features like the mega mushroom which can turn Mario into a King Kong size, to really pound and knockout your competition. The graphics and the gameplay are just absolutely breathtaking and amazing, and really delivers what had been done from the early Mario titles before, while the sound is just purely classic. The control also is percise and in tune to each movement of Mario and company.All in all, this is the second full length Mario adventure title to really deliver well for the Nintendo DS. Like what happened with Super Mario 64 DS did to showcase the brilliance of the DS, New Super Mario Brothers delivers the fun and appeal of a classic game, to a whole new generation of gamers. I definitely think this is one of the most definitive titles available for the Nintendo DS, and I really definitely think it should be a standard to your Nintendo DS library.Graphics: ASound: A-Control: A+Fun & Enjoyment: A+Overall: A 1/2+","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2006"}

{"product_name":"B000ZKA0J6","description":"","reviewerName":"Merryjuice \"Bukkake Boy\"","summary":"For Those Who Didn't Play The First Starcraft","reviewText":"I never played the first Starcraft, but I picked up the game because after World of Warcraft for a solid 5 years, I knew whatever Blizzard made would be quality.  I've never really played RTS games, but after playing a few battle matches and the campaign for about 10 hours, I can already tell I'll be playing this one for quite a while.If you never played the original Starcraft, while installing, the game keeps you up to speed with what happened before.  I got to understand the main character Raynor well within the first hour.  Some of the pop ups of \"old friends\" confused me, but Raynor elaborates on them well enough that you don't have to go and buy the original Starcraft to figure out who they are.The gameplay is fairly simple to pick up.  Its all based on economy more than it is battling it out.  In fact, you'll probably spend 90% of the time gathering and building your resources, and 10% blowing stuff up.  The game is pretty simplistic in nature; build your forces up as fast as possible and rush the other side.  The campaign missions however were diversified and definately took a while to master as you have limited time to achieve the objectives.  It really shows how to split up your forces, and take calculated risks of your men to complete the mission.  I liked that aspect.I was at first, a bit disappointed when I tried out multiplayer.  Basically the game revolves around pure resource speed and creating a massive army to overwhelm your opponents bases.  The bigger your army, the faster you will win the game.  I really liked the objective based games and online tutorials on how to strategize correctly.  I know there is more to Starcraft than just having a massive army, but it certainly does help your chances of winning.Don't get me wrong, the multiplayer aspect was awe-inspiring.  I love the fact I don't have to pay 15 months to play, or have to grind out gear to stay competitive in pvp (aka WoW).  The two things I didn't enjoy about the game were:  The shortcut buttons were all different based on the faction you played. 2.) The targeting system was poor.  Commands like attack or move would not register correctly, requiring a double input.  Some of my army units would also just stand there while my base was being obliterated, or be just out of reach based on a patrol while another portion of the unit would attack at half strength and get wiped out.  Its mistakes like these which lose battles.  I'm sure as I play though, I'll get to figuring out a better way of handling this.  Men are of course not meant to be multitaskers by trade :)I couldn't help but notice the nagging LAN issue everyone has been talking about.  Honestly, I haven't been to a LAN party since 2002 when people were playing Halo in the dorms.  It does bother me though that I have two computers in my house, and I have to buy an entirely new copy of the game if I want my buddy to play the game with me.  This is very much a console-style type of money ploy, though I can understand the complexities of setting matches up on one account considering how much the game relies on Battle.net for ladder tracking.  Hopefully this will be alleviated in future patches, along with a better chat area and a friend's list that doesn't require you to give out your real name.Blizzard certainly has its fair share of dedicated fans (and haters and we can see with the one-star reviews on Amazon). With the PC gaming market fizzling in originality its nice to see a game of this much quality and depth hit the market.  I can already see late night gaming sessions like those I used to have a couple years back when every friend I had played WoW.

I've been playing castlevania games for a long time now, and in my personal opinion, there has yet to be a \"bad\" castlevania game released. There are good castlevanias, better castlevanias, and fantastic ones. This game falls into the last catagory. Game play is fantastic, and very fluid, with simple controlls that anyone can learn. graphics are amazing (especially for a handheld) and the game offers TONS of replay value. I beat the game for the first time in about 4 hours (I'm a little on the experienced side when it comes to castlevania puzzles...) but I have logged over 48 hours into the game unlocking everything.... all 112 souls, 100% map, all 3 endings, compleate monster encylopedia, all \"hard mode items\",all weapons and armor/accessory, both difficulties with both characters, and all bosh rush items.  While the casual player will find plenty to do and play in the game, castlevania fans will pull even more out of the game. wheather you have a few hours to kill on a road trip, or just want some old school, gothic, vampire slaying fun at home, I would recomend this game to anyone and everyone. If you are new to the series, this is the place to start, if you are a vetren, this is one to add to the collection. In my opinion, this is not the best castlevania game ever made, but it is my favorite...for 30 dollars, there are few games that will give you as much fun and enjoyment as Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2004"}
{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Baseball \"Johnny\"","summary":"Just Wonderful!","reviewText":"I got this yesterday and I think this is the best portable gaming device ever. My package included the PSP Unit, 32MB Memory Stick Pro Duo, Case, Cleaning Cloth, Wriststrap, Headphones & Remote Control, Demo Movie/Game/Music Disk, Battery, AC Adapter, and Spider-Man 2. I got two games with my purchase too: Ridge Racer and Metal Gear Ac!d. Both of them are extremely fun and I enjoy playing them. The graphics on this device is just plain beautiful. Since it is a 128-bit system with a 333MHz processor the color is incredible. The remote control is a bit stiff and the headphones are cheap but they are managable. The case is plain horrible and one day it is going to fall and break. 32MB is not enough so I got the SanDisk 1.0GB Memory Stick Duo card which can store movies, games, pictures, and music easily. I also got a Mini-B USB Connector because it doesn't come with it and you have to have it if you want to transfer data from your PC to your PSP. It comes with a thick handbook but you really should know how to operate it pretty quick. Mine charged up really fast and gave me a good 5 hour battery life. In the booklet it says about 4-6 hours in gaming mode and about 3-5 hours in video mode. The wriststrap is just a plain old wristband and works pretty good. Spider-Man 2 looks great on this device and looks just like it would on TV. The demo UMD includes music videos, game trailers and movie trailers all from Sony productions. The PSP gets smudged extremely fast and I would no doubt get a case for it. The UMD (Universal Media Disk) loads really fast but it is somewhat of a hassle because you can't touch this one part and if you do the whole game or movie is ruined. All together this is the best portable gaming device on the market and for $249.99 it is a steal but I would recommend getting some accessories with it. This is such a cool device and I hope you get it too!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00005NZ1G","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world.

Redmond","summary":"Great Game, Install Limit (for Shame!), Poor Customer Support","reviewText":"The game itself is great, and a good bit of fun.  It will provide most people many hours of entertainment.  Is it pseudo-evolutionary theory in a real world setting?  No.  It is a game.  It is fantastical and a wonderful creative outlet.  Unlike many Maxis games it does not seem to have that \"going nowhere\" feeling without any goals.  The game is quite goal oriented.Now the problems.  The game is not bereft of bugs, and many of them are rather large for a non-MMO release.  They are frustrating, but the game is still enjoyable unless your unlucky enough to be unable to run it at all (I believe this to be a vast minority of customers).  The bigger problem isn't the bugs, it is EA's poor customer service.  I submitted a ticket about a bug.. and was told I'd have a response in 24 hours.  In over 48 hours I got a response -- a listing of FAQ's to peruse... which I had already done.  Two more days later I got another response for the website with TIPS/Hints.  Two days after that I got ANOTHER message listing the FAQ's.  It was over a week after I submitted the initial ticket that I finally got a response telling me it was a known bug and there wasn't anything they could do at the current time -- but it is being looked into.  The frustration is that it was over a week before anyone bothered to actually read the ticket I submitted... and it was only four or five sentences long.  They could have read it in the same time it took to copy/paste the same message more than once.  I would have even been happier/more understanding if they had just said \"Sorry, we have a high volume of tickets.  There will be a delay but we will get to you asap.\"  Instead they strung me along to make it look like they were actually doing something when they were not.The other con, as has been mentioned quite a lot, is the install limit.  What PC gamer doesn't reformat or change machines or upgrade components at least once a year?  In effect it means that in 3 years or less we will all be on the phone with EA trying to get our access extended.. if we are still playing that is.  It's a bit short-sighted on their part I think, and will cause frustrations... especially considering the customer service I've experienced thus far.Still, the game is fun and I'm not sorry I bought it.  I will continue to enjoy it for quite some time.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0002A2S26","reviewerName":"Josh Perkins \"antisugarcoated\"","summary":"halo with glossy nail polish","reviewText":"i just got done beating this new title from bungie called halo 2.  now i have some mixed feelings about the whole thing.  i just bought an xbox for this game today, and now, a short time later, i've already beaten it.  on normal difficulty, yes i know, i'm a wuss.  sue me.  anyway, the whole game felt rushed for something that has been in development for three years or so.  some of the beginning levels are fun, like the city streets one.  then they start to get bland in the middle of the game, but toward the end they get better again.  and a lot of the time i spent in levels from the first halo, or ones that looked exactly like them.  i know it's a totally different halo this time (sorry if that ruined anything for anybody), but c'mon.  same type of planet or not, take me somewhere that i haven't been.  take me to a desert, or more stuff on earth, something. i got kind of tired running around a building that looked the same over and over.  it  gets a bit repeptitive after awhile. but, the new character you get to be brightens things up.  his stealth is fun and strategic, seeing as how it lasts for only 10 seconds or so, and the swords are fun to kill enemies with.the story was okay for a game like this, but why the hell did the freakin' developers decide it was okay to end it like they did?  that was crap!  it felt like the game had just got going then, hey, it's over.  wait for halo 3.  god damnit.  i don't want to wait another frickin' decade for a game when they could have just added another five or six awesome action-packed levels where you get to be master chief and kick the rest of the brute's and elder's asses.  it's like reading a book, and the last page cuts off halfway through a sentence for no reason.  i don't really understand why they ended it so short.  granted, i still have to go back and play it on hard and legendary mode, but that's not going to make the game end in any different spot.  it's like a barber stopping halfway through your haircut and telling you, \"that's all for now.\"what?  why? these are the questions i would like to ask bungie.  if this game was in development for three years, what the hell did they put all their time and effort into?  the game looks pretty good, but i've seen a hell of a lot better.  sure, everything is shiny and new-looking.  so what?  i would definitely take a graphic downhaul for a longer game.as for the multiplayer, i've heard it's great and all, but i have yet to try it.  the first halo was a great multiplayer game, so i'm sure this one will be too.but overall, i still have to give this game a 5 star rating.  because it's still one of the best, if not THE best fps for the xbox, or any system.  well, until half-life 2 that is.as for the game's a.i. well, that's also a mixed bag.  sometimes the enemies would be hiding behind a box and not move, so i just walked up to them and bashed them to death no problem.  other times, and most times, they would react quite intelligently and stay behind cover and not come out until i was dead or they thought i was gone.  the vehicles handle much tighter this time and it's quite a relief that i didn't have to do all the driving.  the npc guys can drive, too.  also, you don't have a health bar anymore, just an armor meter that recharges quite quick so long as you can stay out of the gunfire for a couple seconds.  i liked this new armor meter much more than the traditional health bar.  and i love the energy sword and dual guns.  although having two guns really sucks when you're in a crowd and you can't seem to remember that you can't throw a grenade when you have two needlers in your palms.the one thing that i really hated about this game, besides the crap cliff-hanger ending, is the freakin' mutated guys from the first game.  the enemies with the little floating things on their faces, i hate them.  they are really annoying and poorly designed, why the hell are they there in the first place.  i know it all ties in to the story of the first game, but still, those enemies have been done before.  i wish there were more new enemies in halo 2, like the flying bug creatures that shoot at you, or the wookie lookin' guys, though i didn't really favor them either.  but that's cause they are so freakin' tough and kept kickin' my ass.  but they were still cool.  i'd like to see more things that crawl around on the ceilings and stuff, faster enemies, so you can't just walk into a room and shoot one after another until you're the last one standing.well, i think i've rambled enough about this game.  so i guess the choice is still up to you.  but be warned, this game is not revolutionary, it's just more of the same.  it's the original halo with super-shiny graphics and some new levels, that's all.  and the dual wielding, sword...etc...but those are minor changes that have all been done already in other games.so, this is a good game.  not great, but it's worth the purchase.  i just can't wait to go back through it with a friend in co-op mode and keep getting him killed.i'm just glad i haven't been eagerly anticipating this game like everyone else, because if i had been, i would have been really pissed off.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2004"}

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Cg Customs","summary":"good","reviewText":"Halo 2 is the sequel to the best selling xbox game Halo, which sold over 4million copies with unbeliveable graphics, gameplay, sound and a stoyline that left you in suspence wanting to know what will happen next.

When I bought Grip-iT Analog Covers I bought them primarily out of curiosity due to the positive reviews I've seen on the product page. I was not disappointed! First I covered the thumb-sticks on my Xbox 360 controller. Xbox 360 controller Thumb-Sticks are great by themselves, and mine were not damaged or anything like that. I thought I'd give it a try. To my surprise controlling the games did get better. That is due to two reasons. First the area in touch with the thumb becomes wider, which gives more leeway if you move your thumb around on the thumb stick. Second the material the grip covers are made from is a very nice textured rubber that really does give a feeling of \"good grip\". Finaly, it makes the thumb stick slightly higher than the thumb-stick without anything on. It maybe about a quarter of an inch, but it makes a big difference when you're aiming in shooter games. When the thumb stick is taller the distance you have to move the stick to make the camera or character move is greater, thus offering more precision. I was surprised when a 1/4 of an inch made a difference, but it did.I also tried the same pair of grips on my PlayStation 3 Dual Shock 3 controller. Since players always complained about the PlayStation thumb-sticks the effect is even more dramatic. DualShock3 sticks are shaped like a mushroom with the center being elevated, as opposed to Xbox controller, where the center is pushed in or concave. This causes some players, including myself, to slip their thumbs accidentally, especially in shooter games. With the Grip-It covers on, the finger does not slip anymore and the surface becomes kind of flat instead of mushroom shaped.

First time I played Zelda Ocarina of Time, Super Mario 64, Resident Evil 4 are just a few that come to mind first. Blood Dragon is now in that category for me as one of the all time greats. It's not that it re-invents the wheel in creating something that has never been done before, because it is still a straight forward open world shooter. It's how it does it and how well it does it that makes it stand out from every other shooter to have come before it or available now.When the trailer for the game first hit I knew this was a day 1 purchase, especially at a price of $15! Are you kidding me? UbiSoft hands down deserves to win GOTY. Sure it's early in the gaming season but I am going to be a hard man to impress with anything that hits me the way this game did.Everything about it is right. The look, the music, the gameplay, the dialog. It spot on delivers exactly what was promised in the trailer and press rounds made before this bad boy hit the market place. 80s action in a sci fi world that was nothing more then a dream for a lot of us as a child. Now that dream has come true.I don't even normally care for shooters to be honest since I am more of a Fallout 3 / Zelda guy,  but I realize that it's not the shooters I don't care for as a genre, it's that the shooters that are out there lack the story element and vibe that can keep my interest. Blood Dragon nailed it for me and is my favorite shooter of all time. There are so many \"holy ****\" moments of literal laugh out loud moments and \"**** yeah!\"' that I did not want the game to end.Please Ubisoft, take my money and give me more Blood Dragon, a sequel or DLC must happen. Same game designers, same voice actors, more music from Power Glove (yup I bought the soundtrack), and give me a another story in this world but make it bigger with a longer campaign. I want a Fallout 3 / Skyrim game length in this world you've created for Blood Dragon. Do it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2013"}

With your very own plush pal you can keep your new friend with you even when you're away from your Xbox 360.","reviewerName":"iHyphy","summary":"Addictimals!","reviewText":"Kinectimals is structured and directed more to a younger audience.  My 5 year old daughter is addicted!  The game is however quite inviting to the older generation, especially when I see how much my kid was enjoying her new pet!Kinectimals isn't too advance in the form of a Sims game, but you do get to teach your pet several tricks (i believe there is like 10).  You teach your pet to do tricks by performing them yourself, and after he/she has learned the trick you can either perform the trick so your kinectimals will mimic you or you can just give voice commands.  Also, you have to show your pet love--to do this you will take care of it by petting it, congratulating it, brushing it, playing fetch or with other toys, buying accessories for it, and more!  All these actions help build up a type of discovery meter, the more you do with your pet the more the discovery meter builds up and in turn the more of the map/island you discover.  The more you discover, the more you unlock!There isn't much of an actual storyline, except for the introduction you get on how everything came about and how the previous pet owner (some pirate/captain) left many years ago.  Overall, your main objective is to eventually discover the whole island and defeat mini games on the way.  You can also, use a magnifying glass to scope out your surroundings in the meantime to look for buried hidden treasures.The mini games are creative and fun but a little bit repetitive.  They utilize the same games but dress them up differently so they appear different.  \"Bumble\" the guide of the game, a half bee/half mouse looking animal, flies around talking and sometimes I found to be quite annoying.  There is a marketplace within furr town which you can purchase items from all the discovery points you receive.  The items sold there can be used to decorate the interior of your home, accessorize your pet, etc etc etc.My daughter and I are still discovering the island and the game for now, but I will post more as more comes.  I believe this is a great game and great buy if you have a child in the age range of 5 - 15.  But, if you are just an adult looking for a Kinect game for yourself, you will find yourself bored with the title quicker then a child would be.  I only played a few times, and don't care to play to much more except for letting my daughter play.*For people who are wondering if you can buy the plush animals and use them over multiple gamertags--well you can!  The scan card on the plush animal isn't unique in any way and can be scanned multiple times to any gamertag.**For people who have pre-order bonus codes for exclusive animals (i.e. the gamestop exclusive red-n-black tiger), after redeeming the code and downloading the content, the game will not let you choose the red-n-black tiger from the start.  You must pick any animal, and after you leave the bonding circle to head towards your home...a pop up message will show up in the top left corner of your screen alerting you of a new friend in furr town.  That will be your red-n-black tiger.***For achievement hunters, the achievements on this game are extremely easy to get because this game wasn't made very challenging at all.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00005NN5A","reviewerName":"David Girod","summary":"Still Played Often after 4 years!!!","reviewText":"This was one of the first games I bought when I got the PS2 about 4 years ago. Now, my son who is 6 and I play this game almost nightly. The main focus of the game is going around picking up Springfield residents and dropping them off at their desired locations around town. This earns you money which allows you to unlock new characters and cars, and new Springfield locations. The gameplay is fast and fun, the controls are easy to use, and the graphics are fantastic. As a huge fan of the TV show, I was delighted to hear comments made by the characters:Chief Wiggum: 'I'd tell you to buckle up, but somebody stole the seatbelts'Ralph: 'The elves tell me to burn things'Homer: ' Don't sit on my Nacho's'The Mission mode of the game is fun too. You have to complete a series of missions, like Otto knocking over a bunch of lightpoles in a given amount of time, to unlock a secret car.But the highlight of the game is the Head to Head mode. In this portion of the game two drivers compete to pick up either 5, 10 or 15 passengers and delivery them to their destination before the other drive. Once a passenger is picked up by one driver, the other driver has to try and ram the would-be taxi in order to steal the passenger away. The head to head mode quickly became my favorite portion of the game once I was able to unlock all of the cars and levels.As an added bonus, there are secrets to the game as well. Try playing on Halloween, or Christmas, and the characters and their cars change looks. Also, you can unlock the 'Nuclear' bus and drive that around too. If you like this game I also recommend The Simpsons Hit & Run game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2004"}

Much like the first game the menus and venues are relatively the same. Given some new songs, and some slightly enhanced visuals and modes, one wont have a hard time switching over.Infact RB2 is a pinch easier on the timing window for hammer ons and pull offs. If this turns one away the difficulty has been raised to offer more a challenge, songs like Judas Preist's \"Painkiller\" and Metallica's \"Battery\" are quite the uproar. Luckily their still is a handfull of easy songs, and of slight difficulty.RB2 versatile rocking track list feels a little blue. Many awesome songs, but so many filler alt rock bands that don't really live up to a Rock Band feeling swarm the game. It's not even so much the songs are bad, they just really don't fit the experience all too well. Atleast one has the option to transfer all RB1 songs to their HDD for use in RB2. As good as a boat load of new tracks smell it has a slightly offending odor to it. One must pay a light fee, and a few tracks aren't available. This is due to a licensing issue.Rock out at a party with this stellar title, play at home and crank the speakers, download some tracks and invest some time in good qaulity music. Rock Band 2 is finally here.This version lacks the 'gear' to immersivley play, but one should already of had access previously if purchasing this variant. Inside the booklet of the game contains a code which allows access to 20 free songs from the Rock Band site, as of now the songs have still yet to appear. Rock Band 2features a strong online community and an even strong dowloadable content (DLC) basis. Every Tuesday songs are released, upon paying for them you can have access to entire albums! Harmonix has also allowed for single players to play World Tour mode, this is much like the multiplayr aspect of the previous game. 'Touring' locations all over the world unlocking new songs and venues as one progresses, you can even join up with your band to continue.Overall Rock Band 2 is great, only main issue is unlocking every song is a bit tedious. The equalizers on certain songs sound poorly mixed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2008"}

Lucas has been taught the art of combat in the ancient and deadly style of the Legion. Lucas is a skilled swordsman, and a master of two combat stances. He can fight with a sword and shield, which allows him to attack quickly, deal heavy damage, and interrupt and stun single targets. When outnumbered, he wields a massive two-handed sword.

{"product_name":"B001CRQYBO","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Flying Nazis... does it get any better?","reviewText":"Wolfenstein continues to try to juggle the various beaten-to-death knives of WWII shooter, occult storyline, and \"interactive\" NPC's, and amazingly, does all three with only a handful of cuts and dropped pieces. Up front I'll say this is only for single player, as for some reason I can't even access multiplayer.Wolfenstein continues to follow the occult-riddled Nazi escapades of agent B.J. Blazkowicz. Agent BJ (which an alarmingly large number of people call him without getting shot in the face) is dropped into Germany after sinking a German cruiser and finding a medallion that can both ward off bullets and flense thirty men down to the bone. Upon arriving, you discover a similar medallion, just prior to being given a briefing by a member of the Golden Dawn (Alister Crowley makes no appearances to my knowledge) and are tasked with preventing General Zetta from opening a portal to the realm of the Black Sun and stealing the power of the Thules. While so much of this seems hackneyed and dried out, not too mention rather over the top, considering that amount of story gets rammed down your throat in the first ten to twenty minutes, its delivered in such a way that it doesn't seem like the same ol thing.Interactions are a bit strange. Some NPC's are interactive, and will calmly hold a discussion while a German platoon is attempting to fill you with lead. You purchase upgrades through the black market by finding bags and bars of gold(because cash is apparently for sissies), though after finding five dozen bags or so, I'd probably have absconded to buy a Hawaiian island. The finding quests are actually worthwhile, finding blueprints to unlock new weapon upgrades and inject some nice side pieces of backstory, but while being in plain sight, rather than being buried under boxes or tucked behind impossible to spot hidden doors, they require you to scour every square centimeter of every level, since we know most people leave a bag of gold on the sidewalk tucked between two crates, where no one will ever find it, as opposed to in a safe. Searching is rather neat, a simple button hold that actually shows going through the motions of searching cabinets or threading bombs, but its surprisingly rarely used.Combat manages to be exciting and annoying in turns. Most of your eyes have telescopic night vision, able to spot and alert to your presence when they appear as a speck in the distance even on high end TV's. the sorcerers you encounter are rather overpowered, and can soak up almost as many bullets as you can. Health is ridiculous, and reminiscent of the Getaway, basically hide long enough for the blood around your screen edge to fade, making this a cake walk even on Uber difficulty assuming that there's decent cover available. Several of the effects, namely the anti-gravity which allows you to pick off soldiers like slow flying skeet are entertaining.Overall, this game is okay. Not great by any stretch, as they lock you out of too many neat bits and spoon feed you too much story too soon, but not as disappointing as I'd been led to believe. After all, who doesn't like a good Nazi shoot? A decent plot and some entertaining asides that manages to stop just short of being grindy make this a solid rent-to-own, though emphasis is on rent. And if your looking for MP Wolfenstein, I'd just as soon stick to the online freeware.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001UW9ZW6","reviewerName":"Greg Sword \"DETfaninATL\"","summary":"A Game w/ A LOT To It. But That's Both Good & Bad","reviewText":"MARVEL ULTIMATE ALLIANCE 2 (MUA2) was one of the very first games I got with my PS3 and it was the first one I played, since I'm a big fan of Marvel Comics, have been since I was a wee tot, and I still collect a few of them to this day. Having no prior experience to judge it against, I liked it well enough at the time and enjoyed playing through it a second time, as the game more or less requires this to complete the story. However, I never finished it the second time. Partly because I played it on Legendary difficulty (the hardest setting) which, towards the end became extremely difficult to beat some of the boss battles, and partly because, well, I started getting bored with it. Despite the many things to do in the game, the different story paths, the number of characters and the variety of mini-games, etc., I just found myself losing interest and wanting to play other games I had sitting on my shelf. That's not to say this is a boring game - it just depends on what you're in to. I'd say it's more of a mixed bag. Some good, some bad. But let's start first with.....THE GOOD: In a nutshell, there's a lot to do in this game. On the surface, this seems like a pretty straight-forward, role-playing, hero smash-down, using the iconic characters (and many lesser-knowns) from the Marvel Comics Universe. But once you get into the game it soon becomes apparent that there's more to it than you'd first suspect. The first and most noticeable layer of depth the game has going for it is that the main storyline is split into 2 separate, playable paths, each of which requires a separate and full play-through of the game to experience. This has to do with the basic plot of the game, which deals with the hero and villain communities alike being divded between and amongst themselves due to a political agenda. Think of it as Democrats vs. Republicans for superheroes, but it serves its' purpose. Next would be all of the various combinations of super-powered attacks that you can employ. Not only does each character have their own repertoire of super-powered attacks beyond 'punch' & 'heavy punch' but by combining the powers of the various characters in any myriad of combinations, you also form powered 'fusions' to attack your enemies with in any of 4 basic but impressive and dazzling ways. But it's not just the attacks that have depth to them, due to the sheer number of characters in the game, and depending on who you're playing at the time, you can answer questions differently in the sections where you encounter and talk to major players in the game. The end result always ends up being the same, but it's interesting to hear how each character talks to the next. Additionally, there's the option to unlock different costumes for each character (some of which are very cool, some of which are not ), upgrade each character's strength, power and stamina, and of course, swap characters in and out at will. In addition to everything pertaining to the characters, there are mini-training missions you can send your characters on, Trivia games you can play regarding the Marvel universe, and of course, items to find and collect. It's essentially a role-playing game with an action / adventure element, set to the backdrop of the world of Marvel superheroes, so it can be a very fun and at times challenging game to play at times. But then there are the 'other' times.....THE BAD : Unfortunately, what is best about this game is also what is worst about it - there's a LOT to it. Almost too much. Too many characters to play, too many possible combinations of fusions, too many costumes to try & get, too many upgrades (because there's ones for each character), too many trivia questions and just too much to try and do in 2 playthroughs, because, as I mentioned previously, after 2 playthroughs, I was pretty much 'over' this game. And it's a shame because it's not a bad game; just a little overwhelming. Take, for instance, the characters themselves. There's just too many of them. Yeah, sure, this is Marvel comics and their universe and as we all know, it's called a 'universe' for a reason. But it seems like there's just too many characters to play like Songbird, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, She-Hulk and others. Add to that, that you can play a good bit of the villains too (this has to do with the overall plot), plus the fact that some major Marvel names are nowhere to be found (Cyclops , anyone?) and it just feels like way too much. Even the trophies / achievements feel like there are just too many. At just under 60 trophies or achievements to achieve a Platinum or 100% completion, it feels like way too much. And it's not just that there's too many characters or too much to do. As previously hinted, the game makes some bad choices. As I just noted some major Marvel characters are either not in the game at all or have to be unlocked by finding a number of regular items throughout normal play. Characters like Thor, The Hulk and Jean Grey. These are primary staples of the Marvel Universe, so why are they absent from the get go and only available if you put in the time and effort, when lesser characters litter the map? And tacking right on to the characters themselves are some of the alternate costume choices for them. Some of them are pretty cool, but some, most definitely, are not. I don't want to spoil the surprise for anyone, but there were a few that after achieving the requirement to unlock the costume and seeing what it was, I was quite disappointed and saying to myself \" they chose that over ___ !?!?!\" In addition to there being 'too much' to the game, and having some bad choices, the game also feels like it has some things added into it for the sake of giving the player more to do, but as I think I've made clear - that just isn't necessary. For example, the trivia mini-games and training missions. With a game that requires two playthroughs and has the sheer number of characters it does, were these things REALLY necessary? They may be fun in a novel sort of way, but they certainly weren't necessary. Not in my book at least.THE BOTTOM LINE : MUA2 is a pretty decent game, if not very good. The graphics and sound effects are good, the heroes are fun to play and the variety of them works both in the game's favor and against it. If you're into this type of game and especially the Marvel universe, you'll find hours upon hours and many, many playthroughs worth of fun in this. On the other hand, if you're approach to these kinds of games is a little more casual (as I found mine to be), you'll definitely enjoy it, but you'll likely get bored with it after a time. Or at least overwhelmed, which will lead you to being apathetic about it. All in all, I'd recommend you rent or borrow it before you buy it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2010"}

Wait, come back to me, that was lame.","reviewText":"I can imagine writing a bad review of Skyrim, I really can. I could go on and on about the glitches I've seen in the game, like the harmless (but hilarious) person outside of Whiterun who originally had his identical twin next to him, and now has a triplet, too. They all talk at the same time, sharing animations. It's great. Or I could talk about the more annoying glitches, like the quests that don't register properly (my favorite being \"Slay the giant at \"), or the freeze-ups, or the problems with quest items like the crimson nirnroot.But if I went into that, I wouldn't be being honest about the experience of playing through Skyrim, into which I have sunk something like 160 hours. Can I really complain about glitches when I'm putting it in my console to play every night of the week for hours at a time? Can I really say, yeah, this product is unfinished, when I still want to venture out to slay dragons and find new shouts? I can't. Skyrim may have its problems, but at the end of the day, it's one of the best games I've ever played.For me, the selling factor of Skyrim is its sheer amount of content. I'll give you a hint for playing it; once you're able, ignore any active quests you've got open and head to Riften, on the other side of the map from your starting point. The journey alone took me 3 days, had me fighting giants, spiders, bears, saber cats, and of course, humans. Once I got there, I was ready to take on a ton of quests. I suddenly wanted to do everything.And everything I did do. I became an assassin. And a werewolf. And a thief. And a mage. And a dragonslayer. Everything under the sun is available to you, and you can complete the game in just about any way you see fit, or all of them if you want to. I finished the game (or, I guess, completed the main story and stopped playing) at level 60 without ever wearing heavy armor or using a two-handed weapon, or a shield.While the game is exciting and gigantic (I mean, like, HUGE, never let it be said otherwise), I do have a couple of concerns about the design itself, apart from the technical glitches. Since the game is so large and you can walk literally everywhere right off the bat, the balance is all over the place. You may be fine in a forest, then come across a fort that demolishes you. Several of the bosses are significantly more difficult than the areas they inhabit, and come down to \"get him to not notice you, then stealth attack him\" too easily.I have to wonder what could have been done by giving the game a more Metroid/Castlevania design; locking down certain areas until a power or item is unlocked, or block access to certain portions of the map until you help the Stormcloaks or the Imperials ransack it.I would also, for one, like to hear a more consistent soundtrack. I would hate for Skyrim to become a JRPG, but let's hear a theme when we're fighting dragons. Or during the big story bosses. They're in the game, add a track!But I'm nitpicking, really I am. Skyrim, ultimately, overcomes its shortcomings to become more than the sum of its parts. I can't imagine telling someone to not play it on the basis of what are ultimately minor technical issues.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2012"}

Cadieux","summary":"Excellent game, lag problems negligible","reviewText":"This game has been through a lot.  I bought it when it was just released in November 2011, but after reading about the famous PS3 lag problems, I decided to put it away for a while and wait for them to fix it.  I opened it in April 2012 and have spent the last 3 months playing it.  I can say that while the lag is not \"fixed\", it is definitely minimised.  I got up to about 180 hours play time and a 11MB save file, and the lag only appeared a few times.  It was not as slow as original reviewers reported, and it disappeared fairly quickly each time after it started.  The game was highly playable, so if you've been waiting for these issues to be resolved, you can pretty safely buy now.With that out of the way, this game is excellent.  I don't give 5-star reviews in both \"fun\" and \"overall\" lightly, but Skyrim absolutely deserves it.  You can tell how much work went into this game, from the weapons and armour designs, to the mind-boggling number of quests.  It's also flexible enough that you can change play styles in the middle.  I started with a fire mage and developed a pretty high magic level.  Then when I was about 3/4 through I discovered the joys of arrows, and by the end of the game I was the deadliest and stealthiest archer around.  You're not locked in to one play style until late in the game.For those who are interested, the platinum trophy is fairly easy to get (only my 2nd platinum out of over 50 PS3 games owned and finished).  Nothing is particularly challenging, it just requires a lot of time playing.  All trophies can be earned in a single playthrough, but be careful in the Daedric quests and use a guide.  It's possible to irreversibly screw up these quests such that a second playthrough would be required to get the platinum.  Anyway, it's nice for the company to reward any and all players who spend a lot of time with the game by making the platinum trophy so accessible.This game is absolutely epic, and it's difficult to imagine anybody topping it any time soon.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2012"}

All my Elder Scrolls games are in PC version- from Arena Daggerfall, the Redguard, Morrowind, to Oblivion. Now I really don't care if you're a console gamer or a PC gamer. There's been a lot of talk from the PC gamer side about the game having \"consolitis\" and not being optimized for PC use. I'm a longtime PC gamer (hailing back from the 80s) but to me it doesn't matter what format or machine you have. If it's a good game, then it's a good game. Why did I decide to go for PS3? Well, for one thing, the PC version, according to several PC forums I've visited, crashes every so often. I want to enjoy my Elder Scrolls, and until somebody at Bethesda fixes these random crashes on PC, I'm sticking with my trusty PS3. So, now that I've gotten this out of the way, let's proceed with my review. My review is based only on five hours of playing/exploring. It's not going to be a comprehensive review.Graphics: Ahh yes, people love eye candy. Well...I've seen Oblivion on PC and it looks great. I have not seen Oblivion on PS3. Now, having seen Skyrim on the PS3, I really can't make a judgement call whether the graphics are good or not compared to Oblivion's PS3. All I can say, for a console, the graphics are amazingly beautiful. I use a 24\" LED PC Flat 1040p monitor to play PS3 games so I can put my arms on the desk while holding a controller (I'm really a PC gamer at heart). The textures, shadows, character detail are beautiful. I am just impressed with it. I think it has to do with the fact that I have a small screen which tends to compress the textures, thus making the graphics sharper and crispier. I did try Skyrim on a 55\" LED screen and it stretched and \"blew-up\" the textures which didn't really catch my taste. I guess to each his own style and preference.Sound: Sound effects are your standard fare of ambient forest sounds. You'll hear the standard woodpecker pounding it's beak on a tree sound; the gusting wind when you're up on a high ledge, the rustle of leaves and branches, it's all there. As for music, I always turn off the music on any game so I can't make a comment on this.User Interface: Elder Scrolls is not known for smart UIs. If you've played some of the later Elder Scrolls games like Morrowind, you'll know just how awful the UI was on that game. Oblivion wasn't all that user friendly either. Surprisingly, the UI on Skyrim seems friendly enough. This is where I can see why Skyrim was really made for a console. I can imagine a PC gamer struggling to work the UI using a mouse. The UI for the console is actually friendly in some ways. If you wish to access your inventory/skills, you hit the square button and you are presented with a four directional arrow, similar to a compass. Each point of the arrow takes you to a specific part of the character interface..ITEMS, SKILLS, etc. I can't remember the other two. If you need to enter your journal, General Stats, System, you hit the START button. It takes getting used to, but clearly it's a step in the right direction.You can save the game anywhere anytime and load the game to the exact point where you last saved, plus there's the usual Autosave, and the difficulty level can be adjusted at any time during the game.Gameplay: Gameplay is very similar to Oblivion. I'm a warrior so I do tons of melee. You have two POVs- first and third person. I use third person POV so I can have better situational awareness. I have not tested the AI fully. In my first two hours of exploration I managed to obliterate an entire group of bandits, about 7 of them, in a mining cave. I've two-shotted most of them with a nasty Steel Warhammer. I'm playing in Adept level which is Normal probably. Encumberance is still in Skyrim. You can load up to 300 lbs of items. After the first 30 mins of the game intro (aka tutorial), you are thrown on your own in the vast world of Skyrim. There is an overhead compass to direct you on where you wish to go- towards your main quest, nearest points of interest, and mining areas. Yes there is crafting in Skyrim but I have not gone crafting yet. Overall, the game feels like Oblivion, but with more places to visit, bigger areas to uncover.Conclusion: Having only played Skyrim for 5 hours due to real world life, I can say I made the right choice of getting the game. Should I get the PC version. Most definitely. But you are more into consoles, the PS3 easily handles the game well. There are loading screens. The first time you run Skyrim, there is a huge patch that PS3 downloads, and then there's a 10 minute wait for installation files to get loaded. After that, the loading time becomes bearable on each area you go into, whether stepping out of a house or coming back in, or moving to a new location. Overall, I'd say get this game because it's well worth the $60.00 plus the supposedly 200+ hours of gameplay, not to mention the upcoming expansions that will go with it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2011"}

Wario, Mario's jealous rival, plays the hero--well, kind of--in his first console adventure.Money TroubleIn the depths of Wario's castle lies the plunder of his many adventures on the Game Boy, Game Boy Advance and elsewhere.While Wario kicks back in his crib, enjoying the videogame equivalent of bling-bling, a mysterious black jewel in his trove transforms gems into monsters. His wealth, which was once a source of pride, becomes his greatest foe. Now, Wario must scramble to recover his riches.Cranky CapitalistStep into an alternate world filled with quirky puzzles, swarming enemies and lots and lots of loot.

The game even has a wrestling game-ish feel, as you can string together combo attacks that The Rock would give his eyebrow for.Early on, you will learn the significance of special sticky balls that dot the landscape. Wario can cling to these balls to navigate tough spots, reach new areas, and even fight bosses.You can freely bash and manipulate your surroundings to discover secrets. For instance, you can pick up a stone pillar and swing it at your foes or spin a fallen monster to activate a switch that raises a gate.Perplexing PuzzlesThe side-scrolling action remains true to the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games that made Wario famous, but Wario's incredible range of motion gives him newfound freedom.Finding treasure often calls for flipping a colored switch, then searching high and low for the activated chest. Considering the size of the worlds and the plethora of hiding places, this can be quite a feat. When it comes to moolah, though, no task is too tough for Wario.Trap doors transport you to hidden worlds that offer mind-bending puzzles. Using your noggin' will yield some important items. A colorful band of fairies offers game info and advice throughout your adventure.GraphicsThe development team at Treasure have stamped Wario's Nintendo GameCube debut with colorful and vibrant graphics.

Titles such as Devil May Cry and God of War are two of the best action adventure titles that truly take the action and adrenaline rush to an extremely exaggerated level.  Scenes where Kratos rips apart mythical creatures with his bare hands, and scenes where Dante jumps atop a moving missile and navigates it with his feet, are prime examples of why these games are non-stop action.  Never did I think I would encounter a game with just as much gameplay exaggeration as these, but then I bought Ninja Blade.Ninja Blade looks beautiful.  Its crisp and sharp graphics are stunning to look at, and its in game animations are top notch.  The scale of the levels and boss battles also take full advantage of the graphical powers the game is boasting.  The action is fast paced and even though it resembles Ninja Gaiden, Devil May Cry, and God of War, Ninja Blade has an identity of its own.The story focuses around a group of soldiers/ninja who are codenamed G.U.I.D.E.  They are responsible for the elimination of threats that normal weapons and humans are not capable of defeating on their own.  The player takes control of an American born ninja named Ken Ogawa, who happens to be the son of the leader of G.U.I.D.E.  The team has been called to Japan to assist in containing a sudden outbreak that has occurred as a result of parasites referred to as \"Alpha Worms\".  These worms are causing the citizens of Japan to mutate into horrible creatures who are under full control of the parasites.  After being betrayed by both his father and his friend, Ken Ogawa is left to contain the outbreak on his own.Fusing elements from the three games quite nicely, Ninja Blade is truly a lot fun to play.  The game contains a wide range of weapons, from small and fast, to large and slow, Ken's arsenal is greatly diverse.  Ken has access to various forms of Ninjutsu, each with different element properties such as fire, or wind.  Portions of the game require the player to protect a vehicle while fighting off enemy hordes in \"on rail shooter\" type moments.  These moments do not last very long, but are still quite interesting and unique to the overall feel of the game.  Many of Ken's combos resemble Kratos' fighting style from God of War, utilizing lengthy combos chained together in various ways with sudden \"kill commands\" that require fast reflexes to initiate more in depth and over the top kills on each opponent.  This brings up the next subject for Ninja Blade, the boss battles.  The boss battles are epic, placing Ken at the top of buildings, forcing him to fight off enemies twice the size of the entire building.  The fights always finish with \"quick time events\" that take the kills to even higher levels than what the game already depicts.  Moments such as flinging motorcycles at oncoming bosses, or riding missiles (ala Devil May Cry) utilize the \"quick time events\" greatly.  Using the quick time events, the player must control every aspect of Ken's decisions, even things such as landing and jumping are based on these, and all boss battles boil down to this formula as well.Despite the fact that the game looks like Ninja Gaiden, plays like God of War, and acts like Devil May Cry, it still has enough of its identity to make it worthwhile.  With over-the-top action scenes, quick time events, epic boss battles, and great combat systems, the game is a lot of fun to play and is definitely worth checking out if you own an Xbox 360","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2010"}

{"product_name":"B003O6JIVE","reviewerName":"Stephen M. Sturgeon","summary":"Great game, then there's the ending.","reviewText":"Let me start by saying that I actually liked the original FF XIII. I know a lot of people didn't and I can understand why. XIII had its strengths, but it also had its weaknesses, to the point where I was honestly surprised when they announced a sequel.But as many problems as XIII had, XIII-2 addresses these problems and came up as the game that the original XIII should have been.It's no longer a corridor crawl. While each area has an objective and a map leading you to that objective, you're not shoehorned into going where the game wants you to go. You have room to explore and do side quests. So the linearity and lack of towns is very much improved with this.The battles are a mixed bag. It's a little different engaging your enemy. It's a mix between having creatures pop up on the world map then having a limited time to either engage or flee. The actual battles themselves are similar enough to XIII that you could go straight from the old game to this one and feel right at home.Boss battles, however, now include a new feature that's pretty much the same quick time events that you see in other games. However, it gives you ample warning that an event is coming up, the time to react is very generous and it doesn't end in a game over if you mess up. You simply don't end the battle as well as you could, which may mean missing out on some enemy drops or a slight change in story line.I'm rather split on this. As far as quick time events go, XIII-2 does this very well, but I'm not used to having this kind of play mechanic in a JRPG. It could be a take it or leave it.So, here's what XIII-2 did right. They refined the battle system, added towns and opened up the exploration. This does everything XIII tried to do, only better. This is the game XIII was trying to be. In this way, it is a very good game and well worth your money.Here's what XIII-2 did wrong. It is a very short game. Just looking at the calendar, it was released on Jan 31. I just beat it yesterday. Eight days! I beat this game in eight days. I have NEVER beaten an RPG, let alone a Final Fantasy game, in eight days. Sure there's still plenty of side quests to do. There's plenty of content that offsets the shortness of the main quest. But the main quest is the real meat of...and the main reason to buy...a JRPG. It should never be so short, particularly a Final Fantasy game.Also the ending. Yes, do let me rant awhile. Without spoiling too much, it's a bit of a downer ending. That I can handle. Crisis Core had a downer ending. Tomb Raider Last Revelation had a downer ending. Hamlet had a downer ending. I can handle downer endings.What I don't like are three little words \"to be continued.\" When you spend premium prices on a game, you shouldn't have to proceed to be nickel and dimed by downloadable content to get the real ending. Actually, I wouldn't even be so harsh about \"to be continued\" as long as the game itself had a self-contained ending, an ending that would make you say \"yeah, there's more to see. I may get the next part to see how it resolves. But I feel satisfied with this. If this is all I see of this story line, I still feel like I had a complete story and therefore a complete experience.\"But that's not what they do. The ending leaves everything in a very bad, very unresolved way. They let you know that if you want any kind of resolution, you're going to have to pay more, above and beyond the not so cheap sticker price.Now don't get me wrong. I think downloadable content has its place (an outfit, a special weapon, new characters, new maps). But to make a precedent where you have to download the actual ending to the game above and beyond the sticker price is the start of a slippery slope of not having to have an entire game on a rather expensive disk, dolling out the rest of the game in an undetermined number of expansions that nickel and dime the players who already paid to be able to play AND FINISH the game.So where does that leave this review? Does the good outweigh the bad?Unfortunately, yes. The good does outweigh the bad. Like I said at the beginning of this review, I liked the original XIII. This does everything better. It's what XIII should have been. I may or may not go for the DLC that finishes out the game, though I'll be a sucker if I do. But the bottom line is that this game is fun. It has an emotional impact with the story. You come to care about the characters. It's a heck of a journey.I would give this game five stars even given the shortness of the main quest. The ending and having to go to DLC in order to finish the game, however, is going to cost it a star.It's a dangerous precedent of not having an entire game on the disk and forcing the players into downloading more DLC in order to have a complete experience. Video games are an expensive hobby enough without being nickel and dimed just to get a complete game.I would say three and a half stars. Amazon doesn't deal in half stars. Since everything else about the game is so good, I'll be generous and say four stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2012"}

Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Benjamin S. Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"If judged just on \"being fun\" RE 5 prevails!","reviewText":"RE is a series that at times I've danced with and at other moments I've tried to avoid like the T-virus. I never was a huge fan of the first RE but RE 2 and RE 3 Nemesis held my fascination and scared the crap out of me though I was not the best at playing them. By code name Veronica I was tired of the bad controls and \"same old puzzle schemes\".Luckily capcom must have had some mind reading psychics because with RE 4 the game play was fine tuned to perfection, the environments were made fun to explore, and the over the shoulder perspective and laser scope ensured even novices could jump right in and have a fun time! The only qualm I had with RE 4 is it seemed a bit disconnected from the other games with its' las plagos plot. Yet most of us got so much enjoyment out of the game we did not care.So here is RE 5. Everyone had high expectations for it. Some even thought it was going to bring another revolution to the series like RE 4 did. The first thing I'll say is RE 5 does a great job of combining what we liked about RE 4 and fusing it with a story-line that is actually tied to the RE mythos. The fact you are Chris Red-field who has flash backs about fighting Wesker with Jill Valentine should be testament you are in familiar territory and for the most part it is great to be back!However before I go on I should tell you this is not a revolution in the series. RE 5 is very much like RE 4 as far as game play, camera, and creature designs are concerned. While there are nuances later on devoted more to the old school fans (lickers anyone?) this is akin to playing RE 4 in Africa. So for those of you that expected RE 5 to be the next Gears of war 2 or wanted another re-haul you may find yourselves disappointed.This poses a question I would ask you though. If every game in the series is a \"revolution\" and completely changes all the ground work laid before it is there a big risk in losing what we the fans love about the series? Personally I expected RE 5 to be very similar to RE 4. I did not expect it to go so far off the beaten path I did not know what the heck I was playing.A lot of the complaints people give RE 5 can be easily rectified. For example if you dislike the control scheme there is a menu to customize the game functions more to your liking. If Sheva is constantly dying it is due to the fact you are either a. Not providing her with enough weapons or b. not upgrading her weapons. RE 5 is not about being a selfish miser. If you put everything you have into improving Chris but leave Sheva Alomar by the way side you will suffer for it. Both of these characters are equal in importance not only to the story line but also to the actual missions. I suggest improving them both on equal terms.This brings me to the next topic. Many believe that because Sheva is with Chris and combat capable it kills the suspense. While that is true in mild regards it creates a whole new tension of not only having to worry about yourself but also be concerned about your partner. If either of you die the game ends. I found this can invoke its' own type of anxiety and apprehension.The bottom line is the reason RE 5 is not as scary to us action/horror junkies is because we have been playing these types of games for a LONG TIME. We cannot expect to have that same amount of wonderment, awe, and dread for RE that we did when we were much younger. As time goes on things become more predictable. There's no getting around that.So what is the story? A new strand of Las plagos have infected a fictional city of Africa. Sheva has personal stakes in it because her people are being oppressed and experimented on due to the greed of the Umbrella cooperation and Chris is part of a new group that cracks down on biological terrorism. I would say more about \"awesome cameos\" but that is spoiler classified information.Another concern the fans might have is \"are the boss fights fun?\" I suppose that depends on what you expect. I did enjoy having to incinerate the first swarming larvae boss by trapping it in an industrial flame thrower room . It was interesting to lay proximity minds to paralyze the next vampire bat headed boss that had a abdomen more like a caterpillar. Only it's inner thorax was a vulnerable point. Blasting away the el gigante with the big guns mounted on an over turned truck was not truly challenging but it was very satisfying. Like-wise the \"button time sequences\" are not too unforgiving and the vehicle stage in which I mowed down enraged biker minions in hot pursuit was a hoot! Admittedly I have fought harder RE bosses and a few which were more interesting but overall your encounters will still get your pulse pounding and bring a masochistic smile to your face!The enemy roster is more of the same but also has been tweaked. Some las plagos parasites can now fly by beating their bat like wings against the air and the chainsaw massacre sac headed executioners make a return. Defeating even the basic horrors in RE requires brains. For example the chainsaw executioner is highly immune to pain. Simply unloading your bullets into him is ineffective unless you also throw in powerful close range melee attacks. Infected dogs will literally jump at your face if given the opportunity so now you have to throw them off you or get mauled. Fortunately Chris and Sheva have a variety of close quarter throws, kicks, knifing slashes, and elbow maneuvers so though you are only human at least you are not completely pathetic once you hear that all too familiar \"click,click,click\" after you pull out your favorite fire arm only to discover it is 100% empty.The \"item market\" makes a return. You can buy healing supplies, upgrade weapons, and purchase new side arms and protective vestments. Sadly \"the stranger\" is not to be seen and your actions are done from a menu between chapters or when you die. The thing that makes me gnash my teeth is you use items and reload in the thick of battle. On one hand this adds more tension (which is good) but would it be so much to ask to \"pause the game\" as you fumble through your inventory? This was made more tedious than it should be.So what of the environments? The truth is though the areas are engaging and fun they are also much more linear. They are not as expansive as the huge castle in RE 4 . My favorite place was the swamp in which you got to ride around in a fan boat while visiting different huts to collect pieces of a door crest. One could make the argument encountering tribals with spears and giant masks in a murky marsh land is unrealistic or uses blatant stereotypes but honestly do any of us think all that when we are in the thick of shooting angry hordes and running for our lives?Next I have heard this game is accused of using racial stereotypes. The thing is you are \"the heroes\" out to destroy the greedy cooperation exploiting Africa. Sheeva herself is African and Joshua her best friend and trainer is black. In the first city there were white infected people mixed with the darker skinned infected people so I did not see any subversive racial under tones. It's true you meet \"tribals\" later on that don the usual spear and giant mask cliches but these are simply variants of the shield wielding robed clergy men Leon faced in RE 4.  The thing is this is \"fiction\" my friends. Take it for what it is and do not read too deeply into it!The last thing I will mention is that there is co-op. I don't know about you but for me that is \"revolutionary\" for an RE game considering they have been single player up until this point. If Sheva's ai is giving you a lot of trouble simply have your buddy drop into her shoes! This can be done online or on the couch next to you.In closing RE 5 is everything \"I\" expected it to be. While it's shorter than RE 4 which went through a few expansions later on it is still a rip roaring good time and now you can experience it all with a friend!Pros+Gorgeous graphics+A story that ties into the RE mythos.+Familiar villains+ Sheva is hot and a great heroine.+More of what we loved about RE 4.+Co-op play+You can take cover and press up against walls to pick enemies off from a safer vantage point.+ New creature types have been added and a few \"classics\" make a return!Cons-The scare is gone because face it us RE fans are jaded. We know what to expect. Horror movie shock tactics don't make us jump anymore.-The environments are more linear so there is less to explore-While it's good to burrow some things from RE 4 you will get deja vu a lot. There was a marsh land village section that reminded me of the one in RE 4 only \"re-skinned\" to look African.-The quick button press sequences are unnecessary. For friggin sakes just give Sheva and Chris a dodge/action button! The tougher enemies would be hard to evade regardless.-The inventory sharing, trading off, and item usage is done in real time. In most parts of the game I enjoyed it because it made the experience more suspenseful and realistic. However later in the game it gets frustrating as the challenge level heats up. Yes, RE 4 had a better inventory system.-If you pride yourself on being an unyielding RE traditionalist who disliked RE 4 sad to say RE 5 is not going to do much for you. Besides for an appearance of Wesker and the lickers being remastered in all their horrifying splendor RE 5 is essentially more like RE 4.-If you hate \"standing and shooting\" as opposed to \"running and gunning\" getting used to this style of game play maybe a bit frustrating.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2009"}

But \"The Getaway\" seems to be only a shadow. This game represents a movie. There are no health bars, ammunition bars, maps or anything that you would not be able to see in real life. The game does this perfectly. The fighting is also awesome. Basically you can shoot the enemys with lock on or free aim, and lean against walls, also crouch behind crates. Some things [make me mad], like how whenever I crouch behind a small object, it takes me forever to lock on to the enemy to shoot him because he runs right next to me and kills me. What I mean is, if you duck behind a crate, your givin little time to actually shoot your enemy because they do not like to have to shoot through things. I still do not exactly know the controls when you duck behind a crate or lean against a wall, but the fighting still rocks. Whenever you get shot alot you start limping, which makes you more cautious. Some levels are hard, but you will get it. There are some themes that can [make you mad], like every mission is get in a car and drive to place (following the turn signals on your car to know where to go) and then fight a gang, drive back somehwere, and repeat. The plot is good, it keeps you involved unlike grand theft auto. But there is no free roam mode until you beat the game, and there are no side quests. I have gotten half way through the game, but it will probably be much less fun the second time through. Go buy this game, you will have a good time with it for quite a bit.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2003"}

Being a huge fan of the original Metroid for NES (possibly the greatest game ever made, or equal to this one), I was frantic when I saw the commercial for this game on TV (Yep, I still vividly remember the commercial, even after all these years.) When i finally was able to purchase this game, I could barely handle the excitement. Sitting down and playing it, I was not the least disappointed. The graphics were amazing, the music atmospherically beautiful, and to be honest, I was completely captivated by the awesomeness of Samus's suit. I have played most of the great NES and SNES games, but none of them stand out in my memory as strongly as this one. I still remember getting stuck in Brinstar for a long time because I didn't know pressing \"B\" made the character run!!( this was the first game I ever played that had a run option, i believe). I vividly remember looking in the instruction booklet and anxiously awaiting finding the powerbombs. Anyway, this game is just great, so I'll break it down for you:Graphics-10/10 WOW...the graphics in this game were the best a console system had ever seen at the time. (I believe this came out before Mario RPG, Donkey Kong, and Chrono Trigger.). It was the first game to go beyond 16 bits and make it to 24 bits (amazing feat back then). The backrounds are great, and while in the Norfair stages the backround is wavey symbolizing the effects of the lava and extreme heat. The bosses are absolutely breathtaking, especially Kraid. Instead of the little itty-bitty Kraid that was in Metroid one, this one has been totally redone, and is bigger and badder than ever. Samus's suit looks great, and the weapons look awesome as well.Music-100,000/10 The music is absolutely beautiful and extraordinary. Hearing Brinstar's green theme for the first time was just amazing, and it is still stuck in my head. The more recent metroid game, \"Metroid- Fusion\" had a pretty low grade, techno-esque soundtrack, but this game is totally different. The music is often times somber and sad sounding, and often dark or mysterious. Every single levels song perfectly fits that area. The music for the Norfair area is quiet and dark sounding, fitting the darkness of the area, and the Maridia music is very eerie and brilliant, fitting for a water area. Definitely the greatest soundtrack ever for a video game, and even better than a lot of other music.Controls- 10/10 Controlling Samus is a breeze, anyone can do it. She stops moving when you take your hand off the buttons, and runs smoothly. You can also wall- jump among other things in this game. Like I said, this is one of, if not the first game to create the ability to run, which as small as it sounds is a great thing.Fun factor- 1,000,000/10...yep you read that right. There are plenty of power-ups to collect, among many other things such as missle containers and energy tanks. I've beaten this game probably 15-20 times, and it NEVER gets old. In fact, my SNES malfunctioned recently , deleating my Super Metroid file i had recently started. I was near the end of the game when it got deleted, but I still found myself playing it again without being bored or sick of it. In fact, I'm glad it got deleted, because now I can play through it again!!Seriously though, if you do not have this game you are missing out on the greatest video game ever created, and it isn't just for kids either, I'm 18 and i still love this game after 10 years. I would also recommend getting Prime, and the first Metroid. Zero Mission is also pretty good, but be aware it is extremely short, but still MUCH better than Fusion, which was a total let-down.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2005"}

{"product_name":"B001TD6SN0","reviewerName":"Patricia Laverty","summary":"Fan Service in Spades!!","reviewText":"Crossover fighting games are nothing new, and they always tend to have one thing in common: From Super Smash Bros. to Marvel vs Capcom 2, they're less about exploring what happens when disparate universes come together, and more about seeing how hard those universes can wordlessly kick each other in the teeth. It's almost always fun, but for fans invested in the stories and characters of the crossover properties, it often feels like something's missing from the experience.To say Dissidia Final Fantasy isn't like that would be a gross understatement. Bringing together a cast of 20 heroes and villains from the first 10 Final Fantasy games (plus two secret ones from XI and XII), it blends RPG elements with deceptively simple one-on-one fighting to create a crossover fighter unlike any seen before. It also puts about as much emphasis on story and character interaction as it does on fighting, and the action is supported by dozens of lengthy, densely chatty cutscenes, most of them devoted to just showing how all these characters interact with one another.There's a fresh plot behind these meetings, revolving around the gods Cosmos and Chaos gathering champions for one last, end-of-the-universe battle. But ultimately, how much you care about it all will tie in directly to how big of a Final Fantasy fan you are. If the thought of FFVII's Sephiroth having a conversation with FFVIII's Squall gives you fanboy/girl chills, or if you've always wanted to see FFIV's Cecil reconcile with his brother/nemesis Golbez, then the stories that unfold here are a huge treat.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2009"}

The glitches with the first game were so horrible (the load times take 2 minutes at a time for something really simple) that I actually had to stop playing and progress with the second one halfway through the game.the second game ERASED halfway through me playing but luckily, I started over and was presented with making my own choices in the form of a comic that informed me about the previous game that i gave up on. the second game was enjoyable, the loading times were fair and was a great game.as for the third, improved graphics and easy load times on certain missions. I have yet to beat it so my opinions on the 3rd game will be somewhat muted until i finish. so far, no complaints.edit: finished the series fully and cannot understand why it has received so much hatred from players. i loved the ending to the series and it felt like it was worth all that i went through in the previous games to achieve it (this comes with several endings but i won't say the one i got for spoilers sake). i adored the main character and the side characters and thought that the third game was more direct and without as much filler missions. i was annoyed to find out that players needed to go online to boost up their overall readiness for the final battle but also found out that you can level the readiness just by doing missions for others just the same.i liked the second one the best because i felt more connected with the characters overall and loved to help gain their loyalties. i felt the third had limitations and mostly focused on going to the citadel... a lot. every time i was playing, i felt like the game should have been called: MASS EFFECT: CITADEL EXPLORATION SIMULATOR. i was frustrated with it and wanted to move on.the romances with the third game was a bit more refreshing than in the second one as well. i went with kaiden this time around as opposed to tali and heavily loved the romance as it progressed in the story.i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for games where your choices actually count. play from the beginning (or, just play from the 2nd game onward) and see your choices affect the game and responses! the replay value on this series is incredibly high as well and i plan on doing so fairly soon as a female this time around.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2012"}

Pros:* Makes it obvious if you have a clean recharging connection* Makes it obvious when you have a full charge* Never waste batteries or fight with a battery cover again* Defines a space where your remotes belong when not in use (reason I got it)* Never run out of juice, provided you keep it charging when not in use* Don't need to disconnect safety strap when chargingBut, there are some flaws which prevent me from giving it 5 stars:* Runs down pretty fast -- keep it charging when not in use!* Had 1 dud rechargeable battery the first time, had to exchange it for another* Incompatible with rubber jackets for remotes? (I don't use them so am not sure)* Doesn't connect easily (main complaint)The last bullet is why I took away 1 star.  You can't simply drop the remote into its cradle location -- half the time that won't make a connection and it won't begin charging (but at least it's very obvious that it isn't charging so you don't walk away until it's fixed).  You have to seat it properly, sometimes reseating it a few times, before it will start charging.  Annoying but not fatal.

With a diamond reinforced stick carefully inserted, he is the shining knight the LAPD is trying to make their poster boy.As a Rockstar game, the thing you'll notice immediately is the expansive, gorgeous world htats bordering on photorealistic for 1940's Los Angeles. What'll throw you is how little you explore that massive environment. The game shuttles you from case to case, with no real exploration involved. You're led by the nose with Phelps meticulously kept notebook and the dialogue of the partners.What serves as the games flagpole is the facial features, which are photorealistic as well. You can notice facial twitches and eye movements, which start out bordering on the comical, but quickly become more subtle, which drives the interrogation of potential witnesses and suspects. Its a little frustrating trying to use evidence to catch suspects in lies, since there are often 2 or 3 options to prove a single point, but the game expects a specific one. Combined with the scene exploration mechanism makes up 95% of the game, which is tragically disappointing. While its a real set of meat and potatoes, it becomes so repetitive if the stages weren't so entertaining this would be dropping possibly to two stars.There are some chase shootout stages thrown in, which follow the normal mantra of you're constantly just far enough behind the suspect until the end of the stage, which is ridiculous when you, a WWII veteran can't catch up with a 240 lb lard ass who decides to run from the police, and still manages to pull off a fairly impressive Speedy Gonzales impression. Gun battles are a joke of pop out cover combat with obvious cover sprinkled about. Fisticuffs round out the spectrum but are also fairly ham handed.Audio is fantastic as to be expected. Dialogue is crisp and precise, and is never drowned out by the noire themed music or background chatter. The background music carries well and the delivery of the noire themed mystery movie is very well delivered.What almost detracts is the fact that this is a Rockstar game. The main character is so straight and narrow the option of being even slightly crooked isn't present. And there is so much in the way of normal gameplay and story that's left out. Where's his family that he has to protect and give more depth to the character? Where's the midnight alleyway meetings with snitches and informants? Where are the crooked cops plotting to kill you? Where's the more Dick Tracy like hands-on investigation of prints, safes, and so on? Where's the mafia? The facial recognition feature is great and gives fantastic realism, but it took up so much of the pie that there wasn't anything left to reinforce the central gameplay.Is this worth the purchase? Absolutely. A great story and brilliant new tech, along with great research and fantastic scene development make this worthwhile even at a paltry 15-ish hours of play. But if you come expecting GTA: LAPD, you will be sorely disappointed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2011"}

Each animal has a unique mode of operating, which means that the two interconnected narratives behind this game each offer their own distinctive challenges to conquer.As the armored, action-oriented scorpion, you'll string together stinging blows into deadly combo moves that culminate in cinematic finishes and decimate your opponents. Playing as the sneaky tarantula requires a little more finesse--you'll find yourself leaping from above onto your nemesis, throw out neatly aimed shots of webbing to paralyze your prey, and finishing creatures off with your devastating fangs.Wild Enemies and a Sinister Back StoryIt takes skill and composure to master the moves the scorpion and tarantula have at their disposal. And, even after you think you've got every move down, you'll find you need to learn methods, since these life-and-death struggles take place between you and a huge array of vicious, hazardous creatures, including wolf spiders, rattlesnakes, Gila Monsters, Tarantula Wasps, black widows, mantises, enemies of your own species, rats, and even humans.Beyond the immediacy of fighting for survival, this game features a story of greed and betrayal in the human world.

{"product_name":"B00001OWYW","description":"The vampire is back with more depth and better graphics in this sequel from the long time favorite series. You take the role of Alucard son of Dracula in an attempt to find out what has happened to Richter Belmont a descendant of the game's first hero.","reviewerName":"Yossarian","summary":"Excellent side-scroller action","reviewText":"Castlevania: Symphony of the Night harkens back to the early and great Castlevanias of the old NES, but with vastly updated graphics, gameplay, and even ambiance.  Sure, it's still a 2-D scroller where you roam around and jump around on platforms and what not, but it's at the top of the heap.  The game starts somewhat oddly with you as a vampire hunter facing off against Dracula in a fairly wacky fight that always reminds me of a pro wrestling match.  You beat Dracula, at which point time warps ahead and you switch to Alucard, Dracula's remorseful son (spell Alucard backwards..yah, clever) who brings the fight to Dracula's vast and labyrinthe castle in an effort to do away with his evil sire for all time.  At first I was put off by what I thought was a bizarre and inelegant introduction (the human vampire hunter is a character from one of the mediocre middle Castlevania games, and is very unwieldy) but it turns out the manner in which you use him to defeat Dracula \"historically\" in the plot affects Alucard's starting abilities.  Meaning if you beat up on Drakula with magic, Alucard later favors magic.  Ditto for melee combat.Anyway, the game is lush and filled with endless amounts of loot.  Any monster has a chance to drop rare goodies when slain (based on Alucard's Luck stat), fake walls crumble to reveal hidden platemail, accidentally-tripped switches open bookcases or trapdoors, and zillions of types of monsters appear from all over the place.  The music is great and quite haunting, and the game's RPG and money system are quite well developed.  Alucard has quick \"combo\" spells you can use while fighting, and many of the weapons, shields, and armors he finds have their own effects which have to be discovered in game play.  I've located weapons that let Alucard teleport, summon the undead to fight for him, call lightning, ice, or fire, or even waves of holy light down on his foes.  Everything from helms to circlets to rings to boots can be worn, and Alucard eventually even develops the ability to transform into traditional vampire modes.  Dissipate into a swirling cloud of mist and waft through a ceiling vent to escape your enemies, turn into a wolf and charge through crowds of zombies, or transform into a bat and fly around breathing fire on everyone.  Lastly Alucard collects various magical relics throughout the game, that do everything from let him breathe underwater to have permament familiars that float around with him on screen and help him out (the dancing runesword is not to be missed).  As an example of the thought put into this game, your familiars themselves even gain experience and go up levels, growing both stronger and smarter over time.  For example, the runesword familiar at first just kinda floats along behind you, lethargically swinging at things long after they took a bite out of you.  But after a while it turns into a gleaming heat seeking weapon of vengeance, mercilessly smiting anything the second it shows up on screen.  At one point I turned Alucard into mist and just drifted around while the sword familiar took out a boss for me.  This game also has more items and secrets in it than your average Final Fantasy, and is more addictive.  It is also one of the least frustrating games you can find; you can save as often as you want in save rooms you find on your map (in a coffin, natch), heal yourself easily, and as a vampire you're more than a match for the sluggish beasts you meet early on.  The challenge of the game comes from an easy balance of combat and puzzle solving, rather than a heavy reliance on one or the other.Lastly, and most entertainingly, the bosses in this game are amazing.  Unlike earlier side scrollers where the game progressed through 'levels', in Symphony of the Night you simply roam around an enormous, maze-like castle.  You never know when suddenly a steel grate will drop behind you and you'll find yourself trapped in a fight with, oh, a grotesque giant mummy suspended on steel hooks that takes up 6 screens worth of animation.  That's just the sort of thing that's worth the price of admission.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2003"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K956","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Moss","summary":"Good bundle","reviewText":"I bought this bundle for Christmas as an upgrade for my son's PS2.  After some research I decided that the bundle was the best way to go.  While the price comes out to about the same buying the PS3 and the move game bundle separate, in the PS3 + move game bundle you get a bigger hard drive for the same price.The PS3 and the eye for the move was easy to set up. The bundle came with Sports Champion game, one move controller and the eye.  While most games on Sports Champion can be played with 1 move controller, it works better with 2.  Like Gladiator, one controller for the shield, the other for the sword.  The Sports Champion game itself is ok.  It uses the same \"flat\" characters for all the different games (Gladiator, Bocca, Frisby Golf, Volley Ball, Ping Pong).  There are not that much move games out yet (compared to Wii) and I find the selection currently limited.  We downloaded the \"Shoot\" demo and the calibration of the controller is not the greatest.We have used the Playstation store to download demos and to buy and download Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light.  Some people have said to have a hard time using a credit card, but I had no problem.  We live in the country and do not have the fastest (cable etc) download and it took several hours to get Lara Croft downloaded.  However, compared to the PS2 the graphics are great.Netflix.  We have streamed several movies through netflix with no problem.  It works great, also using the controller to navigate can be a learning experience.Blueray player.  We have not tried out the Blueray player yet and I did not buy a Remote control for it, so I cannot comment on it at this time.CON:  this is big enough for me to remove a star.  Charging the controllers.  All the controllers are wireless.  There is ONE charging cable that comes with the bundle.  According the the manual, the controller can only be charged when the PS is on and you can only charge one at a time.  I can never tell if the controllers are charged.  The regular controller has several lights, which helps you figure out if it is charged or getting low...the move controllers I cannot figure out (one light, flashing when it charges).  You can check the battery life on the TV, but that means the controllers have to be connected to the PS3 and who wants to do that constantly.  When one move controller is getting low and I try to change it to make the other one the \"main controller\"  I have been running into trouble getting it switched and usually end up switching games, giving up.  I am buying a separate charger to charge several controllers at the same time.While I think the PS3 plus move bundle was a good deal....it is just the beginning.  Since I bought the bundle, I also bought a MOUNTING CLIP for the eye, a second MOVE CONTROLLER, a CHARGING STATION....possible future buys...a second controller, a remote control to go with the bluray player.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Tekken Tag Tournament's attention to visual detail and fun gameplay even outperforms its coin-op counterpart, making it a must-have title for fortunate PS2 owners. The cast of TTT is a who's who of the Tekken family. A total of 34 characters, including your favorite brawlers from Tekken 2 and Tekken 3, plus an original end boss. But this isn't just a Tekken family reunion; instead, TTT brings a new strategy to the ring with a &quot;tag&quot; system that lets you tag in a partner at any time during a heated round. Fighter duos can do major damage, alternating on the fly without interrupting the action, teaming up for insane multi-hit partner-swap air juggles, and delivering serious hard-hitting standing combos. Players will instantly notice the game's sharp graphics. Each area looks more polished than the arcade version's, with separate animations in the background; enhanced, well-drawn environments; and, of course, beautiful computer-graphic full-motion videos to tell the story. The character detail is also astonishing. From their diverse outfits to each of their unique animations, fighters are vivid and move smoothly without any slowdown. As for the audio, the sounds of TTT have been faithfully retained from the arcade. Crisp audio effects keep the action alive, while the cool techno tunes in each level are in harmony with the overall feel of the game. Fans of this ferocious fighter franchise, of either the arcade or home version, will immediately feel at home with the controls. Using just the top-four buttons, directional pad, and a shoulder button to switch between fighters, bruisers can execute devastating 10 hit-combos and bone-crunching linking moves. Even if you're a Tekken newbie, the Practice mode will quickly get you in shape, as it lists every special move, which the computer will demonstrate how to do if you're unsure what the move is supposed to look like. The only drawback is that you'll have to learn the big-hit combos on your own. Besides the Practice option, TTT also has special modes that you won't find in the arcade version. There are one-on-one vs., Team Battle, Time Attack, and Survival modes, along with an area where you can view the various Tekken cinemas, an art gallery, and a mini-game: Tekken Bowl. Namco has always been strong in the fighting genre, and Tekken Tag Tournament is no exception. While the game may be old in the arcades, it certainly looks and feels new for the home console, effectively exploiting the power of the PS2 with outstanding graphics, sound, and controls. This is a perfect addition to the PS2's burgeoning library.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2003"}

Sega has also rereleased many other games that were on the disc separate on the psn/live arcade but if you buy them seperate it will cost more but the trophys are different for achievement hunters I think but I would still recommend this over the psn releases. but anyway I'll give a short review for the gamesGAMES:Alex Kidd- I never was a big alex kidd fan its good its on here for the hardcore sega fan but theres better games 2.9/5Alien Storm- Good Game 4/5Altered Beast- Really Hard game fun if you can manage to master it 3.9/5Beyond Oasis- never played it enough to judge itBonanza Bros- Very odd game 3.5/5Columns- Pretty much a tetris knockoff but I still like it 4/5Comix Zone- dispite the difficulty I used to love this game back in the day 5/5Decap Attack- odd but good 4/5Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine- More forgiving version of Columns and I like this one more 4.9/5Dynamite Headdy- Never played it enough to judge itEcco The Dolphin-not a fan of these games 1/5Ecco: The tides of Time- same 1/5E-SWAT-Pretty good game 4/5Fatal Labyrinth-Pretty confusing game but fun if you can manage it 3.5/5Flicky- A very fun and challenging little game 4/5Gain Ground- Fun 3/5Golden Axe- Streets of rage but more medieval 5/5Golden Axe 2- Same 5/5Golden Axe 3- Weakeast link of the 3 but still good 4.5/5Kid Chameleon- Underrated sega game this one needs a sequel on psn 5/5Phantasy Star II-IV: Good RPGs I can't say the aged well but still fun 5/5Ristar- This game is surprisingly pretty good needs a sequel 4/5Shining Force-in the darkness: good rpgs like Phantasy star the haven't aged well if you weren't born in the early 90's 5/5Shinobi III- One of my personal favorite old school games of all time 6/5Sonic 1- The original sonic game these are worth buying the collection alone for 5/5Sonic 2- The best sonic game ever made 6/5Sonic Spinball- Its either a love it or hate it game with sonic fans I personally love it 4.9/5Sonic 3- Probably my least faviorite of the 2d genesis sonic games but still excellent 4.5/5Sonic & Knuckles- Part 2 of the 3rd one this is were that one gets good 5/5Sonic 3d Blast- Dispite the controls its not to bad great soundtrack as well 3/5Streets of Rage 1-3: Best Genesis games ever expecilly the 1st 2 10000000/5Super Thunder Blade- Space Harrier with a helicopter 3.5/5Vectorman 1-2: very hard but fun platformersUNLOCKABLE GAMESGolden Axe WarriorPhantasy StarAlien SyndromeAltered Beast (arcade version)Congo BongoFantasy ZoneShinobiSpace HarrierZaxxon","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

Let the critics decide that. Me? Here we go:Pros:Great plot. Developed slow, but it was worth it.Graphics were good for its time and I can't criticize them for that. Plus the 3D at the end was pretty realistic. Nothing like Kingdom Hearts or some other famous current RPGs.Funny characters. You cannot tell me that you cannot relate to Squall's stubbornness. Or Zell's funny attitude.(Barret anybody?)Omega Weapon anyone?I love how they have optional bosses in this game like VII. If only the other bosses compared to his difficulty.Now the Cons:Bosses WAY too easy. Ultemecia was supposed to \"Wow\" me with her amazing power. The battle just dragged on. Woohoo. Ultimate Weapon? Give me a break. I like how they give optional side quests like that for bosses, but Bahamut and Ultimate Weapon were pathetic. I was about level 40 going into both battles and wiped the floor clean in under 10 minutes in both. C'mon Square Enix, make them Omega Weapon tough!Side Quests:Only worthwhile side quests were the boss ones. The other few were quite boring to try and were either overeasy, or just gave stupid prizes.Overall, I know I give the impression of a 5, but this game could have been better on the difficulty scale. VII gave me some difficulty and I normally under-train, but this was pathetic.On the fun scale a 4 only seems reasonable for it's easiness as well.

Mike London 12-1-2012]Review 1:  Released in the Stone Age of Video Games, this game stands as one of the most influential games ever released.  Nintendo players quickly sent the message to Nintendo by making this one of the most played games released on the old NES, with this release staying in the top ten games as voted by Nintendo Power readers for several years.  It would become the blueprint for RPG games, and its influence can be felt even now in the current game scene.  Others would take this and see what they could do with it, and because of this game the RPG became an established genre, although this will always be the game that started it and stands at the beginning, casting a very long shadow over its descendants.  But don't be mistaken, this RPG has some things that are very unlike its genre.  Levels are not built up (this would be the next installment), and magic and that were not big concerns.  Hearts were used instead of experience.  But these would be incorporated in the other release, so even then Zelda has its hands on that as well.So what is it about this game that so captured the imagination and the dollar of the average gamer?  Well, one was the incredible depth of adventure that just permeated the entire thing.  Released during a time when most games were side-scrollers, this set you in a world where you could explore and find items.  There is the now standard item list, where you obtain items and use them to interact with the world about you.  There are hidden dungeons that you must find, and you can burn bushes and push rocks, etc.  It radically opened the power of the NES console up, and the gaming world would never be the same after this game.To give a personal history, my brother and I got a Nintendo when it came out, playing all the standard games but somehow missing this one.  Although I played it, it was only in 1999 that I sat down and, for the first time in my life, played through the entire game.  It was amazing.  We had got the Super NES counterpart when it came out in 1991, so I knew that by heart.  This was just as great, although I still think the Super NES instatement,The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, is the best overall though I have not yet played the two new Gameboy releases,The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of AgesandThe Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons.  I'm sure they'll be great.By today's standards, the graphics are absolutely terrible, and by the standards of the day, they were only average.  But this proves only one thing: playability comes over a sleek looking graphical interface.  And this game has that.  Indeed, even now people call in asking Nintendo tips on this game.  Considering the NES has been dead for several years that is something indeed.  Of all things, this game desperately needs to be released on the Gameboy, packaged with the sequelZelda II: The Adventure of Link.As far as story goes, it is nowhere near as complicated as the games that came after it.  Essentially, Princess Zelda has been kidnapped and Link must regain the 8 pieces of Triforce to gain entrance to the ninth dungeon for the final showdown.  Musically, there are only three tracks, one for the Overworld (the now famous Overworld Theme, commonly called the Legend of Zelda Theme, which this game's N64's counterpart has been criticized for ostracizing, the dungeon theme, and the ninth dungeon theme.) After he beats Gannon the first time, a second quest opens up, meaning yet a whole other adventure.  The difficulty rating is greatly increased.  I personally think they should have down this with SUPER MARIO BROTHERS II, the Japanese version, now known in the States as THE LOST LEVELS.  It corresponds in difficulty to a second quest.  But that is neither here or there.  The great disappointment is that no one else took this to heart, and this is one feature that has not been a major influence on the RPG genre.  The second quest so enriched the game, giving the gamer more for his/her dollar, and I wish they'd do second quests more.As far as games go, \"The Legend of Zelda\"'s influence cannot be overestimated.  Truly one of the giants of the Gaming Universe.  This and SMB 3Super Mario Bros. 3are the best NES games by far.  Lets hope they re-release it soon!---------Review 2:  CLASSIC NES's best release. Wish they had included Zelda II, June 15, 2004.  (Four stars for the rerelease. Five stars for the actual game.)THE LEGEND OF ZELDA, one of Nintendo's most famous NES games, finally sees a rerelease on Gameboy Advance. People have been waiting a long time for this. The Super Mario series got its update (including a graphic overhaul) over a decade ago on the SNES as SUPER MARIO ALL-STARS, including a brand new (for the American market) game called THE LOST LEVELS. The two NES Zelda games, however, never got rereleased until the Game Cube (!), and on top of that, it was a promotional, free rerelease. All this being said, is the long wait worth it?Well, sort of. Although it's great to play the old school Zelda without hooking up a working NES, it's rather pricy at twenty dollars and the graphics may very well turn off younger video gamers. Not only that, it's very odd NINTENDO gave Zelda fans four Zelda titles in the ZELDA COLLECTION for free, and here they just released the original without any bonus material or extra features. Nintendo could very easily have included ZELDA II on this cart as well. That being said, THE LEGEND OF ZELDA, of all the classic NES games re-released, is one of the few that justify's its pricetag. The rest could easily have been put in an anthology of classic NES games, instead of bringing each one out separately.The gameplay of THE LEGEND OF ZELDA sets up the template followed by all subsequent games in the series. (Only the NES sequel has any real amount of deviation from the Zelda formula, bring in more RPG elements into the mix). You play as Link, a hero in green, who has to rescue Zelda from the evil megalomaniac, Gannon. Not to much of a story, but about as good as you got in the mid 1980s. You have to rescue eight pieces of the Triforce, which is a mystical triangle (one of three). These triforce fragments are hidden throughout the world map in various dungeons. Items you get in one dungeon gives you access to other dungeons, and as you progress, you get various upgrades for your sword and pick up new items. After you beat Gannon the first time, then a second quest opens up, with items, dungeons, and shops in entirely different locations. I wish they had released a special edition of SUPER MARIO BROTHERS with the Japanese version of SMB II as a `second quest.\" But oh well. Unfortunately, the second quest never really caught on with other games. The Second Quest is harder than the first. To get to the Second Quest at the beginning of the game, put \"ZELDA\" as your name.The game itself is very nonlinear, which is what made it such a popular game. There was the incredible depth of adventure that just permeated the entire thing. Released during a time when most games were side-scrollers, this set you in a world where you could explore and find items. There is the now standard item list, where you obtain items and use them to interact with the world about you. There are hidden dungeons that you must find, and you can burn bushes and push rocks, etc. It radically opened the power of the NES console up, and the gaming world would never be the same.Ironically, though, some may find ZELDA too challenging for this very reason. Bereft of any real narrative, ZELDA doesn't give you any real direction where to go next, save for the infamous, sometimes incomprehensible old men who give you `clues' on where to go next. If you don't know where you're going, you'll find yourself wondering around a lot, mostly directionless. That's what made the game so popular in the first place, but for modern games it may be off-putting how difficult it is to find some of the dungeons without some internal direction from the game. (As a perfect example, just think how many bombs you would have to use to find the very obscure ninth dungeon on the second quest.) The SNES installment gives you visual indicators on where to bomb, etc; the original ZELDA does not give you visual ques on anything. So unless you know the game well or you have access to walkthroughs, expect a lot of time just trying to figure out where to go next.The graphics, while looking rather archaic by today's standards, holds up rather well given its age. The sprites are bright and the scenery is colourful. There's only a few instances where you can tell that the screen was squished to adapt to Game Boy Advance's screen, but this isn't very noticeable. The music is a near perfect port too, making this a very faithful recreation of the original. For those old enough to remember the NES glory days, the graphics will bring back a lot of memories; for new gamers, however, they may find it difficult to get over the primitive graphics and into the game itself. Their loss.Conclusion: One of the few NES CLASSICS worth shelling out twenty bucks for. Still, it's rather puzzling they didn't include anything extra, or even the second NES Zelda game, given they released both ZELDA and ZELDA II, plus the two N64 games, on one spectacular, free collection for GameCube. For those who never played the original Zelda, this will hook you for life. There's no better way to start playing this historic series than the original. For those of us old enough to remember the NES, this is a great game, and a great way to relive very fond memories. Still, if you don't have the Zelda Collection, this is a very worthwhile purchase.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2001"}

I would have payed the full 50 dollars if it was sold alone, but the addition of the Motion Plus is a great deal.  You can use it with other games that are already out such as Tiger Woods, or for upcoming games like Red Steel 2 and possibly the next Zelda.  Let me give you a reveiw of each game.Swordfighting-  This activity is easily the best.  The controls are great and you actually have to use stragey to beat your opponents, something that was unheard of in the first version.  You press B to block.  When you block your opponents swings, that gives you an oppurtunity to strike.  It's very realistic and fun.  There is also speed slice mode and showdown mode.  Speed slice is when you have to slice things a certain way before your opponent.  It got very intense.  Showdown is when you fight through an army of Miis.  It's fun getting combos.Wakeboarding-  This is one of my favorites as well.  Catching big air and landing tricks was a blast.  The controls were very responsive.  At first it is simple, but once you unlock the harder difficulties it becomes more complex.  You have to dodge obstacles and stuff.Frisbee-  This looks simple, but it was pretty hard.I could never get the frisbee to go where I wanted it too, even after going through the tutorial multiple times.  I'm even good at frisbee in real life. There's a large learning curve to this game.  There's also frisbee golf.Archery-  This was surprisingly a great game.  It is slow paced, but it showed just how precise the Motion Plus can be.  I love the feeling of accomplishment I get when I almost get a bull's eye.  It requires focus and is a fun challenge.  The controls are really tight.Basketball- One of my least favorites.  As a basketball fan, it was dissapointing.  You can do the 3-pt shoot out which wasn't really fun, but I was surprised at how realistic my shooting motion had to be.  The pick up 3 on 3 halfcourt games weren't terrible but were very slow paced and boring.Table Tennis-  This is just like the original Wii Sports Tennis, except on a table.  The controls worked well for the most part, but it was sometimes frusturating when the motion plus didn't register that I switched  hands.  That only happened occasionally though and the game is still fun.Golf- You get a new course plus the original course, and improved controls.  I thought it made hitting from far away harder but putting a lot easier.  It picks up every little curve you make, so hitting a nice shot with your driver is difficult.  I didn't think this game had to be remade.Bowling-  I really did not see the point of doing this over.  It is easier to put spin on the ball but other than that there was no change from the regular Wii Sports.  There is also 100 pin mode and Spin Control mode.  This game is still fun with friends like in the original Wii Sports.Power Cruising- This was kind of dissapointing.  You go through a bunch of rings to the finish line.  It got boring and repetitive.  I guess it was still enjoyable but I won't be coming back to it very often.  I felt the controls did not take advantage of the Wii Motion Plus.Canoeing-  This was a surprise hit.  I never expected canoeing to be this much fun.  You have to go through the obstacle course in the pond and get to the goal.  It was a challenge in the upper difficulties but was still really fun.Cycling-  This definately isn't one of the best sports, but it isn't as bad as everyone says.  You pedal by moving the wii remote and nunchuk like you're pedaling, and tilt it to turn.  It was very realistic because you can catch tailwind, run out of energy, sprint, and all that fancy stuff.  I found it enjoyable, and it was very competitive.  The problem is since it's so realistic, you might as well just go out on your real bike.  It's a better workout, more fun, and is the same thing.Air Sports- Island flyover is one of my favorites.  You fly over beautiful Wuhu Island and find points of interest.  It sounds boring, but it was very relaxing and pleasant.  Wuhu Island has a ton of neat stuff.  Skydiving also falls into this category, but it is the worst sport.  Dogfighting is also in this, but I haven't tried it yet since it's multiplayer only.Ok, almost done.  Here are the pros and cons:+ Great Variety+ Sport for everyone+ Tight controls+ 12 sports+ comes with Wii Motion Plus+ Most of the sports are fun+ Game is deeper than original with unlockables, difficulties and stamps (much like Xbox 360 achievements)+ Great with friends- Poor, poor graphics- limited multiplayer (why can't I do multiplayer sky diving?  more co-op options would be nice as well)- It's annoying how you have to go through so many reminders and have to calibrate the Motion plus a lot- Sports have a learning curve, so isn't as much of a pick up and play gameDefinately worth it for both hardcore and casual players.EDIT:  Well I've had the game for a little over a week now, and I have to say my impression hasn't really changed.  The only problem is, I haven't played it very much.  I usually play games I just got a lot more than this.  I still reccomend it, but not if you have friends over to play rarely.  Multi player is what makes the game shine.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2009"}

E Jackson","summary":"Now THIS is an action game!","reviewText":"Now THIS is an action game!At the time of Mega Man X's release back in 1993, I didn't think the game was as great as I do now.  At the time I was so concerned with what the future of video gaming had in store that I didn't give much notice to quality and instead focused on what video game companies were doing to make games look more realistic.  So even though I thought the graphics in the original Mega Man X were quite good at the time, the release of Donkey Kong County was just around the corner and the graphics in THAT game had me so amazed and stunned that suddenly the graphics in any other game looked inferior.Today, looking back to more than 10 years ago, I can now safely say Mega Man X looks pretty good.  It still looks a little dated too, unfortunately, especially compared to Mega Man X3.  But graphics aren't important here: this is an ACTION game darn it!  When I play an action game I want to go around shooting a LOT of things.  And I'm happy to report that all the levels in Mega Man X have a TON of enemies to shoot!The Armored Armadillo stage alone has more enemies (mostly bats) than ANY stage in any other Mega Man game.  The Spark Mandrill and Chill Penguin stages have tons of enemies too.  Even the introduction stage (which was weak and empty-looking in X2 and X3) will have you excitedly jumping around, shooting everything that walks or flies into your path.  ALL the stages have a substantial amount of enemies.  The stages in Mega Man X2 and X3 look empty and dull compared to the ones in the original X.  This is the number one reason the original MMX is my favorite of all the X games on the Super NES.  Capcom threw in as many enemies in each level as they possibly could (including the Sigma stages) and THAT'S what I like to see!Mega Man X also has the best music of all the X games.  You can easily remember and hum all the music in the game.  Some of the themes are slightly weaker than others, but nothing ever reaches over to the boring side.  Every piece of music is at the very least, pleasant (of course getting into the whole robotic Mega Man atmosphere helps to really appreciate it, hehe).  My personal favorite themes are the password screen theme (touching and sad) the lonely highway theme (when you beat the game and Mega Man is walking to the left) and the jazzy/dance theme that plays immediately after that (the screen where a computer or TV is shown in the background).The bosses are really fun to fight too.  Chill Penguin has a lot of different attacks (including shooting ice and jumping at you), Spark Mandrill will shoot sparks and swing around from the ceiling, Flame Mammoth shoots fireballs and jumps around, Sting Chameleon drops thorns on top of you and attacks with his tongue, etc.  And get this: every time you turn on the game the bosses attack you differently.  For example: if one time you play the game and the first thing Spark Mandrill does is jump at you, the next time you play the game the first thing he might do is throw electric at you.  You never know what will happen, and that helps make the game less predictable and more enjoyable.Expect to see the coolest Mega Man X weapons.  There are two extremely powerful weapons called Storm Tornado and Fire Wave, which make dashing through the levels a breeze.  These two weapons happen to take out most enemies in a matter of seconds.  All the weapons in the game are awesome (even though the Electric Spark and Rolling Shield are fairly weak, they are pretty fun to mess around with).  Capcom was never able to create such cool weapons in a Mega Man game again.And finally, Capcom got it right.  What's the \"it\" you ask?  Instead of making an entirely new stage where you have to re-fight the 8 Maverick bosses, in this game the 8 Maverick bosses are spread out through each of the three Sigma stages.  I figure if Capcom is going to make you fight those bosses again at LEAST make doing so as interesting as possible.

Drawing inspiration from classical military conflicts of the 20th century, Killzone demonstrates a unique graphical style that captures the grit and realism of intense military warfare.","reviewerName":"Clayton J. Gibbs \"Horror Soundtrack Collector\"","summary":"Nitty Gritty Warzone Blast","reviewText":"Killzone is an overall excellent FPS that puts you into the dark and gritty world of future combat.  It feels like 'Medal of Honor' mixed with 'Children of Men' mixed with 'Star Wars'.  The characters look excellent and the voice-acting is solid, with a wide array of foul language and dirty deeds.  The combat is nothing extraordinary, but it overwhelms the senses such as true combat would.  You have a choice between four different combantants as you progress, each with unique weapons and characteristics.  You can attack stealthily, bombard the frontlines with machine gun fire or run and gun a la Rambo style.  You get a sniper rifle (which simulates the steadiness of a sniper well, but will no doubt upset a few who are so used to simple zoom and boom action), you can pick up your rivals weapons, or simply use the ever-so-awesome timed grenades, which will allow you to time your explosion exactly how you need it.  The story of Killzone is dark and twisted and actually has some interesting plot twists, so you don't feel as though you're mindlessly blowing away through level after level.  The levels themselves are fairly linear, but dark and interesting to look at.  Some elements of the environment can be used to defeat your foes (i.e. explosive barrels, etc.) and at times, you'll feel outnumbered and hopeless.  You'll get to blow up tanks, boats, helicopters and more with shoulder fired RPGs.If I had any complaints about this game it would be the following:  Enemies tend to 'pop-up' if you advance too quickly, making for a frustrating glitch.  The aiming system is awkward in that you cannot pull off one-shot headshots like some other games.  I still haven't been able to pull above a 30% accuracy rating, even though I've tried to carefully place my shots and conserve my ammo.  These two discrepancies in no way bring the game down any.I'd say Killzone stands alone in its dark, interesting and often brutal way as a combat FPS. It's well worth a buy versus a try and will surely satisfy anyone with a combat FPS itch.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2008"}

The game (originally called Kin) was being developed by the Dutch programming team called Guerrilla Games. The game had been in development for over 4 years. And now after what seemed like an eternity, Killzone has arrived. The result is a very good game, with a few problems.In Killzone you are one of four ISA soldiers attempting to fend off an assault by the Helghast. The Helghast are a splinter faction of an Earth colony who have become hardened by harsh conditions on thier newley settled planet. The Helghast army then launches a war of agression on the ISA forces.The first thing that strikes you about this game are it's visuals. It truley is a visually stunning game. The opening cutscene shows you immediatley that this game was meticulously engineered. There's alot of attention to detail. Eventhough Killzone is set in the not too distant future (approximatley 100 years or so) it's not outrageously futuristic. Many locations and buildings have a very modern feel to them. There are a few graphical glitches here and there. The framerate does drop off slightly and there are some issues with some event triggers. One of the other problems is the enemy A.I. is prone to bouts of what I'd call \"vapor lock\". At times the Helghast will stand around waiting for an event trigger. A few shots will get thier attention. What I also like is the character design of the Helghast. They are very reminiscent of the soldiers in the anime film Jin Roh. The game's sound is also very good. ISA and Helghast weapons have very distinct sounds to them. Also the Helghast will curse you as they try to take you down. There's also shattering glass, footsteps changing on various surfaces. This is a good sounding game.The gameplay is rather good. The game is a first person shooter but the action never really descends into a static pattern of \"walk, shoot, reload, flip lever, crouch\". The missions are very linear in nature. Then again what first person shooter isn't? There are different mission objectives and the Helghast are very tactical in nature. There are times where you'll be pinned down and have to find cover. The Helghast are no easy win. They will fight fiercely and often regroup and take cover. The various environments (ranging from jungles to city streets) provide alot of cover for your squadmates. After a few missions you are joined by 3 other playable characters. Although you are part of a squad, this game is not Rainbow Six or SOCOM. Your squad does back you up, but they aren't commandable. The playable characters range in skills and use of weapons. Luger is the stealth specialist, Templar is the jack of all trades. Rico is the heavy weapons man. And Hakaha is the spy. The controls also vary for each character. Luger is more agile while Rico is slow and plodding. The controls are also laid out very well. You won't find yourself fumbling for any buttons. The learning curve I'd say is about 45 minutes.With no Network Adaptor I was unable to try the online modes. There are however several different offline \"Battlefield\" modes. These modes range from Assault to Deathmatch, using computer controlled A.I. teammates and enemeys. The offline modes are surpisingly fun as well. There are also a few \"Extras\". War Scenes will show you a game environment with the Helghast and ISA fighting it out. The game trailer is included as well as the opening intro so you can play it at any time you like.So, now you're probably saying \"Yeah but I heard this game was supposed to be as good as Halo\". Well, I really didn't like Halo. So I can't compare Killzone to it. And I'd suggest that you don't either (if anything this game has more in common wtih Medal of Honor than Halo). But this is a good game in it's own right. Once you're a few levels deep you'll find the game quite immersive and addictive. At times I think it's almost too ambitious for the PS2 and might have made a good launch game for the PS3. What we have here is a very good game, from a fledgling developer despite what some would call \"hardware limitations\". If Guerrilla can iron out some of the wrinkles then they'll have a real winner on thier hands. If you're still unsure I'd suggest you give it a rental first.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2004"}

It has enough content packed in the game to keep you busy for weeks or months. The campaign is decent and has good length to it. But, occasionally the game will freeze up in spots but its just a mere second here and there. The weapon selection is pretty good also. I found the best part of the campaign was the story. When I find the story good or interesting the developers had to do something right because most in game stories turn me off. The CGI scenes are excellent !The online is still up and running in 2009 ! That part of the game was a surprise to me as I am 5 years later to the party with this one. Also all of the online modes and match types you can play offline as what you would see in games like Perfect Dark, Timesplitters 2 where you can set up your bots, weapon types, maps and rules. Overall if they do cancel the online someday you can still play it offline against bots so this game is well worth picking up. The graphics are really pushing the PS2 hardware even though it was initially released years ago. The guns look fantastic. Character models of your enemies move kind awkward but that gives you that much more of a reason to mow em down with your guns.Bottom line is if you want a good game for your ps2 this is easily a good game to pick up. It falls short in some areas but those portions of the game are easy to look past.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2009"}

They took a big risk in creating the first Lord of the rings RPG and making the playable charachters be people who are not in the movie.  A really big risk, but in my opinion, it did pay off.The Third Age is an Role Playing Game, where you micro-manage your charachters and strategize battles (hance Final Fantasy).  It takes place in the same universe of the Lord of the rings game, but instead casts you as some \"other\" characther(s) (Hence \"Metal Gear solid 2\", where you played as Raiden instead of snake).  A Gondor soldier, an elf, a dwarf, a Rohan maiden, and a Rohan spearman.  The games story takes place parrallel to that of the movies (hence, \"Enter the Matrix\").  You begin as Gondor soldier Berethor, who has been sent by Denethor to find Boromir and discover what happened to him.  While a lot of people are understandably angry about not being able to play as the fellowhip, I was fascinated by the games story.  It's a lot deeper then you might think.  Berethor for example, starts out as a loyal Gondor soldier, but like Raiden from Metal Gear solid 2 he has a troubled past that genuinely suprised me when I learned more about it.Unlike the previous two games from EA, battles in the Third Age are turn based, meaning that you plan out your strategies before attacking.  You can cast spells, attack your foes or use items to help you in battle.  The battles go fairly quickly and are easy to figure out.  When fighting, you get to use some pretty attacks, ranging from strikes that lower a foes armor, to awesome five hit attacks that can kill a troll in one hit.  You have to be careful when fighting enemies, as they can really kick your butt if you are not carefull.  I cannot begin to count the number of times all my party members were stunned and my foes took thier leasurely time beating the crud out of me (much to my fury of course).Along the course of your journey, you'll run across famous heroes and villians from the trilogy.  You'll join forces with Gimli, Aragorn (who can kill a troll in one move), Gandalf (Grey and white), Eowyn, and a few others.  And you'll fight villians such as the awesomly powerful Witch King, the sniveling Grima Wormtounge, and the coolest fight in the game, taking on the Balrog with Gandalf (I actually squealed with joy the first time I played it).The visuals of the Third Age are top notch.  The graphics are smooth and detailed, the enviornments are huge and replicate the film well (just wait until you see Gandalf fighting the Balrog).  I've heard some reviewers talk about \"Unplayable slowdown\".  I encountered almost no slow down whatsoever in my game, the only time being when I was fighting the Balrog (and even then it created a dramatic \"Slo-mo\" effect).The audio is also excellent, using music from all three movies and fine voice acting.  Ian McKellen shines as Gandalf and Christopher Lee is excelent as Saruman (I heard that Andy Serkis recorded dialoge for the game, but he's nowhere to be found.  A forthcoming sequel perhaps?).  The new charachters feature good voice acting, although Berethor sounds younger then he looks.The neatest feature of the game has got to be Evil mode, where you play as the bad guys in certain battles.  You get to control the Witch King, Gothmag, an Oliphaunt, the Nazgul, and yes, the awesome Balrog.  It's fun to play as the powerful villians from the trilogy, but sadly you are not allowed to pick from a list of battles that you want to play.  You have to play through each chapter, so if you want to play as the Balrog, you have to fight as Goblins and trolls twice before you can play as the Balrog.  Its a shame really, as I would love to just select \"Balrog battle\" instead of slugging through the other charachters.  And for some bizzaro reason, the good guys in Evil mode are often equipped with skills and equipment that you didint have when playing as them in the same chapter.  That got me ticked off at some moments.Sadley, EA did falter a bit when creating the game.  My biggest complaint is that some normal enemies are just too powerful, such as weak archers that can fire arrows that prevent you from attacking with weapons.  And if I ever find the person who came up with the idea of reflective shield (A move where any attack whatsoever does the same damage to you that you deal to a foe), I will throw them to a pack of rabid starving wolves (or wargs), because that attack got me really PO.  It gets my blood boiling whenever my charachters are killed by lowly orcs because they are equipped with incredibly cheap and powerful attacks.  Very bad idea.The Difficulty is also wildly inconsistant.  I never died in the first part of the game until I left Moria, but when I reached Rohan I was dying practically every three minutes from those damn Uruck-Hai (Who are also wildly overpowered).  The later part of Helms Deep was just a huge unbelievebly bad joke, where you're entire group is stunned and eliminated within a few turns.  It took me several replays just to get past that part, and I was strongly tempted to smash the disk out of frustration.  Not a good sign.Also, why can only three good guys fight at once (with a few exceptions), when you're always facing up to four bad guys?  This causes the other three members of your party to lag so far behind in experience that they become pretty useless.There is also no completion bonuses for winning the game.  You do get the ability to travel and see the areas you've already been to, but you have to save your game to do that, and some areas are never visitable after you go through them (such as Helms Deep before the battle).  That may be accurate, but I want to see them again dangit!  I severly wish there was an ability to go and fight the previous bosses with your highly powered charachters, but alas, thats not possible.  The Battle of the Black gates is also missing from the game (but you do get a unexpected boss fight in exchange).  The ending dosent wrap things up.  Like the third Matrix movie, it seemingly exists just to hint at an upcoming sequel.But I dont want to paint a poor picture of this game.  When I was having fun and enjoying myself, the game was shinning brilliantly.  Being able to go through Middle Earth as never before was a thrill.  I'll never forget being able to explore Helms Deep in full, something not possible before.  Even though it takes some big liberties with the trilogies story, I enjoyed it greatly (seeing the Balrog for the first time is a true cinematic moment).In the end, i'd recommend renting the game before you buy.  But if you like \"what if\" tales, the Lord of the Rings story, and good games in general (and you have a high patience level), then you'll probably like this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2005"}

Wells","summary":"Probably the Best First Person Shooter For Sale Today","reviewText":"I bought Battlefield Bad Company 2 after I had played the original Bad Company.  I loved the first Bad Company's witty banter and wild campaign, so I picked this one up hoping for more of the same: Much to my surprise I got something much better.Bad Company 2 does not have nearly as involved of a single-player campaign as its predecessor did.  The single player campaign is short and sweet. Not nearly as much witty banter as the first game had (thought the hippie 'copter pilot is pretty darn funny).  The single player campaign otherwise takes a lot of cues from Modern Warfare 2 and is totally action packed.The brilliance of the game is in multiplayer.  There are 4 specialties (assault, engineer, recon, medic) each has a different weapon option, different kit bonuses and more.  The game demands that squad members come up with a strategy for survival.  If you have engineers in the squad, and the level has many tanks, one with anti-vehicle mines is a great specialty option.  However an anti-tank mine-layer is almost useless unless one squad member has the assault specialty to resuppy him.  This is just one of the many combo options that this game calls out for in the multiplayer mode.  Best played with 4 friends you can talk to and figure out an ideal squad for yourselves.After 20hrs of multiplayer, I have only a fraction of unlocks completed and the addition of 2 map packs (free with VIP codes) has kept the game fresh.  This is one of the few games that I can honestly say I got my money's worth.See you on the Battlefield!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2010"}

My lovely lady advised otherwise and for once the crack of the whip was a good thing.  I rented the game and played about three hours into it before giving up all hope.  The graphics were beautiful, but that should go without saying -If you're going to delay a game for months upon months to tweak it, and then ask 50 bucks for it, it had better look nice and purdy.  So whoopty-hey on the gorgeous animations.  Software designers have no excuse for not raising the bar graphic-wise with all the computer technology they now have at their disposal.The gameplay is linear and stagnant.  - \"Fight these three brown ninjas! Here comes a white ninja! - Fight this monster, oh wait, more ninjas!!\"  About the only rewarding feeling while playing the game was getting to run up walls and flip over people onto ledges etc.  But you can't have fun flipping around all day long because that damn \"random ninja generator\" is cranked to 11, and wave after wave of generic ninjas will keep attacking you as you play.  - So you can't enjoy the wall hopping without having to participate in Ninja Gaiden's stale fighting system. (Maybe they should have done a Ninja Olympics game??)**There is no ragdoll and the ninja's, when killed, die in about the same three or four poses.  This makes for very monotonous gameplay.  They attack the same way, and then they die the same way.  Zzz. (Ps - The camera/view system is bearable at best. - Which is funny, because the game constantly emphasizes how a true ninja must be extremely observant and adept at looking around. - You'll spend a great deal of time wrestling with compromising camera angles.)**The bosses, as I'm sure you've heard, are ridiculously hard.  But not in a fun advanced AI sense, where you feel the joy of battle... No, I'm afraid not at all.  The bosses are hard in the sense that they know what you are about to do before you do it, and constantly thwart your every attempt to attack them.  To defeat the bosses, you have to waste about 6 or 7 tries finding out what moves not to do, and what pattern it's okay to attack in.  To me, that's not a fun challenge.. that's more of a math equation done with an Xbox controller instead of a calculator.  Tecmo thinks it's funny to waste our time ;)To end on a good note I must say that the story is solid.  And of course, the character artwork and animation is beautiful and fluid.  Very fun to watch.  (Sorry Tecmo, I just ran out of compliments.)If you're a hardcore fan of the original games, hey, buy it. - You're bound to make it fun for yourself.  But if it was the hype train that brought you here, I would advise that you rent this one before buying it. - Metaphorically, this game is a shiny new Corvette with my craptacular 4 cylinder Ford engine powering it.

{"product_name":"B0050SYLRK","description":"","reviewerName":"Snake","summary":"A buggy mess without the patch!","reviewText":"Fanboy reviews aside, there is something seriously wrong with this game. Take this as a heads up, there have literally been 4 separate missions that glitch out and are incapable of completing due to npc's not reacting, my character sinking into the floor, and a quest giver not appearing, requiring you to restart your console. They claim there is a patch, but if you don't have a live account to download that day 1 patch, you can expect clipping issues, glitchy characters and objects separating into mid-air, broken mission objectives, and sync problems. It astounds me to no end that publishers think they can push this crap out with the expectation that they can simply fix it later.In terms of the game, here are some facts, judge them as you will:- Some of the features that have been marketed are misleading- you can't actually \"free run\" through buildings. You look for an open window and he just goes through an animation and you're out the other side, losing pursuers. It is pretty much a fancy, slightly faster version of the hideouts from previous games-There are a LOT of cutscenes. Probably around a 1:1 minute per minute ratio in the first few hours. Expect a lot of talking, an order to ride a horse somewhere, more talking, go run over here, more talking, kill a deer, more talking, go run over there, kill that guy, repeat.- Combat is just about blow-for-blow arkham city's combat system. Two buttons do just about everything, so the entertainment comes from watching him do the moves. Combat is still set up so that everyone circles up around you and take turns getting murdered.- Naval warfare takes up a fair chunk of the game. In my opinion, it's totally awesome and probably the best part of the game (when your ship isn't literally sailing through the port, glitching out of the map)I checked the clock the moment I finally unlocked it. The first time I stepped foot on a ship that I controlled was 8 hours and 24 minutes into the game.-You don't play as a full assassin(white robes and gear) like the previous games until 6-7 hours into the game.I haven't tried multiplayer yet, our internet connection is still out from the storm.

Every battle has a time limit. This means if you want to slowly advance on the enemy you can't, you will run out of time. You have to charge in always so the odds of one of your party members dieing is very high.2. Some battles have you protect someone (who doesn't fight). You have to guide them to the finish line. BUT you can't control them. The idiot just runs in as fast as he can. So you have to charge in to protect him. So the odds of him dieing (and thus game over), or lots of members of your party dieing are very likely. I really hated this part of the game. As a result you will have to replay some levels numerous times to know the \"correct\" way to beat it. This then makes it feel more like a memory/puzzle game then a strategy game. I mean in reality wouldn't the guy you are protecting want to stay back??3. The dialogue between battles is the worst. You WAIT and WAIT and WAIT.4. The battles become repative after a while. The game needs more variety here. You mostly pick the same party members everytime, and they do the same sort of attacks.5. Game is too long.

I administrated a few popular COD1/COD2 servers for 3-4 years straight. Played all of them since, even crappy CoD3. I put over 1000 hours in COD4 MP, 800 or so into COD2, and some into MW2. I did not like the first Black Ops and I thought MW3 was the worse of the whole series. A little of my background MP wise is I only play hardcore, and it's usually CTF or SD. If Treyarch freaking puts HC HQ in, I would only play that.Having said the above, I know how a COD game should run. My initial thoughts were, \"I have no idea what this game will be like.\" Since it's going to be a more futuristic appeal, taking a step away from the modern era. In my opinion, Treyarch did a phenomenal job presenting the MP aspect of the game. So much creativity and customizing for everything, weapons, badges, killstreaks, attachments, etc. The map (level) design is amazing. One of the biggest reasons why I disliked Black Ops and MW3 so much was because almost every map had WAY too much bottle necking and not enough side paths. Black Ops 2 threw that all away and the designers created some amazing maps for everyone. I pretty much like them all besides Drone. The graphics are a little shoddy, but it is what it is. COD plays at 60fps in \"1080p\" (which is debatable). But if you want smooth game play, graphics aren't going to be top notch.The balance in weapons is okay, again, I only play hardcore so balance is not there - but that's what it should be like.

An uneasy peace settled over the land while, for years, the drums of war were silent. Yet the kingdoms of men grew complacent in their victory--and slowly, the defeated orcish clans regrouped under the banner of a new visionary leader.Now a darker shadow has fallen over the world, threatening to extinguish all life--all hope. The drums of war play upon the winds once again--rising urgently toward the inevitable hour when the skies will rain fire--and the world will tremble before the coming of the Burning Legion.WarCraft IIIreturns players to the war-torn world of Azeroth. Developer Blizzard Entertainment combines the lessons learned from its bestselling StarCraft, the famous WarCraft lineage, and all-new 3-D technology to create an all-new, vibrant strategy game sure to become a classic.Wage war in a fully interactive 3-D world that incorporates nonplayer characters, wandering monsters, neutral towns, strongholds, temples, and environmental effects. Four mighty playable races--humans, orcs, night elves, and undead--compete in a finely balanced dance of conquest. Upgradable heroes gain experience and harness new powers as the game progresses. This isWarCraftthat's intimately familiar, yet as you've never seen it before.","reviewerName":"Edward \"war02orc\"","summary":"WCIII redefines strategy games","reviewText":"This game is the best RTS game I have EVER played.  Those of you who are uneasy about buying it due to WarCraft II, don't be.  WarCraft III is nothing like WarCraft II.  The entire system was redefined, enhanced, then redefined again.The gameplay is similar to WarCraft II and StarCraft, but in many ways is much superior.1)The addition of RPG-like elements such as Heros makes the game much more challenging.  You can have a giant army and no hero and still lose against someone who has a smaller army and a lvl 10 hero.2)The races are VERY evenly balanced.  EVERYTHING has an effective counter, the trick is to building the units required to counter faster than the other guy can tear apart your base.3)Enhanced AI doesn't simply send enemies at you at programed intervals anymore like starcraft.  Instead, it usually effectively counters your attack, again making the game much more interesting.4)A small food limit seems like a bad thing, but it actually forces you to strategize instead of building a ton of guys.  There is no such thing as an overwhelming force if you have the right units and can micro-manage efficiently.5)The graphics and sound have been greatly improved. (and yes the units still say funny things if you click on them enough)6)A completely different battle.net makes it much easier to play games.  Instead of always playing with people who are 10x better or worse than you, you gain levels.  Battle.net automatically pairs you with people of your own skill level based on your current level (which is based on your win/loss ratio).  Its long and complicated to explain, and is not fool proof, but works quite well.The only downside to this game is its steep requirements for your PC.  You will want to stay quite a bit above the minimum specs to get the most out of your gameplay, but I think its about time that games are being made for faster and better equipped PCs.BEWARE: if you are really into the starcraft and warcraft series, don't make the same mistake I did.  Buy the collectors edition instead of this version as it comes with a cinematic DVD and a soundtrack CD.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2003"}

This game, though, didn't help me unwind:  usually it made me more furious than my job does, which is saying something.I've played, I think, every single outing in the Need for Speed series, and, while I wouldn't have imagined saying this at the time, those titles taught an important lesson:  regardless of how difficult the race in question is, practice makes perfect!  You can get it if you just keep practicing until you know ever millimeter of that track like the back of your hand.MODNATION RACERS, though, contains no such lesson.  Whether or not you finish first seems ascribable to nothing more than blind luck, not application.This is because, in this game, the other racers have weapons they can hit you with, weapons (such as rockets and lightning bolts) that bring your car to a stop and allow the other racers to speed past you.  You could be in first position throughout the length of a race but that doesn't mean anything:  at the last moment, a bolt from the blue can bring your kart to a stop and quickly put you in twelfth place.This can be quite maddening.  It's true you are given a shield that in theory protects you from such attacks, but even if you use all your race points for your shield, you never have enough shield juice to last you through a race and are liable to being hit just before its conclusion.  Why couldn't you have been given an unlimited shield that merely slowed you down?  That would have made this game vastly more playable.)This isn't guaranteed, though, which is why you can win races now and then.  But this makes for a rather downer experience from a video game:  you get the feeling that if you finish in the top three, it's not becaue of your agility on the track so much as simple chance.  You can finish a race 2nd, yet your next iteration on the same track will have you coming in 11th or 12th.  Or vice-versa.  If winning races is a matter of skill, this shouldn't be happening.And the other racers' use of weapons doesn't even make sense!  I'm in 10th position!  Why is anybody bothering to fire a rocket at me?!I think they should put \"Ages 7 - 10\" for this on the cover.  This is because I think the kookiness and randomness of the races wouldn't anger kids:  they'd just take it in stride as some sort of zany adventure.  Adults, though, are quickly gonna sour on the game since winning a race bears no correlation to how carefully you have negotiated the track or how well you know it.  (Thought:  perhaps the game is a metaphor for the medieval notion of the \"wheel of fortune\"?)Also:  I mistakenly thought this was a racing game where the player could customize all sorts of things related to the race.  No, no.  You can customize virtually nothing, save purely cosmetic elements such as the stickers on your car or what color helmet your guy is wearing.Here's a short list of things you can't customize:a.  how many laps each race isb.  the weatherc.  the number of racers in each lapsd.  whether or not to allow weaponse.  what position in the starting lineup you're givenf.  you can't remap the controls!Here's a list of some other things that variously irritated me:1.  \"Casual\" mode is not easy at all.  I would say it's too difficult to be fun, cause after about 15 times around the same track, there be no joy to it, maties.  Be prepared to do some tracks 20-30 times before pure dumb luck lands you in a spot in the top 3 and you are permitted to advance.  Actually, the \"Casual\" mode itself was a patch that came about because of widespread outrage at the difficulty of the game as originally issued:  but United Front Games apparently didn't get the point of those complaints:  \"Casual\" is still punitively difficult.)2.  You must always start last.  Why?  Why couldn't your starting position have been random?  Am I being punished for something?3.  The game \"announcers\" repeatedly insult the player unless he wins the race.  This is one of those ideas that I think sounded a lot funnier on paper than it turned out to be in the actual game.  When you're playing it just gets demeaning and mean-spirited.  If a teacher said such things to a child, it would be actionable.4.  There is no way replay the crucial tutorials given at the beginning of your career.  Or choose \"New Game\" and reset absolutely everything. You basically have to delete the game data from your PS3's hard drive and completely start again!5.  The game cheats.  You can be zooming along a staightaway going full bore and the AI cars can speed right past you as if you're standing still.  How is this possible if all the racers are driving the same car?6.  The load times are pure murder.7.  The tracks have no character.  They aspire to, but in the end the developers included so many random elements in each one that in the end they're indistinguishable.8.  You can't just get on with the racing in this game:  you're basically obliged to do all the stupid tricks (twirling on your jumps, using weapons, etc.) to win.  Not a good feeling if you'd just like to race:  it's more of a combat game.9.  Kinda blows how when you discover a shrewd shortcut, the game resets you, claiming \"illegal shortcut.\"  Hey, I found it!  If you didn't want me to find it, why did you make it possible, you morons?10.  You can get a bonus if you thrust at the very moment the announcer says \"Go!\"  But it's rather infuriating what happens if you \"jump the gun\" on this.  Your character refuses to race ahead, instead turning around and making a cryptic hand gesture to you.  Whose side are you on, you little snot?  I can understand not getting the bonus, but why am I being punished?11.  Blows how you have to confirm a race restart.  This slows everything down.  Restart now!12.  The countdown before the start of the races takes too long.  Another thing that's gonna grate on your nerves since you'll be restarting certain tracks dozens and dozens of times.  The first time I could imagine, but why do we have to go through this again and again?13.  The game does feature \"authorized\" shortcuts, but I don't understand them.  If ALL the AI racers are taking them, THEY'RE NOT SHORTCUTS!  They're just the route!14.  Really blows how you can't check out of a race and simply drive around exploring the track, or going back to inspect what messed you up.  Instead you immediately get a \"Off Track!\"","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2011"}

I'm going to say some negative things here, but that will not change the fact that this game is both fun and worth owning. Some people seem very happy with most of the changes made in this outing, but I must admit that I'm torn with regards to adjustments made to aspects such as graphics and style. Let's be honest, the cut scenes in this game look AMAZING. My issue lies mainly with the fact that the in-game graphics haven't really changed in addition to the cut scene graphics. This makes the experience a bit jarring. I've never been a big fan of games that promise one look in their cut scenes and then deliver less stellar visuals as you play. I would have preferred cohesion exist between the two. Another major pitfall for me was the handling of the camera and the controls. Not only is the camera closer to your character this time around (making for a much more claustrophobic experience), but the designers have attempted to make players less responsible for you landing your jumps, etc. In short, the controls are a bit more guided. They're also very sensitive. Turn just slightly and your character jerks as though he were being pushed. It made the experience slightly disappointing when it didn't need to be. It also ended causing many unnecessary deaths as I fought for control of my character's direction. Cole's voice is noticeably different here, and you'll find yourself regaining abilities fought for in the first game without an explanation as to why you ever lost them. All in all though, these aren't deal breakers. Not by a long shot. This game has one hell of a good, cinematic storyline, the core gameplay is still intact (with some extras thrown in as well), and the large scale boss battles were beyond satisfying for me. Clearly, many people think this game is better than the first. And I can understand why they would. Mostly, I just miss the sense of flowing freedom in the controls and the camera panned out the way that it was in the first game. But even with those issues, I still thoroughly enjoyed this experience. And if you're anything like most other people who've reviewed this game, then you'll probably enjoy it even more than I did. Congratulations belong to Sucker Punch. They've got a real winner on their hands here, and have proven numerous times that they're worthy of the respect gamers bestow upon them. All they need to focus on now is not sacrificing cohesion and great control mechanics, in favor of simpler (yet less fulfilling) contols and stunning visuals which don't match the game in question.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2011"}
{"product_name":"B004NRN5EO","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Jessie Scott","summary":"A Brutally Enjoyable Dungeon Crawl","reviewText":"When Demon's Souls came out, I hoped for more entries into such a series.  It was everything I wanted out of an RPG: customization, a dark fantasy world, deadly enemies, and the ability to tackle any foe or boss how I choose.I pre-ordered Dark Souls the minute I could.  This is one of my favorite games of all time and easily my favorite game for the PlayStation 3.**SUMMARY**Graphics: 5/5 - the game looks really good.  The textures hold up nicely even up close.  Looking up at the sky is beautiful and you can see far into the distance.  The weapons, magic, armor, and other assortment of goodies are all rendered well.  Aside from the starting area and a few minor exceptions, the entire world is seamless.  I want more games that look like this.Audio: 4/5 - Overall the sounds and music are really good, with a few forgettable pieces in and some annoying sounds every now and then.  Typically, music won't accompany large portions of the journey at all, helping to set a tense mood where you can be attacked at any time.  I wish they had a few more sweeping epic pieces in here, but that's a minor gripe.Gameplay: 4/5 - The gameplay is fantastic with a few minor exceptions.  This is an action/RPG full of exploration, combat, and leveling up.  Healing has become a strategic resource instead of being something to stockpile.  The multitude of weapons and magic means there is an enjoyable path for all play styles - I personally like the quick and stealthy approach!  Weapons and armor can be strengthened through a blacksmith.  Managing inventory is cumbersome, and the bottomless box does nothing to assist in this.  The difficulty is still high, but figuring out how to defeat a foe is extremely satisfying and can make surviving much easier.Online: 3/5 - My biggest problem with Demon's Souls was the online implementation, and Dark Souls makes some improvements, but still falls short from the mark.  You can join one of 9 covenants that help shape your online play experience, some helping to find others players for co-operative play sessions, while others help you invade players to kill.  There is still no easy way to pair up with a particular player, and co-op is limited to staying with the player until the next boss/demon has been defeated.  Invaders can take advantage of exploits (which many do so eagerly to my frustration) for easy kills, the biggest culprit being lag.  Those who are new and don't know about these issues will find themselves more than frustrated - there is a difference between difficult and unfair.  Players can still see others ghosts and messages as well as leave helpful - or harmful - messages behind as well.Story: 4/5 - The story is minimal, though there are hints everywhere in the world about what is going on.  Your character is cursed with undeath and tries to escape the prison they have been sent to.  The different factions/covenants have different takes and information in regard to the lore, and while sparse, it's fascinating.  It may take more than one playthrough to piece together everything and even then I believe the ending and story was meant to be left up to interpretation.  In the end, I feel like it leaves the player with more questions than answers.  I wish there was more lore scattered throughout the land to paint of picture of what's really happening.Overall: 5/5 - Despite the issues I have with the online component and inventory management, this is a fantastic dungeon crawler.  The action is tense, the atmosphere is dark with a sense of worry around every corner, and the game can be approached in many different ways.  There are still some issues with the online portion, and others may find it more enjoyable than I do, but it's definitely useful and can be rewarding to play with others... or defeat them.  If you enjoyed Demon's Souls, or are interested in picking up a dark fantasy action game, this is definitely one you won't regret buying.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2013"}

I don't know if it's because this is the 1st game I am playing on the new PS4 engine, or if the story itself and the missions make it awesome, BUT THIS GAME IS AWESOME!The new clarity of the graphics on the new PS4 are stunning.It seems like the mechanics of the game is smoother also and perhaps a little too hypersensitive? I will explain more. The pirate rescue mission where the character literally climbs and jumps from the masts and sails from ship to ship to swoop down and take out the king's guards to rescue the pirates is straight out of a movie. It seems like every generation that Sony releases a new console, its getting hard to tell the difference from the cinematic sequence from the actual game.As I mentioned above my only complaint, and perhaps this may be addressed through a software patch, is that some times Edward gets hung up when he is in free run and fight mode. There have been instances I will be trying to scale a obstacle quickly for him to just sit there. I will have to wiggle the control stick up and down to get him over obstacles.  Another example is that I will be trying to make a speedy escape after a contract killing to have him hung up on a obstacle he is supposed to jump over and climb to while the guards inflict damage. I have played other installments & this is very noticeable this time around on the new PS4. I don't know if this is hypersensitivity control or not intuitive enough but it is noticeable.The above mentioned definitley doesnt affect the game overall, but this is what will prevent me from giving it a 5 star rating.Buy this game, its like an interactive pirate adventure/movie.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2013"}

Characters sometimes get stuck in places that require a restart of the level.- This is highly frustrating and can really take the wind out of the players sails.2. Game freezes and locks up at what seems like regular intervals.- In this day and age of games designed specifically for a console, glitches and bugs of this nature are completely inexcusable.  This just should not happen.  As of this posting, there have been no patches or discussion of patches.  This was a game that i looked forward to since the summer.

I didn't think so - but because it's stunningly good when it comes to its taking advantage of a game console's capabilities, because of its most innovative story line, its unparalleled humor and the games ability to fully transport the player right in the middle of late 19th century Texas, living inside a Western story plot. But, since it all takes place on a huge open map and because you are in control of your character, just about anything can happen and you almost always have a say in it. So, expect to have A LOT of fun and occasionally to go into the 'wow' mode as you are playing it.The funny thing is that I didn't play the game myself a lot because I'm still hooked into another RPG but I've watched my son playing it and watching him playing was almost indistinguishable from watching a movie, that's how good the rendition is. Only when I yelled 'shoot him', unlike in a movie, I could see it happen.When you play this game it feels like you are really living someone's real life. You don't always have to stick to the story line. You are allowed to break free of the story line for a while and go back to it when you feel you are ready. Red Dead Redemption holds very many things to do on the side like maybe a few hands of Texas hold 'em in a cantina, South of the border but, beware, there's cheating going on and keep your watch on the game, ignore the senoritas :). So, it will take you a very long time to be bored.Multiplayer holds games that you can play with other people. You can do team death match and many more types of game modes. While in multiplayer you can start a gang and go around and do things around the map. Just about anything goes, from destroying fortresses full of gang members to fighting off waves of wild animals in hunting grounds. If you can somehow get bored of doing that you can saddle up your horse and try to assassinate anyone in multiplayer with you.So, if you are into 'Western', shooters and wide open world RPGs, this game is it and it's having it all: local color, accents, dialogue, shooting action and lots of unexpected thrills but I won't be spoiling anyone's fun by disclosing too much.____________________________________________Note on language:The 'M' rating is fully earned because the game makes no compromises. Most cowboys didn't complete finishing schools and the game makes them talk like they did in 'real life'. When characters talk it's not just their accent that's authentic. It's not only 4-letter words but also some quite frank talk that most parents would rather not have their kids hear and then ask questions about :).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2010"}

It is a Steam download thing,you have to have an internet connection, but that went well even for a 6.3mps connection. There are Steam games that download from disks or they allow you to and you can sometimes forgo the internet thing. The beauty even though the game has older graphics is it is no strain on your system and can be played in mostly high settings which is a treat...action is crisp and well thought out..I use a laptop\\notebook and it plays like a game should like they all should really. These days unless you go all out and get a dedicated gaming set up what with all the new stuff and such GPU hogs it is just plain fun to have a game that looks good plays good and is no strain on the system..it may strain your brain at times...almost every situation from about half way through HL2 on to parts or episodes 1 and 2 (three total) become more involved in figuring your way out or into other areas...some can be tedious but when you complete 'em you do get a sense of accomplishment...just a fun overall game the way games should be.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00020LZBG","description":"The third installment of the Ratchet & Clank franchise incorporates new elements of gameplay not seen previously in the series, including online and offline multiplayer capabilities that will appeal to a wide variety of players.Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenalreturns gamers to Planet Veldin, the setting of the originalRatchet & Clank, where the duo set off on a gripping new adventure through a multitude of diverse planets to fight for galactic peace. Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.After word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest inRatchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub. The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"Ker Thao","summary":"Another Great Sequel","reviewText":"Ratchet & Clank Up Your Arsenal has everything that made the first two games cool and now is even better with new things.

{"product_name":"B00CMQTVUA","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Van Wagenen","summary":"Not perfect, but very good. Time will only make it better.","reviewText":"I got my Xbox One on launch day, so I've had about a while now to play with it and find out what I think about the system. It is an excellent follow-up to the Xbox 360, but not without some minor flaws.*What I like:*[+] The dashboard is integrated WAY better than the Xbox 360 and PS3. There is no longer the feeling of \"in a game\" or \"in the dashboard\". You are ALWAYS in both. Say you are in the middle of a game but want to spontaneously change a system setting or launch another app etc. Both the 360 and PS3 had some semi-dashboard functionality built into the dashboard/home button, but most everything required you to first exit the game and go to the dashboard (aside from some shortcuts to go straight to a different game). Now, you press the dashboard button and without interrupting your game in any way, you now have access to the full dashboard and settings, etc. There is really no such thing as being required to \"quit\" a game anymore, which is awesome.[+] Speed. I always was surprised that through the entire life of the Xbox 360 (including the 360 S and 360 E), there was an unacceptable amount of lag on many core dashboard functions. Something as basic as showing your list of games, or list of gamerpics to change to, or achievement lists, or loading marketplace screens, would often take several seconds of waiting to populate. The Xbox One's startup is acceptably fast, but basic things like loading marketplace content or my list of installed apps, achievements, etc, is very quick. Switching between game and dashboard is no longer the slow annoyance it used to be, but rather is nearly instantaneous.[+] Dashboard Layout: The Xbox 360 dashboard was too cluttered and poorly organized, in my opinion. There were many different 'sections' to scroll through with LB and RB that made it take longer than necessary to get around. The Xbox One dashboard only has three now, it's much cleaner and simpler. Your pinned games/apps, main section to switch back to currently in-use game/app or browse your other apps, etc, and the third section is for browsing/downloading new games/apps. Very easy to navigate. It's also completely add free. Though at launch, the Xbox 360 had very few ads, and over time Microsoft worked a lot of extra advertising space into the design. So let's keep our fingers crossed that doesn't happen again, especially when you are a subscribing Xbox Live Gold member! I also like the notification and achievement changes. You can earn 0-point achievements in random apps, like for watching videos and such. It's admittedly pretty pointless, but if you don't like the idea of pointless achievements, you can easily ignore their existence.[+] Built-in game DVR. Very cool feature that removes the need for external recording equipment for anyone interested in that. Even if you don't plan on using this feature, it could still benefit you in the form of more & better guide videos from other people that will likely be swarming onto YouTube.[+] The controller. Controller design has come a long way since the old Atari joysticks or uncomfortable NES gamepads. I have used Sony's Dual Shock 3, Nintendo's Wii U Pro controller, Xbox 360 controller and Xbox One controller. They are all fantastic. But I must say I always liked the 360 controller the best. The Xbox One controller is simply an improvement upon that one. The only downside to the 360 controller was the mediocre D-pad, which has definitely experienced a massive improvement in the XBO update. They also moved the guide/dashboard button higher, which I like since I used to accidentally hit that when I meant to hit Start/Back. I even like how they redesigned the battery to go inside the controller. It takes slightly longer to swap a battery out, but since I use the USB cable to charge instead of swapping batteries (no Quick Charge Kit yet exists for the One like the 360 has), that doesn't matter at this point. The only thing I don't like is renaming the Start and Back buttons. \"Press Menu\" sounds way less cool than \"Press Start\" you're used to on any game's splash screen.[+] Noise levels and cooling/reliability. Anyone who had a launch Xbox 360 or launch PlayStation 3 (I have both) knows what I'm talking about. Those things were LOUD. Distractingly loud. Even over my high-end surround speakers. The Xbox One's internal fan is very large compared to the launch 360 (google photos if its internals). Large fans can move more air and are not as loud as small fans. This also helps with its reliability, as the Xbox 360's biggest launch issues were overheating problems. Microsoft learned from this and I guarantee that will not be an issue here. I wanted to make sure of this, so I have literally had my Xbox One powered on almost 24 hours a day for the last week since launch day. This is because if it's going to overheat, I want to know now rather than down the line after the warranty is up. And I'm killing two birds with one stone because Killer Instinct has some goals related to how long you are in practice mode, so I leave it idling in practice mode while at work. Yeah, call me crazy. But anyway, so far, it has handled being constantly on for days at a time with not a single issue.[+] The HDMI-In is definitely a unique feature to the Xbox One that the other consoles can't touch. It's not for everyone; you might not care about it. But it certainly opens up some neat possibilities. Any other HDMI-enabled device you may be interested in using can be switched to and from at a moment's notice. I plugged my PS3 into mine, not for the purpose of gaming (since there is a tiny bit of input lag), but to be able to have a game disc in my XBO and a Blu-ray movie in my PS3 so I can switch without removing the game. I could certainly live without the HDMI input, but since it's there I may as well experiment with some interesting ways to use it.[+] I obviously can't speak for everyone else, but my Xbox One console, disc drive, controller, and Kinect, all function flawlessly and had absolutely no issues.*What I don't like:*[-] Launch line-up. If you are on the fence about buying the console and you're not immediately sure what game(s) to even get for it, you could easily wait it out a while longer. Forza 5 and some of the multi-platform releases are pretty cool (like Need for Speed Rivals), but I'm not sure they're $60 cool. If you are buying the Xbox One now, you're doing it for the novelty of being among the first to have a cutting-edge system. This is true with the PS4 as well. Anybody who swears by any of the launch game is just a fanboy drone. There are a handful of *pretty good* games for both systems, but I see them as more of $30-40 titles. Honestly, I've enjoyed the downloadable Xbox One games the most, such as Killer Instinct, Peggle 2, Halo: Spartan Assault, or the free Kinect Sports trial. A big disappointment is that digital versions of full retail games (like Call of Duty Ghosts) cost MSRP. Until Microsoft shares some of the cost reduction from going all-digital (no marketing, manufacturing, shipping, middle-man retailers, etc), I will ALWAYS buy my games in the form of the retail disc version. A $60 retail game should be $40-50 tops from the Xbox Live Store. It's so backwards that all the retail games are a flat $60 at all times via the Xbox Store, when already Amazon has had various sales that have at some point put them at $39 (Lego Marvel Superheroes) to $49 (almost every launch game). Have some digital sales and permanent price drops and I might actually buy some of them![-] No backwards compatibility. This would have been an even more important feature now than it was on the Xbox 360. We've now had eight years to build up a game library on our Xbox 360s. Mine is quite large. Not being able to use that collection as a buffer between Xbox One launch, and when all the great XBO exclusives hit, is very disappointing. The original Xbox only had four years to amass its game library, and since it was the first of Microsoft's consoles, there were far less owners with far less games than now exists with the Xbox 360. A lot of the same sentiments apply to the PlayStation 4. Both consoles could have benefited greatly from a backwards compatibility feature, since neither of their game libraries will be very expansive for at least a year or so. It's also disappointing that I need to keep both consoles connected to my TV. When I bought my Wii U (and PS3, Xbox 360, PS2, Wii), I could give a nostalgic farewell to my Wii (and PS2, Xbox, PS1, GameCube) and disconnect them from my AV setup entirely, while still playing all my games.[-] There are not yet many ways to show the system off to your friends. The games are nowhere close to pushing the graphics to their limit. The cars on Forza 5 are gorgeous. But Call of Duty and any other multiplatform release will disappoint as far as graphical difference between 360/PS3 and One/PS4. But that's expected, and happens with every new generation. I'm sure the games further down the line will be much more graphically impressive (Titanfall, Destiny, Gears of War, Halo, etc).[-] Two steps forward, one step backwards: There are many features absent from the new generation of consoles that my last gen consoles have. Firstly, playing 3D Blu-ray movies. My old PlayStation 3 had this feature, but neither the PlayStation 4 nor Xbox One's Blu-ray drives can play 3D movies! Why the step backwards? I know both will likely eventually get an update to add this feature, but it is so lame to see features missing that my old consoles have. Another example of this is the Xbox One's hard drive. 500GB is your only option. There are no higher tiers you can buy like they have for the PS3 and 360, and unlike last generation, this hard drive is *not replaceable*. You also can't view how much of that space you've used, like I could on my 360. I know 500GB sounds like a lot, but I guarantee it will get eaten up much faster than last generation, and you have no way to expand it. And unlike on the 360, you can't add a flash drive or hard drive or any type of external storage. Not just for game saves, but you can't even put music or video files on a flash drive to play from your Xbox One. I still have to turn on my PS3 or 360 for this. There are also fewer USB ports than the Xbox 360 had, and I don't think you can ever have too many USB ports. On the front of the 360, 360 S, and 360 E, there were two USB ports. There are *zero* USB ports on the front of the Xbox One, which makes playing with the Play and Charge USB cable connected undesirable. There is one USB port on the left side, but that means if someone trips on a Play and Charge cable when it's plugged in there, it could damage the port or cable much more than if they were on the front. Another feature we used to have that is mysteriously absent is a recent players list. Just finished a game with someone not on your friend list? Good luck sending them an invite, message, or viewing their gamertag in any way; there is no longer a way to see a list of people you just played with. All hope is not lost though, most of these issues can be resolved in a future system software update, if Microsoft chooses. Some of them will require waiting for a console redesign though, such as swappable hard drives and front USB ports.*What I'm neutral about:*[*] The Kinect: Luckily, you aren't required to even have this plugged in so it's not a big deal. But you are forced to buy it with your console anyway, so you might as well find out what it has to offer. Unlike the Xbox 360 Kinect, this one does not scan vertically or self-adjust. The initial setup has an on-screen meter to tell you when the Kinect is pivoted to the perfect vertical angle. Kinect's voice commands are *kind of* cool, but I'm still more of a controller person. I prefer to navigate with my fingers than with my body or voice. I'm glad they made the new Kinect look a little bit neater than the 360's Kinect though. It does have a very much improved camera though. Skype calls with the Kinect are awesome (though outside of the novelty & testing factors, I probably won't use Skype that much). When the full version of Kinect Sports Rivals, and other games designed specifically for Kinect are released, I will probably see more of the value it offers. But for now: eh.[*] The console's physical design: It actually looks very nice to me. But it does have a small amount of boring-ness to it. It's just a big black box, basically. The key will be to keep the glossy part free of scratches and dust. Glossy consoles are notorious for aging much worse than matte consoles. It's also quite a bit bigger than the Xbox 360 redesigns (but on par with the launch Xbox & Xbox 360 sizes). But I do have to say, I am very glad they are taking precautions to avoid the overheating issues of the launch 360s. The giant cooling heatsink/fan inside, and ample ventilation room inside this ominous monolith, will make it much more reliable and less susceptible to failure; an acceptable trade-off in my mind. I'm sure down the line there will be a smaller version of it. But I didn't want to wait 3-4 years to get it.*Xbox One vs. PlayStation 4 vs. Wii U*:It's hard to really compare these in a fair way, because I think all three of them were built for a slightly different audience, and for different purposes. But everyone wants them to be compared anyway, so here I go. So far, I have gotten more mileage out of my Wii U than anything else. But this is simply because Nintendo has had an extra year to come out with some pretty good first-party titles. Its large touch-screen controller is another gimmick as the motion controllers were on the Wii, but many games do manage to use it in a very good way. I would put the Wii U's game library in 1st place compared to the other two consoles, which both have pretty mediocre launch libraries. But again, Wii U had the head start, and in a few years I'm sure all three consoles will have a plethora of great games to choose from. On the other hand, the Wii U gets last place in terms of power/graphics. Most of the games I play are cartooney Nintendo games, so graphical prowess honestly doesn't matter that much. But I have never and will never buy a first-person shooter or multi-platform release on the Wii U, because in those games, awesome graphics can really improve the experience. And the Wii U simply can't compare to the PS4/Xbox One in terms of raw power. Price-wise, obviously the Xbox One gets last place since it costs the most. The PS4 is the most true-to-form gaming console of the three. Hardcore gamers may not find much enjoyment in Nintendo's family-friendly Mario-type games, and the Xbox One was clearly developed with the hope of taking over your cable box and being a big media center instead of just a gaming console. The PS4, like the PS3, has a lot of media capabilities and video streaming apps and so forth, but it was primarily developed primarily to play games. I do have to say, I really like the new controllers on all 3 systems. I would personally give the Xbox One's controller the title of \"best\", but the Dual Shock 3 and Wii U Pro controllers are also both very good. Nintendo basically copied the Xbox controller on that (other than right thumbstick placement) which is probably why I like it so much. All three consoles are great, honestly. But I don't think you can say one is the best or worst, as they all have very different strengths and weaknesses. I usually just end up getting every console so I don't have to worry about engaging in fanboy \"which is better\" arguments. But if I could only afford one, I would probably buy the Xbox One due to its *FUTURE* game library (huge Halo fan), and also because, of the three, it easily has the best online multiplayer experience. But if I could only have one console right this second, it would be the Wii U since as of right now, it has the most games worth playing.*The Bottom Line*:The Xbox One is a great console with great potential, but as with most launch consoles, the games just aren't quite there to back it up, YET. If you are waiting to get an Xbox One because you're unsure of the game library, you are probably justified in continuing to wait. I honestly just got it because I knew for sure I would eventually get it anyway when Halo 5 comes out. But it the price is holding you back, you may have to wait YEARS for this to become affordable. So if you are okay waiting that long, great. But otherwise you might as well get it now so you can actually use it while you wait for the game library to improve. If you are on the fence over the console because of the 360's launch reliability, I would honestly not let that hold you back on this one since Microsoft learned a very painful & expensive lesson from that, and designed a much more reliable console this time around. Chances are, there won't be any price cuts on it for at least a couple years, and the price cuts aren't usually anything significant until around 4-5 years after launch. So if you have the patience (I didn't), definitely wait. But since I am 98.4% sure the price will still be $499 when Halo 5 comes out, I figured I may as well get it now along with the extra pre-order perks.A solid system; I definitely do not regret my purchase. 4.5 stars.Update 2013.12.07:I've developed a few more thoughts after a couple extra weeks of use. First of all, I got my Killer Instinct milestone of 6000 minutes in Practice Mode complete. For this, I just loaded Practice Mode and literally left my Xbox One powered on for 6000 minutes straight. If you do the math, that is 100 hours or more than 4 straight days. And not just powered on at the Dashboard or a menu, but in a game where it is constantly displaying animated 3D models and doing millions of calculations per second. My point is, that's a pretty good amount of consecutive time to push the console. A launch 360 would probably have red-ringed from doing that, and it would also power the fans so loud you wouldn't be able to hear anything else in the room. The Xbox One stays ultra quiet and ultra cool. Success.However, I've become less fond of the way achievements are set up. Simply, it takes a long time to scroll through and read what all the achievements are for a game. Each achievement has a hi-res image associated with it, and instead of a large grid of small icons you can quickly glance over and read descriptions for like the 360 had, you have only a few achievements on the screen at a time, and it is quite slow to scroll through, have it download the images and descriptions, and read them all. I hope they improve this experience in future dashboard versions.One good/bad/neutral (depending on how you look at it) finding is how to invite a friend to a game. It took both me and my friend quite some time to figure out how to even invite each other into a multiplayer game. Coming from the Xbox 360, it is not intuitive at all. There is no \"Invite Friend\" option. You have to be in the same Xbox Live party, then start a private game, then it automatically tells the other person in the party that a game is ready, and they can choose to join it at that point. It was kind of annoying at first, but hopefully once you understand how it works, it may be quicker than the old way of doing it.Update 2013.12.29:I've ran into a few more very minor disappointments relating to features the Xbox One doesn't have that the PS3/360 did have. You can read about this under the \"Two steps forward, one step backwards\" paragraph.Update 2014.01.06:My initial impression of the Kinect was mixed, but after you get over the awkwardness of talking to your Xbox, you can really get some good use out of it. I think game-wise, the best way (for now) to see what the Kinect can offer are the full body motion games like the free Xbox Fitness app, and Dance Central 2014. You can even just view what the Kinect sees by looking for the \"What else does Kinect see?\" option in your settings menu. It's really cool to see the infrared view, distance-metered view, along with the standard HD view. But for me, the best use of the Kinect, is to no longer need to search for the controller in the dark when watching a movie. \"Xbox Pause\" and \"Xbox Play\" commands have gotten a lot of use!Update 2014.02.25:As I predicted, Microsoft has addressed many of the shortcomings I mentioned through their February and upcoming March system updates. They have added the should-have-been-included-from-the-start feature to manage your hard drive's contents and see how much free space is available. They added a controller battery level monitor icon on the dashboard. March's update will be improving party chat and adding a recent players list that I mentioned was a last-gen feature mysteriously absent from this console. However, I am still (im)patiently waiting on 3D Blu-ray support, and USB storage support, among other nitpicks listed in my original review. Hopefully Microsoft keeps listening to user feedback. The updates thus far are promising, but they still have some work to do.Update 2014.03.08:This may be the final helpful tip I have on this review: The new Titanfall Xbox One bundle is the same thing for the same price, but includes a full download of Titanfall, so you should probably plan on purchasing that one instead of this.

{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

Carlson","summary":"Game Boy Advance Get Reborn!","reviewText":"The Game Boy Advance SP is the latest new hardware from Nintendo. This portable gaming system has the exact same inside parts as the original GBA, it is simply redesigned to fit the GBA SP's more compact shape. This reincarnation of the Game Boy was developed to help Nintendo capture the audience of older gamers and also to better compete with the new cell phones that have games on them. The letters \"SP\" in the name stand for \"special.\"The GBA SP is noticeably smaller than its predecessor. It is just over 3x3 inches wide, and about 1 inch thick. It is made up of two hinged panels, with the top part being the screen and the bottom part being the standard buttons (the design is similiar to a laptop computer--only smaller). The LCD screen part does not hinge or snap shut, but it is sturdy and does not shake or move when you are playing. The LCD screen is the same size as the original GBA's. The cartridge goes in on the bottom part of the front of the unit. The L and R buttons are still there, but smaller and are located on the back edge behind the other buttons.The GBA SP comes in the colors platinum and cobalt (metallic blue).The GBA SP is compatible with almost all existing Game Boy games (including GB Pocket, GB Color, GBA, etc.). Unfortunately, because of the way the game cartridge is inserted upside-down, tilt-sensor games, such as Kirby's Tilt-n-Tumble, will not function properly on the GBA SP. However, rumble games, such as Pokemon Pinball, do indeed work.Also, all existing accessories will work for this product, including the Card-e reader, the Gamecube link cable, and AC adapters. Instead of two AA batteries, the system uses its own built in lithium-ion battery which Nintendo claims will last 18 hours (10 hours with the light on).Yes, that's right! The GBA SP has a light on it, which may be the best reason to upgrade. The LCD part of the unit is lighted, allowing you to finally play in low or no light! The screen is lit evenly from all sides, making it look even better than a GBA with an Afterburner installed. The light turns on and off with a button above the controls.The specs are the same as the GBA, but in case you don't know them, here are the basic ones:-32-bit processor w/embedded memory-display approx. 41x61 mm-resolution 240x160 pixels-over 32,000 colors displayed simulaneouslyIn conclusion, I would highly recommend this product, especially if you do not own a Game Boy Advance. This product is targeted at new older-aged gamers, but even if you own a GBA, the [money] might not be a big price to pay for the cool new design, smaller size, and lighted screen.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2003"}

{"product_name":"B002BSC54I","reviewerName":"stevie","summary":"I think I'm done with Zelda","reviewText":"Skyward Sword is the epitome of average....at best. The game can be fun at times, but its flaws constantly bring the experience down. Firstly, there is not a whole lot new here except of course for the much talked about motion controls. They are fun sometimes, but not always 100% responsive. You must play this game with the sensor bar on top of the tv. I was at a friends house where his was on the bottom. I borrowed the game for myself. PLayed it and the controls were much better because I had mine on the top. This will save you a lot of frustration. Overall, the motion sensing is pretty good. I could imagine this is how nintendo originally thought it would be before the wii came out. However, there are still times when you want to slash horiztonal or jab forwards and you end up doing something else. You may not think this is an issue, but there are a lot of bad guy and boss fights where you have to swing a certain way or else they will block you. Again, in some boss fights this is detrimental if you are trying to swing but it gets blocked/countered and you end up losing a heart. Its easy to do it wrong and you could lose a lot of hearts. Making for a frustrating experience when you know what to do but can't do it. However the motion controls work great for shooting items.The world itself is quite bland. Its probably the smallest zelda game which is dissapointing. There are about 4-5 main areas in the game including the sky which is also quite small. Its a shame they couldn't make these lands more interesting. Skyloft is quite small, although it is supposed to be an advanced race of people living in harmony in the sky. The surrounding sky areas are littered with floating rock islands. You can explore these after you receive your skybird which you can call on to fly after you jump off a ledge. Flying is done with the wii mote by tilting it in the direction you want to go. I found myself wishing I could just use the joystick because it wasn't comfortable constantly twisting your wrist at all angles. Even still, the sky area is uninteresting and small. Unfortunately, some major review sites such as G4 have confirmed this in their review as well. I just didn't know how limited it would be. When you do fly over an island, you drop off from your bird and use the wii mote to control links falling direction. Its easy to have the wii mote pointing the wrong way and entirely miss the island and have to call your bird and start over because some of the islands are quite small.The gameplay is basically the same as previous Zeldas except this time they added an unnecessary stamina gage. This goes down when Link sprints, climbs or carries stuff. Why it would be so bad to just let you run as much as you want is a mystery. THe only reason for it is to add an extra challenge. You pretty much get all the same items again except for a few new ones. The areas are not too much different. In fact, most are just updated/re worked versions from twilight princess. Skyward Sword is a prequel. This time, link is going down to the ground for the first time, except the player has been there before. Technically, the areas are still different from the last game. They are new, but they are the same types of areas (wooded,  volcanoe, etc). The truly new areas are reserved for later on. Still, the game has you visiting dungeon after dungeon. Personally, I am growing tired of the Zelda formula. They had a real chance to do something different here but I think they blew it. Why did they not create some kind of interesting sky world instead of just making it a hub to get to other places? Unfortunately, all the nintendo fans are delusional and will buy the games no matter what.In summary.Good: Easy to shoot arrows and slingshot. Occasionally cool sword play.Bad: Same Zelda formula. Fight in dungeons through hoards of enemies. Unresponsive sword swings when you need them most. Awkward camera angles in small rooms. Very linear areas. Not many new areas and not many areas. Not a lot of fun to explore the sky. Game makes you backtrack to previous areas you have been to already. Flying the bird is not fun. Stamina gage is unnecessary. Ridiculously long text screens in the beginning and throughout the game (hold A to make it go faster) featuring lame jokes. High school romance between Link and Zelda. Takes too long to get the same weapons from previous games, making it dissapointing that they didn't put that much new stuff in the game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2011"}

In this game the Prince must set things right after unleashing the sands of time, and also thwart the plans of the evil Vizier.Similiar to what Nintendo did with Mario, Metroid and Zelda, Ubisoft's revamp of the classic series takes the action-platformer genre in new directions. The Prince has complete freedom of movement that allows him to traverse huge environments gracefully with little effort. He can run on walls, crawl around ledges and corners, swing across multiple beams, and perform other physical feats with very simplistic controls. This is the first game I've played in a long while where platform-jumping and climbing has been truly fun. What's more, one of the powers of the sands of time is to rewind time on the fly. If you make a mistake, rewind time and try again. It makes the experience a lot more forgiving and enjoyable.What's also enjoyable is the atmosphere. Ubisoft picked a marvellous way to present the game, and some great voice-acting to pull it off. The whole game is the Prince narrating past events, so you often gets his thoughts and \"Peter Parker\" asides as you play. It's clever and endearing.What Ubisoft dropped the ball on though was the combat. They came up with a combat system that works better than most games, but simply throw in too many enemies at a time. These guys respawn in endless waves, teleport in front of you, crowd you, stab you when you're down, and generally make the game frustrating. Some combat sequences can be skipped, but you're mostly required to play through them like Ubisoft asks you to. Thankfully the platforming elements are so strong that they overshadow the combat weaknesses.Overall, Sands of Time is a solid game. It's not a long game like Mario and Zelda, but I wouldn't call it short either. It's a solid experience that had me marvelling at its innovations when I played it, and its more than worth the discounted price you can snag it for now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2006"}

Works seemlessly with my Sony Bravia TV using Sony Sync Technology, which is a nice added feature if you happen to have a Sony TV (will automatically sync with the PS3 when you put in a DVD or Blu Ray disc or game, or even when you just turn on the device).So many reviewers have talked well about the many great features already that I won't go into that. One point I could make is that I wish it also had a headphone jack. But other than that it is a flawlessly designed machine, so far. Definitely the best choice if one is looking for a blu ray player. Even if one is not into the games, the PS3 is a great device for storing digital media such as photos, movies and music, and for browsing the Sony Playstation store, from where one can download HD movies (rent or buy) right to the PS3, as well as games. It is really great! Movies take an hour or two to download but are spectacular in full 1080P HD. Really fun stuff! And then there is Playstation-Home, where one can get immersed in a virtual world, meet real people and play games online. It's pretty fun.

{"product_name":"B004UDB9SA","description":"","reviewerName":"HeavyMetalSushi","summary":"Pretty Fun, But Glitchy","reviewText":"So I bought this game expecting it to be pretty awesome, being a Resident Evil game, but I was a little disappointed.  While it was pretty entertaining to a degree, there are several things wrong with it.  Capcom did kind of a half @$$ed job on it...one of those things I'm sure they came up with the idea for, made it up in a hurry, and put it out as something to make a quick buck on and try & tide people over until Resident Evil 6.  It is fun, and I'm sure online coop is even funner, but here is just a list of a few things that were kinda wrong about it:Firstly, it is quite glitchy off & on!  As an example, I could potentially lay out a zombie with a well placed round to the head or a licker with maybe 3 well placed rounds to the head...but then there were random times where I would empty a whole clip into one of them and nothing happened, almost as if I was shooting right through them.  Wtf Capcom?  That's more than a little bit frustrating, and I died several times as a result because the friggin things wouldn't go down.  There are a couple of other examples, but that was the most prevelent thing.Secondly, the A.I. was kinda retarded...not very good to say the least.  Your team mates are kinda dumb...there'll be times where they're just running about sporatically and sometimes one of them will even run off in another direction or into another room...and if that's not bad enough, the idiots will sometimes wander right into an obvious laser trip mine or kill a weaponized zombie up close & just stand there, getting themselves blown up.  Again...wtf Capcom?  I can't tell you how many times I have had to run over and revive team mates for stupid things like that.  Furthermore, they don't often always take cover.  There could be a fire fight goin on with spec ops or what have you and they'll just run around shooting, and sometimes get themselves shot down because of it.  They really should have taken some time to improve the A.I.  Sometimes I felt like monkeys could have done better...I've seen monkeys take a crap at the zoo that was more organized than these guys at times.  Good grief!Thirdly and lastly, the graphics are pretty sub-par...maybe a step or 2 above Ps2 graphics at the very most if you ask me.  Now, I don't always necessarily care about the graphics as long as the game is fun, but come on...you'd expect more from a Resident Evil game, let alone a Playstation 3/X-Box 360 game releasing this late in the game.  Once more...wtf Capcom?That being said...the game was otherwise pretty fun, and I think the concept & idea based around this game was pretty awesome.  I can't say I'll likely keep this game, but it is worth a play, and for all you online buffs out there, it's probably pretty cool.  However, in the future, if Capcom does a title like this again with this kinda system of game play, they should probably take a little more time on it...sharpen the graphics, smarten up the A.I., and work out all of the bugs.  After that, my friends, you have yourself a pretty awesome game.  Don't let this review disuade you from trying it out if you're into shooters, but do be aware of the games shortcomings going into it.  I'd recommend renting it first to see how you like it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00004YRQ9","description":"The layout of PlayStation2's Dual Shock 2 controller is nearly identical to that of the original PlayStation's Dual Shock controller, which is good news for most gamers. The main new feature is that, when the buttons are pushed, the controller can register how much pressure is being exerted. This adds a completely new dimension to sports, racing, fighting, and more games. Aside from the Start and Select buttons, all of the functions are analog for greater control, a wider variety of operations, and a more compelling interactive experience. Two convex analog thumb pads and two force-feedback solenoid rumblers round out the features. This controller is also compatible with all software that supports the original Dual Shock controller.","reviewerName":"zeb alford","summary":"The absolute best controller made!","reviewText":"Sony did a great job designing this controller. All of the buttons are located perfectly for easy use. Also, Sony was the first to create the Analog Sticks. Now, some people will say that this controller is to small, well I disagree.

{"product_name":"B0050SXCQ6","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Mason","summary":"Barely 4 stars","reviewText":"I only gave it four stars for many reasons. I'm not going to recount the series history in a review like some idiots.I am a huge fan and have played all of the God of War games. I think that GoW 3 is the best one.CONS:Secondary weapon pickup: I've heard through an interview that this option was implemented to show that Kratos was first a general in the Spartan army. He's such a good warrior that there's no weapon he can't use. Of course any fan or new player alike, can quickly learn without playing the game.......Kratos can use anything. Why implement it in game? I found it a hinderance more than anything. I'm so far in the game that there is a L2+0 to use a relic that if he has said weapon he will use that instead, screwing things up.No new weapons: In every game Kratos either got new weapons or magic. They could be upgraded granting new and more powerful attacks. There are three new 'relics', and all have cooldowns which they should have.Trial of Archimedes: I've found/heard numerous reports that the guy in charge of this part of the game didn't want it to be too hard. Even veteran gamers should be able to conquer it within a reasonable amount of time. I'm not one to waste countless hours, but I've found Kratos being juggled around for at least 5 seconds or more and not being able to do anything. The enemies take more damage here than the SAME enemies earlier in the game. So many complains have come in that they are nerfing it some; because even on EASY people are having issues.Glitch: I've only found one glitch-I got stuck in a brazier of fire (game mechanics did not allow the player to jump in it) while being stuck there taking damage. After a few seconds I phased sideways through the floor; also seeing the gears and such beneath the floor. After the floor stopped rising, Kratos 'phased' through the floor and the glitching stopped. WEIRD.COST- For $80 they know people will pay this much for a Collector's/Limited/etc edition. Sometimes the extras are worth the money.PROS:Collector's Edition-mixed feelings here. The Kratos status is made entirely of plastic. It takes up all but a small fraction of the box. While it does look cool, his face does not. He looks like he's wearing lipstick. The arms come off halfway down because it comes in the box better. The base is hollow plastic as well and he has holes in his feet to keep him on it. The blades look ok, but the detail could have been much better. The rest of him ok. Now considering how many they had to make, molding and all, I think they could've done a better job. As for the Metal disc case, this is a clear winner. Simple design, sturdy case.Bonuses/DLC-You get a bunch of Avatars for PS3 for online gaming. Since I could care less about Avatar bragging rights, this was trash. The Ascension PS3 theme was a bonus, but no real thrill. It does come with the Ascension soundtrack with over 20 tracks. This was a huge bonus, though I wish they'd put it on CD instead of a download.Finally, being a prequel that 'finishes' the God of War storyline is finally good to have. There was so much missing to the GoW story even after Chains of Olympus and Ghost of Sparta that this one made the series complete.I do have some complaints-Why does Kratos lose his weapons (minus the obvious), health, magic, skills, etc. after every game. He does retain some of them later on. I understand that upgrades are a part of the game, but they should'v implemented something different in him doing it again.After all the hype and wait, I think that it could've been much better.The multiplayer is not for me. The Rise of the Warrior webpage has allowed millions to get an advantage of those who didn't or are playing for the first time. Your forced to play with 'people' who have wasted countless hours who will now ruin the multiplayer for you. They'll see your new player and constantly kill you before you can do anything. You have to kill/block/play multiplayer for countless hours yourself in order to gain new armor/weapons. A waste of time. I will not be playing that part of the game and yet I'm saddles with all these 'bonuses' that I will never use.Update: 3-23-2013Beat the game on Easy and Normal difficulty. The New Game+ is disappointing. If you use ANY artifact then you can't get Trophies for the rest of the game. I could care less about them, but I'm speaking for those who do like getting them.New Game+ allows Kratos to start with all but the last 3 upgradeable items: they are part of the storyline and can't get them until later.CON: Kratos LOSES his previous health/magic meter upgrades forcing a replay through to find the eye/feathers all over again.One good thing is a certain artifact gives Infinite Magic which gives one magic bar whenever it is activated.Since I had upgraded EVERYTHING on a the first playthroughs the one multiplying orbs was useless.The costumes are a rip; it's not Kratos under the new armors. They are simply cosmetic; they provide NO BONUSES like the other games.The storyline is not as long as God of War 3. Probably 2/3 as long. However, I believe they did a good job on creating this beginning storyline. For anyone who is a fan, having the entire story to play at whim is a plus.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2013"}

I love the new infinity engine but it's kind of embarrassing watching my players fall all over the place after the play is blown dead.  When I first played the demo I was getting very frustrated because I couldn't get the triangle button to get my players to catch a ball...then I found out that you have to HOLD the triangle button in this years game lol.  Once I figured it out, it is really easy to intercept passes.  Also, computer is very good at intercepting the ball (like always).  I do like the fact that the strip ball button isn't as effective anymore.  There are still some pretty effective nano blitzes that work but it is an improvement.  I have been playing on All-Pro to start with and I'm 7-0 in my first season (gonna turn it up to All-Madden next week).  Overall, I'm pretty happy with the gameplay.As for the game modes, I am not deep enough into them to be able to give a thorough review.  So far, it seems pretty legit.  Trading players seems improved and so does negotiating contracts.  I don't really like the scouting system but I love the stories that they show about the college players (one Georgia QB had 610 yards passing and 150 yards rushing in one game lol).  I'm not sold on the player progression yet.  Each player gets XP and you use the XP to improve different attributes.  I'm glad that this can be done automatically because it would take forever to go through each player.  I save up the XP and do it for my top players every 6 weeks or so.  The practice that you can do every week is a little too much.  You can earn coach XP by completing different practice scenarios (which can be an entire game).Also ran into a bug where my friend an I had injured players playing in a season game lol.  Both our running backs were out for a minimum of 4 weeks and boom! They were back in the starting lineup the following week lol.If I feel inclined to update this review after more playing I will do so.  I'm a big Calvin Johnson fan so this game was a must-buy for me ;).Updated review:  Ok, I'm lowering the grade of this game...the gameplay is still fairly fun but the career mode is just aweful!  I've done two coaching careers with friends and both ended short.  The first one, my friend was fired (even though he completed most of his goals).  The second one, I ended up more than a billion over salary cap with some crazy glitch.  We also cycled through the exact same draft classes on our second career.  I really really don't like the career mode.  Also, Madden causes my game to freeze A LOT and whenever I try to turn off Madden my system has to recover from a bad shutdown (No it's not my playstation because the same thing happened to my friends).  I think they spent too much time on the physics and not enough time on the actual fun parts of the game.  BOOOOOOOOO EA Sports!  I'm glad I got NBA 2k13 in the mail today.  Now I actually get to play a good sports game...","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2012"}

Even though a lot of people I knew recommended it to me I just kept to my stubborn old self and kept thinking if I have the chance to play it I would but I'm not going to go out of my way to, especially when so many Helghast (Killzone 2) needed to be dealt with. This time around I wanted to see if the hype was warranted, or if it was just overrated and only liked for the cuteness factor, similar to say Beanie Babies.Let me explain my title, which actually I have a twofold reason for. First, playing this game makes me feels as if I'm in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe from Mr. Roger's Neighborhood. I don't mean while Trolley is cruising the tracks either, this is during the time Mr. Rogers is hanging up his sweater and changing his shoes, the moment we don't normally see. Second reason is because of the creative side (make believe) to this game, not only in regard the campaign but also the user created content and side quests/mini-games. I love the new school/old school mash up style, it looks great and plays amazing.This game is cute to say the least, you won't find any Call of Dutyesque moments in this game at all. If you're looking for or only play games with an \"M\" rating this may not be for you. However if you are young or in touch with your inner child try this game, you'll enjoy it. This game has a little bit of everything; by far this is probably one of the least repetitive games I've ever played. The controls are simple and very fluid, from six to sixty there is pretty much no learning curve at all. The graphics are beautiful; the Little Big Planet world truly looks like it was put together from items you would find in a child's toy box.Bottom line is, this game is worth the money and your time! Pick it up, it's a very unique and enjoyable gaming experience that shouldn't be missed.Michael","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2011"}

I am not going to repeat what was in that review except for: the visuals are absolutely stunning. It is the most visually stunning game I've seen so far for the PS2.Here are a few things the other reviewers did not quite make clear about the game:0. The way the game merges the tutorial into the game play is excellent and it is one of the best I've seen. It very quickly immerses you in the game.1. The ending is not an ending. It opens the game up to a sequel. If you accept that, then the ending won't be as jarringly abrupt as it was.2. The boy hero is really whiny. But you have to endure the whine since the hints for the next mission are imbedded in the cut scenes. After a while the story and melodrama does grow on you but abruptly ends with the ending of the game.3. This game is well worth a rental and should take you maybe 3 or 4 hours to complete.4. The replay value is low. Once you go thru the game there isn't a whole lot left to do. The 2 player mode isn't that interesting. The game is really more like an interactive story rather than a video game. You spend almost as much time in the story cutscenes as you do in the game.5. Buy this game if you like collecting games- like one for each genre.

{"product_name":"B000099T2E","description":"This sequel features an enhanced health damage system, an upgraded weapons system, all-new character design, and gladiator-style arena battles.","reviewerName":"JoeAZ92","summary":"The sequel done right.","reviewText":"Back in 2003, Insomniac didn't seem to be capable of making bad games, or even so-so games. All three games in their Spyro the Dragon trilogy on the PlayStation were great, and their PS2 debut title Ratchet & Clank was perhaps even better than the best Spyro ever had to offer. Expectations should be high for the next adventure of the lombax and his robotic counterpart as a result, so it's certainly a good thing that Going Commando delivers plenty of improvements and another fresh and fun adventure.Going Commando's story is surprisingly entertaining. Ratchet and Clank are first called upon to help a giant corporation called Megacorp stop a thief who stole a dangerous project-gone-wrong called the Protopet, but the tale eventually involves some plot twists that are funny and unexpected as can be. Add the entertaining plot to the plentiful light humor and well-voiced characters, and the result is a surprisingly worthwhile story.As a sequel, Going Commando proves that Insomniac is all about small improvements that together greatly improve the game at the very core. The original Ratchet & Clank title was especially unique for its deft blend of action and platforming; Going Commando manages to improve both, though the emphasis has definitely shifted a bit in favor of the action. The game's weapons are far stronger and more useful than those from the original, and they can also be upgraded by extensive use (perhaps the game's greatest core improvement). The weapon Quick Select feature also pauses the game, unlike in the original, getting rid of all the annoyances that came from equipping a weapon while enemies could still fire away at you. Throw more plentiful and powerful enemies into the equation and Going Commando ups the ante in action for an overall more entertaining experience.Improvements have also been made in the game's special levels. Clank sections now have a larger variety of robots, hoverbike races are improved with tighter controls, and giant Clank battles are also great destructive fun. Space battles are added with much success, with solid controls and simple but varied objectives. There are also new, quicker ways to earn bolts battling hordes or enemies in arenas and searching for crystals in vast, perilous fields. These are all good fun and nicely change up the game's pace.Going Commando's greatest strength is easily in its replay value. After beating the game's final boss, you are given the option to warp back to before you beat the game or start over on hard mode. Hard mode makes enemies tougher, but Ratchet isn't left without an advantage: better versions of each of his weapons can be purchased and upgraded again, and a bolt multiplier is also added to help players gather the bolts required to purchase this powerhouse weaponry. Playing with these unique and powerful weapons is a blast, and makes Going Commando even more fun to play the second time than the first.Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando is a prime example of how to make a great sequel. The plot is funnier, the action bigger, and the replay value, well, more valuable. It's well worth buying for anyone who wants a simple, entertaining, and high quality action game, whether you've played the first game or not. Going Commando is an all-around better game than its predecessor, and that's exactly what a sequel is supposed to be.9.5/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2010"}

And that disposition affects the type of games that I play.  Normally, I play epic games that have very high production values.  Typically, I would play games in the Soul Calibur, Xenosaga, and Final Fantasy series.  From time to time, I will even play mature, violent games, like God of War.  I enjoy the experience from those games.  Their captivating plot and absorbing gameplay give me the type of entertainment that I cannot get from television.  Playing Soul Calibur gets my adrenaline flowing.  There is a thrilling sense of accomplishment whenever I can execute Ivy's Summon Suffering attack during the heat of battle.  It's the same type of thrill that I get whenever I play Xenosaga and take the female android, KOS-MOS, into battle.  My mind racing, planning out a strategy that will allow me to build up her energy level (referred to as boost) in order to use her powerful triple-barrel Gatling guns against the enemy.  Piloting KOS-MOS' armored fighting vehicle, the E.S. Dinah, is probably the best experience one could have in an RPG.However, the stress of fighting an ultra-evil villain in order to protect the Universe can get to be too much.  I enjoy playing Ivy, Siegfried, Kratos, Yuna, and KOS-MOS to fight against the evil forces that are out to hurt mankind.  There's no more noble a cause than that, in my opinion.  But there are times when you want to take a break from such adventures.  And it is for those such times that you need a game like Elite Beat Agents.The other reviewers have already done a very good job of telling you what EBA is all about.  I just want to add that it is a very fun game, even for a serious person.  It is a suitable game for any age.  You will find yourself tapping and humming to the beat of the songs during play.  It's a simple concept, tapping and tracing circles on the touch pad in time with the rhythm of the song.  However, let me point out to you that it is very challenging.  By challenging, I mean you can complete most of the missions with a modest amount of effort.  But, it will take a lot of effort and practice to complete the mission with a high score.  The higher your score, the more positive the outcome of the story will be.  Ofcourse, if you fail, the story will not have a good outcome.  Keep in mind though that the stories are lighthearted.  None of the stories involve trying to stop a madman who is out to destroy the world.  No, nothing like that.  So your failure won't mean the end of mankind.  These missions range from helping a cab driver keep his driver's license, to helping a babysitter win the heart of a football player.  And you can always replay the missions in order to get a better score.  The game has plenty of replay value.I highly recommend this game.  Just don't take it too seriously.  And do not get frustrated if you fail the missions at the start.  It will take a while to get used to it.  When those circles start coming up on the screen fast, it will be a challenge to keep up.  Do not get upset and do not poke a hole through your touch screen.  A light touch will do.  The DS screen is sensitive and accurate.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2007"}

I had the first one and wouldn't mind playing the sequel.Was it the New Super Mario Bros. game? Hey I grew up with the classics so I wouldn't mind playing that updated version to see what all the fuss has been about concerning its new graphics and gameplay.Maybe a Mario Party game? I'm one of the few who never played one.No... it was NONE of those classic games- it was something I was not familiar with previously- a Wii version of Super Mario All-Stars.Quickly my excitement died down tremendously. Yes, I absolutely LOVE all four of the classic old-school games featured here, but the thing is... I already HAVE this game for my Super NES.Also, just a few months ago I happened to pull out the cartridge and play through all four games while going through a summer Super NES phase.So what's the point owning THIS Wii version? There's honestly not one. The game does absolutely *nothing* different in comparison to the Super NES version, and in fact, it took me a few minutes to even figure out how to start up the game. Yes I was quite aware you had to turn the Wii controller to its side in order to play 2D gaming, but still- simply starting up the game might take you a few minutes to figure out if this happens to be your first exposure to 2D gaming on the Wii.Even more problems- the \"1\" and \"2\" buttons are extremely small compared to the NES and Super NES buttons.  That's going to be a problem for many people who are used to the older controllers, I guarantee it.Nintendo did absolutely NOTHING to encourage anyone to buy this game (except for those who don't have the ability to download games and those who no longer -or never had- a Super NES to begin with). This is, without a shadow of a doubt, an extremely big ripoff. No, including a soundtrack isn't enough to make everything all better either. The soundtrack is average at best.  It's not like you need a soundtrack for a Mario game because you've heard the same themes plenty of times to the point of agitation anyway.While looking through the instruction booklet, I see pictures of Super Mario World.  Why in the WORLD is it not playable then?  Ripoff.I was even hoping there'd be an option to switch back to the old graphics and sounds of the original NES versions.  Nope.  Disappointing.The ONLY way to make such a collection of old Mario classics better would have been to include Super Mario World, Yoshi's Island, possibly a few Game Boy games, and heck, you know what?Don't call it \"25th Anniversary\". INSTEAD what Nintendo should have done was provide 25 years worth of the best Mario games such as Super Mario 64, Super Mario Galaxy, and a few others in *addition* to the classic NES and Super NES Mario games. THAT would have been the logical thing to do. After all, Metroid Prime Trilogy was a perfect collection of three huge games- Nintendo should have continued with the theme of \"classic game bundles\" by throwing in four or five popular Mario games released over the period of the last 25 years and put them onto a single disc.As it stands, it's very disappointing. No, I haven't experienced any unnecessary slowdown or lag time or anything like that- just the SAME EXACT GAME I played over 15 years ago. The games are incredible- this deal is not.

Except the ship & stars are better looking in this game and you have William Shattner telling you the story before you began.But basically same concept you fly through space blowing up other ships and flying around asteroids. It is not a hard game at all, just takes time to get the controls down. Hint when you have to guard a space station lay all your mines down & move off screen and they will wipe out half your enemies and you'll finish the level more quickly.This game would have been more fun; when you increase your engine speed kirk would say \"I need more powers Scotty\" but it doesn't there is No talking during the game just the same SONG over and over and it's not even the star trek theme song so my best tip turn off the volume. It is a very basic game, even boring at some times doing levels over and over to beat the clock, but if you're a star trek fan (and an old arcade player from the 80's) I think you'll enjoy  this game for the price!!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00009TW6R","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play. However you choose to hero your way throughHalo: Combat Evolved, the action should break in your new Xbox in explosive style.","reviewerName":"Rick Layton","summary":"Halo Single Player OK, Multiplayer Disappointing","reviewText":"Being a non-owner of Xbox, I eagerly awaited the Halo experience on PC.  True, when expectations are high, it often results in a let down - as it did with Halo.SINGLE PLAYER  - 3.5 out of 5It's not to say that Halo isn't fun.  It is.  However, I was expecting better.  The highly acclaimed \"story\" is, in my opinion, rather weak.  From what I had read and heard from Xbox owners, I had expected a \"Deus Ex\" type story experience.  Not even close.  The story is rated a 3.I had also expected highly developed memorable characters.  Again not true.  To be fair, however, the story and characterization is  \"above average\" for a FPS.  But it is just not at the level I had expected.  Characterization rates a 3.Playability is fairly good.  The weapon selections and effects are solid.  Movement and customization was adequate.  The mouse and keyboard playability was typical for a FPS.  There were some glitches, however.  The vehicles handle more poorly  than I had expected.  There are also a few clipping problems and slowdowns, even with a high-end machine.  I rate playability 3.5Graphics were good.  But, again, not quite at the level I had expected.  Maybe it was unfair to compare the graphics right after playing Unreal II.  The audio was very good.  Graphics and audio rate a 4.MULTIPLAYER  - 2 out of 5Multiplayer is a huge disappointment.  I had read many reviews which claimed multiplayer to be far and away the BEST thing about Halo.  For PC, the opposite is true.  First, I would suggest you tweak your settings to achieve the best performance possible.  Slowdown is a killer in Multiplayer FPS.  Even on the lowest settings, tweaked, and a 530 Kbs DLS line, I still have lag problems.  And lag is not good.  Halfway through a tunnel, I suddenly find myself outside.  Opponents suddenly disappear right in front of me.  I walk close to a ledge and then find myself dead from falling off.  I shoot an opponent in the chest with a missile, only to find out he was 20 yards ahead of where I see him on the screen.  Not good.The most frustrating thing about multiplayer is the lack of any type of system to boot off game ruiners.  EVERY team based game I have played  had \"betrayers.\"  Not only do you have to battle opponents, but also the very immature idiots on your own team that try to kill you.  There appears to be no recourse for such behavior and the develops appear to refuse to do anything about it.  It's a complete joke.There are also problems with the physics.  Quite often I shoot a missile at a vehicle, which tumbles it into the air, only to have the vehicle suddenly right itself and keep going as if nothing happened.Needless to say, I am very disappointed in the multiplayer experience.Overall, I give Halo a rather generous 3 out of 5.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00020LZAM","description":"Jak 3concludes the Jak and Daxter trilogy with a truly plot-driven adventure game filled with friendship, betrayal, death, and a long-awaited understanding of the Precursor civilization that has, until now, remained a mystery.One year has passed since Jak and Daxter saved Haven City from Kor and the attacking Metal Heads, yet Haven City is still immersed in deadly chaos as three groups fight for control of the streets. The people of Haven City have grown to distrust Jak's dark powers, and as rumors boil of Jak's ties with Krew and Kor, the city blames Jak for its current woeful circumstances. When the palace is destroyed by a surprise Metal Head attack, even Ashelin cannot protect Jak as the High Council's power broker, Count Veger, forces Jak into banishment to the desolate Wasteland. Jak is flown to the harsh island and dumped. With Daxter and Pecker bravely by his side, the three begin their next adventure where the battle for the city has just begun.Five times the size of Haven City, the Wasteland is a desert environment with multiple areas including mines and a volcano. Given the enormity and variance in terrain, vehicles play a large role as off-road transportation is introduced, fueled by a true-to-life physics engine. With a rugged new look and suited with armor, Jak is also equipped with an arsenal of new weapons with upgradeable mods that enable players to increase their firepower and enjoy the freedom to strategize and activate their arsenal at any time.As Jak has been exposed to Light Eco, players can now experience Jak's magnificent transformation to Light Jak. With a glowing electric blue aura and a massive wing span, Light Jak introduces new move sets, including the ability to glide great distances, emit an energy to block enemy attack, and power up at anytime, all of which provide the player with a sense of being invincible. Dark Jak also returns with more capabilities, forcing Jak to find a balance between light and dark.Additionally, game developer Naughty Dog continues to push the genre forward with the introduction of new technology. For the first time in the franchise, enemies feature realistic ragdoll physics, which will allow gamers to witness a unique death for each enemy that is killed. Naughty Dog has also implemented independent cloth movement technology and enhanced the enemy artificial intelligence (AI) with wall climbing and smart formation capabilities.","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Quite fun gameplay","reviewText":"Jak 3 is the end of the Jak trilogy, and gives Jak and his sidekick Daxter the largest world ever to explore. Jak can now use both Light and Dark eco powers, too!Sure, there are a lot of comparisons between this game and the Ratchet & Clank series. And yes, both are similar in many ways. But I wouldn't say one is \"better\" than the other. Both have their unique traits that make them equally as fun. I definitely buy both and enjoy both greatly.With Jak 3, you get a massive 'wasteland' to explore and run missions in, in a variety of dune buggies. There is also a desert city (Fremen and Dune, anyone?) and of course your home city to explore. There are missions involving riding missiles, riding hoverboards, stomping around in four legged tanks, searching for eggs, zooming on races a la pod racer, and much more.The storyline is fun, but very linear. It's always quite clear what you need to do next to progress the game along. You earn weapons upgrades as you go, and earn secrets to alter gameplay in a variety of fun ways. The sound is reasonable, and the graphics are cartoony but well done, especially the animation in the cut scenes. The characters move very fluidly.I do have to say that gameplay balance is a bit uneven. Some missions you fly through with no problem at all, and wonder what the deal was. Other missions you replay 30 times in a row until you manage by chance to get through it OK. If you get a walkthrough guide and just zip from egg to egg, sure you can finish it very quickly. If you actually take the time to explore the areas, seek out items for yourself, and play with the various mini-games, you could enjoy the game for several weeks. I'm not sure that the game is a replayable-minded as Ratchet, though. With Ratchet, we gladly replayed it many times to get the upgrades and secrets only available on the multiple passes through the game. With Jak 3, we're just happy to be done with it.Certainly a great game to get and play, and there's even a secret that lets you blast away at Ratchet & Clank in the shooting gallery! :)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2004"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXEM8","description":"","reviewerName":"1Dub79","summary":"The best one of TWO","reviewText":"Since Army of TWO series has been out, I really wasn't impressed with those games. The characters seemed bulky and the gameplay just didn't impress me. Not to mention, the graphics were horrible. However, after seeing numerous videos on Devil's Cartel, I decided to finally give the franchise a try.A.I. (Bravo): The A.I. of Bravo is one of the best I've seen in a team-based shooter. Bravo is not just a prop, who shoots, aimlessly and gets in the way. He is VERY involved and reliable. He gets cover, when needed. In certain situations, he will not fire, until it is initiated by the player. Not to mention, he does not get in the way of the player, while in a gunfight. The most impressive action is he may wait, until the right time, then move ahead and kill enemies at random. However, his actions are carried out in a tactical way.CAMPAIGN/STORY: This game introduces TWO new characters called Alpha and Bravo (players will be Alpha). They are sent to Mexico to go up against La Guadana, who is a deadly drug cartel.CUSTOMIZATION: Weapons can be greatly customized on this game. In fact, it is similar to that ofTom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier. With that being said, every part of a weapon can be customized and also tested out at the range. Masks can be customized, as well. Players can use default designs or even create their own.GAMEPLAY: The newest addition to the game is the infamous Frostbite 2 engine, which is used in BF3. Of course, the previous TWO games used the Unreal engine. The destructible environments, along with the animations and physics, complement each other very well. Enemies, as well as nearby structures are sent flying, when blasted by grenades. Also, enemies react differently, based upon how and where they are shot. For example, I shot an enemy in the leg, and he was limping. Bravo once shot an enemy and as he was falling to the ground, I shot him in the head and his hat flew off. Heads can be severed by powerful weapons. I once saw an enemy slammed up against a wall, when hit gunfire from a gatling gun.The dialogue between the characters is very captivating, especially between Alpha and Bravo. There is not a lot of cheesy one-liners, like in many other shooters. Sure, they say some comical phrases, but that is just to kinda lighten up the moment, as they are about to engage in immanent battle. The characters really make you feel as if you are a part of the team and what going on. I am constantly listening to each character, as they are proceeding to the next portion of a level. In other words, I feel like I am watching a good war movie with some pretty good actors.Then, there has been an improvement in theTom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2-like points system for various types of kills. For example, a player can get points for scoring a headshot, flanking an enemy, killing with a grenade, surprise kills, decoy kills, multiple kills, melee kills, combination kills, etc. Points can be used to upgrade weapons and accessories.Overkill returns to the game. Of course, those who are new to the series, Overkill is when a player can be virtually invincible for a short period of time. While Overkill is engaged, ammo is infinite and stronger than ever.The enemies on this game come out in vast numbers. Not to mention, they are very smart, which can be a deadly combination. They will shoot straight up, flank, or even throw grenades, if possible. They can even be heavily wounded, and if they still can shoot, THEY WILL. I have attempted to run up on an enemy to try to get a melee kill and as he was running away, he turned and shot from the hip. I foolishly tried to melee a boss enemy and as he pulled out a machete, my character grabbed his arm. Before he could go any further, a button icon showed up at random ala Heavy Rain. I repeatedly pressed the button and my character turned the tables and killed him with it. Cool!Many gunfights will take place in open areas, but being tactical is a huge part on this game because of the numbers, which the enemies come. Of course, this can lead to being under some heavy gunfire. Therefore, taking cover is very essential to survival in this game. The cover system reminds me of Ghost Recon Future Soldier because upon getting cover, an arrow will point at another cover position. Even the movements from cover to cover are similar. Keep in mind that all cover is not good cover, as some can be manipulated by gunfire.Sometimes, gunfights will not always be out in the open. Fighting can go down in some very close quarters. This means, the players head needs to be on the swivel because a single enemy can be around the corner or side corridors, waiting for the right moment to ambush.GRAPHICS/VISUALS: The graphics are very good in the game. The lighting and the shadows are surprisingly good. In addition, the landscapes look good. However, do not quite as sharp as BF3 graphics, but they are still quite nice. The explosions and animations of manipulated structures and the animations of the characters are done very well.SOUND: The sound of this game is very good. The sounds of the explosions are very realistic, as well as hearing various structures being altered by gunfire. Sounds from structures hit by gunfire are very realistic. As far as the sounds of the weapons, don't expect them to be BF3-like! However, the sounds are still pretty good.VERDICT: If you are in need of a very good action shooter, NOT named Call of Duty, Devil's Cartel is the game for you. With that being said, for the diehard TWO fans, this is the ONE of the TWO to purchase.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00005ML10","description":"One of the most anticipated titles in PlayStation2 history absolutely  lives up to the hype.Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Libertyis the  follow-up to one of the most captivating and intelligent adventures on the original  PlayStation. Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M. PadillaPros:One of the best and most complex stories in gamingOutstanding graphics with many interactive elementsExcellent soundtrack and voice actingCons:Long periods of watching instead of playingSome extraneous dialogueSolid Snake may inspire gamers to grow mullets","reviewerName":"Craig Juan","summary":"MGS2 is without a doubt, the king of all action games !","reviewText":"That's right ! The long awaited Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty has finally shipped to the U.S., arriving as one of the best PS2 games of all time. First off, let me give you a lowdown on what this game is like. The action is totally intense and so incredible, the Matrix can't touch this type of action. And plus there's finally some ultra-realism, which means realistic violence that are similar to martial arts movies and mostly military movies. When someone gets shot by the wall, the blood splats on the walls. Amazing, huh ? The graphics are amazing, eye-popping, and jaw-dropping. This type of technology really takes advantage of the power of the PlayStation 2. The characters look great, the environments are stunning, and the special effects are just plain excellent. The sound is perfect. Some of the old Metal Gear Solid tracks have been remixed perfectly and it sounds pretty cool. They also thrown in some new background music that sounds like you're in control of an action movie. The voice acting is brilliant. 'Ol Solid Snake's voice hasn't changed one bit, since he first appeared in Metal Gear Solid. Raiden's voice may sound a little weird, but to me, he sounds hardcore, like he's about to kill someone in just a second. And just one big surprise to the voice acting element appeared to my ears. Phil Lamaar, who played as the voice of Samurai Jack (you can also see him in MAD TV), plays as one of the main villains in the game (he's the guy who revives himself, each time he gets shot or killed). The gameplay is intense, and it still remains the same as the original MGS. But there are some new gameplay elements thrown in for your satisfaction. For the first time ever, you can hide under a box, hide behind a locker, point the gun on one of the enemy soldiers back and tell them to freeze, jump down a rail and land silently, rather than just taking the risk of jumping or falling off, and finally, go on a first person view. If you're in need of getting this game, don't listen to those pinheads who say that this game reeks. This game is the best, and it will grace anyones PS2 game collection. If you love pure action, gunfights, bloody violence, and doing sneak attacks on people you don't like, Metal Gear Solid 2 should not be left behind ! Go ahead and buy it ! You'll be proud you did !","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2002"}

You travel around Springfield to various locations to initiate the next episode to progress the game. There are 16 episodes. With the exception of the first episode where you control only homer, the rest require switching between two characters, using each characters special powers to complete the episode. Each character has basic attacks and special attacks. Homer can turn into a ball, become Gummi Homer, become Insanity Pepper Homer, and become a Helium Balloon. His special power is a giant Burp that stuns enemies. Bart can turn into Bartman and use his slingshot. His special power is releasing a flood of bats that attack enemies. Lisa's can use the Hand of Buddha and her special power is playing the saxophone to attack and stun enemies. Marge can make large crowds obey her and use this \"mob\" to attack enemies, break down walls, etc. Maggie is an extension of Marge and only briefly playable in air ducts and small spaces. Many of the Simpsons' other characters make appearances throughout the game.Side quests: Each episode has a time trial, character tokens, and trophies to get. Outside in the city, more tokens are scattered for each character. There are tons of tokens per character to collect (I believe 100 each). Also, there is a challenge to unlock all the video game \"clich&eacute;s.\"Multi-player: Two players can be used in the last 15 episodes where two characters are used. Each player controls one of the playable characters.Conclusion: Controls are easy to use. Game has a mass environment to explore and collect all the side quests objectives. Replay is moderate but after you get all the accomplishments the game has to offer, not much else. I would recommend this to any fan of the show. It will not disappoint.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2011"}

I bought this model because I had an older HDD already and I just stick that HDD into the slim and it works well.This 360 model is probably as good as the Jasper motherboard model. I had the very first 360 motherboard and that was really crapy. With every new 360 motherboard that came out, the 360 has less risks of overheating and/or red ringing (RROD). The slim is the newest and in theory is the best for NOT RROD. But, I would say the Jasper model has a fighting chance of beating it. It just depends on the user's own usage and maintenance.Long and gone are the days of just using a system anywhere, anyhow, and anyway. Back then, I had systems that I can abuse and use like crap and they still work today. Now Microsoft and Sony both have made systems that are made for very light touch, light abuse, and light everything.The first thing I like to say about this slim is the the placement or the set up of the console really matters. You can't just place this thing on the carpet. You can't place this thing in an entertainment center. You can't place it in a high cabinet. Honestly, the best place you want to put this thing is next to a window. How high up or low it is matter too. 3 or 4 inches away from the window is a good idea. Same for the high. You can put something underneath the system for this high.These things are NOT durable. You want a light touch on these things.  During game play, you don't want to knock or tip this thing at all! Also, moving the console while it is off could be bad if there's a game inside the machine. Tapping, pounding, or smashing the machine would cause it to go bad quick! One fall from 1 or 2 feet would probably K.O. the thing! lol Older systems would probably take the hit and survive, but this thing; nope. If it does, it probably wouldn't last long without you seeing some problems with it.Cleaning the machine is a good idea. Computer experts know that dust kills electronics and the 360 is known for overheating and dust would do that. I recommend getting a dust buster and blowing out the dust inside from time to time. With older system, you would never had to do this, but with these new babies, you will learn to do it. Some people like to vacuum it out and you can if you want too.The overheating can still happen with a slim model. If you don't ever want to see that happen, you will to do some things. One thing you can do is to place your console horizontally. Heat can get out easier if you let it be in this position and the fan will blow it up. If you play the system vertically, you will see that a main air vent is now blocked. You really want air to get in the system so that it can cool it down. If you block a main vent it will tend to overheat easier. I will agree that it looks cool vertically. But, I would rather have a working system then a cool dead system.If you really want to get something for your system to protect itself from overheating, then get something that blows in air from the side. When you do that you create a better airflow circulation. Cool air goes in from the side and warm air comes out from it vent. This is great for the system.Since, we are talking about overheating, I would say this once and only once. I do not recommend you getting the Nyko intercooler STS. That product does nothing for the slim and may actually hurt the system. What you doing is putting an exhaust fan, on top of another exhaust fan. The airflow isn't really increase, but actually stays the same or decrease. Since, the 360 is blowing out air and the STS is collecting it and blowing out air, what did that do? If the 360 fans are blowing out more air that the STS can take in the extra air is still in the system. Heat kills and you want to get rid as much air as you can.Some minor things I don't like about the slim model is the touch sensitive buttons. They will detect anything that come close to it and will start or open up the disc tray. I like the idea of having it, but it just a pain to see it do that when you didn't want to do it. Also, I would had like the slim to have more air holes. The older 360 design had air holes on the bottom of the system and on the top.The power brick is better with this model. It has air holes that let out heat. Also, there is a fan in there and it helps with the heat too.The new 360 slim controller feels a little better. It has a better look to it and has a better d-pad. The older 360 d-pad felt very hard and make it hard to press it. The new d-pad feels smooth and softer.If you know how to take care of your toys, then I say this is a good system.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2011"}

Just like the name says, it is lightweight and has better lighting.  Colors show through magnificently!  Additionally, there is the option of Pictochat - pretty cool tool to have, many people can join a chat room and this is great for long bus rides, et cetera and does not even require any games!Some caveats!!1.  BE CAREFUL!!!  The system does seem a little bit sensitive.  Mine broke after my child dropped it on the tile floor.  We tried to turn it on but it was DEAD...  what a tragedy!  A great solution to this is to buy a protective covering.  A great one to try is the Nerf covering that is sold.  I will say it is a little harder to play games that require button use with the Nerf covering on so it may take some time to get used to.  Alternative is to take it out for game play only and otherwise keep it in the protector.2.  Touch screen sensitivity.  Be gentle with the touch screen!!  Angry youngsters who push too hard with a stylus can distort the touch screen and it will forever be innacurate.  It's worth noting that one can calibrate the touch screen - simply turn the unit on, do not choose a game but rather touch the small icon at the bottom of the touch screen.  Nevertheless, in our case, despite calibrating the touch screen, it is still a bit distorted thus for games that require a response written with the stylus may \"read\" responses as incorrect (case in point, brain age cannot recognize my numbers properly).  The DS  is still usable, however, for games such as Super Mario or others that require little to no touch screen interaction.As any gaming system, take care of things!  Use a soft (dry) cloth to clean the outside and perhaps a very VERY LIGHTLY dampened tissue (I'm talking merely a drop of water) to clean the dual screens (dry immediately!!!!!!!)If a player takes care of the system, it is sure to last for years and will provide much enjoyment!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2008"}

Lethal","summary":"believe the hype!","reviewText":"I'm not going to give away any plot points because this game is much better enjoyed when you don't know what to expect.  I have finished it once and am already looking forward to my next playthrough to see how different choices affect what happens.  The graphics in this game are outstanding, particularly the photo-realistic character models.  Sony used an orchestra to create the soundtrack for this game, and it is better than typed words can convey.  Think Silence of the Lambs in terms of tension being built up perfectly.  It's also in the back of your mind the whole game that you can get one of the four characters you control killed if you make bad decisions or fail to get them out of danger.  Characters are well developed and likable enough that I cared about keeping them alive, not just to get the best ending.  The game is divided into chapters and sub-chapters, and if you're unhappy with what just happened you can choose to restart from an earlier point.  You can also do so to see how each decision plays out, though I never did because it felt like cheating and largely spoils the game's huge replay value.  Knowing that your actions can and will permanently alter the course of the game and story creates incredible anxiety.This is the first time I have ever enjoyed using the six-axis controls in any game.  At one point I had a guy by the collar and decided to rough him up for information.  By shaking the controller up and down I began shaking the suspect until he talked.  For someone who is not a fan of analog sticks I was amazed by how natural their use was throughout the game.  Each action sequence consists of a button pressing/analog stick moving minigame.  While such minigames have become common and are generally starting to feel overused, every button press in Heavy Rain feels natural within the context of the action onscreen.  When running for your life you choose a direction to push and dodge obstacles accordingly.  You push buttons to punch, kick at or dodge the weapon of your assailant.  You have a window of opportunity to make the correct button presses, which changes based on the difficulty level you choose (you can change the difficulty setting at any time during the game).  Different animations result with each success or failure and accumulate during each minigame until you pass or fail it.  There are also a number of times during the game when you unexpectedly have to react with a single button press.  The only control issue I had was getting used to holding R2 to walk, then using the left stick to change direction.  After countless games where walking is done entirely with the left stick alone I spent the whole game fighting my natural instinct.  They set it up the way it is because cameras are fixed and change routinely as you move through an area.  If you simply hold R2 you'll keep moving straight, but if you fiddle with the left stick you unintentionally change direction every time there's a camera switch.  It's a small price to pay in exchange for fixed cameras that never get stuck on things or end up at bad angles.  Since spotting clues in each room is vital to the game working, Sony made the right choice here.  You can even push L1 to change cameras at almost any time, allowing you to focus on either your own character or the person you're talking to.There have been a lot of video games with much hype around them that failed to deliver, sequels that play it too safe and lack originality, and blatant clones of successful franchises.  Heavy Rain is very original, full of suspense, good writing and voice acting, nice graphics and tremendous sound that set the right atmosphere, and very good controls.  This game is why you bought a PS3 and cannot be missed.  Those blockbuster action and FPS games can wait.  Heavy Rain should be your next purchase.  You will thoroughly enjoy it, and we need to support sales of titles that dare to innovate.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000KGD1GO","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"An awesome sequel to a great series","reviewText":"The Good: Engaging story, great audio/visual package, squad based gameplay keeps it separated from the rest, decent lengthThe Bad: Still WWII..., relies too much on knowing other BiA games, pointless slow-mo cams, must...be...patient...I never really liked BiA back when they first came out because 1. I didn't have a PC that could run it or an Xbox. 2. I preferred the run & gun aspect like in Medal of Honor and Call of Duty, and 3. I was too impatient back then for the tactical gameplay. I have changed since then and am not an impatient little teenager with raging testosterone. I have picked up Hell's Highway expecting a bit of a mix and thankfully there was. BiA has been known for it's tactical squad command gameplay with great AI, a great non-fictional story around the fictional WWII setting, and that's here, but it's even better.The story goes a little something like this: You are Baker who goes through an emotional roller coaster ride with his squad mates and you really feel what the soldiers are feeling...and even tear jerking at the end. The only problem is that you have to have played previous BiA games to fully understand the story from the beginning. The story does one of those looping plot twists where it starts out at the end and goes 3 days back, then goes forward after that. The plot holes are jerking when they are filled and you really get pulled into the story. As far as I know this is the only WWII story like this. I guess you can say this is my favorite WWII game story wise and it makes me want to pick up the other two original Xbox games.What really counts though is the game play in one of these types of games right? Well the impatient should steer clear because you CAN NOT, I repeat, CAN NOT run out and go Rambo and their Kraut @$$es. You WILL be shot down almost instantly, and this is not good if you want to restart constantly (and experience the almost too long long time). You have to position your squad mates around the various cover on the battlefield and slowly have them pin the enemies down so you can go around and flank them with...whatever you want, no you can't melee in the game so that's out...sorry only Call of Duty 3 lets you do that. Each batch of enemies has a red circle above them and when it's red they can blow your beehiney apart if you run out, but if you command your squad mates to suppress them with fire it will turn gray and you can run out...for a few seconds. The game gives you plenty of ammo so don't worry about wasting shots. I mainly used single shot rifles since head shots were mostly needed due to enemies taking cover. That's what also makes the AI so great, so say for instance you run up to the cover the enemy is behind they'll run away and hide somewhere else. Throw a grenade and they'll boogy on out of there even if their on a Flak 88!Now you can command four types of squads: Bazooka, Base Fire, Assault, and MG. Go figure on what those all do, but they are all essential to keep you alive. Another thing that makes you REALLY think is that if you send your squad out in open fire they'll die to (but only until the next cut scene because they are all main characters...) so you have to have one squad pin the enemy down while that squad runs, so it's a leap frog type thing. This is really great and keeps things from being boring since you have to think...psh yeah who woulda thunk that a WWII shooter would make you think! Of course you have grenades, but you get a grenade ring and it's basically an auto-lock thing so just hold RB and the grenade will fly over to the enemy on it's own.Speaking of all of that something new here is the \"action cam\" thing. It's kinda cool since BiA is the only game that seems to realize there was actually blood and guts in war...they don't try to purty it up for kids. Sometimes when you make a cool headshot you get a cut-a-way cam of the guys head getting all bloodied up and his helmet falling off. The same goes for explosions so you'll see guts go everywhere (get a clue EA and Activision!!! Stop being sissies!!)If you've been wondering about the audio/visual experience this whole time it's because its good or I would have said something! The game uses the UT3 engine (you know the same one in BioShock and Gears of War?) Its nice and all yet still seems like the game came out last year. Maybe that's because the game was delayed almost a year (yet I have NO idea why). The game has great lighting effects, explosions, fire, concrete, rebar that blocks your view sometimes in the 3rd person cover...it's good but not amazing. The voice acting is really great and the whole game feels like WWII (you probably wouldn't give a damn at this point though...)If you want to know about multiplayer don't come here because I never bothered playing it since it was a rental. I'm sure it's great and has all the multiplayer goodness that most WWII shooters have. I highly recommend this game since it has a pretty long campaign (takes about 8 hours to beat) and really concentrates on Operation Market Garden instead of the whole damn war!!! So, you really get a good idea of what that battle felt like. Don't spend $60 on this though just rent it or wait for a price drop...please...get Fallout 3!!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

You've seen the movies.  You've played the first AvP.  Now be prepared to be blown away by the second installment of what may turn out to be a long-lived FPS series on the PC.  However, not all is gold and silver in this amazing package...The graphics, for one thing, are absolutely gorgeous.  The characters come to life seamlessly and behave realistically.  Going for more of a comic book theme, AvP2's graphics do not opt for the fleshy and realistic looking models and skins of the first game, but instead go for a more colored and polished look similair to what you will find in the classic Dark Horse comic book series.  And thats not a bad thing at all.  The characters all have personality and, contrary to the first game, there is a linear, actual STORY running continuous among all three races...so its not playing the same story with a different outcome, its playing the same story through the eyes of each different race as it unfolds.  What's that you ask?  Why did that guy suddenly disappear from the Marine campaign?  Well, once you're finished with that, you'll play the Pred or Alien campaign and find out.  Consistencies like that occur through all three viewpoints which adds alot to replay and overall fun value.These gorgeous graphics described mask a menace...bugs and lag.  Even on some of the most high end to mid-level computers, AvP2 has a tendency to be herky-jerky when there is alot of action on screen, particularly during mass Alien attacks.  The graphics manage to stay crisp but the high detail on the models still creates a problem.  Its ok...you can always turn down the display settings, but in such a great looking game like this, would you really want to?Crashes are abundant...its too bad really.  This is such a great game and yet there are so many wrongs that could have easily been overlooked by the development and play-test teams.  Crashes during in-game cutscenes(which are done rather well...conveying the story intelligently and clearly) happen often depending on whether or not your video drivers are up to date or if your hardware is compatible.  There are many technical issues with the game that can be easily and shuold be solved in a patch or two.The sound is great, but there are alot of sounds ripped directly from the movies that were included in AvP1 that were so great, and are now missing in AvP2.  One thing that many have wanted is the improved sound on the Predator's shoulder cannon...it sounds exactly as it did in the movies.  Other sounds have been pulled from the flicks and integrated, but many of the sounds have been changed.  In any case, the SFX are still great, and the music ranges from all out creepy to terrifying, especially in the marine campaign.The atmosphere is frightening...use of dark and light is great and keeps the mood forever tense.  There are tons of scripted events that will have your knees knocking from utter fear, especially in the marine missions!Multiplayer coding....it needs serious work.  There is a very highly argued balancing issue between the 4 sides you can choose (Alien, Predator, USCM, Corporate Mercs), each with 4 sub-classes.  Very buggy and unbalanced, the multiplayer game is fun but needs serious work.  There is no shortage of interesting modes however, and trying them all out will be a blast.All in all, a GREAT game with some moderate flaws.  Definitely pick it up if you are looking for a great single player experience, or are a fan of AvP!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2001"}

On Sly's eighth birthday, he is given the Thievius Raccoonus, an instruction manual passed down through the Cooper family for generations on how to be a great thief. But ruthless villains bust in and steal the manual, split it amongst themselves, and then vanish. Sly, along with his two friends Bentley and Murray, must embark on a platform adventure to recover the pages of the book and prove to the world that Sly Cooper is the world's greatest thief. Different skills, such as stealth tactics and platform jumping, are required throughout the game. You'll also pilot vehicles, play minigames, and fight bosses as you proceed.","reviewerName":"JakFrost \"thegreatui\"","summary":"I'm impressed","reviewText":"First off when I bought this game I was thinking 'A raccoon with a stick, how can that be fun', well after playing the game almost none stop I am afraid to say that I was dead wrong, the game is extremely fun. The whole game is based on Sly Cooper trying to get back his family book of how to steal things. You have to find all the clues in a level to crack a safe to get a page back for this thief book. Every page you get awards Sly Cooper a new skill or upgrade, one of my favorites was the slow motion skill. Let me elaborate, lets say a villain is throwing stars at you, well just hit the slow motion button and jump and you can easily dodged his stars and it looks kind of like the Matrix. There are all kinds of skills that a master thief would need, you can turn invisible, do the tight ropewalk etc... One thing that makes this game a plus is when you die and it's game over, instead of starting from a save point you start the level over again with five lives and the stuff that you collected while in the level before you died will stay with you, so you wont have to collect again (Which would get very repetitive and boring). The game's replay value is high; so far I haven't gotten bored of it. The buttons are pretty simple, for special jumps the button you press is circle and for skills like slow motion the button is triangle. You can switch between different skills so there are no combinations of buttons to press just to do one simple jump.This is a must have and you wont be wasting your money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2003"}

When I restarted my xbox 360 My saved game was wiped out and says currupted file . I can't load the saved game file or do anything with it. I've read alot of reveiws were this same thing has happend with currupted files.  If they know about these bugs and currupted saves then why don't they let you have multiple game saves? I'm pretty ticked off. And NO I've never had any of my saved games on any other game for the 360 ever currupted. And I just downloaded an update for this game and hour before my save got currupted. When they make it so you can manualy save or just save in general more then one save I'll put it back to 4 stars. I'm just gona back up and extra save from the hard drive to a usb drive until thenThis is a great shooter/rpg game.Pros:There is replay value if you want to try the other charactors.Alot of fun finding higher power weapons through the game. Same weapons though.Alot of game play hours. 20-60 hours on average for me with sidequests invloved.Quests and sidequests are entertaining.charectors are built good, but half the skills are useless to me.The guns you do find, don't degrade at all unlike the melee weapons in the gameCons:Mostly a melee weapon game. Not alot of guns. and ammo for the guns you do find.Melee weapons degrade way to quick.Upgrades and mods are kinda lame. They are also not realistic.Big bosses rarely drop any good itemsZombies spawn at the same spots and respawn in a short period of timeTo me this game is a mix between Borderland/ and the pc game S.T.A.L.K.E.R. . STALKER is one of the best games I've ever played and if you have a PC and like this game get it.I realy liked this game but what did it for me was the lack of guns. If you like melee weapons and close combat then buy this game. I know that the game said there were some guns but you don't realy get them and ammo until half way through the game. Still a great game but not for me.I sold the game after almost a week of playing it.

It's got the detail, the setting, and hey, even those spiffy new wave tunes you can't get out of your head. The thing is, like just about every other thought-out game in the world, this one's enjoyment is relative to the skill and dedication to themes. Sound like an English paper from the 5th grade? Let me elaborate.For one, this game can be pretty frustrating if you're not used to playing games for quite awhile. I guess that's relative too, but the point is: if you don't have the dexterity of thumb and the wits that this game demands, then chances are you won't get too far, you'll get frustrated, and finally drop it. It's the simple fact that this specific game isn't about minigames or driving around. There are cab and ambulance missions, but that won't get you farther in the game to some of the unlockables, thus defeating the purpose of buying it to finish. So all in all, it gets pretty difficult and it may seem like the game is against you. But if you can bear it and be patient, you can just get good enough practice to beat the game.Now, putting all that schmuck aside, this game is still one of the best games you'll want to be looking for. Detail, lighting, sound effects, and just the overall interactivity of Vice City come together into a humongous experience to drool over.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Cheri Taylor","summary":"8stars if i could","reviewText":"this game is awsome very fun like the first but this is better.

On the fringes of known space, entire human colonies are vanishing. As Commander Shepard, you must assemble the galaxy's deadliest team and stop the most terrifying threat humanity has ever faced.","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"Epic science fiction...one of this gen's finest games","reviewText":"After hearing Xbox 360 owners swoon over this game for the past year, PS3 owners have finally been blessed with one of this generation's best games.  This is one of those games where you can believe all the stories you hear, and buy with confidence...it is a masterfully crafted labor of love that you won't ever forget.  If you're a fan of the great space sagas of science fiction, be prepared to add the universe of Mass Effect into that pantheon of great sci fi lore that includes by Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek and the like.  It's that good.The game itself falls somewhere in between the genres of third person shooter and role playing.  The action in the game is great fun, especially later in the game when your characters are powered up and you are able to turn the battlefields into almost theatrical displays of gunfire and special powers unleashed by your team.  Aside from squad selection, there isn't a whole lot of necessary tactical thought required to get through the game's action sequences...just a mastery of the cover and shoot system and knowledge of the special abilities in which your character is endowed, as well as those of your 2 teammates.  The locales are fantastic, thanks to the great art design seemingly inspired from every science fiction movie and television show to come before.  When you're not fighting to accomplish your objectives, you are exploring the galaxy in your starship...mining planets for minerals to upgrade your ship, armor, weaponry and powers, discovering new star systems & missions, and interacting with the different alien species of the Milky Way.  Bioware has struck a perfect balance here between action and RPG-style exploration.  You'll want to explore every corner of the galaxy just to experience this universe fully and gain every possible advantage you can before your final mission.The accessible action and RPG elements of Mass Effect 2 allow the player to focus on what is the center of this game...the story.  Full of intrigue, excitement, mystery, and sadness, its quite simply one of the greatest stories ever told in the genre of video games.  Shepherd's quest from initially being resurrected from near-death by the mysterious organization Cerberus, to the seemingly against-all-odds final mission is epic in every sense of the word, and is made possible by characters brought to vivid life in ways that video games haven't done before.  The phenomenal voice acting (the best I've ever heard in a video game) and brilliantly written dialogue make everything feel so personal and realistic.  You'll find yourself conflicted when you have to make big decisions that can alter the fates of not just your teammates, but the fates of entire worlds.  You FEEL this game.  You become attached to certain characters, despise others, and find yourself being emotionally pulled in so many directions through the game's many hours.  It feels like a milestone, an important moment for video games that truly raises the bar for the medium in terms of its capability to tell a story.The game looks and sounds great too.  If there were any faults to the game, the only one I could think of is that the game was not very challenging at all on the Normal difficulty setting.  Obviously, the designers wanted to bring both the story, and the way you as a player can shape it, to the forefront.  They were more than successful in doing this, so that's why I find it hard to even complain about the difficulty level.  Any of the shortcomings are more than forgivable given the game's many strengths.  The game makes we wish that I had gotten the opportunity to play the first Mass Effect.  While the in-game comic book gives a good overview of the first game and sets the stage fairly well for your playthrough of Mass Effect 2, you can't help but realize that the comic book is in no way a worthy substitute for playing the first game, especially after playing Mass Effect 2 for a few hours and realizing how deep the lore of this universe is.But in the end, those of us who own only a PS3 are incredibly fortunate that this amazing game found its way to our console.  Believe the hype.  This is one of the finest games of our time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2011"}

Right now I have 5 games installed, & I still have 193GB free. The HD is huge! If you see a red light when you go to turn on your console (RDoD), don't worry. That mainly means that the HD is loose, so you have to take it out & plug it back in snugly. I know this would scare/annoy most.The Wifi being built in is a very nice touch, but it's still not a good idea to game online with a Wireless connection, even though this is 802.11n. I tried playing Call of Duty: Black Ops wirelessly...it didn't turn out well lol.Also, the buttons to eject are \"capacitive buttons\", so they activate by the slightest touch.

Total playing time for me was 58 hours, and I only did a portion of possible sidequests.In the Shadow Hearts series, I have now played Koudelka (the PS1 prequel to SH), Shadow Hearts, and Shadow Hearts Covenant.  Each of the three games is 4 or 5 stars for me, I recommend them all fully.  I think with each successive game, the gameplay, combat system, and graphics got better.  Also, with each successive game, the overall theme got a little less dark (although I prefer darker, personally).  Koudelka was a brilliant, very dark-themed horror survival game with RPG elements that was slowed only by a slow combat system and somewhat blocky graphics.  Shadow Hearts was dark-themed, but less so than Koudelka, with vast improvements in look, feel, combat system and overall gameplay.  Shadow Hearts Covenant is closer to Shadow Hearts, but less dark-themed still, with further improved gameplay.Shadow Hearts Covenant was a great game, 4.5 stars for me.Strengths:- The Judgement Ring system for turn-based combat is a lot of fun, and is even a little better and deeper here than in Shadow Hearts; combines strategy of the best turn-based RPGs with timing/skill- Great story, with multiple flashbacks and tie-ins to SH and similarly spectacular plots and ending(s) that will leave you both satisfied and thinking- Yuri and Karin are some of the best, most memorable characters I've ever played.  Gepetto, Joachim, and the others were very good.- Very enjoyable game throughoutQuirks and oddities:- Some crazy humor and nutty NPCs- Similar (and in some cases the same) weird monsters as SH and KoudelkaMinor Weaknesses:- some unnecessary dialogue with the Ring Soul- Yuri's Graveyard area was good, but I liked the Graveyard gameplay in SH better- less dark than SH or Koudelka (personal preference)Shadow Hearts Covenant is a polished, excellent RPG that really takes advantage of the Judgement Ring System, which is a brilliant gameplay system.  It has some of the same origin and a little of the darker flavor of its predecessors, but it is less dark overall.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2012"}
{"product_name":"B001CWXAP2","description":"","reviewerName":"Shaide","summary":"A Star Wars MMORPG the way it should be","reviewText":"The game is made by Bioware, which also made the popular Knights of the Old Republic games, as well as Dragons Age and Mass Effect, and as such is similar in some aspects to all of them! The game has moral choices that Bioware is famous for, as well as easy to navigate conversation trees.Bottom line: Is the game good? This is a dificult thing to answer. Do you like Star Wars? Do you like Bioware games? Do you like MMORPGs? If you answered yes, to any of those questions, then the answer is: Yes! The game rocks on so many levels!However, like in all MMORPGs you get Trolls and basically childish nimrods who come onto the general chat and become an annoyance. They tend to type in all caps, about how the game sucks and how much better the last game they played was. They like to belittle anyone who plays the game differently from them. Not leveling fast enough? You are a N00B who doesn't know how to play the game. Level too fast? You are a cheat or a \"haxx0r\". Best case scenario, is you are rushing too fast through the game. They want to control your playtime! You don't PvP, then you suck. You RP, then you suck. Luckily though, the game has an ignore feature, that doesn't seem to have a limit to the amount of names it can hold.The trolls are a common occurrence in any MMORPG though, and shouldn't push you away from an exceptional game though!Another thing I should mention is, that the game is very story driven, which for me is great! since I play a game to experience a story, not to rush through and see how fast I can level up and gear myself up.The game is also fully voice acted. Meaning, that every NPC you talk to will speak to you! Some don't speak galactic english though, so you will need to read subtitles. However, this full on voice acting helps immerse you into the star wars universe like never before.Personally, I think this is the best MMORPG on the market currently. Sure, there are other good ones, but this title has made me forget all about them. The player base leaves a lot to be desired though, however the server I ended up playing on, might have just attracted more trolls and morons than other servers. Maybe, that's what I get for choosing a server simply because it had Darth in the name.Am I surprised that I liked it? Honestly, I am! I thought I would detest this game! Simply because of my past experiences with Star Wars: Galaxies, which has got to be one of the worst games of all time! I was afraid The Old Republic was going to be similar to that. Thankfully, it wasn't.This is NOT a detailed review, in fact I consider it more of an endorsement. If this had been a detailed review, I would have discussed the companions, the fact that you get your own ship, and I would have went on about how you can fly to iconic planets, Like Hoth and Tatooine. It's just me, saying you really should try this game out. Even if you have a cruddy older computer. One of the most amazing things about this game, is the fact that it will run on most machines. If you have a semi-modern computer, odds are you can run it. Maybe not at the highest setting, but you should still be able to run, and run it smoothly at the lowest setting.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2013"}

Eventhough the campaign is a bit on the short side (about 4-5 hours) it was a very fun and exciting experience. The graphics are about one notch downgrade from how Battlefield 3 looks (Frosbite 2.0 engine) and there were a few texture pop ins that are really few and far in between.The multiplayer, compared to the MOH 2010 is definitely a few steps above. Does not play like BF3 where you have to run for miles at times to get to the action. MOH-W sets you up with a buddy system where you can grab ammo from if you are running low and you can respawn where your buddy is. There are perks, unlockeable weapons and accessories as you level up.One of my favorite options that a lot of people dont mention is the cover system. You can hide behind a wall, rock, vehicle, etc and by pressing the L2 button and using your left analog you can peek around corners. Earlier Rainbow Six series had a similar peek-a-boo system, but many fps out there do not. It opens up more tactical options when playing. MOH 2010 had this on the campaign only, so I'm glad they decided to implement it on the multiplayer this time around.Medal of Honor Warfighter is definitely worth getting.

Being a longtime God of War fan, Ascension was more important for me to start playing than this (even though I was hyped up about both), but Tomb Raider's effortless controls, intriguing story line, terrific voice acting and perfect combination of action-adventure and horror elements sucked me in and I found myself coming back to Lara Croft over Kratos more and more.  That's not to say this game is perfect, as I found it frustrating sometimes to which direction or what needed to be done next, but nearly everything other element - gameplay, controls, story, etc. - were, to me, near flawless.  People have been comparing this latest Tomb Raider to Uncharted and, yes, in many ways there are similarities, but that could've been said about Uncharted back in the day when it was a newbie and Lara Croft had been a name renowned in the video game industry almost a decade prior.  The survival aspects of this game really hooked me, although I died more than I'd like to admit sometimes when a sudden QTE happened that required an immediate button to survive (partly my fault, I'll admit).  There were moments galore when I was completely immersed in Lara's story and situation and where I found myself with my jaw on the floor or audibly saying exclamations of some sort (or, more frequently, cussing up a storm).  Overall, longtime fans and new fans have a lot to love with Tomb Raider 2013 and I highly recommend it to all gamers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2013"}

I don't just want to reiterate what others have said. I'll do my best to be original. First off, I loved Uncharted 1. It was a great mixture of third person cover shooter and Prince Of Persia style platforming.Along with a great story, it had excellent voice acting and gorgeous graphics that went head to head with the likes of Gears Of War. To say that Uncharted 2 has surpassed it's predecessor is a huge understatement. This game is nothing short of astounding. For the last 3 years Sony has been bragging that their cell processor was more powerful than the Xbox 360's, but it was just \"potential\" power. We never actually saw a game that really fleshed out this claim. Uncharted 2 is that game. The bar has officially been raised. I've had some real seminal moments in gaming. Resident Evil 4, Gears Of War1 & 2, Modern Warfare, and Bioshock (and Uncharted 1) are among some of my favorite games that pushed the envelope in many ways. Uncharted 2 has surpassed them all and then some.The graphics are the best I've ever seen, the gameplay will leave you breathless and the story just soars. The thing that impressed me the most however is that while there are a million things going on onscreen, there was never a hiccup in the frame rate or any slow down whatsoever! It just goes to show you that several cross platform games from a few years back that ran smoother on the 360, were do to developers not knowing how to harness the power of the PS3, period. I have not played multiplayer yet so I cannot comment on it. I beat the game last night and will be starting a new campaign immediately. I own a 360 and a PS3 and all I can say is if you are on the fence about getting PS3 and you can afford it, GET ONE NOW! And get both Uncharted'sThat's it peace.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2009"}

We've waited a long time but it is well worth the wait.With that said, at age 42 - I suck.  But there is something that can be done in a multi-player game that I would like to tell people about.  I do it quite a bit, actually.  Being that I'm terrible and my 13-year-old is quite good, I will play with her but push A and that puts me (the second player) into a bubble.  Yes, it's the same bubble as when one player dies - you have the option of putting yourself in a bubble.  I'll often do it right before plunging to a certain death - POP, push A and I'm in a bubble.  Shake the remote and I'll float over to player 1.  At some of the more difficult areas where the other player might die, that player will \"pop\" me out of my bubble and I'll try to help in the battle.  If the other player dies, I can be there for a second or two until the other player comes back in a bubble and I'll pop that bubble.  In other words, rather than closing the level and making us play the whole dang thing over either from the beginning or from the half-way point flag, we can stay at the same point in the game.A great game.  My only wish is that, like in the DS version, I had the option of using a mushroom or other power-up in the middle of a level rather than having the power-ups like in Super Mario Brothers 3.

{"product_name":"B00GG4BBUM","description":"","reviewerName":"Jeffrey Owens","summary":"A Great Baseball Game, With Little Flaws (8.5 out of 10 on point scale)","reviewText":"I should let the readers of this review know something before getting started: I am not a huge sports fan (in terms of gaming). I never really cared for the Madden franchise (I do plan on trying Madden 25 again, but to be honest that game disappointing me last I played it), I have never played FIFA, NHL, MLB, and 2K franchises, really relying on the NCAA football games for my sports needs in gaming. I am a lover of platformers, of shooters, of RPGs, of all games really, but the one section of gaming I never got too deep into was sports games. Well, I think I might be changing that soon, at least when it comes to the MLB: The Show series.Going into this title, I had no clue how to play a baseball game, and yet this game give much to a beginner to be able to play decently quickly. Batting can be a little tough, but once you get use to the specific styles of pitching and where the batters box is, it gets a little easier. Pitching is fantastic, making me feel like a god on the mound most times. Personally, I loved pitching most of all in this game, but really the game plays extremely well, realistically, and very fun. Overall, the gameplay in this title is solid, fun, and easy to learn, hard to master (which makes for a great challenge).The animations, graphics, and looks in the game are also another huge plus. The game looks fantastic; blades of grass, the individual stadiums, and so on all look amazing. Each player has been modeled almost to a T, looking almost exactly like their real life selves, and they nailed how each pitcher, batter, and player operates when it comes to their personal styles. The uniforms look great, the bats and gloves look detailed, and the attendants in the stadiums are actually quite detailed and look like separate people (most times) from one another, and have fun animations to see.After playing with the Franchise mode and the Road to the Show mode, I can easily say the Road portion of this title is the best of the game. Not only do you create your own character, but you create your ideal perfect player to watch. It is fun, exhillerating, and can be frustrating (in a good way) when trying to make the best of the best possible. The Franchise mode is also quite fun, but it is just like most other sports games I suppose when coming to a Dynasty mode.This game is fantastic and fun, and I personally loved it, but it isn't without flaws.This game has issues with loading times. I mean, the loading times were long enough to where I could go take out the garbage and come back in time to play, or go to the bathroom. They were long (not horribly long, but long enough to be boring and annoying after a point). I often wonder if there could be a means to make the load times better (not so much eliminate them as much as make the time better used), such as possible film of baseball great moments, or video of developers playing the game and kicking butt so to have the players who are waiting able to watch something that should excite them, such as a Grand Slam video clip or a film clip of a pitcher pulling of a no hitter game. These options could be hard to do, and I understand that, I personally wonder if there are means to making the loading times better by not so much eliminating them, but making them more fun or bearable. Overall, the loading times were not horrible, but they were a major factor the the game not being perfect by any means.My one other complaint is the sound. The game sound amazing in game, with the audio and the announcers being solid, the sound effects are fantastic, and really everything in terms of actually playing is awesome. However, the soundtrack is limited, and gets very repetitive. Don't get me wrong, this is a very small portion of the game to really see in-depth, but it is a noticeable annoyance that I wished the creators would have gotten a few more songs to add variety to the soundtrack that was already great, but needed more breathing room in songs. Also, the game could have used more frequent announcer audio of previous games (I would have liked them to happen almost every other song, I liked the audio but I noticed that they started to repeat a lot as well). This is the only other flaw that bugged me, and it is something that I think could be fixed by patches pretty easily.Overall, I loved playing this game, and despite the long loading times and the frequent loading times, along with the lack of tracks and audio in circulation in the game, this game is a very solid game to play and very enjoyable. I recommend playing this if you are either a baseball fan or interested in trying a sports title that is fun and easy to get into.

{"product_name":"B00004SVS7","description":"GAME CARTRIDGE CLEAN WITH CASE, NO ORIGINAL INSTRUCTIONS. [A FUN GAME]","reviewerName":"Axel Law \"The Happy Seizure Kid\"","summary":"Mega Man's final adventure on the NES...","reviewText":"Near the end of the NES's reign, Capcom rush-released Mega Man's 6th adventure, which involved a mysterious (actually, NOT-SO, judging by the appearance of the character) businessman that steals the national tournament's champions (a.k.a. the robotmasters) and uses them to take over the world. Mega Man naturally speeds to the rescue, but what may sound like an awesome game turned out to be a mere effort, unfortunately. Read on to see why Mega Man's last adventure on NES was not a &quot;one shot at glory&quot;:THE GOODWe get two new Rush adaptors (Power and Jet) that kick major arse. You'll find that using them is ten times more fun than using the acquired boss weapons! The music is also thankfully better (although it DOESN'T TOUCH the first four... get to that in THE BAD) and we get more robotmasters and more Wily stages to bash through. Some of the robotmasters are quite unique, especially Tomahawkman and Yamatoman.THE BADThe storyline is TOO similar to Mega Man 4's, and this game pulls it off to a lesser extent. The &quot;Mr. X&quot; disguise didn't fool me at all. While the music was definitely better than the 5th game's, a lot of it is really odd; it just didn't sound like Mega Man. The graphics were also a letdown from 5's parallax graphics, and even some of the sprites (ex.: Mega Man climbing up looks really funky) look rather static. It's clear that this is the last NES game released (to my knowledge), but I think Capcom could've done better. Another aspect of the game that really bothered me was the simplicity of the stages (and the game's insanely easy difficulty).OVERALLI really am mixed about this game. For the longest time, I really liked this one over 5 because it seemed to be more fun. Now, after judging the two games from today's standpoint, I liked 5 better overall because it was harder, the gameplay was a bit smoother (not to mention Beat was ten times better), and the storyline is among the best in the series. This game has great ideas like the Rush adaptors, the Energy Equalizer (I think that's what it's called), better music, and interesting bosses. So basically, if you mashed the two together, you'd get all the Mega Man qualities. Seriously, though, I think Capcom really rushed this one and it shows... And, so, with strenous decision-making, I'd have to say that 5 is better by a notch. Oh man, this game comes SOOOO close. With that said, this is still a decent game, but I ONLY recommend it to Mega Man fans.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2003"}

This game has to be one of the most beautiful, well developed and nicely written games I have seen in a long time.  In fact, it is so well developed, you have the option to install HD textures prior to playing the game for enhanced game play.  When the cut scenes come on, the characters dialogue is fantastic and well written.  The game even allows for significant customization of your agent.Unfortunately, among all of these things, unless you are a fan of the series, you probably aren't going to like this game.  I am a pretty avid and experienced gamer.  I have even appreciated some of the games in the Splinter Cell series.  But what this games makes up for in beauty and style, it loses in difficulty.  The game is just too hard.  I played at the medium difficulty and could not get through three missions.  Each mission, I would spend hours attempting to memorize a level and each of the AI's habits and \"rules\" just to get past them.  It would takes dozens of attempts to make it through a level.  You make one small error, not because you did something stupid, but because you miscalculated how far the AI can see or how dark it is, and you have to restart.  The game truly is draconian...and, ultimately, the game play does not feel rewarding.While experienced Splinter Cell fans or those with a lot of time on their hands may enjoy this, I personally wouldn't recommend this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2013"}

Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"Lightning Returns FFXIII:  Another missed opportunity","reviewText":"The entirity of the Final Fantasy XIII series (XIII, XIII-X2 and now Lightning Returns) will ultimately be seen as having some great ideas mixed with infruriating and head scratching decisions in execution.FFXIII had a deep (some would say, convulted) story with interesting plots, however the decision on linearity (i.e. forcing the player for TWENTY HOURS to follow one path before opening up) turned off many players before they could truly enjoy the game.FFXIII-X2 made the story even MORE convulted, if that was even possible, but refined the battle system and added in some Pokemon elements (i.e. monsters to fill the 3rd spot) and some more frustrating ones (i.e. The Hands of Time).  The overreaction to make the WHOLE game open-ended let to an equally frustrating problem, and that was when do I close a gate?  Open one?  Where do I go next?And so, now comples the closure of the trilogy with Lightning Returns: FFXIII.  First, let's talk about the good:- The deepest customization in the series.  With only focusing on Lightning, you choose different pieces of garb/outfits, weapons, shields, etc. to make the ultimate fighter.  You'll be tinkering with everything that you pick up and your schimata to make the most lethal combinations.- Combat is also the most free-flowing in the series.  You always had that \"pause\" in FFXIII and FFXIII-X2 when switching between Paradigms, none of that here, when you've depleted the AP of one outfit, a quick L1 or R1 puts you to the next one with no interruption, and the ones in the background recharge.  It's a full realization of how great the new ATB could be in the next generation.  Imagine if FFXIII and X-2 had kept it simple and only allowed 3 Paradigms at one time, and developed the same manner of switching.  Those games would have been infinitely more playable.- Debatable to be sure, but the sound/music is again a triumph for the series IMHO.  Now, of course I'm partial to tunes in FFIV, FFVI and FFVII, but there's a lot to love here.And now...the not so good:- Character development.  Which should really read \"WHAT character development???\".  In 500 years, you would think things would change.  Experiences, memories, etc.  Yet you still have Snow whining about Serah. It's been FIVE HUNDRED YEARS dude.  Don't you think it's time to move on?  And Hope somehow went from young (FFXIII) to adult (FFXIII-X2) back to young again in this game; apparently, there was a fountain of youth between Vahalla and the new location.  The deepness of Sazh that we say in the first two games is gone.  Basically, every major player who makes a cameo in Lightining Returns that was in the first 2 games is a shell of their former selves.  It just smacks me as lazy and a mailing in of a game.- The clock.  Yes, for dramatic tension (as Mr. Torgue would say), but for most it will just come off as a gimmick and really annoying.  You lose AN HOUR if you retreat in battle.  You cannot see all the side quests in one playthrough, no matter how skilled a player you are.  So while we have a more open world now, it's an illusion.  If you don't have everything done when the clock strikes zero, you're whisked to the final battle.  So, as a tip, SAVE OFTEN.  This way you won't have to restart from the beginning and you can go down two or three different paths to see all the side quests.- Leveling up is now done...through the quests!  This isn't the standard \"kill guys, get XP, level up\" process.  Now, you might say that's a neat, new, novel concept.  However, after the upteenth fetch quest you end up going on, you'll learn to hate this design decision.At the end of the day, I would NOT recommend purchasing this game at full price.  For all the good (some of the best combat, and as good a system as FFIV or FFVI, it does NOT discount all the cons, namely the fetch questing, uneven pacing, lazy story and the constant countdown.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2014"}

I realize it's a long game, so maybe the outstanding game that some others have been mentioning has yet to show itself, but I think by 20 or so hours into a game like this, I should be more impressed. I've played tons of games in all genres, and I enjoy games. So, I'm not inexperienced. I'm not a big Zelda fan either. I briefly played the SNES version and thought it was ok, and now almost 20 years later, I decided to give another Zelda a chance with this one. My biggest complaint is the lack of creativity, and risk-taking in the graphics and gameplay. The creator was most definitly Japanese, as I see the influence. I also see laziness in this game. The story is imaginative enough though. I hope this is the only Zelda title lacking luster, because if they are all like Twilight Princess, my initial instincts that made me not a fan back in the day were correct.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2012"}

I'll just bring up the points I think make this game very good, and the ones that made it very bad.Bad:The hit detection on sniper rifles is downright horrible.  With the Dragunov I can regularly settle the chevron reticle on a stationary character, fire, and hit absolutely nothing.  Sometimes twice in a row.  It's embarrassing.  The L96A1 seems to work better, but if you scope in, quickly track a target perfectly, settle your breathing, and fire--even if your cross hairs were perfectly centered--the game might just ignore it.  Treyarch, if you're reading this: FIX IT.  If I aim at someone and shoot, I expect the bullet to hit, not veer off to the side for no reason.  That's idiotic.  The generally cluttered maps also make it harder to effectively use the sniper rifles, considering one can just use an assault rifle in bursts to much the same effect, and be perfectly suited to close quarters as well.However the teams are set up, it's horribly unbalanced.  I always seem to be in games where either my team is completely destroying the other, or the other team is completely destroying mine.  Close games?  Ha!  Everyone fighting their hardest to keep themselves and their team-mates going to achieve victory?  No.  More like, one team gets a lead and camps out over the map and picks off anyone that runs by until the score limit is reached.Those RC-XD remote control cars with explosives are EVERYWHERE, always.  Sniping on a cliff?  There's one behind you.  About to take a position?  One in front.  How about tucked away in a corner at the edge of the map, laying prone to take a bite of sandwich?  Yeah, it's there, too.Good:All the reasons for \"boosting\" in Modern Warfare 2 or playing cheaply and most of the ability to do it have been eliminated.  Since gun customization is largely based on what you want rather than \"Get 150 head shots for this camo!\" you can spiff up your favorite firearm to your liking, and take down the enemies with it.  I especially like my Ice-camo Enfield with my waving Kirby emblem.  Spamming of explosives has been severely cut down with the loss of One Man Army and Danger Close.  Basically it's just a lot less cheap.The single-player campaign is pretty dynamic.  Missions are varied, action is fast and exciting.  Storyline is a lot more aggressive and feels more involving.  Rather than slide transitions with voice-overs to go from mission-to-mission ala MW2, you're much better set up to why and how the next mission is happening.  However as reviewers have mentioned: your team mates are idiots, and the enemies seem to have instant, perfect aim from any given distance.  Honestly, you can be lining up a sniper rifle on someone many yards away and they'll make solid hits on you with a pistol.Additions like the Crossbow, Ballistic Knife, and Tomahawk are fun to play with when you get sick of blasting away all the time.  Though to be fair, the Tomahawk is just a re-skinned Throwing Knife.All in all, I really see Black Ops as just a less cheap version of MW2 with different equipment and a better story.  But that's fine.  I played that game for an obscene amount of hours.One final note to parents considering buying this game for their kids this Christmas: you probably shouldn't.  There are a few quite graphic acts of violence throughout the single player campaign.  One notable incident is of the player character sawing through the neck of a Viet Cong soldier with the serrated back of a combat knife.  I know Vietnam was supposed to be an especially grim, unforgiving, and tragic war--and that act (along with the general feel of the Vietnam missions)--sets that up well, but it's not for kids.  Seriously, there's an MA rating on the box for a reason.  It's for mature gamers.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2010"}
