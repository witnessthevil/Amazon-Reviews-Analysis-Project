{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"Parrish C. Moore \"RvngoftheNERD\"","summary":"Rockstar does it again.... In a innovative way.","reviewText":"First off... LA Noire is NOT a clone of GTA 4 nor Red Dead Redemption. Yes it is an open world game but it has its limits. You can not recklessly do things the way you would in other Rockstar games. Younger people may not appreciate this games worth. You are a cop and things should be the way they are in this story.Controls-Some of the primary features from the other games are here. The 3rd person view, open world but the controls are slightly different. Nothing impossible to get used to though. The car controls are very sensitive. The car moves on the slightest touch of the analog stick, your car will move a little more than you may have wanted it to. (UPDATE- After playing some more, I was able to experience more vehicles. Not all of the cars are as sensitive to steering as the one you start off with. Which I think makes the game better as the cars have diversity as they would in reality.) During the interrogations the it's mainly just button prompts. All in all the controls work fine.Gameplay-As far as gameplay goes. This isn't really action driven and it shouldn't be. In order to solve cases, you have to interrogate and search for clues. The authenticity of those activities is amazing. There are shootouts and sometimes you may have to make the tough decision shoot someone but it does a great job of making you feel as you have to deal with that decision. They go a long way trying to make it as authentic as possible even making a black and white mode.Sound-I'm only 22 so I wouldn't know how 40's music was, lol. But from what I've heard in movies and older tv shows. It seems very authentic and gives you the vibe of watching a movie set in the 40's. And the voice over work is very good with some great actors. It's only complimented with the new technology Rockstar has used to portray the expressions and moods of the characters in the game.I don't want to make this review really long so I'll end on this note. LA Noire is not going to be for everyone. It's not heavy on action. I can almost compare this game to Heavy Rain. At time it feels as if you a playing a interactive movie. A really great one at that. Here you will be rewarded with a great game, story, cases and re playability when you want to try to do things right.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001IK1BJ0","reviewerName":"Aaron \"Pwnerer\"","summary":"One of, if not THE best RPG out. Period.","reviewText":"Dragon Age: Origins was always one of those games I overlooked on the store shelves for months. Always assuming I'd just despise it because I despised Mass Effect.Well, I had some money left on a debit card and thought \"what the heck\" for only 13 bucks..The game arrived about 2 days ago and I'm highly addicted and slapping myself silly for not buying it several months ago. This may very well be the best RPG I have ever played, mixing elements of several different rpg genre's, like dungeon crawlers for example, or even tactical rpgs and yes, Oblivion.However with that said this game very much stands apart from the crowd with superior gameplay as a whole, so don't get me wrong!The world is beautiful, and sprawling. While not as huge as Oblivions or Fallout 3's, it is of nice size! You don't travel anywhere you want via sandbox style world though, instead you're offered a map of the world and can pinpoint where you wish to travel, from town to town, dungeon to dungeon, etc.Combat is amazing. If you're a very involved and tactical player you can use the pause menu to lay out battle commands, queue potions, spells, etc. You can also take control of each person on your team on the fly, and use their abilities as you see fit. Furthermore you can customize how each member of your team acts when controlled by AI. For example, you can set your healer to automatically cast heal when an ally drops below 50% hp. Very very nice!As far as Dungeon Crawling elements go, there are a TON of chests to be found, drawers to be opened, closets to be opened, and corpses to be looted. You can find rare weapons, armors, trinkets, etc, and of course standard gear as well. And yes, potions, and professions materials can be found as well.Character customization is done extremely well. You can change every aspect of your character from the beginning. Hair, eyes, lips, nose, makeup, I mean everything. Also once you begin your journey your look changes depending on what you wear, which I love.Characters also develop quite nicely in terms of skills and ability. You have very nicely structured skill/spell trees that you can develop as you see fit. For example, a mage may choose between a fire tree, or maybe an earth tree? you want to cast earthquakes or fireballs? and it's a lot deeper than I can even give it credit for being. You have a LOT of skill/spell options, as well as passive abilities, professions to choose from, like trap making, or herbalism? it's amazing.The story draws elements from the standard RPG save the world from evil storyline, but it's set apart by EXTREMELY well written dialogue and personal choices that effect the story deeply in some cases. It also has very nice plot shifts, and a TON of side quests that in most cases, further or add to the story on the whole. And make no mistake about it, the character development is done SO WELL in-tune with the story, that you WILL care deeply about the characters in this game!Now in my opinion, the overall game score is laid out as follows:Graphics = 7. Not as good as say, Oblivion, despite being a newer game.Sound = 9. The music is beautiful, and my only gripe is some of the combat music can become tedious.Overall Depth = 10. The game play, options, story, everything is absolutely wonderful!This game is a MUST buy for ANY fan of RPG's, period. You are MISSING out on a GEM of a game, and a almost perfect gaming experience!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2011"}

This particular iteration is a little more of the same, but definitely adds the most content between games. If you've played City Folk or Wild World, the gameplay isn't revolutionary. There are plenty of additions, but the core gameplay still remains the same. The methods of making money are the basically the exact same than the previous versions. I'd say this game is a borderline purchase if you've had Wild World or City Folk. For me personally, while the additions are nice, it wasn't enough to feel fresh and restore that addictive factor.On the other hand, if you haven't played an Animal Crossing game or haven't played one since the original Animal Crossing on Gamecube, then BUY THIS GAME.

{"product_name":"B00000DMAX","description":"Mario Kart 64, one of the first games released for the Nintendo 64  platform, is an updated translation of the very popularSuper Mario Kartfor the  Super NES (SNES). And while the game clearly takes full advantage of the graphics  power and speed of the N64, a few components that made the original so compelling  have been left out of this release.Still, Nintendo's expertise at sucking players into the game world is strongly evident, andMario Kart 64offers enough challenges to keep players (especially casual  gamers) entertained. Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a  sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race  computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks.  Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting  power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels.  Grabbing and using on-track items is the heart of the game's fun: a strategically-placed  banana peel sends the unlucky victim into a spin, nailing an opponent with a turtle shell  launches their vehicle skyward, and a rocket provides a quick boost to near-breakneck  speeds, if only for a moment.The multiplayer mode provides enormously chaotic fun for up to four players--flip it on  at a party and watch the guests congregate around the screen.--Eric TwelkerPros:Well-designed tracksSimple controlsStrong multiplayer appealCons:Computerized opponents sometimes pull off questionable feats","reviewerName":"Hannibal","summary":"Neat N64 game!","reviewText":"Graphics: 9/10 - Eye-catching, bold and pretty, Mario Kart 64's graphics are fulfilling and nice to look at.Sound: 8/10 - Lots of bells, whistles, engines and da-da's in this game.

It can also be very strategic at times, which is good for a racing car game.Overall: 8/10 - Nothing too memorable, but it's delightfully entertaining to play when you are actually using the controls. Mario Kart 64 gives you things to do and stuff to work out. It's the first game I played on Nintendo 64 and as far as I'm concerned, it's well worth the time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2001"}
{"product_name":"B00006LEMX","description":"Looking for a new obsession to keep you up nights? Let me introduce you to Hotsuma, the main character inShinobi, the much anticipated new action-adventure game from Sega. Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics. The anime-style cutscenes woven around the slice-and-dice sequences provide an interesting story, but one that doesn't relate very directly with your job on the streets of postapocalyptic Tokyo. Your moves are cool though--spinning in midair to collect coins that will unlock secret levels, killing three ninjas with a flash of Akujiki, zipping around so fast that a shadow of your ghost remains. It's easy to get caught up in the exhilarating energy of the game. Serious gamers will enjoy confronting bosses, who may take several frustrating tries to kill. But when you finally defeat them, you will feel the power of centuries of samurai.--Maile BohlmannPros:Fantastic graphicsExcellent scripting and voicingFairly easy controls and maneuvers at outsetExciting fighting sequences with intense gameplayCons:Killing early bosses can be unusually difficultLong sequences with no save pointsStoryline frames fighting sequences, rather than interacting with them","reviewerName":"Sigmund Freud","summary":"A frantic kill or be killed hack n slash","reviewText":"Shinobi is a game that takes what you know about ninjas(hiding in the dark, assassinating feudal lords and what have you and throws it out the window. This ninja game is similar to the now well known \"Ninja Gaiden\" series but complete action is the only similarities. In Shinobi you play as a super ninja who seeks vengeance on a evil sorcerer that has cursed his clan into being mindless puppets all in while saving Tokyo from impending doom.The game's levels are in stages like A-1,B-2 etc usually the stage ends in the third 3rd act of each stage, in which the final stage has a boss character you must battle.The game constantly thrusts you into killing enemies as your blade is cursed and must feed on enemies souls or it will instead drain you of your health. This where the difficulty of the game comes from as your constantly speeding to the next batch of enemies and that is what most of the game boils down to, its not a bad thing as Shinobi originated on the arcades so it makes sense to keep the game simple.There is no in depth combo list for your weapon which is the cursed sword and you get about 3 special ninja magic that's it, the key gameplay in the game is stringing kills together in order to get a better rating at the end of the stage. This could be a good incentive to keep playing as you unlock special characters.All in all Shinobi is a great action game and is and was a challenging game involving ninjas before \"Ninja Gaiden\"","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2010"}

I think I waited like 2-3 weeks after it came out and got it for 50% less than it was when it came out. I actually, I only winded up paying 10 bucks after using my Amazon reward points towards the purchase, and I'm glad I did.This game is lame!!The game play is that of a hack n slash, which I am a huge fan of God of War and Dante's Inferno, so that is fine with me. But a game that is a hack n slash I feel needs a good story line to balance the game out. But this game is a hack n slash with almost no story line. The cat will pop up once in a while but most of the time I can't even hear what he's saying and it's usually not even intriguing.The camera angles during battle are whacky along with the enemies. They aren't hard to defeat per say. It's the camera angles that make them hard to defeat. And some of them are plentiful and annoying. I hate mosquitoes in real life, but this game's mosquito characters are the worst! It's hard to see them and lock on them.The game is also full of glitches! It gets very jerky at some points and it even completely froze my system at one point.The storyline is lame and the memory collecting is also lame. I find myself collecting them but I stopped listening to them because they are very boring and don't seem to support you moving through any type of interesting storyline.Also, the on screen messages are quite annoying. They come up at very weird times. Some enemies will seem to have no indication on how to beat them when they 1st present themselves, and then after fighting the 5th one the game will give you a clue on how to beat them. It seems kind of pointless after you already defeated several of them.The music is terrible as well. I could have, without a doubt, made a better soundtrack on a cheap Casio keyboard with missing keys, wearing a blindfold with 8 finger splints, stage 4 arthritis, and immediately after having a carpel tunnel injection into the center of both hands.The idea they went for with this game was great, but they just didn't do it right.The graphics I feel could have been worlds better. Almost looks like a PS2 game. I think if the graphics were amazingly beautiful and the worlds were better designed this game would have keep me playing. I hate not finishing games, but I made it to chapter 2 and can not go any further because the game is completely boring to me. Like I said, its a hack n slash with no story line to keep you going. So basically you are just smashing buttons and being annoyed by glitches and camera angels while listening to a soundtrack not worthy of Alice, fighting off very annoying enemies and occasionally getting stuck on parts where its not clear where to go or what to do.Also, I should mention, dying can be annoying as well. There was this one part I kept dying and it brings you back to the games save point. But it didn't seem to remember that before I got to that part I upgraded my weapons. So every time I died I had to restart where I was and upgrade my weapon again. And sometimes the game will bring you back VERY far when you die. I died on this one part and had to redo this whole 10 minute sequence over. It wasn't a hard part. It was just a long part. I winded up falling into a pit because I couldn't judge a jump correctly based off the camera angle (happened often in this game).I bought this game based off the ratings I seen on Amazon, the price, the trailer videos, and also with the notion that anything that is Alice in Wonderland has to be good. I did not, however, enjoy this game.'I'm sorry they had to do you so very wrong Alice'","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2011"}

A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Players will enter this new environment and follow the exploits of their own customized snow pirate on their quest to seize control of the changing planet.GameplayLost Planet 2, like the original game in the series, is a third-person shooter featuring huge boss battles, challenging terrain and the ability to pop in and out of battle mechs, known in-game as Vital Suits. The primary difference in gameplay this time around hinges on the inclusion of RPG gameplay elements. Players can now customize many of the aspects of their playable snow pirate, including his physical attributes, clothing and to a certain extent, weaponry and gestures. Players will control these customized heroes across 6 interconnected episodes, creating a truly unique and interactive experience that changes depending upon the actions of the players involved.

Created by famed game designer Peter Molyneux, Fable 2 for Xbox 360 features an epic story that picks up 500 years after the first game. It offers an open world environment giving players a massive amount of freedom to explore and play as they please, with every decision made contributing to the game itself..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Fable 2Players:Offline: 1-2Online: 2Gameplay Modes:Single player, offline cooperative multiplayer, online cooperative multiplayer.The new combat system lets you master different fighting styles.View larger.You are free to roam the world of Albion any way you like.View larger.Every Choice Has Its ConsequencesFable 2 provides players with a truly immersive experience where a virtually limitless number of choices can be made, all of which have their own consequences, making each game unique. When you start the game, you choose either to play the role of a boy or girl, and depending on your choices, the hero will grow up to be tall or short, good or evil. Players can get married and have children; female player characters will become pregnant, which will then be reflected by their physical appearance.Early in the game, players are presented with a stray dog for a best friend, who will need to be fed and loved, and will accompany the player throughout his or her life. Depending on the player, the dog will change appearance and assist him or her in various ways, such as alerting of impending dangers and attacking enemies.Players inhabit the world of Albion and are free to roam the land to as they please. Players can use different expressions to communicate with others, such as taunting and laughing, and even belching or farting.As the players grow, so does Albion, reflecting the choices that were made earlier in the game. Every house, hut, castle, and dungeon can be purchased if the player wishes. Players can buy up all the land in a town and can become mayor, king, and even emperor of the entire land.Fable 2 presents a dynamic and free-roaming world that doesn't demand a player to take any one set path. At the same time, players seeking a plot line will find an epic story and quest that they can follow if they wish, along with many side adventures.Fight Using Different Weapons and MagicFable 2 introduces a new combat system that allows for mastery of hand weapons, such as swords, long range weapons such as cross-bows and guns, and, of course, magic. Players improve at each discipline with time, and can combine different combat styles when they fight. Other advanced design features include tactical positional advantages that can bring new strategic elements into combat.Bring Other Players into Your WorldFable 2 has a multiplayer mode that allows you to bring other players into your own world. Consistent with the rest of the game, the actions of these other players can be permanent and affect your world. You can explore and fight together with these other players, share treasures, and even fight each other.Note:Fable 2 will not ship with Online Co-op mode. An update with this functionality is rumored to be released shortly after the launch of the game.Xbox LIVE Arcade Mini-GamesGamers can play minigames through Xbox LIVE Arcade and earn currency that can be used in Fable 2 to purchase weapons, armor, and other items for the hero.Fable 2 is rated M for having mature content that may be suitable for persons ages 17 and older.Depending on your choices, the protagonist can turn out wildly different -- male, female, good, evil, and more.","reviewerName":"Benjamin S. Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"Wonderful but yes, it is flawed (some spoilers)","reviewText":"\"Hopefully a more thoughtful review discussing the good, the bad, and the ugly in Fable 2.\"Have you ever just got a new system and were blown away by the first game you got for it? In many ways that was my situation with Fable 2. I was even wowed by the little things such as the detail in the leafs. However when I read my first review it seemed biased. Sure I was wowed by Fable 2 and yes, it still is a great game. However having spent time in retrospect I do have to take some things into consideration which I did not before.The first is Fable 2's controls are great. Being able to fluidly switch between melee weapons, guns, or spells on the fly makes the combat fun and a seamless experience. Even if you are someone who normally detests RPGs for their slower pace would be hard pressed not to get into Fable 2's quick real-time action fights.For gamers that missed Fable 1 many more expressions and actions are added to your socializing wheel than in the first game. The more you play the more articulate and expressive you become so even if you were not able to impress the bloke or lass you had a fancy for earlier on you can come back later and likely achieve the desired effect.If you want open ended options Fable 2 does throw some nice additions into the works. You can get married and even have children. As time goes on you can also buy up lands and stores which will bring you a steady income. Though it may be hard to see at first Fable 2 has a life simulation aspect that cleverly hides amidst all your treasure hunting and monster slaying. Fortunately if you have no desire to sire children or have a spouse you are never once forced to partake in these activities. Like almost anything else in the realm of Albion it is optional.Want to play the game as either an evil knave or spotless hero? Fret not. That is the whole premise of Fable 2 and chances are your character is not going to be identical to the one of your friend. Focusing on magic gives you glowing veins, eating certain foods makes you thin or fat, and you can change your hair and get tattoos. Your virtuous and foul deeds also take a toll on your physique and alter you over time.You are also accompanied by a faithful canine companion that helps in finding treasure and fighting games. Treating your dog kindly or cruel does effect his behavior and appearance. Furthermore do not expect teaching your pooch to be easy. Though you may see it as harsh punishing your dog is good in certain situations as is playing with him or rewarding him with treats. Being too lenient can endanger your pet just as much as being mean to him. As in all things balance and moderation is key.Teaching your dog new tricks is as simple as finding tomes filled with knowledge. \"Dog related books\" will boost his combat skill, awareness, trick repertoire, and ability to dig up better items.The last big thumbs up I'll mention is you can be male or female. At least that opens a door to girl gamers that was previously closed.With all this you may think I'm saying the game can do no wrong. However now we come to the things that are suffice it to say not so pleasant about this over hyped game.My first qualm is though it seems like your decisions shape your world near the beginning of the game as you reach its' climax your choices narrow. Good or evil you are still out to stop the man who wronged you and your sister. Good or evil you are presented with the same options in the ending. You can continue the game filthy rich, continue the game by saving all those that fell to the corruption of the head bad guy, or rather sacrifice your family. In one of these choices you lose your mutt because yes, he counts as your family too.Now I know some of you are thinking I spoiled the ending for you. But that's the rub. There is no actual ending. You do not see what happens to Albion if you triumph as a villain or as a saintly knight. Either path you choose Teresa gets the spire and you get the shaft. The game continues on in its' monotony and though you are made aware your sister is alive if you choose to save your family there does not seem to be a way to be reunited with her.My second gripe is many of the quests you do are repetitive. You can save the slaves or capture people to be made into slaves. You can assassinate villagers, sacrifice innocents to the temple of darkness, make a donation to the temple of light, or help everyone you happen across. Sometimes you may even be asked to clear an area of monsters. While this is fun near the beginning after you've done each of these quests 10 times over the nostalgic sheen dulls considerably.Third we come to the creature selection. While you may expect a variety of neat beasties they are limited. Bandits, hobs, balvorines, undead, trolls, giant bugs, and banshees cover every thing in Albion's glossary of gloom. It is true there are a few variations among each opponent type but the game is so long you'll get tired of your antagonists quickly yearning for something more unexpected such as the Kraken in lost chapters. The \"boss fights\" are so non eventful chances are you will not even see them as boss fights.The next quarrel I have with Fable 2 is some areas seem incomplete. For example you come across an orphanage that has no use and later on while swimming around you see places you should be able to eventually get to on the horizon yet you never do.Lastly though the socializing system seems fun at first you quickly begin realizing the people you interact with are missing a certain endearing quality. Perhaps its' simply that everything you use to interact with them is a gesture or attempt to entertain them. You never have villagers that stand out or provide you with more interesting conversations. Pretty much they all will like some things you do but disdain other things you do. However even if you make someone mad one of their favorite gestures will have them praising you in no time.Sometimes its' good to make things just a bit linear. For example in Persona 4 most of your relationships lead up to one or two conclusions. Yet each conversation you have with those characters delves into their hopes, desires, aspirations, and fears. They actually \"talk to you\" like a real person and you immediatly feel attached to them.Fable 2 by comparison uses the same villager skins many times over and though everyone may have slightly unique traits this is buried by their repetitive responses and similar mannerisms. For example you can marry two wives that look and act so similar the only way to tell the difference between them is by their name and what gifts they enjoy.So IS Fable 2 a good game? By all means \"yes\" it is. While I do not agree over it getting \"Game of the year\" from G4 TV I admit Adam Sessler made valid points in his blog on why they came to that conclusion. In the end \"Game of the year\" is simply another opinion. I do not hate any other reviewer for having a different view-point than myself. There is enough immaturity online as it is without fan-babies firing off insults left and right.If you are tired of J-RPG fever and want a game that is easy to jump into, fluid, fun, and you have a lot of time to kill Fable 2 is still a highly recommended purchase or rental. While it may not be \"perfect\" it is still addictive and engrossing on its' own merits!Pros+Silky smooth easy to learn controls+Added canine companion who really is useful.+The social wheel is more complex and you pick up more expressions as the game continues.+Albion is MUCH bigger this time around!+Some choices do indeed drastically change the world around you.+ Art direction, music, and visuals are all breath taking to behold.Cons- Towards the end good or evil you are given the same choice which yields the same repercussions.-Villager types and enemy types are lack luster and repetitive save for a few exceptions here and there between long stretches of playing.-The socializing system while adequate is somewhat detached and both adults and children seem to respond to your gestures in the same boring ways over and over again.-Certain areas seem incomplete.-There is no actual endings to further the story-line-Certain jobs get quite tedious especially if you do them in tedium for many hours. I suggest buying shops and land so you'll have to work less often.-Quests get more and more similar.-Some glitches and freezing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2008"}

As such, I enjoyed DS2 as well. However, there are some aspects of this game that I didn't like too much. The save game system is odd. You can save everywhere, but it only saves what you have and what you have accomplished, not where you are. So when you re-load, you are always back to one of the 3 towns. This actually works better than one would think as it moves the game away from constant quick-saves and quick-loads. However, it does NOT work well whenever you die near a boss-battle, since you basically have to run back naked to get your gear. Not fun at all.Another aspect I didn't like is the map. DS1 had a great map, while in DS2, I constantly was lost. Back-tracking to complete secondary quests is a major PITA for that reason. Makes me wonder what they were thinking.Similarly, I didn't like the quest-log interface. I do not like seeing ahead of time how many quests there are. Neither do I appreciate the whole setup of the non-resizable log-screen that is just plain hard to read.One of the oddest things is the difficulty level. You can only play at lowest difficulty until you played through the whole game. Once you are all the way through, you can re-play the game at a higher difficulty level and with more party members. Hu?!? WTF?Oh, and btw: Your party now has a maximum of 3 members plus a pet that acts as a limited additional member. I liked the larger parties from DS1 MUCH better. Also, it was much easier to manage your party. I really do not appreciate this kind of dumbed-down gameplay.Nevertheless, I had fun with this game. If you liked DS1 a lot, then you will still have fun with DS2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2006"}

I thought it was fantastic. Guitar Hero II is even better! Great songs, great gameplay, quite addictive. A must buy :)So first, how this game works. You have a special controller that looks like a guitar. If you have one from Guitar Hero (I), it will work so you won't have to buy another one. You get 5 buttons on the fret (the thin part on the left) and then a \"push\" toggle in the center of the guitar. So you're hammering down strings on the fretboard by pressing colored buttons, and you're \"strumming\" by pushing down on the toggle in the guitar's center. It's actually quite fun, although \"real\" guitar players have a fit because the notes are of course not in the right place and when they try to really play the song, it doesn't work properly.But back to our fun air guitar playing :) They have a fantastic blend of songs on this. The intriguing part of any music game is finding songs that every single person likes. I imagine it's impossible. There are songs on here that I dislike that I'm sure other people love. Then again they have \"Surrender\" and \"Message in a Bottle\" which I find amazingly fun to play, which I'm sure some people hate with a passion. Hopefully there's a middle ground here!The game moves you from club to club, and you have to pass 3 out of 4 songs at each club to move along. You go through some classic locations like the Rat Celler in Boston. You get to choose your character from a number of pre-sets (both male and female, hurrah!!) and even choose your guitar. The songs get trickier as you progress.When you unlock songs in career mode you can then play them whenever you want in the casual playing mode both for one or two players. It's great fun to rock out with a friend with the music blasting!Then there's always going back to get perfect scores - and increasing the difficulty to get to special songs that the Easy People can't see.The graphics are pretty good - but really, when your fingers are flying and you're trying to push the buttons in super-fast-time (that's a musical term), how can you possibly even see what those on screen characters are doing in the background? That's more to entertain whoever is watching you. Still, I like that the audience waves lighters during the quiet parts of songs :)If I have a complaint, it's the same complaint I had with the first one - that sometimes their prompts show up OVER THE FRET BOARD so you can't see what the upcoming notes are! Surely some of the testers must have realized this - or were the testers all so glazed at that point that they knew the songs by heart and weren't having to look at the screen?Still, it's a minor issue. Definitely a game to get, that is great fun for anybody who loves rock music!Here are the songs you begin with, to whet your appetite!Shout at the Devil / Mother / Surrender / Woman / Strutter / Heart-Shaped Box / Message in a Bottle / You Really Got Me / Monkey Wrench / Them Bones / Search and Destroy / Tattooed Love Boys / Cherry Pie / Who Was In My Room Last Night? / Girlfriend / Can't You Hear Me Knockin'","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2006"}

This is the Wii turned Super Saiyan. Not only are your Wii games and peripherals compatible with this console, but Wii games are also up-scaled in HD (making them look a lot better), and Wii peripherals also work with Wii U games.Nintendo's games look incredible in HD (if NSMBU is any indication) and will only get better. Some games from 3rd party developers have issues such as frame-drops, but that's their fault. They don't understand this technologically advanced console. Nintendo is always innovating; this console only runs on 33-watts of power when playing NSMBU. That's a fraction of what any other gaming console uses. Another innovation is the latency-free wireless, built-in screen on the game-pad. Although it's somewhat disappointing due to the low resolution and somewhat choppy picture quality, it's still quite nice, and I'd say the positive points outweigh the negative. I wouldn't recommend using it as your primary screen, though.Also introduced with this console is Nintendo Network, which is just like PSN, but for Nintendo. I will say this now; you should get this console sooner than later because it's the only way to make an NNID, so early adopters were given first choice for usernames. If you care for it, you may want to keep in mind that this account system will be standardized for future Nintendo consoles. (The 3DS will get this at sometime in the future, though, so if you don't intend to get a Wii U you'll want to turn there.)The console itself is aesthetically pleasing and well-built. Same goes for the game-pad. The plastic doesn't feel cheap and the screen is quite scratch resistant. I'm only disappointed by the analog sticks; they don't handle nearly as well as the PS3's dual-shock controller's. Although those were prone to wearing out easily - hopefully Nintendo made these to last.All in all, I'm very satisfied with the Nintendo Wii U.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0037LTTRO","description":"","reviewerName":"pennywyze","summary":"Not bad; but it's not good either.","reviewText":"I recently purchased Ghost Recon Future soldier after holding off so long; and I have to say, I'm glad I didn't purchase this game full price.Onto the review-Graphics-This may have been one of the worst parts about this game. While I can still play GRAW2 and still be impressed by the graphics, GRFS does not hold up much at all. The game has intense glare that hurts my eyes, some of the textures are muddy looking and the background details are mediocre at best. One thing I did like was how the in-game characters looked. I felt they were highly detailed and moved smoothly and throughout the course of the game, there are some moments in which the game does look good. (For example, the sandstorm level looked really good) The explosions are slightly dumbed down from the previous Ghost Recon titles; but they're not bad.My main complaint would be the glare in some bright backgrounds such as the white sands in Nigeria which are so bright that I have to finely tune my TV's contrast as to not hurt my eyes. Also, there are certain quirks with the physics like killing an enemy and watching them float in mid air.The good parts again would be the characters themselves and certain effects such as explosions, the water and the camo effect was alright. Nothing too special; but nothing really bad either. It looks about average to be honest.Sound-In comparison to the past GR titles, the sound in this really stinks. Some of the dialogue is really off. At times, I'd hear my team mate say &#34;3 o' clock&#34; only to turn that way or study the area and the enemy is in a different position altogether. The gun sound effects are just alright. But sound no different than the generic COD FX you'd hear quite often.Gameplay-This aspect was also quite different than what I was anticipating. While in the past GR games you'd rely on squad tactics and commands, this game ditches that in an effort to cater to the casual market, however, it replaces such with stealth gameplay that is flawed for the following reasons-1. The game dictates how you use stealth at times. How in the world would a regular enemy soldier see me whilst using invisible camouflage? Invisible camouflage? Really? Ok.2. Soldiers would find a dead body at times when they weren't even near them or they'd walk right past a dead body and say nothing.3. Soldiers can't seem to see my team mates when they're walking in the open, but see me just fine if I do the same.With that said, there are certain things I really like about this game that was introduced to the series and seems better than the previous games. For one, the introduction of hand to hand combat in the form of take-downs.  I personally found that to be a cool addition rather than running out of ammo and being helpless. You can even stealth shoot an enemy which looks really cool. The control scheme is better in my opinion. The previous GRAW games had controller options that were all over the place while this one is simplified.There are some moments within the campaign that were satisfying, rewarding you with a wow moment, but once the dust settles and the campaign ends, there's really not much of a reason to play.The multiplayer isn't much better. To be honest, I played this more for single player being that I'm not a MP type gamer.There is co-op and Guerilla Mode which I checked out a bit and found to be good additions. But to be honest, if you're looking for another GRAW experience, then don't get this game. However, if you're just looking for a TPS that's military themed then this is a decent effort. If you can find it for cheap then get it or get Spec ops- The Line which is largely superior to GRFS.Not a bad effort by Ubisoft, but I'm waiting for the next Splinter Cell to get my taste of stealth action.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2012"}

Not much to not like about this mouse","reviewText":"With the exception of their mobile mice products, which I find just too small to be comfortable for longer term usage, I tend to find myself pretty happy with Logitech's mouse offerings.  In the full-sized line, I find them fairly comfortable and easy to hold and use for the sometimes extended gaming periods that I might engage in.  I may bounce around a little trying to find the most comfortable of the current offerings, but generally if I'm shopping for a new mouse, I can fairly well rest assured that if I pick a Logitech mouse that I'll be happy with it for years to come.I think that is pretty much exactly where I'll be with this gaming mouse. It is comfortable to use, is, as the manufacturer obviously intended, highly adjustable/customizable and easy enough to personalize for the end user.  Adding the included metal weights, or taking some of them away offers the user a chance to make the mouse \"feel\" better for their own gaming and play style.  It may take some experimentation on the part of the user to arrive at a configuration that fits what is desired, but there really are plenty of options and possibilities.The programmable buttons are also very nice and better yet, being able to store the game profile in the onboard mouse memory is a neat feature though it concerns me from an IT security point of view since the on-board memory could also give a point of entry for storage of malware if not carefully controlled.The manufacturer touts the durability and build quality on this product and they should feel safe in doing so.  It has a sturdy feel and has been put through enough tests to rate the buttons to a number of clicks that any of us mere humans should never expect to be able to amass.Good job Logitech.

The same cartoony style graphics and whimsical environment designs can be seen here, and to good effect!Music (score 8/10):  The music is fantastic, very charming and whimsical, but after playing the previous two entries in the series, it's all starting to sound familiar.  So much so, in fact, that I can't tell if the main theme is a remixed version of the theme from the previous games or the exact same track.  Oh well, either way, the music is still very good.  What really makes this series (and this game) shine is the voice acting.  I especially love the professor's voice.  Its refined British awesomeness is joy to my ears!Characters (score 8/10): The main characters are (of course) Professor Hershel Layton and his apprentice Luke.  The Professor is just as awesome as he ever was - I just love his gentlemanly nature.  Luke is also quite likable.  He's a bit more emotional than the Professor and easily flustered so their dynamic as a pair is good.  As for the other characters, many series regulars appear in this game.  You see Inspector Chelmey again, and Flora makes a return as well.  I found Flora a bit more irritating than before since she's always whining about coming along and I hate characters that whine constantly.  Anyway, there are a few more minor characters that pop up again (such as Stachenscarfen and Pavel) and they are amusing.Story (score 9/10): The basic premise of the story this time is that the Professor and Luke get a letter from Luke's future self, and they have to time travel to solve a problem in the future.  Yes, that's a crazy premise, but Unwound Future pulls it off well.  What's great about this entry in the series is that we get to learn a bit more about Professor Layton's past, including his previous love interest.  In fact, I daresay this entry has the best story so far since it's so personal to the Professor and his past.  More importantly, we finally learn the backstory  of Don Paolo, a recurring character from the previous games that had heretofore remained completely unexplained.  It's about time we learned about him!Gameplay (score 8/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Well, if you've ever played a Professor Layton game before in your life, you'll know exactly what to expect.  Unlike the second entry (Elysian Box) it seems that there are fewer puzzles that directly relate to solving a problem in the environment and more of the random brainteaser puzzles that NPCs just give you.  If you like brainteasers you'll be pleased, but I was slightly disappointed.  I prefer adventure games where the \"puzzles\" are based on solving practical problems in the environment (and this game has a lot of weird doors \"locked\" with puzzles - which is quite crazy).  Oh well, it's not that bad and I'm sure previous Professor Layton fans will be pleased nonetheless.Overall (score 8/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  This is definitely the best entry in the series so far story-wise, even if I'm still not a huge fan of brain teaser-type puzzles.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed myself greatly.  If you are already a fan of Professor Layton and haven't picked this game up yet, you definitely should get your hands on it.  However, if you've never played a Professor Layton game in your life but would like to, then this isn't a bad place to start!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2012"}

Footprints will be left in mud, for example, but only until it rains and then they will wash away. Lara's shirt will also get wet, and she's more likely to lose her grip if she is standing on a slippery, rain-soaked ledge. When the sun comes out, her shirt will dry and the slippery surfaces regain their friction.In Underworld, Lara also has a lot more flexibility in how she makes her way through a level, as there is often more than one way to get from here to there. She can now climb walls with texture and rocky outcroppings to reach areas she previously wouldn't have been able to access.All of these additions have been made to give the game a non-linear, open feel. Players can interactive with the environment by doing things they find to be intuitive, and the game will respond in an appropriate way. When Lara interacts with trees, for example, she will push aside leaves using either one or two hands depending on whether or not she's holding something. These details give a lifelike, immersive sensation to the game.New Melee Combat SystemUnderworld introduces a new melee combat system that requires players to strategically strike with offensive, defensive, and evasive maneuvers. Lara can now attack enemies with different punches, kicks, knees, and other acrobatic onslaughts. Items lying on the ground, such as poles that were previously walked on, can be picked up and swung at enemies. Players can also perform a greater variety of actions with weapons; for example, Lara can now hold onto a ledge with one hand and fire a gun with the other.Realistic Enemy and Animal AIThe AI in Tomb Raider: Underworld has also taken a big step forward--both enemies and animals now make independent decisions based on their surroundings, employ ambush and squad tactics when fighting, and will retreat if deemed necessary.With updated graphics and a more immersive and realistic gameplay, Tomb Raider: Underworld will have both fans and newcomers excited about the newest installment in this popular video game-pinup franchise.Tomb Raider: Underworld is loaded with a new melee combat system, various weapons, and smarter AI for both enemies and animals.","reviewerName":"Ashern \"Hmmm\"","summary":"A Good Game!","reviewText":"This Tomb Raider is really good, its better than Legend in the aspect of a more free-roam feeling.

I've played Kinect games with whole groups of people at a time. The sensor recognizes people of all shapes and sizes quickly, tailors easily to almost any sized room, and there is almost no learning curve involved. Hover your hand over an event to play it, and you play by moving your body as you would expect to (jump over obstables, move left or right and your avatar moves with you, and so on). The most amazing thing about Kinect is that anyone in the room can stand up and play. There is only one control to learn, a unique pose to pause a game and bring up the Guide, which is demonstrated before you begin play. Whether you have parties with friends, or have a game-interested wife, or if you have kids, or if you live all alone and just want to have fun, Kinect is for you.Why choose this over Wii or Playstation Move?Motion-sensing controllers are a thing of the past, and Kinect is the future. Personally, I feel that Playstation Move basically matches the Wii in terms of precision and functionality, so I'll focus on the Wii. The Wiimote's \"pointer\"- the infrared sensor it uses when selecting from menus or doing precision pointing- has to be pointed just so in order to work properly. Sometimes it can be a hassle working through the Wii's menus or with precision targeting. Kinect suffers none of those issues, as you simply wave your hand over items to select them, which is natural and elegant. If you get too close to the TV or too far from it, most Kinect games will give you a live diagram, guiding you back to the optimal play space. The Wii has no comparable feature. The Kinect also tracks your whole body- it's like having an army of Wiimotes strapped to all parts of your body. Your hands can wave, your feet can kick, your hips and shimmy, your head can plug a leak, and Kinect can track all of this at once. The Wii, meanwhile, can track one hand or maybe two, depending on what attachments you own.Is Kinect worth it?Yes. Kinect is an absolute blast to play. Anyone can pick it up, anyone can have fun, and there's a variety of games that build very well on the unique things that Kinect can do. The incldued Adventures game is a \"Wii Sports\" style collection of minigames, but you don't just get stuck with lame minigames that don't go anywhere. There's a story mode, where you work up to harder challenges and unlock special rewards. Kinect Adventures has achievements, to add to your permanent Gamerscore. Adventures also records snapshots and videos during play, (the contents of which are not shared via Xbox Live unless you choose to do so), to be reviewed anytime and often have you in stitches laughing well after the action ends.Conclusions.I tell my friends that Kinect is a marriage counselor in a box. My wife loves playing Kinect as much as I do, and it's frustration-free fun that we can have together. We often play the cooperative minigames, and we're always holding hands and smiling like goofy little kids by the end of it. Kinect is awesome, and everyone who owns or wants a 360 should invest in one.Recommendation.The only possible reason I would hold back a hearty recommendation is for people with limited mobility, who may not be able to perform some of the actions that games require. Even in those cases, I'd suggest demoing the games with friends, and you'll most likely find some activities that cater to your circumstance. Aside from this, and borrowing an old catch phrase, anyone from ages 8 to 108 are going to love Kinect.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"Matthew Siebert \"~Author and Critic\"","summary":"Why....","reviewText":"I remember when FFXII came out, after watching the opening scene I had a tear drop from my eye because I *knew* they did the game right. Now, after playing FFXIII I've had several tears flow... tears because all the lower reviews are nonsensical crap, tears that there are so many 5 star reviews, and most of all... tears that this game was privileged with the title Final Fantasy...Lets start off with the good, which undoubtedly is unanimous and undeniable amongst anyone who plays this game. The graphics are breathtaking, the story is deep, the character development is perfect, the battle system mechanics flow smoothly, and the game sucks you into a world unlike any other.So what could be wrong... what could possibly substantiate a two star review? Unfortunately... plenty... in fact way too much....First, let's look at how linear the game is. At first I didn't think it would bother me, I am generally one to go right through the game without a break to do many side quests. But the presentation of this game is indeed beyond ridiculous... it is *literally* like running through a series of tubes from point A to point B.Granted beautifully designed breath-taking tubes, but tubes none the less.Along with this there are no towns. Again, I didn't think it would be that big of a deal... just a slight change. But it soon became apparent I was exploring a world all but devoid of life. I feel like the game is more like a prototype for a final fantasy rather than the game itself.Next we come to the battle system... oh lord... where do I begin. The battle system is gorgeous but flawed. If you have one character attacking and another casting spells to reduce defense (see Saboteur), eventually all the enemies defenses will be minimalized. It is at this point you would expect the character casting the spells to lower defense to join in and attack, but you would be wrong. The character instead just sits there with a thumb up their (explicit). This is mainly a problem early in the game where character roles aren't as developed... yet I cant believe it was overlooked. The problem is consistent when the computer uses the medic - it heals a character with almost full HP three times in a row while completely neglecting to heal itself despite the fact its in critical condition.Also, the battles seem like nothing more than pressing X to auto-battle. The battle system goes so fast it is almost as if the game doesn't want you to choose your characters actions, only switch roles. I feel absolutely no sense of accomplishment after winning a battle, it wasn't me that won... it was the auto-battle. Sure I switched roles to heal and maybe cast some spells but all the actions were chosen by the computer. And I hear some of you screaming already, FFXII's battle system is also impersonal, how do I get off complaining about FFXIII? Yes FFXII was impersonal compared to other final fantasies but it was still ME modifying the actions it was ME choosing what EACH character was going to do next. It wasn't the computer. I just don't feel the same accomplishment switching \"roles\" during a battle, especially as unnecessary as it generally is.Also with the battle system, a large portion of the game (~60%) requires use of only two characters which further minimalizes any aspect of strategy. Even after the game opens up and you get to form your own party, there's hardly any change to battle strategy. Attack, heal, attack, heal. On tougher battles first use buffs / debuffs then attack, heal, attack, heal. Further reiterating the redundancy, several of the enemies have WAY too much HP so you can do the same thing till your little hearts content. You think this games hard, play the original FF (or some wizardry), this games a cake walk especially with unlimited resources. As with the eidolons, don't worry about using them. It takes *forever* to build up enough TP to summon one, on top of that their next to useless on bosses.Also as a matter of personal opinion, I cannot stand the paradigm system. I have to have six pre-rendered paradigms before entering a battle? Why not just let me change one character role as needed instead of making me shift an entire paradigm? Don't give me the strategy nonsense, if I need a paradigm that isn't there I just click retry at the beginning of the battle and add it. I don't find it entertaining having to mess with six different paradigms to create nuances.Even though you control one character, it doesn't feel like it. When exploiting an enemy's weakness using Libra the characters automatically attack using the appropriate spell. Ugh, its sickening - I have absolutely sense of accomplishment yet again, the game does everything for me. Does no one recall in the original final fantasies how GOOD it felt to find a weakness against that one enemy who whooped you butt, then exploit that weakness and get a buttload of experience and gold? You EARNED that experience and EARNED that gold, dammit YOU found its weakness. Not anymore.Then again, you don't even get money after battles in this game, further making them pointless. Sure, their required to advance character skills, but to what avail? Now the computer will do more for me as I sit there and watch and continuously press X to do auto-battle. Gone is the feeling of going to town and upgrading all your equipment after hours of hard work and coming back into the world to dominate your opponents. Gone again is that sense of accomplishment. And for what? I get to watch the computer do my battles for me!I would dare say that if you compared every persons game file at the end of the game there would be little or no difference. Where are my bragging rights for having rare unique items? My bragging rights for having the best equipment? Anything? Nothing. There's absolutely no replayability, if you play through the game again you'll have the same character development, the same weapons, and be using the same paradigms on the same bosses.There not even mana or magic points in this game for frick sake! In the original final fantasy only certain characters could cast certain spells period... this has been a downfall in other final fantasies as well - diffuse roles amongst characters. But to have a final fantasy without any form of mana or magic regulation?!?! Blasphemy I say, blasphemy!!!Also after each battle, characters automatically gain all their health back. Again stripping me of any accomplishment I have from exploiting enemy weaknesses. Status alignments? Haha, what a joke. Hardly used at all and minimally threatening. And if for some reason I do die I just click retry. Never mind scratch that, if I start off a battle poorly and wanted I could just click retry. No need to be prepared for a malboro getting a sneak attack on me completely debilitating my characters, killing two right off the bat, yet by some miracle, being able to make a comeback and kill the SOB... I just click retry.Now let me touch on the equipment - or lack there of. The only equipment slots you have are one for a weapon and one for an accessory (two for accessories later). No shield, no armor, no boots, no gloves, no helmet. You upgrade your weapon and accessory by finding components or winning them after battles. The game boasts a hundred different components, what it fails to mention is that they all serve the same function - to give an item experience! Sure some components boost how much experience an item gets but experience is experience, there's absolutely no point in having so many components unless they each have a relatively different function. This feels like just another way to make the game stripped down while looking like theres more at play.And on top of everything else the game chooses, it also chooses your party... sick. This is truly a game that plays itself. Sure you get to choose your party later in the game, essentially chapter 10 out of 13. Great...I feel like this is a bad joke. Like square-enix was sitting around saying \"You know what would be really cool, and funny, well screw with the entire Final Fantasy fanbase. Lets make a final fantasy with no gameplay where the computer decides everything, yah, lets also make it devoid of any content, just one single line after another. But to keep people from thinking it's a joke, well have the best visuals the world has ever seen along with an amazing story and unseen character development.\"I wont lie, they have something good here. They have something real good, but its only the beginning. They have great characters and a beautiful battle system. They need to make the REAL final fantasy 13. One where I have a sense of control, one where I have a sense of accomplishment, one where my characters are MY characters. This game does not feel like a game, it feels like a demo, or a VERY early beta. I cannot for the life of me understand how this got released and, more so, how so many people like it. I can't imagine that other people have played the other Final Fantasies, enjoyed them, and had this game appeal to them in any manner whatsoever.I have no problem with people calling this a breath taking adventure with a story and visuals beyond what the world has ever seen. I do have a problem with people calling this a video game. I just want to break down and cry when I hear people call this a Final Fantasy.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2010"}

{"product_name":"B004Z4ZKL6","description":"","reviewerName":"M. burns","summary":"A big pile of flaming sh....","reviewText":"In theory, FIFA 12 should be an awesome game.  You have a ton of leagues and players, ultimate teams that allow you to make your own team from scratch, a build your own pro player feature, and on line play.  Unfortunately, as usual, EA manages to screw it all up.First and foremost, EA screws the game right off the bat by demanding that you connect to their servers.  EA's form of DRM that takes the game 10 minutes just to start up.  Then you have the problem of being disconnected from EA's servers constantly.  So all those coins you earned in ultimate team -- gone.  The game you just won, now a lose because their servers lost the connection.  I've also had to reset and re-setup by Wifi because the game has screwed up my connection.  Pathetic.  Even more pathetic is EA's response to problems which is usually fix the problem yourself.Single player is broken.  This had been a problem since FIFA 1 and EA still has refused to address it.  The computer opponent AI continues to act like 5 star players no matter what the star rating while computer teammates still continue to act like complete and utter retards.  Why is it that opponent AI can strip the ball from me by just being within 5ft while my players run away from loose balls?!?!?  In addition, skill moves do not work against the AI, the AI never is caught out of position on tackles, the computer does not understand the offsides rule, slide tackles are rendered completely useless, etc, etc.  Also, things like Ultimate Team functionality and level advancement are \"void\" if you are not connected to EA's servers.  Again, pathetic.Controls are a positive and negative at the same time.  The game gives you a lot of control and options but it feels like you need to be an octopus to be able to fully control the game.  On one hand, it gives you a sense of accomplishment mastering different things, on the other, the game has been nullified as a pick up and play sports game.  In other words, you cannot just pick up the game a few months from now and play like you did before nor can you play with friends who have never played before as the controls are ridiculously complicated.Where FIFA 12 shines is really only in the on-line component.  This is the only place where the game actually feels fair and balanced for the most part.  Well, that is until you run into the cheaters.  Laggers, guys with 0.5 star teams that act like 5-star teams, glitch exploiters. It can get really sad.  Probably only 2/5 matches seem like your playing a far match.In conclusion, I love soccer and I really wanted to love this game.  Parts of this game I really love like create-a-pro and ultimate team but in the end, I felt more frustrated with this game than I enjoyed it.  Do I suck at this game?  Absolutely not.  That is not why I have come to dislike this game.  Most of my dislike for this game comes from EA's refusal to fix problems that have been present since the beginning, EA's complete disregard for people that want to play single player, and that EA is more concerned about it's DRM than the actual game.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S.

The first iteration of the popularMonster Hunterfranchise to make an appearance on the Wii platform, action in it revolves around quest based gameplay built around the hunting and capture of monsters as a means of character development.

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or braving it solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house.Key Game FeaturesHunt Together- In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone. Hunt together with up to 4 players online or take on arena quests with 2-player split-screen action. In single player mode, you even have the ability to hunt with AI-controlled characters named ChaCha.Communicate Online- Because communication is key in coordinated huntsMonster Hunter Trisupports Wii Speak and text chat.Monsters with Unique Abilities and Attacks- Monsters have unique and dynamic personalities, abilities and defenses, increasing in complexity as the player progresses. They camouflage themselves to ambush hunters, but will flee or call for help if outmatched.Immense Living, Breathing World with Ecosystem- Monsters interact amongst each other in a living breathing ecosystem, complete with food chain. Monsters have stamina, migrate and even attack one another, the strong feeding on the weak.New Underwater Maps- For the first time ever in anyMonster Huntergame, you will be able explore land and sea and hunt monsters of the deep.Fully Customizable Equipment- With ten weapon categories &ndash; including the all-new Switch Axe &ndash; and new armor and weaponry created from the remains of slain monsters, there are almost limitless opportunities for equipment customization.Choice of Controls- Play with either the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, with the Classic Controller or Classic Controller Pro.Take Your Character with You- The ability to save your character to your Wii Remote lets you engage in multiplayer hunts anytime on a friend's console.","reviewerName":"Skitz","summary":"This Game Will Hold You Captive & Won't Let You Go","reviewText":"Wow. Just WOW. You know how games like Harvest Moon are addicting and tons of fun? Well...I thought Rune Factory was the pinnacle of games like that. I never met a Monster Hunter game before that's for sure. There's just too much to do, & it's even worse cuz you're actually gonna WANT to do it ALL for once, even if you're not that type of gamer. This is like rune factory but the battles are a million times more epic. Farming, mining, fishing etc are still all important but there's nothing like slaying a dragon or leviathan underwater and carving its flesh with your knife for resources. The graphics are amazing. Well lit, well coloured, weapons, armor and monsters are highly detailed, music is wonderful and changes to suit the mood of the game very well. Monsters are HUGE, but that's ok, cuz your weapon is just as big lol.It's a very strategic game with a deep free roam battle system. There's an uncountable number of items for you to forge, find, and combine, it never gets old. The online mode though I must say is half the reason this game is so good. This has to be the deepest, realest, and by far best online gaming experience I've had with the Wii hands down. I don't think anything will beat it either. This game launched in 2010. We're almost at 2013 now & there's LITERALLY HUNDREDS of people still online today playing EVERYDAY. It hasn't gotten boring. The best part is that Capcom did away with friend codes! It feels like you're playing a PS3 because adding friends is so easy in this game and you can track your friends, message them, teleport where they are, trade items and so on. It's amazingly deep. And boy oh boy don't even get me started on the world map. HUGE AS HELL, and gorgeous from head to toe! I won't reveal any spoilers but you really feel like a hunter in the wide open natural world of monsters. They did it so well I sometimes just play around in areas just to watch how pretty it is.Online gameplay is also just as important as offline since online is part of the story mode. In the game you play as a hunter in a village taking quests from the big guild in the city that oversees everything. I always wondered where the city was before I owned the game. Online is the city, and like a city, it's very lively with players from all over the world walking up and down, sleeping, some sitting, some drinking, others chatting with friends, some going out to hunt together, you can't go wrong with this game. I've owned this game for 3 days and already have over 63 hours of gameplay under my belt. Do the maths. THAT'S how addicting it is. I've completed so much and still there's so much more left to do. This game easily has over 150 hours of gameplay from where I'm standing. I've heard people say it's actually well over 200 hours long.Get this game. There's nothing like hunting with your friends and communicating and planning strategies during big fights together, being backed into a corner against a gigantic monster together and barely making it out alive, as a team. It's the best thing I've ever seen capcom do. And the Wii speak and usb keyboards are supported by the game so chatting during gameplay is easy as pie. I was hesitant at first to buy this, because I tried it once & it felt boring. I heard someone say it's a slow-to-start game. It really is, cuz after all the bad stuff I said about it I can't put it down lol. Don't be like me, do what's right & buy this game man. I've got a college final in 2 days & can't seem to study yet with this evil game in my room. Someone make the fun stop lol :(","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2012"}

There are lot of reasons that one might say to himself, \"This is the best kart racing game ever.\" And given its endless list of things you can do, it may well be. I wouldn't know as I haven't played them all. But when you look closer at Mario Kart Wii, there are a few glaring problems with the game.The Good:All of these tracks are good. There are 32 that I've encountered. Many have the sorts of alternate routes we've come to love and there are plenty of places to do little tricks for speed boosts. Consequently, driving the karts are pretty enjoyable. The great design of these tracks make the Time Trial mode all the better. Half of the tracks are from older Mario Kart games, which is good for two reasons: 1) Nostalgia is good. 2) You can play your favorite old school SMK tracks online now. Neat.It has a pretty vibrant online mode. It's been out for two or three years now, but people never seem to tire of Mario Kart. It's awesome. It should be said that many folks who play this are extremely good, so veteran kart racers  will find no shortage of competition.There two ways you can turn (or drift, as the game calls it). The automatic method is easy and for the most part makes braking unnecessary. The manual method plays like a cross between the original Super Mario Kart and Diddy Kong Racing for N64. You get a little \"reward\" in the form of a speed boost for using it on curves. This option is good because it adds even more depth to a game that's already immersed with it.Speaking of Diddy Kong, by the way: He's here once you unlock him. There are lot of unlockable characters and vehicles in this game.I could go on an on, but there's so much ramble about in the game's favor.The Bad:When you're in groups with other people playing online, there is no form of communication at all. I didn't expect anything in the way of voice chat (after all, it is Nintendo we're talking about), but a something akin to a system of predetermined emotes would have went a long way in making the online mode feel like you're playing with human beings.I think that it would have been so much better if Mario Kart Wii had focused more on racing and less on the powerups. This is almost inexcusable: When I'm winning, the Blue Turtle shell of death will come. And when I'm losing, I can rest assured that sixteen million Mushrooms will come my way and get me back in the race. This game actually punishes you for being good at it. It would have been so much better if items like Bullet Bill and the Shell were just rare and didn't spawn in relation to your position.I compared the manual drift to DKR's, earlier. Mario Kart Wii would have been PERFECT if it had just taken a few more cues from that game or even earlier Mario Karts. It's good for everything that it has, but the actual racing experience is somewhat lacking due to all of the powerups.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2011"}

Digital Illusions does developing duties for this very fun and challenging racing sim. Rallisport Challenge doesn't have the ultra-attention to after-market modifications as the PS2's Gran Turismo series but what it does have is a very realistic and accurate simulation of the sport of rally racing.The look of the game, from the many different models of rally cars to the crowds lining the race course all the way to the environment themselves are beautifully done. The controls for the game are not to simple, but not overly complicated as other racing sims. The racing itself is very fun and does a great job in conveying the wreckless abandonment required to race in the off-road type racing courses of the rally car circuit.Overall, Rallisport Challenge is a welcome addition to the racing sim genre. Street racing, NASCAR, and other types of racing circuits have been done, but this nice gem for Microsoft Game Studios marks the first time an entire racing sim game has been dedicated to the rally car circuit.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00002STEZ","reviewerName":"Zachary Koenig \"K-Dawg\"","summary":"Too Much Collecting, Too Little Story","reviewText":"For the Nintendo '64 gaming system, the two pre-eminent adventure games were Mario and Zelda.  Those games enthralled players with their tight gameplay and interesting stories.  Unfortunately, DK '64 doesn't have that same tight gameplay, and the story was never the strong suit of the series.The problem with this game is obvious after about 30 minutes: It's all about collecting items, and very little else.  Whether it is coins, tokens, or bananas, this game quickly devolves into little more than a scavenger hunt for miscellaneous items.  Making matters worse is the fact that EACH CHARACTER needs to collect each item to unlock certain features.  The game is tedious enough playing just as a single character, but add in the four others and it becomes ridiculous.The music in this game is engaging (the DK Rap might just be the highlight of the whole experience!), but other than that nothing really stands out.  If you don't mind collecting item after item, you'll like this game more than I.  If you prefer a developed plot, however, than stay away at all costs.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2010"}

The Sith were too easy to beat, not just the last one (I don't remember her name) but all of them and it didn't take me long to figure out anything. I was expecting a plot twist like with Revan but that never happened. None of the characters held up like part 1 either, nothing special about them. I haven't played the \"Dark Side\" yet but I was dissapointed in the light side ending, way way to short, like they left it open for a sequel with your character.

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"N.

Your grappling hook and parachute actually become some of your best weapons, whether pulling yourself out of an intense firefight just before you die or pulling a foe down from his tower to meet his demise; you actually kind of become a militant Spiderman in many ways.The graphics are pretty amazing for a game of this scope; The weapon upgrades and helicopter assistance is nice, esp in traveling, which was a huge issue for the first game; the kill, chaos, and $ stats that pop up during your rampages is a pretty fun addition and gives it an arcade-like feel once you get on a roll. The gunplay can be intense at times, and the over the shoulder view can put you right in the middle.So far the missions and exploring have not gotten old or repetitious; I could see how after 80 hours your could feel otherwise....I am at about 25-30 hours and am enjoying it a lot; the time flies by, and exploring is just as fun.....from the sea to the snow, there are some nice landscapes just to appreciate. Skydiving provides some awesome views, too....The controls seems a little strange during the first tutorial missions, but once you get the feel of it, you will be slinging and shooting in no time. Never tires hijacking helicopters.Bottom line is that this is a really well made and enjoyable sandbox game; Certainly a lot of bang for your buck, esp considering some games only give you 10-20 hours of play, unless they are are online of course too.I don't know how well this would have worked online, but I am thankful the single player mode is as amazing as it is. If there was one complaint so far, it is just that this game is too big. So I guess it's a good complaint, esp nowadays where you want your video game $ going into something good and something that lasts or has high replay.

Battle cries, swords and other good stuff is featured. The music is great and keeps the scene moving(you don't wanna fight 10 monsters at once with boring romantic music do you?)Gameplay: Now, button mashers beware. You might like this. You really got to pay attention to your combos. Simple pressing random buttons won't get you far. Another problem I had is I was using Legolas and I got up to the second part of Helm's Deep fighting an endless array of enemies and fighting out I'm a little weak. In most RPG's you can go back to level up and get better enhancements to help. This is just &quot;if you're at Level 5 and you barely have enough skills to continue then sorry, keep going.&quot;But other than that, it's quite a fun game and urge you to try it out regardless if you're into Lord of the Rings or not.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2002"}

Theres easy modes, hard modes, cheats, new costumes, new characters, and gameplay 'styles' that would satisfy anyone. There is a ton of variety to this game and everything is balanced and solid.Though the one thing that disappointed me was Vergils story... or lack there of.Vergils game is basically a carbon copy of Dantes. No new levels or anything. Playing Vergils game is like playing Joachims game in Castlevania Lament of Innoncence. You will know what i mean if youve played that game...Still, DMC3 is the greatest action/adventure title out there for the PS2. Even God of War cant touch the variety, challenge, and gameplay of this.

You not only get to play as Dante, but as his brother, Vergil, as well.  To start off, however, you can only play as Dante if you don't have a memory card file of playing the original edition of DMC 3.  Dante is betting heads with Vergil once more and this time it's well before the first DMC.  Vergil still looks like a human being and is working against Dante's attempts to keep the demon world out of the human.  What follows is a twisting, spiraling story that is a button-smashing heaven for all those who can keep up with the pace.Your thumbs WILL get a work out during the game.  If shooting Ebony & Ivory aren't enough, like all DMCs, you are going to be tapping a lot of buttons in succession, quite often, against a never ending stream of opponents.  Unlike the last two DMCs, though, you get a fighting style which allows for a large range of style specific moves.  However, be warned, the Trickster style is a bit useless.  I tried to get into it, but I just couldn't afford the time or the attention of such a style.A lot of the bosses and the demons in between that you encounter are similar to past games which gives us seasoned veterans and chuckle and a smile, but the game doesn't hesitate to throw some new bosses and creatures at you for your enjoyment.Going back to Vergil, once he is unlocked he is not nearly as fun to play as you would think.  Dante is a lot more fun because you get cut scenes and, eventually, he can be very, very powerful if you keep using those red orbs you so painstakingly spent gathering.  Vergil, however, never gets to that level of amazingness and he has no cut scenes.  He does get his own intro, so you're tricked into believing there will be more, but there aren't.  There is also a new boss, a jester, which might as well not be a boss.  Don't get your hopes up on that one.Because Vergil is a playable character the game is fun, but it certainly doesn't, in my opinion, garner buying two copies of this game.  If you have the first one, stick with it and borrow a friend's.  Otherwise the game is just as fun as the original.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2011"}

Now, seven years later, I've played it and walked away about underwhelmed. First off the game is butt ugly, but that is expected for a seven-year old game. The textures are blurry and washed out and the character models are down right laughable. No matter though B&W; delivers a great style that hasn't been in any other RTS. While the story is paper-thin there really isn't any need of one. You are a God who is just a floating hand and you take control of creatures. These Creatures can help your villagers either farm grain for good, chop down wood for...erm...wood, and you can pet it, slap it around to tell it it's bad, or encourage it to do bad things such as even eating the villagers!The whole premise of B&W; is the \"good or evil\" premise that Peter Moloneux oh so loves. The whole concept of the game is to influence other villages by performing God like tasks such as supplying them with food, or wood. You can use your Creature to impress them or you can do evil things to impress them such as picking up the villagers and throwing them around, smashing their buildings etc. When you get a village the people will have needs. These are noted with flags around building. Some may want more houses to breed children. Some may want a wonder, some people may even want more trees or rocks in their village. When you start running out of resources you can perform miracles by having your villagers chant at your temple. You can then use \"gestures\" to use wood miracles, food miracles, fire, or shields to attack or protect villages etc.The game plays out in missions via silver scrolls that require you to help (or hurt) people. When you get the God Stones you unlock the next door to pick your next Creature. While all this sounds astounding (and it is) the game is very hard and gets old really quick. After the first land which is the tutorial land you'll pretty much have seen what the game has to offer. What makes the game so hard is that you will never have enough resources and the resources are very limited, and buildings require too much wood to build. While taking your Creature out on walks using a leash (use the good or bad collar to have the Creature act accordingly) sounds neat it is but not for long. Back in 2001 this kind of thing was like finding a Martian...it didn't exist. In 2008 we've seen this many times before and it's nothing new. If you really dig this kind of thing I recommend it, but if you've played other great RTS games you won't see anything new here.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

The bad guys have no variation, the forest and cabins all look about the same, and the difficulty of the game is increased by fighting hoards of the bad guys with limited ammo. Repetitive gameplay is not always bad, there are plenty of games that are designed in this way. What makes this game bad is the story did not make sense, as if some parts were cut out, and since it is a very linear experience with no incentive to explore (looking for chests and coffee thermos is not fun), the game became a chore to finish. The ending was just disappointing with no final battle.The weapons are: handgun, shotgun, rifle, flashbang grenades, flares, and flare gun. There are no upgrades to the weapons as the game progresses while the most important thing is the flashlight.

Cadieux","summary":"The best Batman experience in any medium!","reviewText":"In my review of the previous game, Batman Arkham Asylum, I praised it for being the best Batman game we could ever hope for.  Then this game comes along and betters even that.  I would like to suggest that this game is the best Batman experience available over any form of entertainment, whether it be movies, comics or other games.  If you are a fan of Batman, this is the closest you can come to the perfect experience (until perhaps the next game?).First, a tip.  There's a lot going on in this game, and even for those who played Arkham Asylum, you might feel a bit overwhelmed at the beginning.  It's an open world, there are lots of side-missions, lots of moves and gadgets, lots of other distractions on the screen and on the heads-up display.  After a couple of hours, I had pretty much decided that I didn't like the game.  But I kept at it, I learned, and in the end had an awesome time with it.  This game is 5 stars, without question!The Good:1. Great combat, pioneered in Arkham Asylum and improved somewhat here.2. Visuals are great.3. Lots of extra stuff to do if you want a break from the main story, most of it pretty interesting.4. Catwoman is surprisingly capable and fun to play as.5. Funny dialogue between the thugs on the street.6. Soaring around the city for an extended period using the dive bomb and boost techniques rocks!7. Intense final section with total chaos breaking out in Arkham City was great, and felt a lot like the ending of the Batman Begins movie that I loved so much.The Bad:1. Story doesn't make sense sometimes.2. This is a nitpick, but the time between death and your next chance is long and could have been made shorter.  After you die, first the game taunts you for a little bit, then it asks you, after each death, if you want to try again or quit.  After you choose to retry, then it takes some time to load the level again for your next chance.  It's frustrating when you just want to get back in and kick the butt of whoever dared to oppose The Bat.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2011"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

Unfortunately the gameplay is very redundant.  The gameplay does have a bit of spice where it tries to break away from the -Gears-of-War-shooting-from-cover-style with little gameplay events.  This is why I deducted one star, too much of a gameplay type that I can't enjoy for hours on end.  If the story looks appealing to you, though, I highly suggest you get the game or at least rent it.  It gets better with each hour you get into the game.  Character development is good, graphics are great, controls are passable, some fresh ideas, wonderful soundtrack, highly detailed/interesting story, and totally awesome boss fights/designs (except for the final one which was terrible).All in all I can say I will probably never play this game again.  I don't have enough time and there are so many others I want to play.  I am,however, extremely glad I took the time to play through once.  It is very memorable and unique.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2012"}
{"product_name":"B004ML44Y6","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Going Beserker","reviewText":"BRIEFThe initial Darkness was the very first paid-for (not coming with the box) PS3 game we purchased way back in 2007. It didn't get much play at the time because the kids were still small and the sound effects alone were enough to terrify them. Kids are older now, they played the first installment already and Darkness 2 appeared on a birthday wish list.The game is a fun rampage shooter game to get through and play again if you are bored. The graphics, sounds and animations are a giant improvement and make the game look like a living comic book. While beautifully executed, the game feels incomplete since the story is way too short considering  the creativity in writing and gameplay. The ending was not as fun as it should have been - if 'fun' can be associated with the game total gruesomeness, and the Vendettas should have had a bigger and longer role since the characters had fun personalities and powers.The Special Edition comes with a nice Darkness 2 art poster, two extra powers for story mode, and an alternate costume for the darkling. These are nice things to have but do not really help in the grand scheme of the game. In other words, whatever you can accomplish in the Special Edition is achievable in the regular game as well.ATMOSPHEREPlaying 'The Darkness 2' is like living inside a horror movie with you cast as one the monsters. You are Jackie Estacodo who is the Don of the the mafia in New York. The show opens with an assassination attempt by an mysterious group. You/Jackie survive by awaking your evil super power, the Darkness which you have repressed for three years. You use this horrifying power to investigate why 'the Brotherhood' is trying to kill you and why you are haunted by visions of your girlfriend who was killed in front of you years ago.PLAYUnlike the first installment where you could freely go wherever you wanted, the story mode in Darkness 2 is very directed - that's why I'm comparing it to a movie. Side-missions are gone but hunting for artifacts is introduced.Artifacts come with a boost of essence which you use to get new powers and power up your darkness abilities. They also come with little stories (not bedtime stories though) that relate to the Darkness' role in history and the Bible.- GunsThe gun-fighting in the game is unique. You would generally get weapons and ammo from enemies killed in the game. You can only hold three weapons at a time, which you can toggle using the d-pad. You can hold one assault rifle or shotgun, and two pistols. Something that I liked was you can shift between using one pistol for accuracy, or dual wield guns so you can cover a wider range of enemies in front of you or fire off a clip from one gun and keep shooting with another. There is a wide verity of guns but the ammo for one type matches with a another.  For example, you can collect the ammo form a discarded twelve gauge and put it into a riot shotgun. In combat shooting and aiming is very smooth, but a tad unrealistic since there is absolutely no recoil and the scope does not move at all while shooting or aiming.- PowersWhile shooting is a big part of the game, the really fun part comes with the Darkness Powers. They are fueled and improved by the 'essence' which you get after killing an enemy or from artifacts (ahhhhh). The various powers are accessed on pillars of essence and are purchased on a skill tree system. You start the game with the classic tentacles but unlike the last game where they were only good for eating hearts and for singular powers, the tentacles play a vital part during combat. One tentacle is for slicing and dicing, the other is for grabbing and throwing, and holding up car doors and other things for cover. unlike the previous game . They are also used in one of my favorite parts of the game, the over the top, and extremely gruesome executions - I'll leave what happens there to anyone's imagination.- DarklingYou only get the one berserker like darkling in Darkness 2, but he is a lot smarter and you can throw him if you need too. The darkling is now a legitimate character and plays a vital part in the story. There are also a few parts where you play as the darkling and crawl through vents and use your claws as a knife and act like a mini assassin.ONLINEIn the online mode, Vendettas, you play as one of the four Darkness powered hitmen (actually one is a woman) hired by Jackie to help him fight the Brotherhood. They each come with their own darkness powers, also skill tree based, and have a darkness artifact, each with different powers and executions. There are two online modes: story and hitlist.The story mode consists mostly of fighting trough hordes of bad guys (badder than you?) and fighting bosses in medium to large environments while you communicate with whomever is in charge at the time by phone. The story is the same for whatever character you are playing as but the phone banter is well written and quite funny.'Hitlist' is more for leveling up and fun. You play through a story mode level and finish at the boss. Both modes can be played with friends, but they have to choose a character not yet chosen.___________________________________________NOTE: I would not play this game if or when children are around.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2012"}

It was wayy too short as far as the story, and it was  way to short on the extra stuff outside of the missions.  But it was still a very good games minus those negatives I just said, GTA4 was a rock solid wall as far as gameplay, it was just awesome. So i got this based on all the reviews saying that Saints Row 2 was the better sandbox. I was hesitant at first because the first SR sucked completely. It too suffered from terribly short gameplay and a horrible ending. I get about 20 min into SR2 and I realize just how bad it is. Not on par with GTA4 by a hair. The driving sucks, handling, everything. You can;t even get a behind the wheel view, you can only get the arcade style 3rd person view outside of the car. The gameplay is completely sloppy, no real finesse like gta4. You cant even change the view that follows your character, its stuck pretty much right behind him, which is annoying because you cant get a wide view of what going on.I felt like I was playing an unfinished game, oh did I mention THAT ITS THE SAME EXACT MAP FROM SAINTS ROW ONE? NOTHING NEW BUT THE ACTIVITES AND MISSIONS, THIS COULD HAVE EASILY JUST BEEN DOWNLOAD CONTENT TO UPGRADE SAINTS ROW ONE. The graphics are good. Dont buy this game, rent it first. GTA4 was way better and it has Download content, there will be another add-on  coming in october besides the Motorcycle one they have out now. It really comes down to this: There's more to do in Saint Row 2, but it suffers from bad gameplay, which makes the experience not worth experience. I expected way better, Why do these companies keep cheating us out of our money with these extremely short games that dont meet expectations or live up to the hype? Because we dont do anything about it. This game makes me want to throw my 360 out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2009"}

If you don't agree that is sucked, I want you to wear aluminum foil on a daily basis so if I see you walking down the street, I can go, \"Okay, avoid that guy - he's an idiot.\"Saints Row 2 is what a Sandbox \"Guns & Glory\" RPG should be.  This is how GTA began so many years ago (anyone else play the original top-down version were you got mad points for running over a bunch of chanting tribes-men all at once?)  I wasn't but an hour into Saints Row 2 before I was riding along in a Sewage truck, spraying fecal matter onto homes, people and cars because some realtor wanted to get revenge on a competitor.  You can't learn that kinda stuff!  That's pure genious.  Ever spray crap on a cop before?  I hadn't!I won't go into too much detail for now - I just started the game.  The character customization was nice but kinda difficult - I spent over an hour on it and my guy still looks like a tard.  But in the end I'm pretty content with him - he looks like a good s**t-kicker which is what he should be.Graphics are okay - nothing awe-inspiring.  I'll admit GTA IV looked better.  But there's none of these heart-felt phone calls from your whiney cousin going \"We don't hang out anymore!!\" or stupid girlfriends that you have to dress up for...  In fact, it appears that you don't even have to wear the Saints Purple to earn street credit - you just buy nicer clothes.  You can buy multiple versions of the same shirt and just keep racking up respect, as long as you have cash to back up the binge.Car customization is AWESOME - they really beefed up that aspect of the game.  After completing just the first few missions, I came across a \"Superiore\" - looks like a Lamborghini Countach.  I took it to a custom shop and went nuts on it - multi-layered black tints with a \"Saints Purple\" stripe, purple interior...  There's over 30 different wheels!  You can also upgrade the performance of the car - most of it appears to be body strengthening - I'm guessing so you can take more thumps and bullets.The appearance of my character, wearing clean, \"stonewashed\" jeans and his black-and-purple Saints football Jersey, standing alongside his black-and-purple \"Countach,\" arms crossed - lookin' all thuggish - was the neatest thing ever.And by the way, whoever does the voice of Johnny Gat is one of the best, most talented voice actors in the history of video games.  That guy is HILARIOUS. He delivers lines with perfect precision, dripping with sarcasm and laced with dark humor.  I am absolutely relieved to see that he has returned to the series.  My applause to you, sir.I still have a lot more gaming to do, but with so many let-downs in the prior year - GTA IV, Mercenaries 2, etc - it's GREAT to see one title that took a good idea and actually made it BETTER.Let's go SAINTS!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000ZKDOV2","reviewerName":"Rick \"BchNuts\"","summary":"THE MOST FUN SANDBOX GAME EVER!!!!","reviewText":"I was amazed at how fun this game is. I know everyone keeps comparing this to GTA4 but here's another one. I got really bored really quick with GTA4 because it got to repetitive and to frustrating after the first 4 hours of game play or so. I don't think I'm alone with this opinion either. Sometimes you want to play something serious and sometimes you don't.  Well think of GTA4 as simulation mode and think of Saints Row 2 as arcade mode, A.K.A., the fun mode. Sure there are technical glitches but it doesn't take you out of your experience. The activities never get old and the missions have a ton of variety. My girl even loves this game. She gets more into the customization. She spends hours just shopping for clothes, pimping out cars and decorating hoods. When she runs out of money she just does some activities and goes right back to shopping. I personally spend hours boosting cars and killing targets. There is so many things to get into it's crazy. I also love the free targetting too. You never find it hard to aim at who you want rather than accidentaly aiming at someone you don't want to, cough..GTA.. The co-op is extremely fun too. If you want hours and hours of entertainment that seems to never get old you'll love this game!P.S. Seek out the Demolition Derby, it's a BLAST.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2008"}

Mortal Kombat V Deadly Alliance came out in 2002 the 1st Mortal Kombat game not to be in arcades. Most of the principle characters are back Raiden, Kung Lao, Kitana Quan Chi, Jax, Sonya, Kano, Cyrax, Reptile, Scorpion, Sub Zero, if you want to count him as a returning character Blaze.  It also features the return of Shang Tsung. Were also introduced to new characters Nitara, Bo Rai Cho, Mavodo Lei Mei & Kenshi. Story is after Mortal Kombat4 Quan Chi has Shinnok's Amulet after his defeat & has plotted & planned for 5 years & found the mumified remains of The Dragon King Onoga's undefeated army & formed an alliance with Shang Tsung together they round up Kano & Mavodo who is introduced in this game & there enemies they have to put there differences aside. Shang Tsumg gets 2 demons from the Netherelm Moloch & Drahmin who I forgot to mention they are new. He promise them that he will let them kill Scorpion & Quan Chi even cause they have a history with them. 7 years after Shao Kahn's defeat Shang Tsung has enslaved a lot of people 1 person is Lei Mei whose village was destroyed & Quan Chi & Shang Tsumg has promised her freedom from The Deadly Alliance if she wins the upcoming Mortal Kombat Tournament hosted by Shang Tsumg. Cause Shang Tsung wants full power over The Mortal Kombat Tournament again so he & Quan Chi kill Shao Kahn. Shang Tsung also wants to ensure that Liu Kang doesn't try to stop him so 10 years after his defeat he avenges that loss murders Liu Kang  & steals his soul. But wants revenge on Shang Tsung Kenshi when he was younger he was fooled by Shang Tsung to open a passage way it contained souls it blinded Kenshi he has a sword that guides him. 2 other characters that are nuteral are Cyrax & a new character Nitara after being attacked by Moloch & Drahmin he was left stranded & then he was attacked by Reptile & Nitara saved him. Raiden gathered what he could Jax Sonya Johnny Cage Sub Zero & his new partner Frost a female Lin Kuei member. This game was an awesome return to the series. I know some hate this game it's better than Mytholgies & that Special Forces bull  s  h  it. I wish the gore would've been more than blood & meat chunks. But you get some good fatalities. John Vogel gets s  h  it as a writer I think he's as good as John Tobias. When your cornered it can be a problem. You think Goro Kitaro or Motaro were tough Moloch is a hard as  s. I'm glad they gave us a better boss Shang Tsung & Quan Chi. The opening video took a year & half to make it still looks good 10 years later. I liked  most of the new characters & that's a problem with the new Street Fighter games the newer characters I don't care for.

{"product_name":"B0011BE3KA","description":"The renowned Silent Hill survival horror series continues on the PS2 with a brand new adventure that reveals many of the series most hallowed secrets. Assuming the role of a lone truck driver who becomes trapped in Silent Hill, players must escape the city's horrific inhabitants and confront the strange hallucinations that have haunted him since childhood. Featuring enhanced graphics, sound and control, Silent Hill Origins sets a new standard for this survival horror classic.","reviewerName":"Benjamin S. Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"For both silent hill completists and fans of horror, a psp port of ps-2 quality!","reviewText":"I've played every single Silent Hill. My first experience was the first game. Sadly I was not really able to appreciate its' deeper more profound symbolism when I was a younger age. Only reflecting later would I truly understand Cheryl and Alessa were the same person as well as the warped physics of the other-world. I finally realized just how brave Harry was and how much he had to lose. Truth be told Silent Hill was always more complex then Resident Evil. It focused more on the psychological and the occult then viruses and zombies.The games that came after always either hit it big with me or had me give up. Alot of fans say \"SH 2\" was the best in the series. It was a good game but I could not really relate to a guy who killed his sick wife. (By now I'm sure EVERYONE knows about that. SH 2 has been out a LONG TIME.) However SH did introduce everyone's favorite geometric headed butcherer Pyramid-head as well as the possibility SH's energies are not only fueled by Alessa but rather by anyone who enters its' borders. SH 3 was a game I loved. Heather was one of my favorite protagonists and though people often critique her for being \"too sassy\" or \"too whiney\" I thought she was supposed to be a normal teenaged girl in the first place. Despite her short comings she was still brave and capable of caring for others. I get tired of people expecting their heroes to be perfect. If anything Silent Hill is about \"imperfections\" that come back to haunt us. SH 4 let me down completly. Once again some people thought it was awesome. I thought it was \"good\" for the genre yet something about it did not feel quite like \"silent hill\" to me. Henry was not \"unlikeable\" and being a bachelor I could relate to him finding comfort in solitude but all the back tracking and ending variables hinging on Eileen's health and exorcising spirits made the game more of a frusterating chore. Actually protecting Eileen would have been a reasonable task if not for those damned ghosts that can phase through walls to come after you. Walter Sullivan was one of the best antagonists in SH but the flawed gameplay broke the mold in a bad way.Now we come up to origins. Honestly I was worried intially. Afterall I was buying a psp port to my ps-2. Would the game look like crap? Would it play like a dying mule? Would Climax seriously mess up some of my favorite characters in the SH canon? I'm happy to say \"no\" to each of those.As you well know you are put in the shoes of Travis Grady, a stoic trucker who gets caught up in Alessa's life and tries to stop everyone's favorite crazies from seriously messing up conventional reality. There have already been complaints such as \"Travis had no reason to be in SH.\" Hmmm. If you think you just clipped a little girl with your semi truck wouldn't you be just a tad concerned? If you say \"no\" to that question you likely need to talk to a therapist.Anyway, Travis ends up following Alessa back to a burning house and saves her from a ritualistic sacrificial burning. After he passes out he awakes in Slent Hill. As you know once you're \"in\" silent hill it is hard to get out until you've conquered your inner demons. Not only does Travis stay around out of concern for Alessa but some of his own past memories are lurking the town's foggy streets. From this we are able to dispel the silly notion he has \"no reason to be in silent hill.\"Origins really sticks its' neck out to make new innovations. Some are great. Others are not so great. For example melee weapons break after a few uses and you can lug around tvs, toasters, and type writers to literally throw at oncoming nasties. To balance out the weapons issue Travis can go fistacuffs with opponents like a boxing champ. The only problem is when more then one monster is in the vacinity he'll often keep focusing on the baddie knocked down instead of facing the lurching one that is the bigger threat. Honestly though \"Survival horror\" is not about making combat perfect. If you could easily cream hordes of demons it would be more akin to an action plat-former. Travis though being the toughest protagonist is still in over his head. If you are a true SH fan you want it that way. Having a flashy pretty boy like \"Dante\" from DMC running around unstoppable on the streets of silent-hill with a big sword and infinite ammo would kill the atmospheric terror aspect quick.One thing you should be aware of is this time around the creatures are faster and meaner. The first time I saw \"the patient\" monsters in the distance I thought I could easily out run them. Afterall the similar monsters in SH 2 were slow as a southern drawl right? Wrong. These \"things\" are unrelenting. They will shamble at you quickly and try to crush you with their legs or in the case of the nurses put a rusty syringe in your neck. That cannot be sanitary! This brings up another new combat mechanic. Travis can \"shake off\" assaults by tapping the x button really fast. I find overall this is a good feature because without it you would be even more screwed.Instead of shifting to the other-world at random Travis acesses mirors to step between realities. Some say this kills the suspense but frankly so much is creepy about the game it is hard to say if it took the frantic edge off my nerves personally. Afterall I first encountered \"the butcher\" in the \"normal fog world\" cutting open a nurse creature with a huge cleaver. I didn't really feel safer in either dimension.Moving along you will meet Dahlia, Kauffman, and Lisa. Though they look significally different their personalities are very much entact from the first game. Dahlia is as evil and creepy as ever so the designers did not try to make her a more sympathetic character like she was in the movie. This does stay in line with the first game though her movie counter-part had more layers. Likely that was one of the things Director Gans did well. For some reason Dahlia seems like Cruella Deville from 101 dalmations to me. Antagonists that are evil just to be evil work for cartoons but they do not do so well in a serious and frightening survival horror setting. If they portrayed Dahlia as at least having some guilt and remorse issues the end result would have been much better contrieved. What if for example you found her telling her confessions to a preacher in a church weeping? You would still not like her but she would come off as being alot more \"human\". Yeah she's crazy, but can't crazy people still love their children?Kauffman is cold,aloft, cruel, and calculating living up to his usual \"ice man doctor\" arch type to a perfect T. Lisa is sweet, flirtatous, yet misguided which is refreshingly loyal to the ground work in the first game. For some reason people yammer about poor Lisa seeming like a \"slut\" but she does not seem to go about things differently in her interactions with Travis then she did with Harry. She flirted with Harry too and everyone knew she had an abusive relationship going with Kauffman. Does that coupled with being a nurse make her a tramp? For those few self annointed \"elites\" complaining I'd like to say \"whatever prudes.\" You had no problem with her in the first game despite her drug addiction yet you do in origins? Bury the fan-baby angst already. It's not as if Climax tried making Lisa like Cynthia. (Not that Cynthia was a bad person either. Being a \"hooker\" does not make a woman automatically deserving of death or less of a person.)Beyond this point you can guess the formula. Alessa needs your help and guides you through Silent Hill. Each time you defeat a boss you get pieces to the overall puzzle unlocking more info about the cult and your own difficult past. My only complaint is each completed area seems to get locked off. Yes, you can beat the game in 5 hours if you're good at navigation and have a faq handy to tell you where everything is but most likely if this if your first time playing it'll take you 8-10 hours.Wrapping up I have to say this is my favorite SH game since 1 and 3. I'm surprised it looks so good on my PS-2 being that it is a psp port and equally delighted Climax handled each and every detail with loving care.Pros+ Loyal to the SH canon.+ Alessa gets more love and a chance to let out more frustrations onto her tormentors.+ Lisa is likable this time around too. I know some disagree with me over that fact but I found myself caring for her and feeling sorry for her just like I did in the first game.+ Monsters are varied and vicious with new attacks though admittedly alot of their designs seem to be from the other games.+ Great scares but you should play it in the dark for more jump out of your chair moments.+Vivid and lucid sound-track.+ Travis is a good guy. I found it easy to relate to him and liked how he took responsibility for his own actions.Cons- Character models were changed aesthetically a bit. I did not care so much but I know certain fans will.- Camera angles can be really bad here and there.- Alessa seems more \"mischievous\" and \"dangerous\" then \"innocent\" and \"helpless\". However I understand why she'd be driven insane and want to screw with people after being burnt alive. Poor kid.-Combat can get frusterating especially when fighting multiple foes or the \"biggy-beasts\" in this installment. Word to the wise. Its' ok to run sometimes!-Arguably the shortest SH if you know exactly what to do and where to go.- The power to travel to the fog world and other-world at your own leisure may kill the suspense for you. It didn't for me though. Both places seemed equally twisted.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2008"}

All of the above!","reviewText":"The first thing that must be said about Rage is that the Artificial Intelligence (AI) is unparalleled in the gaming universe. You will see things in this game you never would have thought you'd see until at least the next generation of consoles. Enemies will group together to gang up on you, will split up to flank you, will run for cover if out in the open and will actually run away from you if it's the best option (just to name a handful of the awesomeness you'll see unfold before your very eyes by the time the game is over). Rage is the first game where, when playing offline, you feel like you're playing actual human beings online. The AI is that intelligent. And for that alone, this game gets a 4 out of 5.Sadly, the second thing that must be said about Rage is that it doesn't live up to the hype. It doesn't even resemble the hype. A game that was said to be 18-25 hours long (in a much ballyhooed release to the press) can be finished in less than 10 (12-15 if you engage in the sidequests and are into collecting items). A game that was said to revolutionize shooters is essentially just another shooter -- and one that could easily be seen as a sequel to Borderlands, its gameplay style is so similar (EDIT: Rage was in production prior to Borderlands and reading a preview from 2006, it seems Borderlands got its ideas from Rage -- not the other way around!). A game that was said to have graphics that would be unmatched has texture pop-in and screen-tear on a regular basis (that said, it's still pretty incredible, considering it's running at 60FPS).\"Potential\" sums up Rage better than any other word in the English dictionary (\"disappointing\" would be a close second). It never lives up to said potential, but it shows it from beginning to nearly the end and oftentimes comes close enough to its potential to keep you playing and keep you having fun. It shows what AI is capable of -- not in the future, but right now. Today. On a console you already own. It also shows what happens when a production is too rushed or a developer reaches too high.So is Rage a great tech demo and a bad game, or a great game with advanced tech that's not quite ready for prime-time? It's both. It's id through and through. It has some of the best weapons ever placed in a shooter. You WILL have a blast (pun intended) with these weapons. Coming from the company that brought us the BFG, we should expect no less.  The game also has some amazing level design, taking you into spiraling descents into Hell, where, usually toward the bottom of the shooting missions, you meet a nasty boss or two). It has violence that makes id's other shooters look tame by comparison (headshots have essentially been replaced by violent decapitations). It has a fun premise that never goes anywhere. And it also has the most disappointing ending in gaming history (which I won't spoil here).Seriously, id Software, what was up with that ending? It feels like you guys gave up on the race a foot before the finish line.I liked Rage. A lot of times, I loved the game. But nearly as many times I hated it. I hated the fact that I felt, throughout, that Rage was a game I could have loved throughout. A game that could have been the revolution in gameplay it thought it was. But, thanks to that amazing AI, Rage did show me things I have never seen before. Every 15 or 20 minutes it had another, \"Woah!\" moment that would make even the most jaded gamer's jaw drop. Sadly, all this is sandwiched between \"fetch quest\" type gameplay that got tired in Borderlands a couple of years ago.Rage is a lot of things. A disappointment, a thrill, broken, amazing, generic, fresh ... it contradicts itself at every turn. Just when you think you love it, it lets you down. Just when you think you hate it, it gives you goosebumps. Love it or hate it (or, likely both), Rage is an experience. Just not one that's worth full price (but fans of id's other FPS work should be happy enough, even if they did shell out the full 50 or 60 bucks). If they have time to perfect this Frankenstein Monster of gameplay they've developed? Rage 2 could be the best game ever.RAGE Gameplay Tips:Play the side missions. A lot of them are actually fun (that's not always the case in games)!Don't sell the Feltrite Crystals! You'll need them.You CAN skip a lot of the races, but the racing game is basically a game in and of itself and it's a good one.In the Mayor's office look to screen right on his desk to find a Fallout bobble-head doll. It's worth some serious cash and it's totally awesome.If you like card games like Magic, buy a deck of cards and play! There is a pretty wild game of cards that may end up addicting you (it kept me hunting down collectible cards to use in the game).If you're a fan of the television show, Breaking Bad -- there's an odd (and sort of hilarious) Easter egg for you in the Sheriff's Office.The main story quests can oftentimes be a LOT longer than you expect them to be with a TON of enemies. Bring LOTS of ammo.Don't give up until you've at least spent a few hours in Wellspring. The game doesn't fully take off until that point.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2011"}

On the positive side I think the graphics and the selection and appearance of the cars you can race is nice and the parking lot events and competitions with the drifting, donuts, etc. is actually more fun that I'd imagined. However, the constant advertising to buy other events and automobiles is annoying, and even more annoying are the commentary by your \"team\" that constantly bombard you with these stupid little positive reinforcements (made even more annoying by British accents). Plus you can't customize any vehicles on your own and the settings of \"casual\" and \"intermediate\" feel miles apart. I've played many of the racing games on the market and own several too but the intermediate setting was very challenging I thought and the casual setting just ridiculous as all you have to do is steer slightly and the game will do the rest and you will win easily every time. I also was surprised by the lack of drifting competitions on the track competitions. It seemed restricted to parking lot drifting - I only remember one drifting track in Kenya, which was the funnest thing I remember about the game. Maybe you could buy more of the drifting tracks, but who wants to keep shelling out another $5 here and there? I paid $5 for the Japanese tracks and they were very bland and boring, so it didn't inspire me to shell out any additional money for other tracks.FINAL GRADE: C","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2013"}

Be forewarned, from what I have done so far in the 11 or so hours I have played so far and from what I have read, this game will take a looonnnnggg time to beat.  With me being a gamer since the atari, this game definitely has that old school rpg feel to it...meaning the time consuming leveling up process.  But that's a good thing in my opinion.  But since I work a full time job and am married, beating this game will pose a problem...or at least will take forever.  You guys out there like me know what i'm talking about! lol  But a plus is that I actually caught my wife...who is also a gamer...listening to the game and watching occasionally as I played.  So maybe I can get her to play too...she did say she liked the graphics very much....cell-shaded cartoony looking and the humor as well as some of the \"cute\" monsters such as the candy cats and the jailcats.  I love the graphics as well.  The game's humor...from the dialog to some of the monsters you battle and to the expressions on boths faces at different times in the game...are a welcome addition.  I found myself chuckling and grinning quite often.  And the \"British\" voice accents in the game is a nice touch too.  I am not sure whether to get the guide for item combination yet though or item location maps...you can make cool items by combining other items in the alchemy pot.  That's fun to do.  My characters are on level 11 and 12 right now and leveling up is starting to worry me...due to me working full time...about how long it will take to get them to max out and to acquire all their abilities and spells...but it is an RPG after all.  But the game is refreshing due to the cartoony graphics and the humor in the game.  So far it hasn't been too tough with the right strategy used at times.  Make sure to take the time to level up enough and have enough supplies before tackling certain areas and bosses.  A good sign is when the area monsters no longer pose a threat and you easily beat them every time....then a boss should be no problem using a good strategy.  But once a boss or certain enemies beat you once, you will know what to do. This is a very good pick-up-and-play game but will take a long time to beat.

{"product_name":"B000B43OY4","reviewerName":"Paul Arellano \"Last Days on Earth\"","summary":"Excellent Toy","reviewText":"Now is the best time to purchase an Xbox 360. Supply is up and there are several package options available. Xbox 360 is like a desktop with it's parts crammed into a tiny console box. After waiting for three months, supply of this elusive system is back up and is flooding some of the gaming stores out there. I finally decided to get the Xbox 360 Fully Loaded package. It came with a wireless controller, a 20gb HD, cables,Xbox Live 1 month trial, and the headset.I highly recommend that you connect it to an HDTV LCD. This is the only way to fully appreciate the breathtaking graphics this system offers. You may have to invest on an HDTV LCD I hooked up my system on my 37 inch HDTV LCD and I was completely blown away by the graphics. Kick up the resolution at 1080i, and everything becomes so lifelike and real. If you hook up this system to a regular tube TV, you'll be missing out on a lot of things. I connected my Xbox 360 to my 37 inch flat panel HDTV LCD and it just changed the way I look at console gaming now. Setting up the system is easy. With HDTV connection, you'll have to connect to the Y PBr connections; and for regular TV, just connect it to the R Y B connections. The system also functions as a progressive scan DVD player. I don't play DVD movies on this because I have a feeling the DVD drive might burn out faster.First complaint I have though is the noise it makes. Well..typical for any PC but for a small console like this, it does make quite a sound. Obviously it's the cooling fan.Second complaint, the AA batteries don't last too long on the wireless controllers. It'll last for a week, again, depending on how frequent you play with your 360. Wireless does have it's benefits for a gaming console. You can be in your most awkward yet comfortable gaming position and still manage to play without having to worry about wires. Distance for wireless effectivity is about 30 feet. I tried it in my lounge at 30 feet and it still works.I'd recommend several games to test out the 360. Get Call of Duty 2, Condemned, Ghost Recon, and Oblivion. Excellent games and a good test platform to see the power of the 360. Just a word of caution that this is still a console and not a PC. Expect some extended loading times, slow framerates when screen gets busy, and hard drive space. The Xbox 360 comes with 20gb but when you check the drive, the available space is 12GB. I would think the missing 8 GBs is where the firmware is loaded...or not.All in all, a good investment and a a good system that will stay in the market for a good long while.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2006"}
{"product_name":"B000B43OY4","reviewerName":"PS2 Bruce","summary":"Very Happy With My New XBOX 360","reviewText":"I finally got my 360 about a month ago; I had been waiting and considering buying one since lanch, but the actual supply of them here in southern california was limited until recently. It's kind of silly but I finally bought my 360 so I could play a game called Saint's Row, which is, well, alright, but I have several other games I like better. (More on that in a bit).Anyway everyone probably knows that the 360 comes in two different packages-the \"core\" system, which is the console, wired controller, 10-100 cable (I think) and regular video cable. There is no hard drive or memory card included. So long story short, this model will get you started, you can run games in 360 format and original XBOX games that are supported, but you can't save. For this reason I strongly recommend purchasing the package I believe is called the \"premium.\" It costs a bit more, but you are getting quite a bit more than just the cost of the hard drive-it has a wireless controller, composite AV cable (that has both SD and HD controllers for your TV and a headset to use with XBOX Live, all of which will add quite a bit to the cost if purchased later. In addition to my console I also purchased a wired controller (in case i run out of batteries), and a memory card (in case I want to backup game saves, etc); but that was my choice, if you get the \"premium\" it starts you off with all you will need (well except new games :) )Setup was easy--all you need to do is unpack the items, connect the 10-100 cable if you have a broadband internet connection, connect the AV cable, then connect the power cable. That's it! It just took a couple of minutes to create an XBOX live account (I picked the \"Gold\" one) and I was good to go.The 360 is compatbile with some original XBOX games; evidently it uses some sort of small \"bootstrap\" or stub software programs for emulation, and it looks like around 8gb or so of the hard drive is formatted as an original XBOX HD, so my guess is when you put a program in that's recognized, it \"thinks\" it's running on an XBOX. I tried some of my games and they worked fine (Halo2, San Andreas, Ninja Gaiden, Fable, even starting with the old XBOX logo, and showing the old XBOX interface when I went on line in Halo. Cool! And MS is saying they are constantly working on making more and more games \"compatible.\"As soon as I played a couple of the \"new\" games, well, I just had to go \"shopping\" and pickup some more 360 titles, just call it my early xmas present haha. I have pretty much all the popular titles now and enjoy them all a lot. But it's sort of funny one of my favorite games turned out to be \"Texas Hold Em\" that you can get through XBOX arcade; I spend hours on line in it, haha. So here I am, with a brand new 360, hundreds of dollars worth of new games, and I spend all night in Texas Hold Em. Oh well, haha.Finally I would like to state my experience with the hardware and offer some tips: There have been many reports of system problems and overheating, I have not experienced any. My 360 runs from 3 to 14 hours a day, and has been doing just fine, in fact it doesnt get warm at all, although the power brick does, just a little. I think that if there is overheating, it might be caused by standing it vertically; I keep mine horizontal so that all of the vent openings are uncovered, and it sits on a desk close to my TV, rather then being enclosed in a stereo cabinet, or whatnot. I would guess that if there are overheating problems, those would be the causes. I also have not had any DVD reading problems; maybe becuase my 360 is a later generation (built in 5/06).I would highly recommend this console, it's great. I can't wait for the next games to come out; there are supposed to be some awesome ones in the next few months.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2006"}

I understand how much came with that first set but the microphone was small and didn't feel anything like a real microphone. I enjoy wireless equipment and I was hoping to find an upgrade for the lousy microphone that was included in the set and Logitech provides an excellent alternative for those who share my disdain for it.The microphone is fairly easy to use and set up. It's very light which is odd since its much bigger than the normal microphone that they give you. It's about the same size as my real microphone but much lighter. The microphone doesn't miss a note and is great for people who love to play and sing at the same time. I have a stand for normal microphones and this one works with that quite well. The receiver it comes with doubles as a stand but it's wobbly and isn't really meant for that (or it is and isn't very good). I don't have a headset for my playstation 3 and was hoping to use this as a communication microphone as well. It can be done but the wobbly receiver stand makes that more annoying and tedious than it should be. Despite that small negative this is still a great purchase.it's a shame the games don't all come with wireless equipment but this is a top of the line microphone for those looking to upgrade their level of game.

With the WaveBird Wireless Controller, you can play up to 100 hours on just two AA batteries.","reviewerName":"romevi","summary":"A great controller, but not my preferential GCN controller.","reviewText":"If you know the GameCube controller you know what you're getting here--except wireless.A few years ago I found a stock of platinum ones at my local Walmart. They were all on sale for $25; I have no idea how that happened. My guess was that they had found old stock in the back.This was around the time the Wii was still hard to find, and production of the WaveBirds had long since ceased. You can imagine my joy when I found them while glancing through Wally's World.But I still wanted the other color just to complete my collectionist mentality, so I ordered the gray one.Now, some time later I purchased the white GameCube controller for the Wii from Amazon. At $30 with free shipping it seemed (and was) a very good deal. Yes, they are directly imported from Japan, but there's no reason you'd need to be concerned unless for some reason you NEED the box in English. They're fine, and I believe the only way to get them was by importing anywayThe benefit of these over the regular GameCube controller? The lengthier cord.But why choose cord when you can have a wireless WaveBird?The construction quality is the same, but that's to be expected from anything by Nintendo. The WB is slightly heavier in that the two AA batteries in the back of the controller make it weightier. They don't come with a built-in rechargeable battery, but I prefer that as I get to use my enelooops.Included in the packaging is a receiver which you plug into the GameCube controller port. It's a little longer than necessary, but I imagine that's to accommodate the antenna. There are wheels on the bottoms of both the controller and receiver, and these click for each number from 1-9 (at least I think the last number is 9). Just match the numbers from controller to the receiver and you're good to go.When I purchased the gray controller used it didn't come with a receiver, but the one included with my platinum worked with it just fine so long as they matched in number.Despite being wireless, and despite how rare the WaveBird may appear, I actually prefer the regular white GameCube controller for three main reasons: 1) comfort; 2) no input latency; 3) rumble.1While the WaveBird and corded controllers are identical in form and size, there is a little bit of extra plastic underneath the WaveBird to allow for the batteries and wheel. While it may not bother some, it actually hinders me from perfectly gripping the controller. My fingers don't wrap around the handles as well as the corded controller, and my unused fingers actually cramp after a while.I'm a 5'8\" male with smaller-than-average hands, if that helps you determine my hand size.2I haven't come across this, but some have complained about games not receiving inputs correctly because the WB is wireless. It's true that having cords and a direct plug-in will always lead to higher input ratio than wireless, but I haven't had issues with my games not recognizing my button presses. Still, it's something to note, especially if you're playing certain games where every button press and stick maneuver is crucial, like SSB or Mario Kart.3Rumble.I love it. I need my rumble.Many consider it a gimmick. Sony tried to denounce it as an excuse for not having it when the PS3 initially came with a SIXAXIS controller. But I've loved the rumble feature ever since the first DualShock came out. If I have the option of using a controller with rumble, I'll go for it.There's my review.

{"product_name":"B001C4C4KW","reviewerName":"DryvBy","summary":"Welcome to Evil Academy, honor students.","reviewText":"Fans of the hybrid-genre strategy-RPG have probably already played through a Disgaea game before. It's a parody of the genre itself, making fun of every aspect the genre keeps sacred and exaggerates it. Disgaea's known for it's ridiculous stats, level caps, and gameplay length (try over 1,000 hours). And with each installment, everything becomes more and more ridiculous. For example in Disgaea 3, one of the trophies is to cause over ten billion damage to an enemy, while another trophy is rewarded for doing a 255 hit combo. If you're new to the series, that's a taste of what you're in for. A time-consuming game with incredible \"numbers\" and a story that is full of high-quality humor.The game takes place in the pits of the underworld at a school for demons known as Evil Academy. At Evil Academy, being a delinquent means going to class and doing homework. So naturally, being an Honor Student means skipping class and forgetting to do homework. The protagonist, Mao, is the school's best Honor Student. His main goal is to defeat his dad, the Overlord and chairman of Evil Academy. Why would a son want to destroy his father? Power. And a small twist that hilariously ridiculous. Since Mao is obsessed with comic books and video games, he realizes that to defeat his father, he'll need to become a \"Hero\", since the hero always defeats the boss. From there, he's joined by a host of unlikely partners including the school's greatest delinquent, Raspberyl. During the adventure, Raspberyl's \"evil\" influence on Mao creates much more trouble than he can handle.Revealing too much more would ruin several surprises scattered throughout the lengthy storyline. Did I mention length? The game's main story takes hours upon hours to complete. And the way it's presented may be a little off-putting to some. There's hardly any cutscene action. Most of the story is presented by showing a non-animated character avatar on the screen with spoken dialog between characters. It's presentation may be off-putting to newcomers, but if you can bare through it all, you'll end up with an excellent story that will have you laughing and thinking about death and get sad and stuff.In-between the story, you'll prepare for battle using various shops and your Classroom Assembly. Classroom Assembly is where you rearrange characters to setup partner combos, pass bills that allow access to better gear and more, and create new characters. It's the same thing as the Dark Assembly in the previous games, just with more features. If you're not watching cutscenes or managing your characters, then welcome to battle. Battling on a grid map is the core of the game with only a warp portal to allow your characters onto the map. You'll set up your characters by moving them to locations according to how many move points you have and attacking if able. This is all turn-based, but it does manage to move quickly. Playing this game like a typical strategy-RPG will lead to a complete failure. Remember, this game is ridiculous and with that comes ridiculous strategies. One of the abilities you'll use is stacking all of your characters on top of each other and performing a massive combo attack. Or you may end up juggling a character in the air for a few minutes with attacks with another character until it's way past the time of extinction.There's also Geo Blocks (colored blocks) which are randomly placed throughout the map, along with various associated colors that power up the space it's on depending on the color. By destroying a Geo Block on the same color space will result in damage to anything standing on it, as well as the removal or color change of said block. Confused? As an example, a Prinny standing on a red space may give the Prinny a power up of +100% health. Let's say you're on the other side of the map with a blue Geo Block in front of you that happens to be on a red space of it's own. You can attack it and change the red spaces on the map to blue, which also causes Prinny a little bit of damage due to the color change. This also causes the newly created blue space to use a different power up/down depending on what the Geo Block's specialty was. There's also a combo system with these too. In the same scenario, if another red space on the map holds a green Geo Block and you just changed everything to blue, then that red space will change to blue, damage the green Geo Block, then begin changing all blue spaces to green and so forth. This combo system may drain a character completely of it's health or close to it. It's a complicated system that requires you to check out your map before just randomly hacking away at enemies.After you beat the game, the game then begins. You'll spend the rest of the time doing small side quests and grinding levels. There's a grinding that's going to take place. You'll not only be leveling up your characters, but you'll also jump through a series of grinding in a place called Item World. Let's say you have a wicked axe or armor piece but it's starting to lose it's edge. In Item World, you begin a series of fights inside the item you want to level. Depending on how well you did, you can improve your items value and stat points enough to keep it with you for several more levels. It's a cool idea, but it requires just more grinding. The maps are randomly generated so that will at least keep things interesting while you grind. On top of Item World, you'll fight pirates, aliens, and more weirdness throughout the underworld. The level cap is 9,999 and levels aren't handed to you like you'd think. Again, there's going to be some grinding to achieve that high of a level.While the sounds are just fine with great battle music and outstanding voice acting, the games biggest weakness comes from it's graphics. The backgrounds are high-definition and the avatars are presented in high-definition, but the in-game sprites look like nothing more than a stretched out pixelated mess. The animations are smooth and the combo system is bright and colorful, just like you'd expect from Disgaea, but there's nothing special that stands out in the graphics. This game would have easily ran on the PlayStation 2.Outside of the graphics and the grinding gameplay, the game is excellent and should be played if not for the incredible anime story it presents. If you're new to the series, this is a good place to start. It's addicting and fun, but you just have to bare with it. If you've tried Disgaea before and hated it, Disgaea 3 isn't going to change that. There's nothing that's drastically changed from the past.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2012"}

It seems the Mother Brain has returned...","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"Metroid on the Super Nintendo","reviewText":"It's unbelievable to me how many perfect or near-perfect scores Super Metroid has received from game players all across the internet.  To this day, gamers STILL have the time of their lives running, blasting and spin attacking their way through each and every area of the planet to reach the final stage and face the evil Mother Brain.Now, I'll be the first to admit that this game had me totally floored back in 1994 (which led to me spending an ENTIRE summer playing the game, much to my mother's displeasure) but I'm afraid over time I've began to notice a few small problems that make it very hard for me to give the game a perfect grade.  Keep in mind I think Super Metroid is still, after all these years, one of the best adventure/shooters ever made, but I can't give in to childhood memories and whip out a 5-star rating.  Sorry!  One problem is the challenge.  This game is incredibly easy.  I can't believe so many people find it difficult to progress through the game.  Come on, those nasty space pirates you fight in the beginning part of the game only require ONE hit to defeat!  It's funny how something so nasty-looking can be defeated so easily!And the easiness doesn't stop there- throughout the game you encounter simple enemy after simple enemy.  It's a shame, because one of the most important things about the Metroid series should be the challenge, and when you take that away you're left with a game that feels like it's intended for 5 year olds.  I just wish it was like the original Metroid in that each enemy you walk up to requires a good four or five shots to completely destroy.  Shooting and killing them with only one shot is ridiculous, especially when you consider that the weapon you're using to defeat them is just your regular blaster and not some kind of special upgrade.  It also drives me crazy how every enemy you defeat seems to conveniently leave you a purple energy ball, and most of the time you will receive the BIG energy ball, and as you probably know the big ball is the one that recovers more of your health.  Nintendo made the game so you can't lose, basically.My only guess is that this \"challenge\" gamers frequently speak of is the difficulty in finding all the weapons and other important items because, to be fair, MANY of the weapons and items in Super Metroid are hidden quite well.  Without a walkthrough it's easy to miss something, even if you walk past the same area a hundred times.  This is where your weapons, such as the power bomb, come in handy.  Many of the secret areas throughout the planet require a power bomb to break through sections of a wall, and some of these places are where you least expect, because many times there's no sign something is hidden.I've heard other complaints about this game.  Granted, they're not popular complaints (and only a small amount of people actually believe them).  But I happen to be one of those people, and the complaint I'm speaking of is the lack of enemies throughout the planet.  Many times you find yourself walking across boring empty areas, desperately searching for something to shoot.  An example would be walking from the spaceship all the way to the Wrecked Ship area.  On your way you only see a couple enemies around, and if you ask me there should be a LOT more.  To be fair, again, this isn't a major complaint, but the more you play the game the more you notice things like this, and in the end you wish more weird-looking creatures or space pirates were around so you'd have something to shoot as you walk to the next area.  I guess this is probably just me complaining about \"never having enough\".  Well, tough.  This is how I am, so you mine as well get used to it. :)The graphics are phenomenal, which is one HUGE positive with Super Metroid.  You've heard countless times someone refer to something as \"unique\" and you're probably getting sick and tired of it.  Well, in this case, the graphics ARE totally unique, because I can't think of another game out there that shares the kind of graphics featured in this game.  I can understand people who aren't comfortable with the music in Super Metroid and find it disturbing.  Just imagine how freaky the music was for me back in 1994 when a game like this was the first of its kind!Anyway, the one thing that makes this a must-own game and near classic is the long, gigantic maze of a planet you need to explore.  Yes, despite the lack of challenge from the planet enemies (ALL of them) and the emptiness of much of the world, exploring each new room CAN be a lot of fun.  You'll want to keep searching until you discover every little missile or energy tank available, and that is what a good adventure game should do.One thing that IS hard is the wall jump technique, which has a tendency to baffle many people.  You see, you have to jump near a wall and press certain buttons on the controller at just the right moment, and you will bounce off the wall (any wall) and repeatedly bounce in an upward direction.  If your timing is off just a *little* you won't be able to make the move happen, and Samus will fall straight down (not that falling down kills you instantly, unless you land on spikes and stay there).  Some gamers can't master the wall jump, while others become really good at it and think it's a nifty way to grab hard-to-reach items early in the game.  I think if you practice enough eventually you WILL be good at it.  It is tricky, though.  But when you finally get the hang of it, you'll find out how useful it is. I should also mention that the wall jump technique is NOT a requirement (except in one area).  It's just a trick to learn if you feel like it.I can't think of anything else to talk about... oh wait, yes, those big ugly nasty bosses you have to fight are SO COOL!  Kraid, as you've read by now, is a drastic improvement over his appearance in the original NES Metroid because now he takes up TWO SCREENS!  Back in the day this was known as the coolest thing ever.  Unfortunately, to bring back a complaint from early in my review, Kraid can be defeated by using only a few super missiles.  Once again, this is making the game too darn EASY and Nintendo should have made Kraid, along with the rest of the bosses, harder to defeat.  They should have made Kraid like in the original Metroid, where you were required to waste a LOT of regular missiles in order to defeat him.  I love fighting that octopus-looking thing in the Wrecked Ship level.  That thing is cool.  Ridley is awesome and packs a mean punch.  He's my favorite boss battle because it's all about power versus power.  The Mother Brain is an absolute JOKE to fight.  Even if you only manage to find 100 missles (there's 230 of them total) she's STILL a simple boss fight, and this includes BOTH her incarnations. Heck, in her second form when she changes into something bigger and badder, she's actually easier!The different areas of the planet are beautifully designed, too.  I especially think Norfair, even though it's creepy and covered in fire, is a cool looking area featuring some of the scariest looking monsters and the sweetest background graphics in the game.  Maridia, the underwater stage, is another very nice looking place filled with fish and other creatures, some of which live in the sand.  I'm a little disappointed Tourian has only 15 Metroids for you to freeze and destroy, which is unlike the original Metroid where you had to face 30 of them or so.Even though it seems I am somewhat putting the game down, I think it's a wonderful, addicting game, and it comes very close to being one of the very best shooters ever. I believe if Nintendo had worked on the challenge I would have given the game a higher score.  You should buy it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2006"}

After days of tense negotiations, the Soviets finally agreed on the 28th   to withdraw their missiles from Cuban soil. With the resolution of this   incident, later to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it    seemed that humanity had survived yet another threat to its existence.However, there was a secret condition in the deal that put an end to   the crisis. Nokolai Stepanovich Sokolov, a Soviet scientist who had   defected    to the West, was to be sent back to the Soviet Union. The U.S.   government agreed to this stipulation, and returned Sokolov back to his   native    land. Little did they know that Sokolov was to be the designer of a   nightmarish weapon. Now, with Sokolov back in their hands, the Soviets    are ready to resume its development. If this weapon is completed, it   will mark the beginning of a new age of fear.August 1964. Realizing at last the urgency of the situation, the CIA   forms a plan to recapture Sokolov. They dispatch the covert FOX unit    to Sokolov's research facility, located to the south of the great   Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero,   FOX is a    next-generation special-forces unit that operates both as a   specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit. The FOX   unit's modus    operandi is to send a single agent, backed by radio support from afar,   into enemy territory to carry out solo sneaking missions.August 24.

Set 150 years from now, the world has been ruined by war and ecological disaster with only a handful of survivors remaining.End Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"B. Cooper","summary":"Enslaved: Crossing into Hollywood","reviewText":"It's not difficult to imagine that Enslaved began as a concept for a CGI movie before becoming a fully realized next-gen game. The voicework and motion capture of Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings - Gollum) takes center stage, ultimately delivering a highly enjoyable cinematic journey that does not attempt to redefine the platforming or action-adventure genres.  Although there are a few small problems that keep the game from reaching critical acclaim, Ninja Theory realizes that many of todays gamers are looking to purchase a game they can watch as much as play.  Some videogames like the Uncharted series tread this line masterfully and offer a rich story that continually puts you in the action.  Enslaved often feels like it is on auto-mode in an attempt to keep you enticed by the narrative, frequently guiding you throughout platforming sections and giving you simple actions to repeat for boss fights.  However, the game ultimately earns its credibility by reassuring gamers why they play games at all: to have fun.  Enslaved may not be perfect, but if you enjoy action adventure games and sci-fi films then the west will amaze you.NEGATIVES:-This game has a few bugs in the CGI realm. When first introduced to the character \"Piggy\" the dialogue cuts out for about 15 seconds during a cut scene. Characters can splice in and out of the background during a few short cut scenes as well. To the game's credit, I was actually able to overlook this drawback without letting it seriously impact the game's review. Perhaps Ninja Theory would do well in the future to have a bit more QA though.-Ending leaves a bit to be desired. Feels like an effort to become more pretentious that the rest of the story suggested.-Not quite as \"polished\" looking as other games released within the same period, but still beautiful due to art design.-Game lasts about 10 hours.-Enemies are not as diverse as other action games and most can be defeated using similar combos-No notable extras upon completionBOTH:+/- Combat is both a positive and a negative depending on your playing preference.  It can be varied and extremely fun if you choose to utilize different combos and tactics. However, Combat is dull if you do not upgrade, and/or utilize various unlockable techniques. I also recommend playing at 1 higher difficulty level that what you would typically select for a more satisfying challenge.+/- Platforming in Enslaved is Extremely Fast Paced and somewhat different than other recent additions to the genre.  Monkey can climb fluidly and execute a variety of moves in rapid succession; however, these animated segments offer little challenge when compared to similar games.  Every foothold or vertical path is highlighted by a flashing gold light, and the game will not allow you to initiate a jump unless the subsequent hold is within reach.  I believe that the design choice to not allow Monkey to fling himself wildly into space was made in an effort to make his character more maneuverable and believable.  If the player was allowed to navigate without any boundaries they would be constantly restarting the section because of the speed at which Monkey climbs. The trade-off between speed and freedom pays off in the context of the story and character portrayal even though more serious gamers will be disappointed by the lack of challenge and obvious hand-holding the game forces upon you.POSITIVES:+Facial animation and voice-work is PHENOMENAL! Motion-capture for this game represents the pinnacle of video game animation for the time of its October 2010 release.  This element has had a serious impact on the score I've given.+Storyline is Excellent even though the ending leaves a little to be desired.  Story was written by the author of the zombie film 28 Days Later.+Atmosphere is Rich, Color Palette is Alluring, Character/Mech Design is Awesome.+Collecting Orbs for Upgrades is much more Satisfying than it was for Prince of Persia, despite any similarities. Every Golden Orb has worth (more than just 1 spending point), and upgrades become easy to acquire and immensely useful as you spend time acquiring them.+\"Cloud\" hoverboard is utilized very well during several different sections and is always fun and exciting.+Game Pacing is superb. All elements fit together very well and offer variation after previous sections. Lots of distinct moments interwoven within story-driven sequences.+Music never deters from impact of story and ultimately fits well within both gameplay and CGI. Uses the \"less is more\" approach, but in a way that complements the scenery very well.Overall, this is a game that has become easy to recommend.  Although hardcore gamers may find some faults with the difficulty and gameplay design, if you enjoy a game with heart then I encourage you to become enticed by Enslaved.

{"product_name":"B00008DHNL","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Very Good Game but probably not Vice City","reviewText":"True Crimes of LA is actually a pretty good game. You get to explore a much bigger city than in GTA: Vice City, but the stale gameplay and such can easily bring this game down a notch. While more realistic in everyway, True Crime can be considered one of the more innovative games of this time!First the graphics. The graphics in this game are ASTONISHING! They're almost realistic in everyway! Surprisingly enough the game looks like REAL L.A. (with the exception of there not being much traffic.). So as far as eye-candy goes, True Crimes does a brilliant job here.Now the sound. Again, no mistakes here! Good sound overall, and you can't go wrong here. Sound effects are great as well as the music. Again, you're not going wrong. The only thing I can say is that if you don't like Rap, you may not like the soundtrack as much.Gameplay is probably where te game begins to faulter. The game has a \"Good Cop/Bad Cop\" system which isn't a bad idea. Should you do things the way a cop in real life would (i.e. you don't kill those you capture, you only injure, you fire warning shots and only shoot people in the leg and such) then you'll be considered a \"Good Cop\". Do the complete opposite and you're a \"Bad Cop.\" There is a meter that tells you on which side of the bar you fall on.Good Cop/Bad Cop isn't too badly done, but it really brings down the difficulty level of this game. It's fun to drive around but the game is so simple to keep to one side. If you see someone rob a bank you can easily just hit them with your car and not kill them, which results in you being a \"Good Cop\". If you hit him and kill him, you're a \"Bad Cop\". This becomes simple gameplay should you approach it that way.What also makes gameplay simple is that you can choose to redo any failed missions. Clearly you could try them over and over again until the game is done with. BUT you could continue and leave mission failed. If you do this it effects future missions. Missions are very realistic. You can go undercover and hope you don't blow it even. You can do various things that a cop would do. You can search them and see if you find drugs, weapons, etc. or you could flash your badge, which will result in a suspect running or something else.What's not to like about the gameplay? Well, it's too simple for one thing. I already talked about how you could hit a suspect with a car and not kill them, and this finishes missions easily. The other part is that you could easily complete missions without shooting (just knock them out). The auto-aim is very nice however.The other bad thing about the gamplay are those camera angles. You'll find yourself constantly repositioning the camera just to see some of the action. Because of the camera you could be \"jumped\" and never know who did it, or get shot from behind.The game presents a branching story. The outcome depends on the missions you succeed in and whether or not you're a \"Good Cop\" or a \"Bad Cop\". There are tons of ways to go through the story but the final confrontation is the same. You \"could\" become a bad guy but it makes no difference.The story is actually more like something you'd see in an action movie. You've got your average jerky character (Nick Kang) who doesn't want a partner and constantly refuses to work with his and goes at it alone. His father used to be a part of the LAPD but died working a case. Sound familiar? It should, and it's full of chase scenes, one liners, and everything else you could want in an action movie.So while larger than Vice City by A LOT the game is actually fairly linear. The storyline is decent (although the main character takes a bit of time to like), the gameplay is nice and overall the game is pretty good.The Good:+Great graphics and sound!+Though quite linear, TONS of missions+Lots of weapons to choose from+Branching story+Multiple endings+HUGE City to exploreThe Bad-Main character is unlikeable at first-Annoying Camera Angles-Missions are too simpleThe game overall is pretty decent. You've got a lot of freedom to enjoy and a huge map to explore. A great experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

The graphics are blocky, the game audio sounds dated and there is no voice over dialogue.  In fact there are spelling errors in some cases and even poor use of English.  What gives?!  What we have here is a wonderful throwback to gaming of \"ye' olde day\" in the theme of Legend of Zelda.  It breaks the current mold set by today's standards bravely just breaking them in the wrong direction! (A good thing I feel!)  Charge that flux capacitor and floor it to 88 miles per hour , we're taking a trip back in time folks!GAMEPLAY3D Dot Game Heroes aims for what many games of the past strived for in the Atari, NES and early SNES days.  Gameplay!  It was all most games could lean on due to sound, graphics and memory limitations of the time.  From the slightly pixel-ed menu screen to the scrolling dialogue bubbles this game explodes with nostalgia for an old gamer like myself.  The gameplay is fairly solid for this game.  Throughout my adventure there was no freezing or loading problems.  The game did not hand feed you instructions on what to do, yet did not make it too hard that you would get frustrated either. It maintains a nice balance between the two like a good Zelda game can do.  If you ever played Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past then you know what to expect here gameplay wise.  You will be sent on a quest to secure 6 crystals located in 6 different temples.  Along the way you will fight your way through mobs, solve dungeons and fight bosses while gathering a variety of items along the way to aid your journey.The gameplay is fun and enjoyable; However this game knows it is turning the dial back about 15-20 years and isn't afraid to not take itself serious.  Plenty of townsfolk have some funny dialogue mixed in with some nostalgic throw backs.  Hidden caves with the game developers attempting to figure out how to code the game.  Broken English like \"Life Get Up!\" and they even threw in a NAVI clone called Lee. You  know you are in for a crazy ride when you can select your character, and as of patch v1.01 you can select characters such as Santa, a Tank, a dragon, a shark fin, Funky Santa, even Sackboy!GRAPHICSThis is where the game takes a small hick-up.  Graphically the game obviously is no Uncharted 2, Crysis, Killzone 3 etc.  It isn't meant to be. Instead it has this really nice throw back look like a Pixelated version of Lego games but in nice High Def.  There are some nice particle effects when enemies or objects explode, splattering the screen with little dots.  The game also has a nice camera effect when judging distances, a kind of blur effect.  While the graphics are actually really nice, in a throwback way, there also was plenty of times the game would lag when enemies would burst.  Kill too many enemies too fast and the game might FPS chug for a moment.  It isn't bad but at the same time, you aren't rendering massive 720p map textures with explosions and gun fire everywhere so the dip in FPS is a bit surprising; but it is not all that common and really doesn't effect the gameplay at all here.SOUND/STORYThe sound track for this game is really good!  It has this great NES / SNES tone to it, just mastered at a modern bit-rate.  It is like taking your old 8-Bit NES favorites and remastering them today on studio equipment.  All the songs have this really nostalgic theme to them which will make it feel like you are a kid all over again!  Sound Effects are handled fairly well, having that old school kind of sound to them without being to \"old\" sounding.  Just a nice overall balance between old and new.  As for the storyline there isn't much to it.  It pretty much is a near clone of Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, given a slightly different spin but not much.REPLAY/LENGTHThe game itself will probably take you anywhere from 10-14 hours to complete on your first playthough since there will be some time figuring out where to go, backtracking to get some upgrades in towns etc.  This game contains Game+ modes where the difficulty can be increased up to a difficulty where you die in one hit period!  Brutal!  On a Game+ you get to keep all your previous items so a Game+ run might take you only 5-7 hrs to complete since you could just breeze through dungeons with upgraded stuff.  With varying difficulty levels, and lots of hidden stuff to find the game could easily last you 2 or 3 playthroughs.OVERALL B/B+ ... 85%3D Dot Game Heroes is a game which attempts to recreate that nostalgic feel older gamers had when they first sat down to play the classic that is Legend of Zelda.  It does an exceptional job and recreating that old NES/SNES feeling in a game without sacrificing enough that makes this game feel as if it just doesn't belong as a modern title.  It walks the line perfectly.  If you have always been a Zelda fan, or have a craving for some nostalgia this is a great game to pick up.  While it is not perfect by any means the game captures what made old games so good and gives that old dusty game a nice modern polish.*NOTE: You can also create your own character from scratch*NOTE: While you can eventually create a sword that pretty much will equal an \"I WIN\" Button, I feel this was almost intentional as on Spelunker difficulty you die in one hit.  So in a way a GAME+ mode w/ that sword and 1 hit deaths kind of balances out.*NOTE: I found the game to actually be easier to play with the D pad instead of the Analog stick","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00009WAUK","description":"You can almost hear the collective drooling of RPG and Game Boy fans worldwide. As the inaugural Nintendo/Square reunion title,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancehas a lot to live up to--and it does, spectacularly!The long heralded Final Fantasy series has enjoyed a number of spin-offs and sequels. Using the familiar character types and classes of the Final Fantasy series, but with a wholly original storyline,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancecreates an immersive world of strategic combat and conquest.Snow JobWhile most fantasy games favor romantic landscapes,Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceslyly starts out in a plain-vanilla suburb. Players assume the role of young Marche Radiuju in the humble burg of St. Ivalice.A snowball fight introduces the characters and sets the groundwork for future battles. After a brief (but chilly) skirmish, Marche heads home to visit his younger brother.Marche MadnessSoon after, Marche's friends drop by to show him an ancient book of mysterious origins. After failing to translate the text properly, Marche's friends leave for the evening. After a wistful slumber, Marche awakens and realizes he isn't in Ivalice anymore... or is he?Alone in a foreign land, Marche quickly comes under the care of a helpful creature known as a Moogle. It doesn't take much to convince Marche to adopt a lucrative career as a mercenary.Gangs of IvaliceA quick stop at the town inn introduces Marche to his new gang. A motley crew at best, your associates include low-level monks, mages, archers, and soldiers. The only hope you have of finding your way home is to turn your ragtag group of misfits into a finely tuned fighting force.Begin your tour of duty by chatting up the local barkeep. He'll clue you in to interesting news bits, rumors, and job opportunities. Due to your severe lack of experience, early quests are little more than errands.As you gain experience and reputation, your job options grow as well as the rewards. You can also send one of your crew members on side missions for extra swag. You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy. Attacking an enemy from behind or the side will yield much higher hit percentages than head-on attacks.Job FairWhat you do off the battlefield is arguably more important than what you do on it. Thanks to a stable economy, your characters can usually change job classes once they gain enough experience.Need a little more magic in your life? Try turning one of your grunts into a mage. There are more than 30 different job classes available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Even in far-off fantasy lands, commercialism is a way of life. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll end up spending your hard-earned greenbacks on shiny new stuff. Weapons and armor serve not only to boost your stats, but also grant special abilities to specific character types and species.While one sword might grant tremendous attack points, a seemingly lesser sword may give its wielder access to a special attack that can tip the scales in your favor. Thanks to the law system, one should never get too attached to a single piece of equipment.Face ValueGorgeous character illustrations and 2D sprites harken back to Square's 16-bit glory days. Each of the shops, inns, towns, and fields is superbly detailed, with subtle background animations.Final Fantasy Tactics Advancemaintains the series' stellar rep for technically and visually brilliant summon attacks.Uniquely,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancefeatures three separate display settings, depending on whether you're playing on the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, or the Game Boy Player. Each setting offers different levels of brightness, contrast, and saturation to appease even the most fickle of gamers.The only thing that can rival the on-screen wonders is the audio candy. It is no surprise why Square Enix's soundtracks are the most sought-after in the video game community.Lasting PowerNeedless to say, there are hours upon hours of gameplay packed into this tiny little cartridge. Square Enix has done a tremendous job in creating an easily accessible yet incredibly deep gameplay experience. Plug into one of the finest strategy RPG experiences ever created withFinal Fantasy Tactics Advance.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"FFTA: Final Fantasy Tactics for Amateurs","reviewText":"After a long absence from Nintendo, Square finally brings Final Fantasy back to Nintendo consoles. Final Fantasy Tactics Advance seems like a promising game, but for those who really enjoyed Final Fantasy Tactics on the original Playstation, this is a completely different experience.The game begins with a turtorial (actually a snowball fight) to help you get adjusted. You play as Marche, a young boy who has just moved to the town of St. Ivalice. He engages in a snowball fight at school where he becomes friends with Mewt and Ritz, two fellow classmates that are constantly picked on. After school, Mewt goes to the library and checks out a book with a title too hard to read but over time, the tome has been referred to as \"Final Fantasy.\" Marche and his friends soon talk about how great it would be to be in a game. When the three go to sleep the world around them suddenly changes and they awaken in the Final Fantasy universe. Marche now decides he wants to go home but neither of his friends want to.The story, for Final Fantasy, is weak. Compared to the series (and its big brother on Playstation) this story lacks creativity and insight. The story is too simple and predictable and there aren't really any breathtaking twist that the FF series is known for. In all essence, its childish.The gameplay in FFTA isn't all that bad. The cutscenes before each engagement are a little long and can't be skipped (and if you lose the first battle you'll have to sit through the tutorial AND long intro all over again). But battling is simple and easy to get used to. Much like most tactical games you move a certain number of spaces and then act.FFTA puts a twist on battling, and its not one to be too fond of. Each battle now has laws and a judge to moniter the battle. If a character breaks the law (friend or foe) they're issued a card. A yellow card is given for a minor offense and a red card for a major offense. At first this seems creative but as the game goes on you have to deal with more and more laws. Soon they get annoying. They change each time you go to a new location but soon the game incorporates three laws per battle. Laws that soon they enemy never seems to break. Some laws don't let you use items, some even restrict the fight command! Then there are some of the more stupid laws such as preventing you to heal your characters or even to do damage to a monster! Soon, the laws become downright annoying.Along battling, there are lots of subquests that go along with the normal missions. There are 300 missions in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. That means you'll be able to fight lots of battles and raise your characters to the fullest right? Unfortunately, only 1/3 of these missions allow you to do any interaction. The other 200 are simply \"dispatch\" missions where you'll send a character out for a certain period of time (either after a certain number of days, certain number of battles or certain number of enemies killed) and they'll either return with a success or failure.Then there are the abilities. In the original Final Fantasy Tactics after each attack you got Job Points and Experience points. You could spend your Job Points to learn more abilities. This would've been good to bring back but instead FFTA makes you learn abilities by what weapons you equip and earning AP. Most weapons require 200 or 300 AP. Every now and then you'll find one that needs more. From each encounter with either a wandering clan or after a mission you'll get anywhere from 40-80 AP. It won't take you much time to figure out that you'll learn abilities quite slowly. Especially since, once you get further into the game battles begin to pace even slower. ONLY characters who participate in the battle get AP and if you send on on a dispatch mission only the dispatch gains AP.The visual look of FFTA is astonishing and it runs quite well. The graphics aren't 3D but 2D only isometric, so it looks 3D. This is nice but sometimes characters become to crowded amongst each other and the judge will also get in the way. Since its isometric, the camera is at a fixed angle so you can't move it around. The game is VERY vibrant and colorful and showers some nice eye-candy. A GBA game has never looked this good before.I wish I could say the music is as good as the graphics. FFTA doesn't really have \"Bad\" tunes. Mostly the game suffers from not having enough tunes. The soundtrack doesn't have a variety. It doesn't sound as good as the original on PSX and even for GBA it sounds lackluster when compared to other games such as \"Golden Sun\" or \"Castlevania: Circle of the Moon\". The soundtrack is also very limited. So limited that I got very tired of hearing some tunes and turned the volume down ever once and a while. The sound effects are very nice though and when you KO a character they give a little scream that sounds very realistic.The last problem with FFTA is how easy the game is. The original Final Fantasy Tactics... well... actually required you to use tactics. This one doesn't require nearly as much strategy. In fact, as long as you have a character who is equipped with a good weapon you'll be able to win everytime (you won't even have to worry about healing unless the laws are totally against you). There are more varieties of job classes in this one but you really won't find yourself switching to learn abilities all that much.Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is by no means a bad game. Its a little too easy and too childish for the FFT veteran but it can be enjoyable if you make the most of it.OVERALL:On the positive side+Beautiful Graphics!+A few good tunes+Good voices+A variety of job classes+Judge system makes the game unique but...+Easy and simple to playBut of course with all the good stuff there are the bad things-You can't rotate the camera in battle, when characters get bunched up its hard to place them when you can't see!-The soundtrack isn't big enough, and the music isn't as good-Abilities take too long to learn-The Judge System is downright annoying-The game is TOO easy","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"A Review About More Than Just the Graphics","reviewText":"I have to admit I didn't know much about Gears of War before I bought it so I don't know about the hype. However, I'm sure they were comparing it to Halo. At the end of the review I'll let you know how it compares. Please note I'm only reviewing the campaign part of Gears of War.The things I like about Gears of War:The graphics are amazing just like the feeling when you first played a truly 3-D game over a decade ago. Lighting creates subtleties that only come in real life. Movement is natural as well as all of the physics. Faces have astounding detail and just an overall realism to them. You really have to see it to believe it. It is truly a next generation game and warrants the extra money. The gameplay is intense. I could actually feel my heart rate climb while I played it. It is mostly setup in small areas where you can use various objects to hide behind to as to keep your character alive. Even on the \"casual\" setting the enemy is relentless so action is nearly constant. You can also hide behind objects and shoot around the corner which keeps you alive a lot longer.The whole interface for changing weapons and reloading is fairly intuitive; many will get used to it in a half an hour or so. Grenades are easy to use because you get a trajectory map for where it will fall. Having a chainsaw attached to your machine gun is definitely a plus. Physics in the game are the most lifelike I've yet seen. Guns have a correct range and bodies are not just gone once you kill them; they can be moved around and blown up some more if you so desire. Chairs, couches, clocks and dressers are all destructible too. Another very helpful thing is intelligent team members and the ability to command them to a certain extent. The levels are quite varied and keep you from getting bored of the surroundings. Something else that definitely is enthralling is the element of fear. You walk into an area and don't ever have a very good idea if anything is going to jump out at you.Things I don't like about Gears of WarThe major problem I have with the game is the lack of explanation within the story. It seems as if most of the story is based upon Marcus Fenix's quarrels with the \"Gears\" which is the military group he belongs to. You only get to see glimpses of the background behind these locusts. I feel like I was supposed to read a book before I got the game, because I don't have a very good idea what is going on. A few other things that really bother me, but which might not bother other first person shooter fans are: A closed in feeling everywhere you play, not just in environment but also in movement of your character. Many things are preset such as jumping over walls and running is done by holding down the A button and then you have cover while you run. Unfortunately while you're running you can't shoot or turn very well. Many of the movements seem to be like automatic which can get really annoying.A lot of the game is based on staying behind concrete, walls and doorways to avoid fire. For example, if you are walking down a hall and just want to run it is difficult to keep yourself from smashing up against the wall for cover. I also personally don't like the fact that it isn't technically a first person shooter; what I mean is that when you go to aim you are actually looking over the person's should instead of being their eyes. As I said before the gameplay is intense and at some times so intense it just ends up being over the top. The idea of blood splattering on the screen is great, but not while you are trying to kill something-You can't see! Many areas of the game have objectives you have to complete, but give little or no idea on how to complete them. In one area you are coming out of the back of a house and are trying to get onto a helicopter to escape. You are told to get to the helicopter immediately all the while 10-12 enemies are in the way. Do you kill the enemies or get of the helicopter? Apparently both. Also until one of my team members died I didn't know you failed as well when that happens.Is the game better than the halo franchise? No, not in my opinion, but Halo definitely has some solid competition where previously they didn't. Gears of War missed on a few key areas. Gameplay is rigid. You can't truly jump and everything feels limited in general. Even in the giant cave part of the game there is an obvious and minimal area of exploration. Secondly, the weapon I used 95% of the time was the machine gun and the other 5% I used the shotgun. It isn't that the other weapons aren't effective, they just have fundamental problems. The pistol is inaccurate and the recoil is enough to throw you off target. The RPG that the \"boomers\" use is difficult to get anywhere near a person. The torque bow is great if you have the time to not only aim but wait for the thing to be fully contracted. So unlike Halo where any weapon when used correctly is lethal, Gears of War makes the machine gun the most lethal. The other between the two is obviously the story. Not the storyline itself, but the fact that barely anything is told about your enemy, the main character, who the Gears are, if they are super soldiers, what time period it is or what the enemy is trying to do. This isn't just a personal predicament I have with the game either. In this day and age, if you don't have a well developed storyline people will think the game is one dimensional.On gameplay I would rate it a 7/10, graphics: 10/10, storyline: 6/10 (only because it is so enigmatic), replay value 6/10, music: 5/10 (only remember hearing it twice over the course of twelve hours) and overall value 7/10. I really can't see how this is a \"revolutionary\" game. It is a great game, but in the long run will be forgotten.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2006"}

{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"dark54555 \"dark54555\"","summary":"Nothing short of a masterpiece","reviewText":"To quote IGN: \"This game not only revolutionizes the Zelda series, but the Action/Adventre genre as a whole.\"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker is the latest game in one of the most popular series in gaming history.  This game takes and builds on the story of Ocarina of Time, occuring over 100 years after the \"Hero of Time,\" our previous Link, saved the land of Hyrule from the evil Gannondorf.  Now the land of Hyrule has once again been plunged into darkness, and it's people are waiting for the Hero of Time, a man dressed in green to return.  When he does not, the people fear all is lost.  It's about this time when our new hero turns 12 and puts on his own green outfit, a gift from his grandmother.Gameplay:If you've played Ocarina of Time, the controls should feel fairly familiar to you.  This is because the game runs on what is essentially an upgraded Ocarina battle engine.  The main difference is the C stick now controls the camera fully, and the camera, when working on its own, is much smarter.  This elminates one of the main complaints from Ocarina, the bad camera angles.  Link once again has a whole array of items to find and use on his quest, many that are familliar and some that are new.  This mix keeps the game fresh.Graphics:Ever since the debut of the new graphical style of The Wind Waker, nicknamed \"Cel-da,\" many people, myself included, have been sceptical.  However, Nintendo did an excellent job, producing what is probably the first effective use of cell shaded graphics in the video game industry.  In game, people's faces have a much more noticable emotion, which ads depth to the game as a whole.  Moreover, the cell textures are much more rich than was anticipated, making the game almost a work of art.Sound:Sound is where most of the critics have voiced their complaints, as some of the music has a midi feel.  However, with the use of many old sounds from Ocarina and A Link to the Past, I think the slightly midi sound makes all of the parts work together.  It also brings back that classic Zelda feel that so many of us have come to love over the years.Overall:With as many side quests as there are, this is a massive game.  Although it can be completed at a bare minimum in 20 hours or so, completing the game on the whole could easily take 40-50 hours, even with a guide.  This highly anticipated game has exceeded expectations, and is the first must have title of 2003 for any system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2003"}

Set in a gritty and brutal fantasy world, the story follows two mercenaries (Caddoc, a human male warrior and E'lara, a female elven archer) as they investigate the disappearances of townsfolk after sinister creatures begin to emerge from the underground.  Armed with a magic artifact called the Deathstone which allows the wielder insight into the lives of the deceased, Caddoc and E'lara set out to the nearby town of Dyfed in search of its missing inhabitants.  Here are my thoughts on Hunted: The Demon's Forge;Pros+ Grim, dark and adult fantasy setting.+ Hidden areas are fun to discover and explore.+ Excellently detailed character and creature models.+ Humorous and witty banter between Caddoc, E'lara and the NPCs.+ Spell and action particle effects are clean and look impressive.+ Rez vials are a convenient way to revive companions.  Much easier than kneeling over them for a set amount of time while getting beat on by enemies.+ Dungeons have dark and eerie feel to them.+ Blood splatter from combat is a nice touch on characters.  Shields are also destructible.+ Very non-stereotypical main characters.  E'lara is shoot first ask questions later elf who is always more than happy to rush into battle.  Caddoc is a calculating and strategic mercenary warrior.+ Solid voice acting talent includes Lucy Lawless, Laura Bailey and Robin Atkin Downes.+ Outstanding soundtrack by Kevin Reipl (Gears of War, Unreal Tournament, Resistance - Burning Skies).+ Weapons and armor have excellent detailing and design.  Many weapons also have magical effects accompanied with simple particle effects.+ Can see many items you're carrying such as weapons, potions and rez vials.+ Gruesome looking creatures.+ A few good scares in dungeons.Cons &lt;Contains SPOILERS>- Impossible to tell which items you can break and which ones you can't.- Caddoc's crossbow is slow and quite lackluster.- Lots of invisible barriers and places where items can fall behind which you can't reach.- Careful fighting next to \"sleg\" pots, it's extremely easy to drink them altering the ending of the game.- Checkpoint save system which can be really poorly spaced in some areas.- Melee combat against enemies is often extremely dangerous even for Caddoc.- Cut-scenes can often cause you to lose loot that you didn't pick up in battle.- Many areas are one-way only with no option of returning.  If you missed something, too bad!- Some really ugly and dated environmental textures.- Health and Mana potions can disappear even though they still show on the ground.- Some musical glitches where it gets caught in a loop so you can't tell when combat is over.- Finishing maneuvers while neat, lock you into the animation but not your partner which ends up looking odd.- Riddle heads tend to get a bit repetitive.- Some graphics clipping issues.- Limited number of enemy types.- Local co-op is split screen view.- No jump or crouch.- Clumsy cover system.- Linear gameplay.- No inventory option.- Some jerky character movement.\"Hunted: The Demon's Forge\" is exactly the type of fantasy action game that I look for.  Its dark story, grim setting, brutal creatures and unique characters intrigued me from the very beginning.  The teasers hinted at Gears of War style gameplay but in a fantasy setting after which I was sold.  Unfortunately, \"Hunted: The Demon's Forge\" just doesn't live up to such lofty expectations.  The game felt unfinished and largely subpar in so many areas.  The game's faults really show with its broken cover system, linear gameplay, dated graphics, clumsy character/enemy combat, invisible barriers and overall bugs.  Despite these issues there are some bright spots in the game as well.  The character and enemy models look great, the combat is generally fun, the voice acting and soundtrack are quite well done and the overall setting of the game has a very dark and gritty feel to it.  That being said it's still not enough to push this game beyond the average or cause you to overlook its many flaws.  I played co-op with a friend (I played Caddoc, he played E'lara and it took roughly 10-12 hours to complete) and while we enjoyed it, we both agreed to be glad when it was finished.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00DC7G2W8","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Kart Madness","reviewText":"There is no question that Nintendo has really made some excellent games over the past several years with the success of the Nintendo Wii. But with the Wii U since it came out a few years ago, there really hasn't been many games that really have hit the nail for the system. While there have been some good games like New Super Mario Brothers U and Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze that have delivered nicely. But surprisingly, there really hasn't been that blockbuster game that can appeal to everyone. Well, Nintendo is definitely trying to get that rhythm out with the release of Mario Kart 8, continuing the success of Nintendo's most-popular racing franchise for over 20 years. It showed a massive appeal on the Wii and with Mario Kart 7 on the Nintendo 3DS. Now, that Nintendo is pulling out the big guns with the Wii U, the question is does the game deliver all over again, well the answer is absolutely yes.Mario Kart 8 for the Wii U definitely delivers with the success of both Mario Kart Wii and Mario Kart 7 for the 3DS, into great fashion as Mario and his friends and foes, across 32 classic and current tracks. This time there are many more outrageous twists and turns this time around, as you can race on many twisting and turning tracks that can make it more challenging as you can race either old favorites like Mario and Yoshi, or the newcomers like any of Bowser's Kooplings, Roy, Ludwig, Larry, Morton, Wendy, Iggy and Lemmy all across courses like the Bowser's Castle, the Koopa Airport, all the way to the skies by racing on one of Bowser's fierce airships, as well as classic tracks like Rainbow Road and Yoshi Valley from Mario Kart 64 and Tick Tock Clock from Mario Kart DS. The tracks definitely are challenging as well as have great twists and turns by racing regularly, and sideways, its like combing the Mario Kart gameplay, with the fierceness of F-Zero's tracks. The graphics are great and the control is definitely at par with all the great Mario Kart games from before, surprisingly where so many Wii U games have missed the mark this past year. You can play with either the Wii U Gamepad, or the Wii-Mote and Nunchuck Controller or Wii U Pro Controller. It definitely is a game that handles well from every angle from riding Lakitu's Motorcycle, to riding Yoshi's Wiggler Caterpillar racer.All in all, I found this game to really deliver from everyone position for the Mario Kart racer young and die hard racer. This is definitely a race game series that still shows to deliver after all this time. I have loved about every Mario Kart game all the way back to over 20 years ago when Mario Kart first hit the Super NES era. This is definitely a fun title, and absolutely makes you just wanna grab a Wii U, grab your Kart and take a warp pipe all the way to the finish line.Graphics: A-Sound: AControl: Wii U Gamepad B+; Wii U Pro Controller: A; Wii-Mote & Nunuchuck: B 1/2+; Wii Wheel B 1/2-Fun & Enjoyment: A for solo player; A- for multiplayerOverall: A-","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2014"}

The graphics are hands down the best I've seen to date.  The story is engrossing.  You get to fight Collosi, Lycans and Vampires. There are some puzzle elements that I had to look up cheats for, but none that are too difficult.  And the campaign is pretty lengthy too so for the going sub $30 price range, there is not a game I can recommend more than this. It does start out a little slow but stick with it as it gets a lot better.To all the hardcore Castlevania fans, I remember beating the original one on the NES and it was a real pain in the rear.  Talk about a punishing 2d side-scroller. It was hit or miss whether I could beat the game whenever I played and I used to game hours upon hours a day.  I definitely don't miss those days and I wouldn't want another 2d Castlevania.  It's called evolution so time to stop complaining and get back to present day lest you'd rather be playing pac-man and ghosts'n goblins, then more power to you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2011"}

I'm not saying the game is dreadful. But it is easily the one of the worst of the series. Graphics are great. Sound is amazing. Controls are hit and miss. The story starts out pretty sweet and easily grabs your attention. Then there is a surprise near the first third of the game that you can see coming a mile away. it ends up being very cliche' and uninspiring. So much to do in this game but there is no real reason to do any of it. You can beat the game using the very first set of weapons you start the game with. The Homestead missions are better than the regular missions.The games glaring weakness is it's main character. Connor is very dry and boring. That's the total opposite of my man Ezio. You can't go from playing AC2 through Revalations and then finish it up with this. The game has glitches galore. Freezes and crashes. Becoming stuck in environments and etc. I forced myself to complete this game and it was truly a work of labor. There is fun to be had.

{"product_name":"B007XVTR5S","description":"","reviewerName":"1Dub79","summary":"A pleasant surprise","reviewText":"After initially being comprehensive about buying MW3 in 2011, I bought it and was ultimately disappointed. Then, Black Ops 2 came in 2012. I saw the futuristic based gameplay and thought, \"I am through with COD.\" I also thought that it is just another COD, except a futuristic version. However, I kept hearing about the how great the story was, over eight months. Not only that, I saw the game is not only based in the future. It tells a story that builds from the Cold War Era of the first Black Ops. I saw the game for under $30 and figured I'd give it a try. I am glad I did. In fact, I could have bought this game full price. I feel like I got a steal. Here is the reason why......CAMPAIGN/STORY:  The game does take place in 2025. However, most of the game will NOT take place during that time. Black Ops character, Sgt. Frank Woods, who is now old, will tell Alex Mason's son, David aka \"Section\" a story about the rise of a madman (Raul Menendez) from the Cold War era to the present day of 2025. Of course, most of the missions will take place during the Cold War era, so players can get an understanding of how everything began. Of course, players will play as Alex Mason and also see other familiar characters, such as the young version of Sgt. Woods and CIA member Jason Hudson. During the 2025 era, players WILL play as Section and will see some new characters, such as Mike Harper, who is voiced-over by actor Michael Rooker.GAMEPLAY: Players that are familiar with COD already know how the game plays. The coolest part about playing in the 2025 era is using the new equipment and weaponry. One gadget that the player will use is called the Cognitive Land Assault Weapon aka C.L.A.W. It can fire bullets and missiles. Though I am not a fan of sci-fi-like games, it is actually something to see. Of course, playing through each mission is even better because the weapons load out can be changed, as if playing multiplayer. On one Cold War Era mission, the player will get to ride a horse. That's pretty cool, too. I would say the best part of this game is it has multiple endings. Of course, the endings are based on the actions of the player during the campaign.GRAPHICS/VISUALS: The maximum output on this game is 1080i. Who says you need a PS4?! Lol Anyway, the graphics are VERY good, though. In fact, they are some of the best I've seen on a COD title. The detail of the maps between the campaign and the multiplayer are on point. The lighting, shadows, animations, and character models are great. I really love the physics of the game. I love the way bodies fly in the air from the blast of a grenade or any other device that explodes. Not to mention, I like the way the bullets just riddle the bodies of enemies. For example, even when enemies are hit with a kill shot, they can still be effected by additional gunfire. With that being said, the game is very gore, which may not be suitable for a kid to play.MULTIPLAYER:  Of course, the multiplayer is set in 2025. It is cool to see many of the fictional weapons because it may make players wonder how weapons will look in 12 years. Some weapons are familiar looking, but have more of a futuristic look to them. Many weapons and equipment have totally different names, too. I still have a hard time remembering the names of many of these weapons. Some of the new attachments have a futuristic feel to them. For example, they have a new sight with a target finder, which detects enemies on sight. Of course, players will see the recticle for targeting, but the detected enemies will have red triangles surrounding them.The killstreaks are now called scorestreaks, which means getting certain numbers of kills are not going to cut it. Now, you have to earn a certain score. Instead of a money system to buy weapons, perks, scorestreaks, and attachments, the game has a token system. I like many of the new scorestreaks. For example, one new scorestreak can have a player use what is called a Hunter Killer. This is a drone, which is thrown in the air. Then, it automatically seeks out the nearest enemy that is out in the open. When I have used it, I have replayed the match and love to watch it just explode, when slamming into an enemy. Instead of a money system to buy weapons, perks, scorestreaks, and attachments, the game has a token system.SOUND: The sound is superb in this game. Treyarch definitely stepped their game up. The weapons sound very real and distinctive. Hearing the blast of grenades and mines go off is intense. I even love the crisp sound of weapons being reloaded. That's just me, though.VERDICT: After playing MW3 and called it as a failure, I was about through with the COD series. However, the campaign has a good balance between two eras and builds a gripping and compelling story. With that being said, I must say that Treyarch makes better COD games than Infinity Ward, in my honest opinion. Overall, the game is worth owning, especially due to the lower price. Perhaps, if anyone has reservations on COD Ghosts, this can hold players over, until the price drops on that game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00000JRSB","reviewerName":"An amazon visitor","summary":"Okay video game, bad battle system.","reviewText":"The battle system could of been a lot better.  Number one: There's too many battles in the first place.  You take three steps you get in a battle.  You walk two steps to get somewhere and you end up in a battle.  You take one step, most likely you'll get in a battle.  Also, let me point out that once you're in a battle, you can't move around.  And plus summoning whatever it is you're trying to summon, like Thunder or something, you have to press eighty buttons just to summon it at once.  It's hard to do.  However, I think that the game was engaging and never let ya go.  It was entertaining, and it is undoubtedly worth the twenty bucks$...but...the battle system could of been a lot better, I'm sorry.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2002"}
{"product_name":"B002BS47YE","description":"","reviewerName":"Tyler","summary":"Fun, but not worth the price","reviewText":"I found the game quite enjoyable, and it definitely has replayability. The transition from island jungles to the concrete jungle was a worthy iteration in the series. Nonetheless, it has its flaws.Cryengine 3 is very stable. However, it is important to know that the new engine is not an evolution of Cryengine 2, for those who might have thought otherwise - it has been designed to allow for nearly seamless and uniform performance across all platforms; PC distribution of the first Crysis game fell well short of predictions, primarily because the engine, at the time, required too much processing power for the average consumer to match...people simply couldn't play the game at its full potential. Crysis 2 has been, arguably, dumbed down such that it performs nearly equally on all platforms; essentially, console optimization holds the game back from what it could have been. It is hard to argue in favor of paying $60 for a game that has been consciously dumbed down - in fact, I am insulted that EA would choose to bend to inferior console gaming limitations, rather that establish new benchmarks in gaming technology, as the first Crysis did. This issue is the primary reason for giving the game 3 stars.There are other notable, but tertiary glitches that should be noted. Clipping problems can be irritating at times - for instance, you might encounter a staircase that you cannot ascend. the AI isn't very impressive, either - on several occasions, you will encounter enemies that will not react to you, or simply spin around in circles like an ice skater. There is some sloppy design work to note, as well: on many occasions, EA chose to use invisible barriers, rather than physical objects, to define the boundaries of maps, which is very distracting. Objects tend to float in space here and there. Also, depending on how you approach a combat situation, you will often encounter the moment and place at which enemy AI will spawn. Howevder, these issues could all easily be remedied via patches.My final critique is the lack of impressive enemies that had existed in the first Crysis - you won't encounter anything that really has the \"shock and awe\" factor. In fact, the alien force of Crysis 2 doesn't even really resemble those of Crysis - whereas the original Crysis aliens had a definite aquatic and/or low gravity anatomy, the new aliens seem very heavy and bulky, and a very human design quality.Nevertheless, it is still a fun game. The engine, though it doesn't live up to its potential, still blows the overused and outdated Unreal engine out of the water.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2011"}

A shooter at its core, Dead Space tells a simple story in a surprisingly believeable world.A creepy new religion based on worshipping alien artifacts controls two of the biggest corporations on Earth and silent engineer, Issac Clark (the player character) is left to pick up the pieces when a ship that's picked up one of these artifacts goes dark.Most of the monsters (necromorphs) play fair and you never really feel cheated when you die.The game makes good use of its setting with certain rooms on the ship devoid of oxgyen or gravity. These areas of the game are the most fun. Shooting monsters while moon jumping and watching nervously as your oxygen counter ticks down is intense and exciting.Unless you're easily grossed out, or frightened, I reccomend this game to anyone who likes action/adventure or shooters.Also, this is not a game for kids.

Multiplayer is like others games but again the Dubai setting with the occasional sandstorms makes this game feel different and fun.  my only con is that squad commands could be better.  The only command you can give is to eliminate a specific target.  Most of the time I find myself having to eliminate the target myself and having to revive my teammate, Frustrating.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2012"}

Controls like a dream in first person, 3rd not so much; I use the 3rd person to get a bigger picture of wherever I am, but that's about it.On the down side, the gray textures can become overwhelming; some might prefer something more colorful. There are some small glitches here and there--like my gun wouldn't stop firing one time even though I wasn't pulling the trigger, and it used up all my ammo; A few freeze ups and some frame skips too, but nothing on a constant basis. Just save often.  And the game starts slow....may turn some people off as you have to spend the first hour or so creating a character and talking to everybody.But once outside, the world is yours to do what you want. I can't really think of a single thing they got wrong here with the exception of maybe working in a wider variety of creatures and enemies. And co-op would have been cool. But still, this is a must play in my opinion.This was written after 41 hours of play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0038TT8QM","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Super deep and highly addictive","reviewText":"The Good: Amazing depth and strategy, addictive turned based game play, lots of leaders to chose from, great visuals and audio, new changes are for the betterThe Bad: Can be too hard for super casual players, not 100% balanced, takes too long to finish a game, can be too addictiveAfter playing my first game of Civ 5 I realized how much of a greedy jerk George Washington was. 500 gold, all my resources, one city, and open borders for just one silk resource?! He's just begging to get wiped out, but I keep my cool and press on as the most advanced civilization for the next 150 turns. I build many great wonders such as The Great Wall, The Great Lighthouse, The Colosseum, The Taj Mahal, and even The Hanging Gardens. Of course it takes about 100 turns to create most of these but it keeps my people happy and sets us into a Golden Age.This is just the beginning of Civ 5 and it's deep turn based strategy game play, but yet it's so simple to grasp and that's the beauty of it. Civ 5 may seem like some overwhelming beast when you first play it (mainly newcomers), but you learn as you play. After my 50th turn I already had the hang of 90% of the game, and just learned little things from there on out. You start out by picking your leader of a country, but each one has special attributes like a better economy, military, or even science. You establish your main capital city, and from there you learn new sciences, produce buildings, great wonders, workers, or different military units. Different tiles on the map may have icons for mining, farming etc. and you deploy workers here. Connect these to your capital and your income will increase.Of course after awhile you must expand your empire or people will get unhappy and may even rebel in the city due to over population, or not having enough entertainment, food, or other resources. Keeping your people happy is just part of the struggle to create a great civilization. Other cities may want to ally with you by having you gift units, give them gold, or vowing to protect them. Connect your cities with roads and voila you have more income. Or you can just wipe them out and either annex the city (requires building a courthouse before you can use it), or use it as a puppet city and just collect the income, but don't control what they do. There's also the option to just raze cities and let everything burn!Yes Civ 5 let's you play as you please sadism or masochism is all up to you. You can be friends with all your neighbors and just run out to 2050 and be the first and most advanced civilization. Or you can do what I did and get tired of the other leaders and build an army to take over. After having a rapidly advancing civilization over Washington I decided to open my borders to him, but he was still guarded because he didn't like my huge army. Sure I made my people suffer a tad by the high upkeep of this vast army, but it was well worth it. I started attacking his capital and this declared war. After a few turns he offered a peace treaty for 10 turns so I accepted and during this break I got every unit I had and surrounded his capital. After the treaty was over I attacked and quickly took over his entire empire. It was easy thanks to my advancement in military technology so I was way ahead of him. Musketmen versus spearman doesn't exactly equal fair. He offered peace treaties, but I swiftly turned them down and he eventually declared defeat.But...just...one...more...turn! Even though I technically beat the map I kept on conquering, and even stole over his allied city before defeat. I bought tiles with lots of resources to quickly build my empire up and expand my borders. Turn after turn I swept up all resources, and horded my gold, and built massive structures to be the greatest of all time.That's how every game plays out, and with the great AI, stunning visuals, and excellent little tid bits like Social Policies which act like perks, and the fact that not every map will play the same way twice. While you can't stack units anymore it really makes for a better strategy, and makes things a bit simpler so you're not just concentrating completely on your army. There are so many little things to this game you just have to play it to realize what's here. With a great in game user made map, scenario, and other item download section, excellent multiplayer, and countless hours of endless ways to play maps you will never get bored. Tactics must be changed up for each leader, each map, and each opponent. The only real issues I had were the fact that not every leader is balanced, and that a game can take days to finish plus some changes may turn hardcore fans off. So, the question begs the answer: Can your civilization stand the test of time?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Nishi","summary":"I enjoyed 99% of the game","reviewText":"Finally, the game fans have been waiting on for years. While hearing about the day one DLC and the multiplayer I was worried that the single play may have been sacrificed, but I'm glad I was wrong. I had fun playing the game, and still find myself playing the multiplayer of this game. One of the coolest things they did is tie in a bunch of the books/comics into the game story.Story:I really enjoyed the story and finding out the effect some of your decisions in previous games really made this a great narrative. Along with that, the decisions you make in this game have a lasting impact and I was presented with some of the hardest decisions to make ever in a video game. It's a really dark game and the story reflects that wonderfully.War Assets is new to the Mass Effect franchise and it's basically a pooling of all the resources, people, ships, intel etc that you have collected that will help in your fight. If you don't play the multiplayer you will get a 50% reduction in your overall score, which can really cut it close to being at full readiness if you rent or buy this game used.In between missions and objectives your crew sometimes moves around the Normandy and actually have conversations with other crew members, instead of standing in one spot the entire time. This makes the ship feel alive and that your members are having lives when you are not there to babysit them.On top of all that, you have a ton of side missions that help you gather more military strength. While they are fetch quests at heart, they can be missable if you're not carefully and most have a pretty cool backstory to them. Also, every few missions or so you are presented with a situational weapon that can mix things up and sometimes used in more ways than killing your enemies.Gameplay:Bioware has finally perfected the gameplay of the two games in this one. We have the customization from the first game mixed in with the action feel of the second. They included a ton of guns in every specialization (SMG, Sniper rifle, etc). Each gun can have two attachments that can reduce recoil or increase the damage of the weapon. Every class can use any weapons, but more powerful weapons weigh more, which reduces your skill recharge rate, and with skills you can carry more weight without loss.In singleplayer they brought back the same classes as Mass Effect 2 had with some improvements to the quality of them. The max level in this game is back at 60(as I it should be when dealing with Mass Effect) and each class has a ton of skills to choose from. Along with that you get to choose an additional skill to level up that comes from your companion's main skill (So if you're a soldier you can choose to get Slam, a biotic skill). Each class its own Heavy melee attack animation as well (Soldier has an Omni-Blade stab, while Biotics get a falcon punch style attack).Planet scanning is back and it's really improved this time around. Instead of scanning each planet for multiple resources, you fly around using left trigger to scan the system itself for planets or debris for items, which can make your presence know to the reapers. On 360 they added quick saving into the game (Back button) which is something I've wanted to happen for console games.Multiplayer has the same classes, but with only 4 abilities that you can level up to the max of 20. In order to get weapons, equipment and other usable items like Medi-Gels you have to buy trading card-ish booster packs that give you uncommon/rare/ultra chances the higher up you go. While this is a cool alterative to getting weapons and what not, it gets annoying since non-human races have to be unlocked the same way.Six maps are included with the game (taking place in different parts of the galaxy and are the layout is the same as some of the N7 missions). Three enemies Cerberus, Geth and the Reapers are able to fight you on any of the maps and each is really unique. While the ground troops are basically the same, the harder enemies vastly differ.Cerberus has Atlas (giant human controlled robots), people with shields, powerful turrets, snipers and samurai-ish warriors. Geth have Primes (giant Geths), Rocket Troopers, Hunters (invisible shotgun wielders), and Pyros (flamethrowers). Finally the reapers have Ravagers, Brutes, and banshees. They all react differently (Geth and Cerberus take cover, Reapers rush you) and with each difficulty (Bronze, Silver, Gold) they get increasingly harder and more of the tougher enemies can appear at once. Granted this is just Horde Mode but I'm having fun with it, but It is a mode to play with friends and not by yourself.While Bioware said it does not have impacts to the story, it actually really does. You start out with 50% Galactic readiness and it cuts your Military strength in half and the only way to get to 100% is to play multiplayer. Each day/restart of the game takes away 1-2% so you will need to be constantly playing multiplayer to keep 100%. While normally I would be fine with this, but its tied down to an online pass so those who can't play online/buy it used will be at a significant disadvantage. Not to mention those who only care for single player.Soundtrack:Man was the music really awesome in this game. Ever since I watched the trailers main theme I just knew it would be good, and I was right. You can pick out themes from Mass Effect 1 and 2 in some of them, and if you played those games if you feel a sense of De ja vu while hearing it. Mass Effect defiantly has some of the best Sci-fi music around. Weapons/Biotics/Tech all sound great and didn't really notice wrong with them.The voice acting is still just as awesome as the previous installments, and the main character voice actors stay the same. I was never really taken out with pointless dialogue, or bad voice acting or anything like that. One complaint I do I have, as do many is Diana Allers (Jessica Chobot). She didn't really have that important of a role and you could kick her off the Normandy at any time, but her voice just annoyed me and I'm pretty tolerant when it comes to actors. It just felt forced, and I like to hear about the little news segments around the galaxy so I visited her a lot.Graphics:Best graphics for a Mass Effect game yet. All the weapons have great animations, the Biotics look really awesome, and the combat drones look way better in this game. The faces look upgraded and I think they look the best so far. The random planets you go to just look beautiful. Some of the best looking sky and outside graphics I have seen in a while. The enemies are well designed and really creepy at times.Verdict:I had a lot of fun with majority of this game and I'm still playing the multiplayer with my friends. The gameplay is really fun, soundtrack is great and the graphics are top notch. I enjoyed most of the story, the music, soundtrack and I recommend at least a rental if you're interested in trying this game. It was a powerful, awesome, and amazing rollercoaster ride to the finish and its one I'm glad I took.~ Written: March, 2012Positives:* Decisions that matter* Dark story* Hard decisions* Situation weapons* Quicksaving on consoles* Lots of class diversity* Really fun gameplay* Avatar awards* Blasto 6* Best graphics yetNegatives:* Disc swapping* Multiplayer required for 100% rediness but is tied down to online pass.* Still can't use Makos* Diana Allers","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2012"}

Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.Defender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look.

Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus is less RPG and more action/shooter, taking place after the events of Final Fantasy VII.  Vincent seeks to learn more about his mysterious past as he attempts to stop a group called Deepground from destroying the world; all of this is told through cut-scenes aplenty, which in themselves are pretty to look at (and some look very similar to the Advent Children film), but there are too many, and the loading times before and after really slow down the gameplay.  Running and gunning isn't always a bad thing, but it gets so trite here which is a crying shame for all the potential this game had.  Many of the enemies are generic and repetitive, but the gameplay does get spiced up occasionally when you get the chance to change into one of Vincent's alternate, monstrous forms and dish out some punishment.  Most of the areas are nicely done, and will look instantly familiar to longtime FF VII fanboys, and the bonuses that get unlocked once you beat the game are a nice touch as well.  However, the overall feeling of Dirge of Cerberus is that it's just a generic shooter.  It's nothing bad, but considering it's pedigree, Dirge of Cerberus is very disappointing, but it's still worth a look for FF VII fans who just can't get enough and want more to the story.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2006"}

It's design can be best described as a car based role playing game.I actually found myself riding around the well mapped and nicely detailed map of Colorado more than I did running any of the game's events.The story is you are a newbie racer and have landed at the Horizon festival in Colorado. You are here to race and become the most well known racer. Kind of a simplification of an already simple storyline.You have various events to choose from, including standard Forza style races on actual roads instead of standard tracks, point A to point B races and showcase events where you have to do odd things like race a Mustang (airplane) vs a Mustang (car).The graphics are pretty much just like Forza's normal graphics. Highly detailed cars. Fairly decent detailed scenery is included.The RPG elements are the fact that you can race around Colorado, never running an actual event, if all you want to do is travel around the \"over world.\" You won't ever actually win the game this way, but you could play that way if you desired. In terms of random battles, you can find other racers as you drive through Colorado and challenge them to a race. You don't have to do this either, but you can.Over all, I'm having a lot of fun with the game. I don't play multiplayer/online so I can't really rate that.If you love Forza, this game MAY not be for you since it deviates from the standard Forza pure racing formula.

If you actually looked into the game before buying it (which is something everybody should do) you would know what it is.  It's a RTS game where you summon espers and do battle with other armies of espers and pirates using your stylus.  As far as I can tell, the storyline, while not the greatest, is good enough to keep me playing.  The gameplay is amazing, but it gets hard if you don't keep up with your leveling.  The Ring of Pacts is probably my favorite part of the game, i love unlocking new guys to use.Don't go into this game trying to compare it to the original Final Fantasy 12.  Even though i've never played it, I'm sure this game won't compare.  Think of it as more of a stand alone FF game with the same characters from FF12Edit: Okay, so I got a lot further in the game and have played Final Fantasy 12.  The games really aren't anything alike.  If you enjoyed 12, you might enjoy this, seeing as how it has the characters from 12 and is in the same universe.  Gameplay-wise it couldn't be more different, and as far as I remember (haven't played in a while) the stories are different.  12 is more of a tale of politics, whereas Revenant Wings is pirates on an adventure.Gameplay involves setting up \"stations\" (i don't remember what they're called in-game, so I'll refer to them as stations) where you summon monsters to fight other teams.  Generally, you have to either defeat all the enemies, capture certain/all stations, or both.  You move your units (monsters and characters) on the bottom screen using the stylus by selecting them and clicking where you want them to move.  Anybody who has played Age of Empires, Starcraft, or Warcraft will know how this works.  The game is NOT a turn-based RPG like most Final Fantasy games, and it is NOT the same gameplay style of 12.  If you're looking for more of that, look elsewhere.  I personally thought Dragon Age: Origins for the PS3/360 had an incredibly similar battle system to FF12, so look into that.

The writing is hilarious without being corny. The dialogue is offensive without sounding contrived. The voice acting is marvelous, and the graphics are outstanding.Of course, all of that is meaningless without decent gameplay, and Lollipop Chainsaw has it in spades. Basic movement and technique are accessible for just about any gamer, but without being overly simple. One thing I really like (again, almost hearkening back to Bioshock) is the monotony is broken up by mini-games andDragon's Lairstyled interstitials. Similarly, it seems that the characters are constantly saying something new -- so you're not hearing the same three grunts, or the same five catchphrases repeated over and over again.You can tell a lot of love went in to making this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2012"}

Your mission isn't terribly new (infiltrate a terrorist base and blow everything up), but the gameplay is: your numerous enemies are watching for you, and you are encouraged to sneak rather than simply charge in. Every level brings new challenges. You fight snipers, invisible ninjas, psychic warriors, and even an M-1 tank! As the father of the modern spy game genre, this game is an instant classic.Your allies and superiors speak to you via a cool, implanted radio,  monitoring your progress, offering  tips--but failing to give you the full story. The combination of a mysterious and engaging plot and high in-game tension makes this a thrilling ride. Campy humor also abounds as you rescue beautiful women, verbally spar with your allies, and blow up enemies in the bathroom. A user-friendly control interface allows for sniping, hiding, crawling, and running, and the graphics leave nothing to be desired. If you like espionage, spy movies, or just want to own and play a piece of gaming history, then this is a must have.Metal Gear Solidis one of the all-time greats.

The parts are scattered across  a forested area crowded with giant (when compared to our hero's size) animals  and other hazards. Our hero stumbles across a race of part-animal, part-plant,  all-bizarre creatures he names Pikmin. Olimar has to learn how to lead the  Pikmin around the forest as he uses the abilities of the different-colored  Pikmin to overcome the many obstacles in his path.Learning when and how to make the best use of your Pikmins' skills and traits is  the essence of the game. You can control up to 100 Pikmin at a time while  figuring out which Pikmin are best suited for a particular task. Some are better  fighters, while others can survive in water or handle explosive bomb rocks.  However, even the best Pikmin herder will have to sacrifice a few of the  plant-headed beasts for the greater good. It's the making of new strategies to  minimize losses that makesPikminchallenging and fun.For a first-generation GameCube title, the graphics, sound, and music are  fantastic and show an awesome amount of detail. Though it's noPok&eacute;mon, this game should appeal to wide-eyed younger gamers as  well as seasoned vets. The controls are intuitive and feel perfect for the  standard GameCube controller. However, learning to position the camera can be a  tad frustrating during some of the more tense moments, as it has only a few  magnification levels and needs constant adjustment.The biggest obstacle Olimar faces is time. He has only 30 days (each day is  about 15 minutes in real time) in which to find the necessary parts. While this  keeps the pace of the game up, some may find such limits somewhat frustrating,  as it means there will be a lot of repetition and rethinking of strategy. It  also means that diligent gamers may findPikmina rather short game.At the end of your gaming day,Pikminis one of the best games on the  GameCube.--Mark BrooksPros:Very innovative and originalGorgeous graphicsGreat sound and musicAmazing blend of action and strategyCons:Time limit causes players to repeat tasksExperienced strategy gamers may findPikminends too quicklyDifficult to control camera during tense moments","reviewerName":"Teco","summary":"Over and over again....and again...and again!!!","reviewText":"This game is cool while you start playing it.

Now, when I first put the game in I started playing with the gamepad and if felt very awkward because the screen was lit up down below me and the the tv screen was in front of me. Also, the controls on the gamepad are very good and resposive, however, not ideal for this game. The wiimote is much better and allows for much quicker movements and jumps. With that being said, it is really cool and fun playing on the gamepad while looking at the screen on the gamepad. It makes you wish that they would've designed the 3ds like that. The game itself is amazing even though it is pretty standard for the mario series. I can't believe some of these haters giving the game 1 and 2 star ratings though. They must really hate nintendo or something, because even if you don't love mario games, you still have to admit that this is an extremely fun game that deserves atleast a 4. The only downfall of the game are the boss battles. They are far too easy and they are repetitive because there is not alot of variety in the bosses.

Don't believe it, the PS3 has less than a 1% failure rate which is unprecedented in the console business.I've owned just about every gaming system ever made, and I can say with honesty that the PS3 is the best game system I've ever owned.  The reason is simple, it's the most powerful game system out there, it's the only game system that gives you a built in HD movie player with BluRay, and it's the best music playback device on the planet.  You can also rent bluray movies instead of DVD's from Netflix for no extra charge, which I do, and I love it.Throw away your CD player, the PS3 networks with your computer via wifi so that your music library that's already on your computer is available on the ps3 without actually existing on the PS3's hard drive.  It's extremely high quality music reproduction and it gets all of your .mp3's into your living room.  It's the most unsung feature on the PS3.  Plus, on a nice HDTV the PS3 is by far the best way to view your pictures, which you can also view via wifi the pictures on your PC's hard drive in all their glorious detail.  There really is no better way to view your pictures.If you're in the market for the PS3 do yourself a favor and buy Uncharted.  Not only is it one of the best games made in the last five years, but it also shows off what the PS3 is capable of.  It's the most visually impressive game on any console.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2007"}

You control the speed and pace of the movie.  You control the action on the screen.  You control where the camera looks.  That's basically what you get with Star Wars: The Force Unleashed.Let's get the bad out of the way first, since The Force Unleashed does so much right, but a few minor things keep it from being a masterpiece.  First of all, remember the very first trailer?  The one where you see an Emperial Star Destroyer crash to the surface of Courascant?  You're probably thinking: I can't wait to do that in a game! Right? Wrong!  This level ruined the game for me.  It was too long and too frustrating.  The game would have been a LOT better without it.  By the time I got to the cutscene at the end of this level I was SO relieved.  I really wanted to give this game a perfect score, but I had to knock the score one star and the fun 2 stars simply because of this one level.I also experienced a few minor graphical errors.  In one level I was supposed to kill all of the storm troopers and get on an elevator.  I got on the elevator before killing everyone and the game didn't know what to do.  The frame rate dropped to the point of being in slow-mo until I killed that last guy, then everything was fine.This game encourages exploration.  If you prefer to run through a game as fast as you can to get to the credits, then this game is not for you.  (or perhaps I see a rental in your future)  If you don't enjoy leveling up and upgrading your powers, abilities and combos, then this game is not for you.  If you would prefer to hit one button over and over again to game completion, rather than stringing together amazing combos, then this game is not for you.If you have even the slightest interest in Star Wars, then stop reading now and get this game.  The story alone is worth the purchase.  If you like to explore every inch of every level this game is for you.  If you like to test things out and find out what happens when you throw an astromech droid through an exterior window or use force push while standing on a rope bridge, this game is totally for you.The music is excellent, the graphics are amazing and the gameplay is very good.  The gameplay is much better than the paused live action of Knights of the Old Republic, and far superior to Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy.  If the story had the same length and character development as KotOR it could have rivaled KotOR for a better story.  As it stands KotOR has yet to be beaten for story.  The graphics, voice acting and music aren't even in the same league as KotOR and Jedi Academy, but neither are the two consoles these games were made for.Graphics: A+ (Huge expansive levels with intricate details)Sound: A+ (Good sound effects and excellent music, on par with the movies!)Story: A (Many of the questions on what happened between episodes 3 to 4 are answered)Controls: B (You don't always have control over what you pick up and where you throw it)Gameplay: C- (At harder difficulties it's trial and error until you get lucky, plus pulling a Star Destroyer out of the sky isn't nearly as cool as it sounds.  Other than that gameplay is very good)Length:  C (You can beat this game in one weekend)So the bottom line: if you love Star Wars and exploration get this game.  If you dislike or could care less about Star Wars, this game really has nothing to offer you.(Note: I write reviews to help you decide whether or not to purchase a game.  If this review helped you make an informed decision, please take the fraction of a second it takes to hit yes next to \"Was this review helpful?\"  Thanks!)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2008"}

The game is basically matching rows of gems to break them while trying to chain breaks together for increased points.When I first played this game, I was confused by the complete lack of challenge.  The only mode that is unlocked from the start is a training mode called Zen.  There are no dangers.  You just match jewels forever apparently to get the feel of the game and test strategies.The actual game is called Classic which unlocks after playing Zen.  Here there are progressing levels of difficulty involving locked gems and bombs.  It's really not worth discussing in detail.  The challenge is in figuring out the strategies that work for you.There are a number of other modes to unlock that are discussed in the manual.  There's multiplayer as well.  You can play with the gamepad or the stylus.  I find the stylus play rather annoying and opted for the pad.  One thing I don't like about this game is that you can only twist gems in one direction.  It plays into the difficulty, but also makes it tedious at times.This is a fine game at a decent price.  You can spend many hours wasting away in this game.  It's not too frantic and can be rather challenging.  It does not compare to Tetris, however, as far as I am concerned.  Good old Tetris is one of the most fulfilling puzzle-type games.  Bejeweled is more of a trial and error type game where things you didn't intend to happen may happen to your benefit.

If you are those kind of people who like games who resemble the real life then this game is not for you.The NEGATIVES (which are more then the positives by the way).* IN real life when teams are on offense most of the time DEFENSES get tired. Well, in madden 2005 and 2006 that is not the case, if your offense is on the field most of the time your offense gets tired and their defense gets stronger.*When the computer wants to score there is NOTHING you can do. Even If your CB is covering,  the ball will go through his body and the WR will catch it ( i have never seen that in other games like ESPN).*As we all know in MADDEN players are rated by an overall number. IN madden 2005 and 2006 for example if your defense is agains the computer you have a big disadvantage one single offensive linemen can block 3 (99 overall) players of your defense.*The most ridiculus part of this game is when a CPU player is running in one direction and then accelerates in the ooposite direction and tackles your player and the block at the same time.I can keep going on and on and tell you why after 5 minutes this game is not fun anymore, but the negatives are so many that I would need days to review this games (2005 and 2006).If you ask yourself why am I including madden 2006 in my review?

{"product_name":"B00004SWL9","description":"Just when it seems 3-D fighting games have permanently made 2-D fighting  games obsolete, something likeMarvel vs. Capcom 2comes along and proves  just how deep and fun 2-D fighters can be. It's better than its predecessor in  every way, and arguably the best 2-D fighting game to grace the Dreamcast.The amount of playable characters is enough to put any fighting fan's salivary  glands in overdrive. Beginning with favorites such as Spider Man, Wolverine,  Ryu, and Chun Li, players can eventually unlock 56 characters. We had our hands  full just mastering a few of these fighters, and getting familiar with all 56  would take months of intense practice. There are almost too many moves, all  depicted with superb animation and augmented by several tag-team combos. When  the match begins, you can pick three characters. Once things heat up, you can  call in your pals to unleash a massive move on your opponent. This adds  immensely to the game's depth, and button mashers will be in for a shock when  they find that their mistimed tag-team moves backfire.Visually, this game is intense. The large characters are slightly jagged around  the edges, but that's more than compensated for by the massive amount of  animation frames, colorful special effects, and stunning 3-D backgrounds that  are loaded with detail.Marvel vs. Capcom 2also delivers a sonic  performance that is nearly arcade-perfect. This is a must-buy for any fighting  fan, especially those who have a couple of buddies to bash. Just be prepared to  put in a lot of time in practice mode if you want to get good.--T.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"One of, if not the, best 2-D fighters ever","reviewText":"The original Marvel VS Capcom showed promise, but Marvel VS Capcom 2 is absolutely hands down one of, if not the, best 2-D fighter ever made, and behind Soul Calibur and Dead or Alive 2 the best fighter on the Dreamcast.  Containing 56 fighters from the Marvel comics universe (including Spider-Man, Wolverine, Captain America, Iron Man, and Cable) and the Capcom universe (Ryu, Felicia, Mega Man, Jill Valentine, and Captain Commando), and a plethora of possible combos and tag team variations, Marvel VS Capcom 2 takes Capcom's outline of tag fighters and up's the ante in virtually every way possible.  Unlike some of the Street Fighter games and even the first Marvel VS Capcom, you can't just button mash your way through the game.  Learning the various special moves, timing, and techniques for tag team pummeling will prove essential if you hope to get anywhere in the game.  The 2-D fighters are superbly animated, while the 3-D backgrounds look great as well.  There is hardly a single flaw in Marvel VS Capcom 2, which is one of the reasons why this game is so hard to find (if you ever find this game and you still own a Dreamcast, pick this up, you won't regret it).  All in all, for those few Dreamcast owners out there, this is an absolute must have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2003"}

{"product_name":"B003O6G5TW","description":"","reviewerName":"Too Old for Games \"casualgamer\"","summary":"Single player review only","reviewText":"Yes, I am aware that Battlefield is a multiplayer concentrated game, but since they hyped up the campaign for this game, I am going to review it.  I had such high hopes for this game based on all the gameplay videos that I'd seen, even dismissing some of the lackluster reviews I had read about the single player from professional sites.  Unfortunately, they got this one right--the campaign is just not that fun, and I love short linear games that can be finished in 2 or 3 days. COD4 is still my favorite amongst all the fps out there.  No, I am not a fanboy because MW2 was pretty stale and derivative to me. I was looking to move away from that series and Battlefield had such promise. In the end, they managed to somehow make Black Ops' putrid campaign more fun than this.  I'll just note some of my thoughts:*Recycled storyline - I mean, \"Really? Couldn't you come up with anything new?\"*Graphics are not as great as some would suggest, all the videos shown are from pc's. They are good at certain points, but just average throughout*Destructibility is impressive. I would try to shoot at random walls and objects and it would leave bullet holes.*The AC-130 section from COD4 was way better than this knockoff and that came out years ago. Again, \"Really? You plagiarize from a 4 year old game and couldn't improve on it?\"*AI is really bad on normal. Very slow to react and they'll do the normal pop in and out of cover routine.*The auto assist aiming is ridiculous.  I felt like a marksman with every gun.  I think a semi-blind person can pass this game, no offense to the blind.This is definitely a rental from a campaign perspective. There are cool moments in the game like taking off from an aircraft carrier, but they somehow manage to suck the fun out of it by having you sit shotgun and take out the \"shoot-at-me\" targets.  And that sums up the m.o. for this game.  Cool moments spruced throughout a dull and perfunctory campaign.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005ME7X","description":"Originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System,Dragon  Warrior IIIis a Game Boy Color port of one of the all-time classic  role-playing games. The game reunites two of Japan's greatest RPG talents in Yuji  Horii (story and game) and Akira Toriyama (character design). Toriyama is also  known as the creator of the immensely popular Dragon Ball cartoons and comics. A  prequel to the first two games in the series,DWIIIcasts you as the  child of a great hero who must defeat an evil demon. New additions to the port  include improved graphics, new minigames, new items, and a better translation of  the original Japanese dialogue.The game starts off with a personality test that loosely determines how other  characters will react to you. Gameplay is standard RPG fare: exploring, building  experience levels, acquiring allies, gaining weapons, and ultimately going after  a large monster. There are some interesting minigames to mix things up. The  Monster Medals feature adds a collectible aspect to the game. Monsters may leave  medals behind after you defeat them. Some monsters only appear during certain  times of the day. Getting all the medals unlocks a secret dungeon. You can trade  medals via link cable to make things easier. Most RPG fans will love this game,  but those raised on modern RPGs might find its combat a bit tedious. This game  is compatible with Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance only.--Raymond M.

I grew up with this series, and I recall the third installment having a lot of bugs.  For example, you could end up with a character that wouldn't develope certain stats.  I had a mage once, and for about 5 levels, it didn't get any extra hit points with the level ups.  By the time I was at level 10 and my warrior could kill my mage with one hit, I realized  I should restart before getting too far.  By 10th level the second time through, my wizard's hp was about doubled...  Well, you don't have to worry about that in this version, as they seemed to have fixed it.  You can also customize your characters a little when you make them by giving them seeds.  Some additions to the maps and game play were also noticed.

Additionally, they are not as bright  as SOCOM 2's team.  More choices during the briefing should also be included.  During briefing as well,  I wish they included a 3-D model map (so I don't go around in circles)  as in previous versions of Rainbow Six.  The inclusion of stealth missions were okay in theory, but were poor in final execution.  Who would send a SWAT member to place bugs on telephones and hack computers \"stealthily\"?  It is usually done by an undercover agents and their ilk.  Or at least not when terrorists are still INSIDE the building!

{"product_name":"B003O6E6NE","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Cravens \"Loves a good story\"","summary":"Captivating. Haunting. Powerful.","reviewText":"When I first set foot in Columbia, I was immediately swept away in its historical grandeur above the clouds. All my senses were immersed in the heaven-like entrance, and I greatly enjoyed seeing what things the 1912 citizens were doing. However, as I explored the city I picked up on the twisted subtleties that made me realize I was actually trapped here, far away from normal society and the actual ground. Though the feeling was quite unnerving, little did I know just how incredible of an experience this whole game would be.COLUMBIA:Ahh, the floating city we've all been waiting to see since that infamous trailer that debuted several years back. Just like Rapture from the original BioShock, Columbia itself plays one of the star parts of this game. Everything feels alive. People are chatting with one another and being involved with the town. Shops are bustling every which way.The visuals themselves are marvelous. I love the Colonial architecture, as it's not something I'm used to. The attention to detail is truly impressive -- as you walk around various buildings will bobble up and down in the air. Blimps, fireworks, etc., will all be occurring whether you are paying attention or not.Yet something is horribly wrong here, as we all know these fictional cities serve to show what dark things humanity is capable of. In Rapture, there was no authority at all, and everything focused on the individual. Columbia, on the other hand, goes in the opposite direction. The citizens religiously follow and worship \"the Prophet\", the man in charge of Columbia. Convoluting his own status with faith in God and a pseudo-American Exceptionalism, it doesn't take long before you start thinking how parts of Columbia actually mirror some facets of America today, even as things shift around later in the game. The hyper nationalism, misplaced religion, and racism will make you, the gamer, wrestle with your own questions and beliefs long after your console is off. This alone is one of the things that makes this game so different and brilliant.STORY:The story is the complete driving force behind the game. All philosophies/religious topics aside, BI focuses on Booker DeWitt's mysterious dilemma surrounding Elizabeth. Where most first person shooters do a terrible job on making a cohesive and compelling story, the team over at Irrational reliably excels here. As you'll see, Columbia, the protagonist, and Comstock are filled with dark and horrible secrets you'll inevitably uncover.It's not just about the story (though I think you'll find it's a fantastic plot) -- it's really about the storytelling. You see, you won't learn everything through just dialogues or cinematics. Through Booker and Elizabeth's conversations about their pasts, the voxophones, the environments/levels themselves, and so many other factors, all these come together and mesh in an organic way where you directly experience the story as you play from beginning to end, piecing everything together as you go. It's a truly rich and uninterrupted method of storytelling you simply don't see in other games or other forms of entertainment. Just like the original, make sure you pay attention to everything!I thought the ending was great. I felt there was a lot of emotional buildup through the game, but, without giving anything away, ultimately the ending took more of a figure-out-the-puzzle turn than an emotionally powerful one. As a result, you'll feel very rewarded once everything clicks, and you'll be quite stunned with just how intricately woven everything is around the city in the sky.GAMEPLAY:If you played BioShock 1 you'll notice this game is much more linear than the previous ones. There aren't nearly as many large, open areas to freely explore, rather there are various rooms and places continually as you go. This may sound like a negative, but in all actuality I consider myself a rigorous explorer and am more than pleased with the balance of plot pacing and freedom to explore Columbia on my own.I find the combat here to be a tighter and faster form of what was in BioShock, especially regarding AI and gun audio. Just like before, your guns are on your right hand, and your powers are on your left. I actually find myself preferring to use guns more than the Vigors (BI equivalent to Plasmids) because their audio makes them so darn fun to shoot. However, don't get me wrong -- there's plenty of fun to be had with a myriad of combinations you can cook up between the Vigors, guns, and the personal upgrades (known as \"gear\") you find throughout Columbia. Some Vigors burn enemies up. Others send off a pack of crows to distract. There is a sufficient amount of variety here as I found myself using multiple Vigors as opposed to just one.Probably the single biggest element to the gameplay aspect is Elizabeth. As many of you are aware, in battle she will give you various supplies to give you the edge in combat, whether it's med packs or her mysterious abilities to call in objects for you, such as a wall for cover or a turret. However, where she really shines is out of combat, where she is engaging with Columbia and asking Booker all kinds of questions. An emotional bond is formed here, as the gamer won't be able to ignore that Booker and Elizabeth increasingly and meaningfully learn about each other as the game progresses. Fortunately, Elizabeth never feels like she gets in the way. I know from an interview with Levine he said he put in a lot of time with his team to ensure that. I don't even want to know how many hours it took to implement her in so well.In terms of flaws, there are only a couple to keep in mind. One thing that did stick out to me was how little Songbird is emphasized until last minute. From the trailers leading to BI's release, I would have thought its involvement would have been higher. Everytime it debuts I am either disappointed with how quickly it leaves or just overall with how rarely you see the fascinating creature. Also, I felt the audio levels were a bit unbalanced with dialogue, or at least the timing.. There were times when I'd be listening to a voxophone, only to have it drowned out by a random comment from Elizabeth. At other times, Elizabeth would be saying something super important, but then that would get drowned out by an equally important PA. It wasn't a constant problem, but it was a little noticeable.REPLAYABILITY:At the end of the day, are you getting your money's worth in terms of time? If you like to explore and take in all the details, you'll be looking at at least a 15+ hour game for your first playthrough (mine took just over 20 hours). If you are the type who likes to stick with what's necessary and power through games, you will likely finish this game in 10-12 hours. This puts it overall at a bit longer length than previous BioShock games, but considering how linear and story-driven this game is, the quality you get for the hours spent is insanely good. Also, if you want all the achievements, expect to play on higher difficulties as well as through the 1999 Mode once it's unlocked. Yep, that's money we'll spent.In conclusion, you will most likely be mentally rattled after playing this, and I mean that in a good way. Not only will you have fallen in love with the characters, but the game will repeatedly expose you to ideologies apparent in our society today, even as some of those ideologies largely switch around as you progress through the game (don't want to spoil anything). I think this is great, as it gets people thinking, asking questions, and looking deeper into what they actually believe about these topics.Would I compare this to the original BioShock directly? You can, but that's like directly comparing two different Final Fantasy games. Both are excellent games with their own strengths over the other, and just like the original, Infinite will be a classic for gamers for years to come.Thanks so much, Mr. Levine. I heard your team put in many hours to make this game happen, and it shows very much. This will go down as one of my all-time favorites.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2013"}

What is Kingdoms of Amalur? It's like EA took ideas and concepts that were popular in other games we've been playing over the past 10 years, mixed them up in a bag, and then created this game and tried to tell us it's new. This is a new game that feels very old.It may provide a new feeling or area of game play to those not really familiar with free roam RPG's or MMO's but if you've played those 2 genre's off the bat you'll just get flashbacks.What Kingdoms of Amalur does well is creating a console MMO without the other players. You can feel where this game was supposed to be an MMO because it acts like one right down to the stale NPC conversations and expressions.What makes this game not work is that the story isn't very unique and the NPC's lack of emotions don't help to sell the story to you either. It's the same Evil Lord story we've all heard about 1000times this one just cut and pasted differently. I really do play RPG's for the story but those one just didn't make me feel like I cared enough about it because it's been done to death.On top of that Sundae is also the gameply which relies down to a \"single\" action button which makes combat very simple. Now here is the thing about Kingdoms of Amalur, they tried to tie in the idea of using different abilities like using a bow,stealth kills,spells,etc. and then tie them up into one single action button. That may be fine for 1989 but with a 6Axis in 2012 I think they could do much better. I give Two Worlds 2 the Credit for their combat system of making combat unique and mapping different skills to the controls that made you feel like you were in a battle and not just pressing an \"action\" button. What took KOA down is that I've seen their fighting concept done much better in Two Words II yet a game like that gets worse ratings. Also the Stealth sneak kill and bow attacks feel cut and pasted right out of Two Worlds 2.So with the story and gameplay aside what is KOA really left with? Graphics?The graphic style and atmosphere of the game I need not even speak what it reminds people of. The art style of the game isn't exactly fresh or new and neither or the dwarfs with their accents and pastel colored florescent landscapes of the game. Been there done that and everything in this game reminds me of other cities I've been to in other RPG's.So with a borrowed art style what's left to be new?Class build possibilities? This being a console game that hardly matters really. Usually people argue about mixing class abilities its in MMO's. It doesn't matte what class you make in an offline game because your not going to get 10-25 of your friends (if you have any) and take down a raid boss or climb arena ranks.Maybe Unique Character Personalities?In KOA your characters a mute blank slate. No personality and no dialog which makes the game even less interesting than it already is. Once again I use Two Worlds 2 as an example. Your character has no name but he still talks and has a personality. Although you choose the decisions your choices are what gives him personality. He's either a bad guy or a good guy but he has a conscience about his actions that he hints his thoughts on in the quest journal. Your not just a mindless \"action button\" mashing ape, your an actual character in that world that can talk to the other characters and interact with them and change their story/fate if you wish to do so. To me that is the direction Freewill/open world games like KOA should be going in.The bottom line is that KOA is getting credit or at least hype over ideas that they either do worse than other games or borrowed from other games.As a budget bin title this would be worth the purchase for a RPG collector. For someone that wants to experience MMO like game play on a console this would be best suited for them but for someone that's a fan or RPG's and plays them like nothing, this is just like buying what you already own.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2012"}

The first thing that hits you is that the combat (which is centered around telekinetic powers) is a waste of the license. When you say \"Final Fantasy\" what pops into my mind is the ye olde Active Time Battle system, experience points, and multiple approaches to killing things. The most Chronicles lets you do is fling enemies and objects in various ways, increase the number of health slots, and equip items to improve your telekinesis, and play an enourmous array of minigames. Without the appeal of EXP, the combat feels pointless, and the minigames are myriad and rather insipid. Minigames have been a part of Final Fantasy for a long time, but almost always served the core gameplay, in that playing them gave you rare items and powers (FF X's Blitzball or FF IX's Chocobo). Here, they serve to please the percieved casual audience for this game.Since the gameplay is lackluster, and the graphics are decent enough for the Wii, the story is all that's left, and the characters are all annoying enough to sink it.

There are also a good deal of puzzles to solve- mainly by pushing switches, casting spells on inanimate objects, and jumping over pits. A well-drawn world map and backgrounds make the game quite aesthetically appealing, and there are all sorts of new things to see and new, more powerful weapons to acquire.One unique element in Golden Sun is the use of Djinni, which you assign to your characters. Depending on how many and what sort you give them, your characters will gain new spells and attributes. You can also summon them after the fashion of Espers in FF III or Guardian Forces in FF VIII, but in addition to doing some sort of beneficial effect (say, raising everyone's defense), depending on how many and what sort you use, you are able to summon a powerful one-time attack on enemies. It's a tradeoff, though, since summoning will remove whatever benefits the particular Djinn gave to the character. This gives you two distinct possible strategies for difficult battles- trying to summon them to death, or just fighting it out with your bonuses and magic intact.Most of the puzzles are related to finding new Djinni. You can avoid them and just continue with the main quest, but this will net you fewer Djinni and therefore reduced powers. There are also sidequests that will give you powerful items or weapons, but also aren't necessary to completing the game. Although some of the puzzles are pretty tough, they're not impossible, and none of the ones related to the main quest are that difficult.The level design is well thought out and the mechanics of the game function very well. As I have hinted at earlier, the graphics are very impressive- better than anything on the SNES. The soundtrack is also very well done, although not quite as good as Nobuo Uematsu's FF scores.About the only complaint I have about Golden Sun is that it was too short. Even if you finish up all the subquests, the game is only about 30 hours long- more or less depending on how familiar you are with similar RPGs. This is, of course, because there is a sequel planned. I can't say the game was much of a challenge either, but that's probably because some of the other similar RPGs I've played are pretty tough. Nevertheless, Golden Sun was a great deal of fun, and well worth the cost. I am looking forward to the sequel.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2001"}

This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Jack Coffee","summary":"Like Resident Evil 4, only much worse","reviewText":"It's not a bad game, but it's basically a remake gone bad of Resident Evil 4.  It's a shame that more thought wasn't put in this game.  I think most of the effort of Capcom was done on multiplayer and on the AI of the NPC, but that's a shame that so much energy was put in a feature that's not fun even a bit (having an annoying NPC stuck with you through out the game).Pros:Great graphics, although basically the same graphics of RE4 with no noticeable improvements (not that they needed improvement)Very nice story, and some great dialogueStill the enjoyable gameplay of RE4 just inferior in many levels: less scary, less dark, less variety in the way you pick up and organize your weapons, no merchant, no treasures combining etc.Cons:Shorter than RE4Less appeal of the characters.. Chris is not LeonVery annoying NPC in single player campaign that still has bugs and ruins the game in many levels: picks up ammo, breaks barrels on her own, stands in the line of fire or stuck near a doorway etc. Too much maintenance and not one which makes you proud (i.e. defending a helpless daughter of the president) - in other words maintenance that was not intended by the game designers.General disappointment of a game not living up to its predecessorI suggest pick this up only if you're a huge resident evil fan, and even then make sure you have played all the previous titles and the Chronicles series first that's available on the Wii, and more fun.  Still a good game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2010"}

R. Jeanclerc \"Reader, Listener & Obsessive...","summary":"Don't Believe the Hype - This Emporer's Naked","reviewText":"One of the most critically-acclaimed games for the PS2, \"Shadow of the Colossus\" has amassed a legion of staunch defenders.  However, after only a short time playing, its many shortcomings become apparent, leaving any objective gamer wondering why it receives the support that it does.SotC ultimately boils down to an overgrown puzzle game.  The box and the trailers will make it look like an action/RPG hybrid in a fantasy setting, but it's none of those things.  Each colossus must be killed by figuring out how to grab on and scale its body to find its weak points.  Once you're there, you repeatedly stab the weak point and hope you have enough grip left to hold on until it dies.  Otherwise, you simply have to start the climb all over again and repeat the process.This is one of the most linear games ever - find/kill no.1, then find/kill no. 2, then find/kill, well you get the idea.  Also, the bulk of the time spent playing this (short - only about ten hours) game is in the finding of each colossus' lair.  It could very well have been called \"Wander Around Lost for Hours En Route to Killing the Same Boss Over and Over Game\".The travel time stems from a gameplay environment that is huge yet ultimately pointless.  The map is gigantic, but aside from save point temples and the colossi themselves, there are no other points of interest/activity at all.Many praised SotC's art direction, but I found it to be nothing special.  First, I enjoy 50 million shades of pale green and grey as much as the next guy, but this was overkill.  The lush, mossy terrain gives way to endless fields and majestic mountains, but after a short while, it gets very repetitive (and again, adds nothing but ornament to the gameplay). Plus, the moving objects all look pretty obviously sewn-together.  Overall, the graphics push the capabilities of the PS2 so far that frame drag and other motion problems are frequent.When actually doing battle with one of he colossi, the camera simply does not work.  It drifts, flips, and generally does what it pleases at the most irritating and inopportune times.  Have fun trying to track the flying colossus.The storyline starts out as a paint-by-numbers plot involving a magical quest that the hero must undertake in order to revive his dead girlfriend.  There are hints promising plot twists later in the game, but they don't develop into anything.  The ending that's presented is lengthy but ultimately self-indulgent nonsense.  And of course, you don't do anything during this protracted ending other than watch it happen.The music is a bland knock-off of FF and every other synth-symphonic score.  There is also not enough of it, so that it gets very, very repetitive after only a short amount of gameplay.  But worst of all is the fit to the action - even during the fight scenes, the music is often this melancholy dirge that reinforces how much this game feels like a dreadful task that's fallen on your noble shoulders to complete.This feeling of dread is compounded by the sympathetic feeling of your foes.  For the first time ever, a game has created an experience that makes you feel bad for having won!  SotC feels like clubbing baby seals to me.  Maybe if the story had explained why these slow-moving, seemingly docile creatures needed to be viciously stabbed to death, I'd be able to better cope.  Or maybe if I didn't generally have to initiate the fight by shooting arrows into it until it's finally mad enough to defend itself.  Or maybe if more than half of them actually fought back. Or maybe if a single one of them had ever managed to kill little ol' me during the game.  Alternate title: \"Hunting Gentle Elephants for their Ivory or Maybe Even Just Out of Boredom Game\".Many will knee-jerk disagree with me over this one, but I feel that many more will be disappointed after blind-buying this title.  It looks like much more than it really is:  a task list of puzzles to be solved with a lot of pointless wandering around in between each.  Add in graphical problems and a camera that fights you harder than any of the colossi, and you've got a real unengaging time.  At least it's also a very brief game. . .","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2007"}

This game did a great job of reminding me of those game, but not in a good way. As I played this I was reminded how good the others were, especially the first two, and how this one paled in comparison.I'll quickly list off some issues I have with the campaign:-Boring story. I found the story quite boring and predictable.-Boring Guns. Most of them are the same as past games, or slightly tweaked versions of them.-Enemy AI is terrible. Even on harder difficulties the AI is very dumb, making the game incredibly easy.As far as the online multiplayer goes I can't say much about it. I only got into 3 or 4 games because the matching making doesn't seem to work properly.If I could I would give this game 2.5 stars, but I rounded up because I love the Resistance series.If you are a big fan if the Resistance series I might recommend it.

{"product_name":"B0047ODJAI","description":"","reviewerName":"Maek","summary":"\"How I wonder what you are...\"","reviewText":"Necromorph-blasting fans rejoice!Dead Space 2, the continuation of Dead Space, is upon us and has certainly upped the ante of the survival-horror genre.If you haven't purchased the original Dead Space, stop reading and play the first game.  You'll appreciate this game a LOT better and this review may spoil the first game a tad for you.  I'm writing this review from the point of view of someone who HAS played the first game.Story (potential, yet minor spoilers - skip ahead if you wish to the next section)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------First off, Isaac has extremely vague recollections at the beginning of the game of a \"therapy\" session with a psychiatrist who certainly sounds more like he's interrogating Isaac about the Marker from the first game.Shortly thereafter, Isaac Clarke is revived in the midst of an unknown location with Necromorphs roaming about causing chaos.  The game starts off with a bang and doesn't let up soon!  Not only does Isaac Clarke have to contend with Necromorphs, he stumbles across security/military personnel who also do their utmost to specifically eliminate him as well under the orders of a man named Tiedemann (sp?).Isaac Clarke is then contacted by a mysterious woman who informs him that he is located on a city-like outpost on Titan and claims that she will help him with his situation as well as his increasing dementia which results in hallucinations, including his long dead girlfriend, Nicole.That pretty much sums up the premise of Chapter 1 (there are a total of 15) and I won't spoil it beyond that.  Suffice it to say, however, that Isaac has a speaking role this time and you get to see a lot more of him then the first game.  It's quite a different take from our mute protagonist in the first game, but it's a quite welcome change and the story is immediately engaging and ratchets up further from there.Gameplay--------Superb!  Dead Space controls have returned.  However, there are several improvements:- The circle button actually acts as a shortcut for healing.  No more struggling to heal yourself in the middle of a battle by frantically searching your RIG.- There is a new hacking routine built in to the game, which requires Isaac to hack into consoles/systems in order to gain access to areas/items.  It's a rudimentary system of navigating your analog stick and hitting the \"x\" button at the appropriate times, but the animation showing Isaac trying various things to hotwire a console as you're doing it is quite cool and gives you something quite new to do.- New weapons!  In addition to the Javelin gun which can impale and, in turn, electrify your enemies with its secondary fire mode, there is also the Rivet gun which you could get if you pre-ordered with GameStop OR if you download one of the several available equipment packs that are available online for $[...]/per pack.Graphics/Sound--------------Dead Space was originally so effective because it utilized a color palette and lighting along with a sound ambience that constantly had you jumping at shadows, the clattering of a pipe, the skittering of \"something\" moving through the vents, etc.  Every corner and vent fan was a potential threat and the occasional outburst of sound, including the detonation of metal-clad windows in a long hallway, was enough to scare you out of your wits.  The original game took place on the USG Ishimura and even the environment of a wide open bridge was as frightening as a dimly lit hallway.Dead Space 2 wisely ratchets up the scares.  This game takes place on the \"Sprawl\", a city-like environment located on the Titan moon.  There, the seemingly mundane environments of a hospital (ok, granted, it was used in the 1st game, but this hospital is for civilians - seems a lot different with \"Get Well\" balloons!), a laundromat, an ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, etc. become horrifying places to traverse.  Early on in the game as citizens are told to evacuate, you sense the chaos going on around you and it seems more action packed at first, but then the scares become ever so much worse as you become more and more isolated.Dead Space's graphics and sounds were good.  The graphics and sound are even better in Dead Space 2.  Isaac moves a lot more smoothly and seemingly with more purpose and action.  Details are incredible and Visceral Games has really done an awesome job of creating a realistic environment where civilians would live, including the aforementioned \"Get Well\" balloons in the hospital reception area.  Not to go into many details, but the Elementary School is by far my favorite and yet devastating to see considering that I, myself, am a father and could not even imagine children being subjected to that hell.  Visceral does not hold the punches, however, since hell this is!  One minor detraction is that shadows, when viewed close up, are still quite rough, but that's typically the sacrifice you see to have everything else look as good as it does (especially the fire effects...in a word, WOW!).I will tell you this much.  If you have an extremely decent sound/HDTV setup, Dead Space 2 will make full use of what you have available.  Bass is quite deep and will punch hard to frighten you quite well.  Surround is fully engaging and will have you jumping around to the source of a sound.Graves' soundtrack is also quite good and complements the scares quite well.  It wouldn't be the same without a fully orchestrated soundtrack, but it's so easy to forget this because it's woven so well into the game.Multiplayer-----------Ok, this is a \"meh\" moment for me.  Don't get me wrong; it's fun playing a Necromorph or a security guard and running around utilizing your own unique sets of abilities.  That said, however, it's not Dead Space for me.It's fun, but it does not evoke the same kind of fear as the main game because it boils down to a bunch of people on each team.  If you're looking for the same kind of visceral fear in the single player campaign, don't look here.  If you want to see what it's like to try to dismember someone as a Necromorph, however, welcome to the party!Dead Space Extraction---------------------I was on the fence for a long time about whether or not I should get the Wii Dead Space Extraction game.  Now, I no longer have to worry.  Both limited edition and Collector's edition game packages include it for free.  Oh, and it supports the Move controller, so it should be quite similar to the Wii experience!Collector's Goodies-------------------Now for the fun part!  I've seen some negative reviews complaining about what they got for an extra $[...].  I, however, don't quite see what the fuss is about.  I'm extremely happy with it!  Here are the details:1.  PLASMA CUTTER.  Ok, there are pros and cons.  Pros:  it's pretty cool and the LEDs are EXTREMELY bright.  It's small and made of plastic, but I didn't expect much being packaged in a container that accommodated the Dead Space game container.  It was extremely well packaged and survived a UPS trip quite well.  Cons:  ok, it has the \"Made in China\" quite obsequiously  stamped on the bottom of the gun handle.  Couldn't we have just lived with the small plastic lettering somewhere?  The fact that EA didn't include 2 cheap AAA batteries didn't exactly help either.  The cover of the gun handle, however, is quite easily removed with a small Philips.  Overall, I think it's quite cool despite the cons.  I think that some people must have been expecting a full-sized replica, but the product photos showed the game case and cutter in the same shot; the scale was fairly advertised.  With the quality of the LEDs and the cool collector factor, it's easily worth $[...].2.  SOUNDTRACK.  The 18-track soundtrack is included here and was quite as enjoyable as the first Dead Space game's soundtrack.  This fully orchestrated soundtrack is quite cool and also has additional CD-ROM content.  I'd say it's easily worth $[...].3.  DOWNLOADS.  The Collector's Edition includes the Unitology Suit and a Force Gun via a redeemable code included in package.  For 2 items, I would say it's worth about $[...]-$[...].4.  LITHOGRAPH.  It's nothing stunning, but it is a postcard sized piece illustrating some Necromorph artwork.With everything included, an additional $[...] for this edition of the game is a pretty fair price and includes a pretty cool box shell as well.  Considering how many $[...] - $[...] overpriced collector's offerings there are out there, I was surprised that EA only asked $[...] for this one.  Overall, I give it a 4.5/5 for the Collector's swag.Dead Space 2, by Visceral Games, has been one of my most anticipated titles to date.  The trailers have certainly hyped it quite a bit and, to be perfectly honest, the game has EXCEEDED my expectations - a first for me.This is a must-have if you own the first game.  You will not be disappoined.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2011"}

I'd have given this a higher rating were it not for some things that were dumb.The gameplay is great at first!  But eventually its just the same thing over and over again.  The gameplay starts to repeat itself over and over and over.  Kill something exchange items with a character.  This become very annoying.  If this game were more of an RPG and not some action game it would've been better. A LOT better.The exchanging gifts was cool and a great concept but it gets boring really fast sometimes when you're just receiving the same gift over and over again.When you actually got to battle a bunch though the game really hits high when they're a lot of enemies around, but like I said battling gets repetive at times and easily gets frustrating later on in the game when you start to notice that enemies can block anything.  Also, its annoying to keep fighting the same goddamn boss over and over again!  I felt like I was playing Devil May Cry fighting every boss like three times.The cutscenes in the game are brilliant!  But the characters have no real depth behind them.  There isn't anything this game does to make you feel much of anything for the characters.  To make matters worse they tried to throw in a love story and that wasn't too good either.I like the fact that the game does actually give off replay.  If you actually liked battling and can deal with it all the time, this game has lots of replay.  But you also have to like the gift exchange system.  Depending on who you trade with most depends on who you're most allied with.  Its possible to play all the four different scenarios in one game!  If you trade and battle a lot then cool.Leveling up your armor is ok, but once its all maxed out why the hell would you want anymore souls?  There isn't much to this game at all.  It has tons of mini-games and secrets.  But near the end the game gets boring and is the same basic thing over and over again.The music score is brilliant, but isn't quite as good as the first game.  The game is a little harder but I still think it was easy until that final boss battle.  The game has different game modes and thats kinda cool too.  But the game would've been much better as and RPG rather than an acton game.OVERALLThe good+Fantastic Music+Great cinematics and graphics+Battling can be fun+Trading gifts was creative+Pretty good storyline for something done over and over+Cool secrets+Good replay for the different scenariosThe Bad-Too much battling gets repetitive-Trading can get boring and predicable-The ending isn't much of an ending-Would've been better as an RPG-Too much of the same battling as in the last gameOverall its good but the fact that you don't play as Samanosuke kinda sucks!

Want the low down? Here it is, for those of you who didnt pre order the game like I did along with others. First off, it sucks writting a review anything less than 5 stars. I had high hopes for this game, I loved the first game. Writting this review, know that I never played The second. I didnt like the storyline and didnt want to take away from Bioshock. Here comes along Bioshock Infinite. I said to myself when I first heard about it \"Now thats a good idea, dont try and top the first with the story taking place in the water again (bioshock2) and build a city in the sky! Very Smart!\" So I waited and waited for it to be released and now Im angry at the team that put it together. Here is the pro's and Con's.Pro+Good Idea for the world to take place in the sky+Long gameplay, maybe took me 6 or 7 hours to finished on normal.+Strong Begining+New CharactersCons-Only hold 2 weapons at once (Seriously, does anyone like that?)-Weak, very weak storyline-Boring New Characters-The graphics got worse? (To double check I wasnt going crazy, I put in Bioshock 1 and yeah Bioshock infinite graphics are terrible up agaisnt its older brother. I do think that is due to the lighting tho. First game is very dark, shadows. 3rd game is all in the light)-The goals of the game felt lame and uninspired-No replay value-Terrible terrible terrible ending (Almost as bad as Rage)In A nutshell, its a let down for me. I felt like I was just playing to get it over with after the first half of the game. STrong start, weak finish. My suggestion, if you are a fan of the series then you are going to get it either way. If your hardcore into Bioshock 1 then you will be let down with this title. Try going into it open minded...but even then its still a let down. If I was to review this game without playing the first...its still an average release like all the other first person shooters they bang out every year.**Internet trolls, this is my opinion and doesnt make it right.

I own the Black Ops 2 Tango and have been extremely pleased with them on my Xbox 360. I decided to upgrade to the newest version for use with my PS4.  Sadly, after receiving the headset I discovered two huge cons.  First, you need to connect the headset to your controller via a cable, newer lots will include the cable, but older lots require you to contact Turtle Beach for a free cable.  Basically, if it has been on the shelf for a while you may need to contact Turtle Beach for the cable. Secondly, you cannot control the volume from the headset.  You can only control the volume from the settings menu on the PS4. Turtle Beach said a later firmware patch will rectify these issues, but no planned date has been scheduled.  I am upset because they aggressively marketed the headset for use with the PS4. I do not want to pay for something and not be able to use all the features. Sure I can wait for the firmware update, but that could be weeks or months.  During that time I will not know if everything functions as it should and may discover after the wait I have a defective product, which will eat away at my warranty. I feel they are just grabbing everyone&#8217;s money now and will deliver later. At this time I can only give it two stars based on the extreme limited use. When it is 100% functional I will adjust my review accordingly.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Victoria Jann Borjesson \"Calle Borjesson\"","summary":"great fighting game","reviewText":"this game should be rated e. this game is really fun and has a whole bunch of charecters. fire emblem is gonna come out with marth and roy(check the review up there or down there depends where they're gonna put my review.)will come out in america for game cube. this is a great 4 player fighting game and has a whole bunch of levels and charecters. there is like 2 levels for each character(s.) this game is one of the best fighting games for the game cube that is 4 player. maybe i wont even be on the same page as him or her.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00149MEVY","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"yawn","reviewText":"This is not a good Silent Hill game...I would say it's the least impressive of all the major releases to date. It's a very small-time venture, and only holds about two-thirds of the amount of gameplay that I would wish for in a game from this series.Lets start with the plot...A man named Alex comes home to the sleepy town of Shepherd's Glen only to find fog everywhere and the town eerily deserted and locked up tight. In his wanderings he comes across about 5 people (amazingly all have some important connection with him), one of whom is his mother who tells him his brother is missing. This is pretty banal, as 99.99% of the whole TOWN is missing, but anyway, Alex goes off on a search that takes him through foggy streets, a cemetery, a prison, a hotel and so on. On several occasions, Alex spots the young brother, who (stop me if you've heard this before) always trots off round a corner just as Alex calls his name and approaches. Yawn! How much longer are we going to have to put up with that old plot mechanic? As well as the cliched speech that Alex gives to everyone he meets: \"I need to find my brother! Have you seen him\". Anyway it isn't long before Alex starts to realise there's a whole lot of nastiness going on, and so the tale unfolds.Lets leave the plot there and concentrate on what's good and bad about the game.GOOD: Graphics are great, some of the scenery is terrific and there's lots of detail. There is also a really nasty climax to the whole game with large dollops of very shocking gore and torture - be prepared for this. There are some new monsters with some cool designs (we liked the poison gas belching things, the Scarlet boss, and the gas chamber boss).BAD: And, sorry folks there is more bad than good. The character faces look awful - Alex looks like an eyerolling zombie in some shots. The controls are pretty bad and you get REALLY low maximum ammo capacity! Cruelly, you often can't even backtrack to pick up unused stashes when you need them either - this game is really linear. And the inventory ring is terrible! If you open it and then quit without making a selection, you automatically use or equip whatever was on the screen at the time you quit - and in my case I was continually using up the best healthpacks (serums) even when I didnt want to. BAD DESIGN! Plus, the locations are fun but quite small - and more of those frickin' faceless nurses - enough already!!! Think of something new!Finally the PS3 version is also pretty buggy - several times puzzles look like they have gone wrong but still work (the four locks on Alex's house?) and you often see screens glitching between game view and cut scenes.All in all it's a bit botched. Seems like quite a rushed job with some very ugly scenery in places (The Lair? What was THAT?). Added to this how short (and also easy) it is, and you won't be spending very long in Silent Hill this time. Not to mention that the game spends precious little of the time in Silent Hill anyway (and both it and Shepherd's Glen have a ridiculously small amount of explorable streets).The only thing that really lingered in my mind was some of the graphic violence (I think the 18 rating is earned), but most of the rest of this trip to Silent Hill only warrants a flying visit.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2009"}

I played the demo and I thought it was pretty good and I couldnt wait to it comes out. I got the game few days ago. There are good and bad stuff in this game.Good:Bullet time is pretty sick. You hold your breath and you can hear your heartbeat beating in the background while you are going to shoot the enemy. And the x-ray vision when the bullet hits or breaks the bone. I get very excited when I shoot a bullet to hey he enemy's head and breaks the skull.Other thing is the equipment. Triping mine, mines, rocks( cause a distraction), and grenades. My favorite is the Triping mine. You can set a mine on one side and another to the other side. Mostly you can do that when you pass a doorway so you can trick the enemy.Different guns: sorry but I forgot the names of the guns. But each gun is from the Germans, America, and Russia. Pretty sick guns like the mp40, ppsh gun (Russia) and the Thompson. The pistols were pretty good but I use the suppressor pistol.Gameplay controls: for me, I can move the sniper pretty easy. So I can basically dodge those bullets but that is just me and my sentitivity.Bad:Graphics: ok I say but expect better. It is like 2010 graphics.Glitches : there are some in the game. One time I was taking heavy fire and need a wall to get cover. Found one and half of the body was in the ground. I couldn't shoot or peek out. Yes, I can get off the wall and move again. There will be some points in the game that you find a glitch.Guns: this game needs more guns and more ammo.The multiplayer: never played it and need to renew membership for LIVE.

Sleeping Dogs is worthy of its growing reputation as an interesting, semi open world, wander through the city story.  It is not GTA, or Saints Row, nor does it pretend to be.  Its a cool story about organized crime in Hong Kong (one of my favorite places on earth), the cops, and the city.It takes a while to get into the story, as well as get going into the gameplay.  I always am suspicious of games that require lots of tutorials, and Sleeping Dogs has some, but probably needs more.  Like Assassins Creed, the PC controls require a deft touch, which is usually ok with me.  I always assume that I'll have to get used to the controls to be most effective with the style of gameplay that the designers thought about when building the game.I usually like fighting games (Batman Arkham City/Asylum are some of my all time faves in this genre), and Sleeping Dogs has plenty in droves.  Unfortunately, its another example of combo mouse clicks, perfect timing, and all sorts of other things that are hard to control.  The original Witcher had a unique method of controlling mouse timing and movement, but once you got used to it, it was terrific and made the game super fun.This game though, is far less fun, as the combo button pushes, as well as other combo keys, make it hard to handle the fights, especially in groups.  You can usually get through them, but its far from enjoyable gamepley.  The driving and gunplay are fine, less annoying.My single biggest annoyance is the PC method used for guiding the character.  Its part mouse, part Left/Right keys.  It makes accurate running nearly impossible, where you are trying to get somewhere, either in a chase or in a fight, and you end up somewhere completely different.  Its truly borked, and makes absolutely zero sense.  I guess the developers never bothered playing with a PC....In conclusion, its another sad story of console-itis, as well as awkward control decisions in the first place.  I'm sure these subtle problems could be fixed with a patch that would allow the character control to actually work, but we'll see if the Square Enix and the devs actually get around to it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2012"}

Mauricio","summary":"Good Uncharted clone, bad Tomb Raider game.","reviewText":"Once again we find Tomb Raider being re-imagined by Crystal Dynamics. Lara's story has once again been scrapped this time, now she is a young woman in her early 20s whose yet to be the world class archeologist she would eventually be known for. Our young heroine finds herself shipwrecked as her and an ensemble cast of generic and multi-cultural crew members in the seas off Japan known as the Dragon's Triangle (a Japanese Bermuda Triangle of sorts). The island where she is stranded is once home to an ancient people and is currently infested with deranged cultists off for blood.Gameplay here is not what you would expect from a Tomb Raider game. Gone is the precision based platforming replaced with much more simplified controls. You'll no longer need to guess how far you have to jump as the game will automatically do it for you so long as you press the jump button. The locations you are in no longer require thought in figuring out point A to B. With the press of the L2 button, Lara goes into a mode called Survival Instincts that highlights things that you need to focus in to solve the simple &#34;puzzles&#34; thrown all over the game. Exploring is still there since the whole game is set in one island. In fact, the game borrows heavily from Metroid (hey, a franchise with a lady as a main protagonist) where you'll be backtracking to previous locations to open previously locked areas when you gain new abilities.Another first for a TR game is the focus on gunplay and hand weapons based combat. The gunplay is actually quite satisfying despite the fact that you'll constantly see Lara during the cutscenes in agony under such circumstances. That's a huge problem I have with this game, Lara is portrayed as just a young woman whose often very vulnerable and weak. The punishment you see her endure during the cutscenes are borderline sadistic, made for a Ryona loving audience. Yet the moment you regain control, Lara can pull off head shots like was trained by the Seals. Just like in modern action games, melee is a big part of this game. The weak, helpless Lara you see in the cutscenes becomes a highly skilled marksman who can also pull off ruthless up close and personal melee kills with her trusty axe. It doesn't just end there, she has miraculously  mastered the art of modifying weapons to give her an advantage.Graphically this new Tomb Raider game is simply, drop dead gorgeous. The island you are stuck in is beautifully rendered full of detail in every inch of the map. Even on the PS3 the game looks and runs very nicely it's very hard to find any faults in the visuals. The game also relies on physics based puzzles that really show off how everything runs bang on from a technical standpoint. Simply put the visual presentation of this game looks like it belongs in the top 1% of PS3 exclusives. This is a multi platform title after all.Perhaps what I'm least impressed with this game is that it's called Tomb Raider but is a very poor one at it. There are tombs in this game but are primarily just large rooms with one puzzle to solve. The game also is not very challenging when it comes to platforming. I've mentioned this already, the only hard bits here are the set piece battles and that is not what Tomb Raider is all about.Crystal Dynamics has done some epic platforming adventures in the past and its a bit disheartening that they went the Uncharted clone with Tomb Raider. Even if Tomb Raider Underworld was a buggy mess, it was a grand platforming adventure that tested your skills. This one primarily just tests your trigger fingers to see if you can survive a gunfight. People who called this the best Tomb Raider game ever made are either  too young to play the PS1 games or are not good enough to pass them. My litmus test for the franchise has and will always be Tomb Rider 3. A game that really demanded mastery  of the controls from the player to solve really sadistic stage designs.the new Tomb Raider greatly deviates from that instead, to provide another shooting game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2013"}

Oh yeah, and at one point Lara feels bad about killing a guy -- then proceeds to kill hundreds as the game progresses. There's a huge problem with consistency everywhere in this game. I won't accept this just because it has good graphics and gameplay.I feel ashamed to have reserved and purchased this game [via GameStop]. I feel ashamed to have gotten out of bed in the early morning cold to buy this game. I feel ashamed to have tweeted a picture of the games cover, boasting to my thousands of followers that I have this game. I feel ashamed to have waited in anticipation as it began to install. I do not think I'm going to be buying any video games for a very long time (outside of sports) if this is what is considered good these days. I turned off my console as it saved to purposely corrupt the game -- that'll show Square. Go buy LEGO Indiana Jones instead.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2013"}

This game does not have non-stop action but with a game like this, that's not a bad thing. When the action does start, the combat is fun. There is nothing boring about the platforming or the fight sequences. They are constantly throwing something different at you. You can shoot, fight and use special skills. What more do you want? The graphics are great, some of the best I have seen, and the story is good enough to keep you playing through. Remixing memories is pretty cool too! If you are a C.O.D fanboy, this game is probably not for you! This game does require you to think at times. Some people complain about there only being two buttons to press during combat, other than the shooting and special abilities. This is actually a good thing. Each button press is mapped to a different move that you choose from a list of moves as part of your combo strings. Using only two buttons keeps memorization to a tolerable level. All you have to do is remember the combo strings and not the individual moves. Nicely done! I would recommend this game to anyone who actually wants something that is not run of the mill. Don't listen to people who give this game average or below average scores. These are people who are used to the same old thing and think every game should be the same.

When Amazon made Uncharted 2: Among Thieves available for pre-order, I did what you would infer I did-I pre-ordered it. I didn't try multi-player yet, I only played the demo, so if you're looking for a review on multi-player, don't read this. If you've played the first Uncharted, then you're not going to have trouble with this--the controls are almost exactly the same. The storyline is as intriguing as you'd imagine. I'm glad they kept the Dragon Sniper and the Wes, and they even threw in some new guns. The M32 Hammer (I think that's what it's called) is sweet and the RPG 7 is great if you have a lot of enemies crowded together. I found the parts with the helicopters and the tanks a bit frustrating, but I got over it. There are much more challenges (in my opinion) in this than in the first--and I mean shooting-wise. They still kept the puzzles that barely require any logic at all. All you need is Nate's journal to solve them. There's still plenty of action and some hilarity. It's a lot like the first, and I'm beginning to think Naughty Dog can pull anything off--and a game with extremely high expectations because of its prequel is pretty hard to pull off. The graphics are still through the roof and the environments and surroundings tie in perfectly with the situations. A must-have for PS3 owners.

I have mario party for ds lite, and I've played Super Mario Bros. 1,2,3  for NES, Super Mario for SNES, and Nintendo 64's Super Mario Bros.  Having said that, I saw little things in this game that included something from all of the past Marios, which I thought was cool.  You have the collapsing skeletons from SMB 3 in the first dungeon, you have basically the SMB 3 level map and item choosing.  You have the power up levels that are from SMB 3.  Overall it took a lot from SMB 3, left the level maps up to SMB 1 and 2, and threw in a little something from DS Lite's Mario and stuff.  Overall average game that has potential.

A really, REALLY fun game.","reviewText":"Vanquish is a fast-paced, high-action shooter with outstanding graphics and a fun storyline.  Think Dead Space meets Robotech.  It's also got several skill-level settings, so once you go through on normal (or casual, if you're a new gamer), there are more difficult settings that make several play-throughs fun. The gameplay flows nicely.  There are an array of techniques and weapons.  As a player, you're free to develop your own style.  The game is fairly generous with its weapons upgrades, but there are a lot of weapons to choose from.  So you're going to want to figure out which weapons you dig and focus on making those really awesome (tip: upgrade the heavy machine gun, not the assault rifle).  (There's a nice balance between fighting swarms of fairly weak opponents, moderately difficult opponents and your occasional badass that takes some doing to kill.  At no point, however, does Vanquish feel like a grind.  Even the boss fights feel \"fair.\"  And by this I mean that the controls stay responsive (you don't get \"stunned\" every time you take a hit) and dispatching them doesn't require some silly gimmick that takes two hours and half your hair ripped out of your skull to figure it out.  However, to win Vanquish, you do have to take full advantage of all the capabilities of the suit.  That being said, the wildly over the top skills and abilities afforded you by the suit are what make Vanquish the thrill ride that it is.What could be stronger?  The character development.  Where we can all get on board with stopping a malevolent dictator from taking over the world, our hero doesn't have a personal stake in the story.  Clearly he knows the scientist he's supposed to be rescuing, but for most of the game, we're vague with regard to what their relationship was (Is this out hero's father, mentor, friend, brother, what?)  Hence, Vanquish could dig a little deeper to tease out a strong emotional core to pull us through the story.  Yes, I'm nitpicking, but personally I always find that the more fully realized the characters, the more invested I get in the game.  I hate to say this, but for a Japanese game, the story excels.  At least it makes sense.As far as the gameplay goes, I really don't see how Vanquish could have gotten it any better.  This is a masterfully executed, kickass game.  It's exquisitely balanced and balls-out fun to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2011"}

It is so much better than those other boxing simulations.  I did fitness boxing with an Olympic boxing trainer for three years, and this game comes the closest to what we would do in our training sessions.  I do not know why they didn't just call the game -  Wii Boxing!  The only thing missing is actual sparring simulations.  And they also could use a speed bag simulation.  It would, of course, be impossible to simulate heavy bag without a heavy bag.One part of the game is boxing lessons - how to jab, cross, uppercut and hook, as well as stepping, ducking and weaving.  Another part is the boxing examination, where you can test yourself on your skills and earn certificates.  Then there is the additional fitness drills, abdominals, squats, pushups.  Each one is done in a 3 minute round, just like boxers do when they train.  In fact, these exercises are all the same ones that we would do in my boxing class.The game allows you to create an anime version of yourself.  As you workout, you earn \"Gold\" with which you can buy additional outfits, including a full body panda suit.  For some reason, all this struck me as incredibly Japanese.  I wonder if the game was originally developed in Japan under another name, since there's nothing particularly \"Gold's Gym\" about it (and I belonged to a Gold's Gym in the past).  Other nice features include the ability to work out in three different locations - forest, ocean, and gym, and a way to track your data with a calendar, height/weight/BMI, etc.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2009"}
{"product_name":"B003PHLTDC","description":"","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"NOT A GEARS CLONE","reviewText":"A lot of people have been bashing this game saying it is a Gears of War clone. To set things straight, it was Shinji Mikami, director of Vanquish and Resident Evil 4, established third person shooter genre. While Gears of War are great games, but Vanquish is a different type of game in league of its own. After finishing the story on HARD difficulty and attempting couple of challenge rooms (you unlock by finishing campaign chapters), here is what I thought.****************PROS*****************REVOLUTIONARY ACTION-PACKED GAMEPLAY: While majority of people will confuse this game with Gears clone, this game promotes you to do exactly the opposite of what is required in Gears. Gears of War promotes and rewards you cover and shoot type of gameplay. Now if you try really hard, you can probably get through this game using cover and shoot strategy, but chances are by staying in cover long enough, you will probably gate killed by either melee attacks of agile enemies, by mega lazer that bosses fire or simply by homing missiles. To get an edge over the enemies in this game, you have to be daring. You have to do crazy actions such as use your boosters, kick them on the face while jumping in the air, while in air slow down time and shoot the enemies around you. COOL, RIGHT? Honestly, the gameplay, rocket boosters, crazy melees, freeze time and shoot are BEST PART OF THIS GAME.UPGRADE REWARD SYSTEM: Just like fasted pace gameplay, this is also something new and unique in this game. All of the weapons you get are upgradable. But to upgrade them you have to be strategic. There are two ways you will find upgrades for the weapons. One is simply by destroying enemies (or rather destroying multiple enemies in stylish manner). Other is by not using that weapon and them picking up one more of that weapon from destroyed enemies or from crate supplies which are found like every 7-10 minutes. This prevents you from overusing one weapon and exploring different weapons found in the game. Also, reckless shooting or staying in cover for too long will get you killed. If you get killed enough times (by playing recklessly), your weapons will be downgraded.JOYS OF EXPERIMENTATION: So on one hand you have your abilities and on other hand you have at least 8 different types of weapons (maximally 4 at a time). The gameplay truly encourages you to experiment with them. I.e. use assult rifle and take out legs of big robot while you are in cover, jump out of the cover and slow down time, quickly take out the hands of the robot, boost your thrusters get close to the robot and finally melee its head off. LOVE IT JUST FREAKING LOVE IT.YOUR SUIT, WEAPONS, ENVIRONMENTS AND ART: To me this is the coolest thing in this game. Your suit and weapons are created from \"nucleus\". So you will see each time the character relaxes, the helmet will be half gone and when you change weapons, one weapon will turn into another. Words simply can't describe it. Furthermore, depiction of near robotic future of America and designs of Marines and their commander Burns (with all the armor and heavy guns) is also pretty technical and to the details. I like it a lot.GREAT ENEMY A.I.: I loved the A.I. in this game. YOU CAN'T HIDE. The enemies and bosses will come and get you. Even the weakest enemies have deadliest melee attacks. While I played it on hard mode, even on normal mode, enemies can kill you with ONE HIT KILL. Don't worry though. This is no Demons Soul. There are frequent checkpoints in the game. And the opposite is also true. You can kill many of the enemies with one hit kill assuming you do things the right way. Even the bosses you may find difficult at first have weaknesses. You just have to experiment enough and find out how. Love how this game push you to try new things.CHALLENGING BOSSES: There 6-8 different types of bosses (not including few main bosses) in the game that you may encounter more than one time. Some of these bosses are very unique. While you can shoot them over and over again and kill them, it will take long and chances are some of these bosses will kill you with one hit kill. To beat these bosses you will truly have to master your skills (dodging, thrusting, slowing time etc.) Again love how this game pushes you to experiment and be tactical.DECENT STORY: While it is not one of the best, the story still makes sense and has certain degree of suspense and mystery to it. English voice acting, dialogues and character facial expressions are pretty good. I won't spoil the story, but if you follow politics (more importantly IF YOU ARE REPUBLICAN), you will enjoy the depiction of Hilary Clinton look a like depiction of US president.CHALLENGE ROOMS: After finishing each chapter of the game, you will unlock Challenge rooms (equivalent to Horde Mode in other games). As stated above, you have lots of abilities and weapons and campaign is rather fast. So challenge rooms are one place you can experiment as much as you want with your weapons and abilities, create new moves and punish enemies. Now don't get me wrong that is not the only purpose of Challenge rooms. As their name states, it will be a true \"challenge\" to finish these challenge room levels as you will have one after another hordes of enemies attacking you from all the direction. These challenge room truly adds to the replayability of the game.***************CONS.******************RELATIVELY SHORT CAMPAIGN AND NO MULTIPLAYER: I know these days most games are 8-10hrs long, but I wish the campaign was longer. While multiplayer and co-op is not a requirement for this type of games, I truly wish it had it. It feels like one of the games that is designed for co-op. Never the less, it has challenge rooms, so it does add longetivity of the game. Plus, if you get hold of the action, I know you will play it more than once.UNIQUE MELEE: Melee attacks in this game are SUPER AWESOME. Only drawback is they are quite tactical. Using them will deal great damage to enemies, but also leave you vulnerable to enemy attack if you don't kill them off with melee or melee weapon combo. I truly wish you don't have to be so tactical when using melee and could use it as much as you want.*********CONCLUSION******************This is a very unique game and certainly not a clone of Gears of War (which is also a great game). If you like crazy fast-paced action mixed with futuristic weapons this is a game for you. Any body who is a fan of action adventure and shooter games such as Resident Evil 4, Gears of War and even Devil May Cry should definitely this a try. THIS GAME IS UNLIKE ANYTHING OTHER YOU HAVE PLAYED. Trust me on that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2010"}

Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Lots of mindless fun, but a little repetitive.","reviewText":"There is an argument that games can be a truly transformative and liberating artform, a way of transmitting ideas and narratives and developing characters in ways that traditional film and literature cannot hope to match. There is also an argument that, whilst that is true, games should also seek new ways of including as many ludicrous explosions and insane stunts as possible whilst allowing the player to go mental with an Uzi whilst dangling from a helicopter. Just Cause 2 is the ultimate exploration of the latter idea.The setting is the island-nation of Panau, which stretches across a massive 400 square kilometres. For the record, that's thirty times the size of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and twenty-five times the size of Skyrim. It's an absolutely massive environment taking in frozen, snow-blown mountains, burning deserts and lush, tropical jungle, as well as the skyscraper-strewn metropolis of Panau City. Playing as Rico, you can use ground vehicles ranging from tuk-tuks to armoured personnel carriers (via sports cars, bikes and fire engines) as well as a variety of helicopters, boats, jet fighters and airliners. An arsenal of weaponry is available including submachine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, grenades, explosives and Magnum-like hand cannons. Rico has a grappling hook which he can use to grab lifts on passing aircraft or cars (and then hijack them), or ascend to the roofs of buildings quickly. He can also use it as a weapon, pulling enemies off high ledges or - most entertainingly - attaching them to passing vehicles or exploding gas canisters.The game has a central storyline which is worthwhile enough, with a few good gags and a few satirical jabs aimed at American foreign policy, but it's mainly worth playing for the missions, which tend to be more epic and inventive than most of the game. The bulk of the game is spent playing missions for each of the three rebel factions, helping them expand their territory over larger portions of the maps. The faction missions are enjoyable, but tend to be brief and rather easy. Disappointingly, they also don't overlap. In fact, bizarrely, each of the three factions seems completely unaware of the existence of the others, even when their territory meets. The faction missions also just peter out in the end, with no big pay-off or final mission for each faction, which feels like a bit of missed opportunity.Where the game's true appeal lies is in its enormous open world. The game scores everything by how much chaos you cause. The more chaos you cause, the more missions, weapons and vehicles you unlock and more unstable the regime becomes. You cause chaos by completing missions but also destroying government property, such as petrol stations, oil depots and military bases. Sufficiently impressive explosions also add to your chaos score. In short, whilst going absolutely ballistically nuts in, say, a GTA game is a fun diversion, in Just Cause 2 it's part of the core game design. To get to 100% game completion, you need to pretty much destroy every single bit of government property on the map (which, given the map's overwhelming size, will take weeks, if not months) and pick up every single upgrade (since there's literally thousands of them, this will also take a while). To make this more achievable, the game breaks the completion score down by location and settlement, with each settlement having it's own sub-score so you know if you have to do more stuff there or can move on.This is the the core of Just Cause 2's appeal: going crazy and blowing everything up is built into the game design rather than being left as an optional extra, and makes the game more entertaining. Everything else, even the missions, are designed around this idea (so whilst doing a story mission in an enemy base, you may wish to simultaneously level the place and get all the upgrades to put it towards your overall score). This is useful as the main storyline, whilst amusing, is rather brief if you tear right through it.Visually, the game looks astonishing, even three years after release. The draw distances are staggering, the views of the islands are incredible either by day or night (and at night the sight of the lights of villages on the sides of mountains a dozen miles away is particularly evocative) and the attention to detail is mind-blowing. Each island is packed with towns, villages, remote homesteads, ruined temples and other features of interest. You could play this game for months and still never see all there is to see. It's bigger than many MMORPG worlds (Panau is five times the size of the entire planet in World of WarCraft, for example).Unfortunately, where Just Cause 2 does break down is repetition. The game world is enormous, but there is a limit on what you can do. In fact, whilst the game world is far vaster than any GTA game, you're still limited to blowing things up, doing story missions or taking part in races. GTA4's attempts to give you more stuff to do through bowling, mini-games etc may have been fairly naff, but at least it was an attempt to give the player more activities to pursue in its open world (something GTA5 sounds like it will improve on further). It's unlikely that many players will get to 100% completion in Just Cause 2 because to do so would involve attacking dozens and dozens of near-identical military bases, exploring dozens and dozens of near-identical towns and villages and base-jumping around lots of very similar skyscrapers in the city, whilst having to painstakingly explore every nook and cranny to make sure you haven't missed a hidden upgrade crate. The game world is vast, huge and overwhelmingly impressive, but it will eventually get a little stale. This will vary by player, and for me it didn't happen until almost 35 hours in the game and 40% completion (accomplished by completing very faction and storyline mission, destroying almost twenty military bases and generally causing lots of random havoc). Certainly there is more than enough game here for your money, enhanced further on the PC version by both the more lush visuals and the impressive multiplayer mode (added by modders).Just Cause 2 (****) is a big, dumb and amusing game set in possibly the greatest environment ever created for a game. Some might wish for a stronger narrative, or more variance in the missions and locations, but as an open-world sandbox designed for having fun, Just Cause 2 is now the game to beat.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2013"}

It's true what people are saying about this game: it's not good. RE4 bought the game to a new, exciting level. RE5 continued the trend on the new consoles, but RE6 is a B-movie.The formula has gotten old. Although Capcom pulls out the stops on graphics and melodrama - things I love about the series - they also include lots of predictable moments and frustrating camera angles. The series is ailing, and Capcom just goes through the motions here.Boring me, and annoying me, about RE6:1. Enemy cheap shots: zombies/j'avo pop out of nowhere and get a cheap hit in. Although it happens only a couple times, it shouldn't happen at all.2. Ultimate boss battles that drag on and on. Take the Simmons fight, for example. That was about six different battles w/the same guy. After \"killing\" him once, it was like watching a cheesy horror flick where the monster jumps out of nowhere at the end despite being killed.(And then you get to fight him AGAIN as Ada Wong - yippeee)3. Frustrating camera angles in the Chris campaign. There's a part where you have to escape a huge BOW, and it's about as fun as sliding down a pole fixed with razor blades into a pool of lemon juice.4. Getting your butt kicked relentlessly as cut scenes unfold. After a while, seeing Chris/Leon/Jake/Ada falling fifty feet onto concrete, getting swatted by a giant BOW, or getting tossed like a doll by yet another huge explosion gets tiresome after a while.The good news is that RE6 is worth it for $20.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2013"}
{"product_name":"B003O6C9LK","description":"","reviewerName":"pastapadre","summary":"Fantastic socially-centric online experience makes SSX arguably the best alternative sports game of the generation.","reviewText":"The SSX reboot from EA Sports faced the difficulty of living up to nostalgic feelings bred from earlier entries in the series while taking advantage of the advanced technology available and in turn justify its full price on the 360 and PS3 with a wider-ranging experience. The new game had to appeal to those earlier fans while reaching new ones - and it entered the marketplace during a period where arcade-style games have found little traction.Despite some bumps along the way SSX largely succeeds by providing the potential of immesurable value with an innovative online experience.UPSIDE--Exhilarating and Varied Gameplay--There is a rush that comes about in SSX that is rare to find anymore. The danger of cruising down a mountainside is fully realized - whether it be simply from the speed or other challenges that get mixed in. Whether it's the races, trick events, or simply survival runs there is something new to be found in each event.The environments all feel different - the nine Deadly Descents offering unique elements of their own to face. Having different goals and challenges on each run really mixes things up well. Throwing in new gear to utilize based on those environments can be really fun to try out also - the wingsuits in particular - but a few of them turned out not so positively.Still there is never a sense that SSX is going to run out of steam - there's always something new to achieve and how to do so will provide the challenge. The fun factor has the potential to be off-the-charts and it reaches that level at times.--Social-Based Online Play--Though SSX doesn't feature traditional head-to-head online play what it does deliver in terms of a social dynamic is brilliant. Not only does it provide great incentive to continue playing and improving but it eliminates the headaches that would come by playing against live opponents and avoids the wait times needed to gather for such events.RiderNet always keeps players alert of their friend's activity. If time or score on a drop is beat it immediately informs of that and in doing so provides motivation to go back to recapture the lead. Global Events can include up to 100K people and offer a huge pot of \"credits\" depending on the final bracket that one's time or score finishes in. Some of these events cost credits to get in but it's relatively easy to make them into winning propositions. There is also what amounts to a side-game with \"Geotags\" which can be placed and captured for credits.Make no mistake about it - SSX is most rewarding due to its online integration. The offline mode of World Tour pales in comparison to the value online delivers and the \"Online Pass\" implementation is much better than just blocking people out. Knowing how important the online modes are to SSX as a package is surely the reason why it was designed that way.--Technical Achievements--SSX utlized NASA data to craft the real-world mountains. While I would have no idea just how accurate the final product is to the actual topography that is just cool in itself. The controls are a tad loose but responsive and the feel of going down the mountain comes through in exceptional fashion. The graphics are crisp and look great throughout the numerous environments. The menus are well-designed and promote more play through smart navigation and notification options.DOWNSIDE--Moments of Frustration--As fun as the game can be it also reaches high on the frustration scale. In some situations it can be difficult to orient and that results in turning the wrong way or loss of momentum or even heading off a cliff. On occasion characters have gotten completely stuck though that isn't as prevalent an issue. Falling into a void is about as bad as things can get and it happens often. SSX makes sure disaster will strike by throwing in a lot of cliffs, attempting to outrun avalanches while having to do it backwards on the controls, and limiting visibility severely.The Deadly Descents can be incredibly tough and not necessarily for the right reasons. The unique elements to deal with make them exciting and some are quite fun while others are just irritating and not worth the time and struggle that comes with it. Given that the game provides the user with the ability to skip any run after failing three times shows the devs were obviously aware of that. This is more concentrated on being a problem with World Tour and isn't really a consideration when it comes to RiderNet or Global Events.For a game that offers an organic challenge in trying to beat your own marks, and throws in some stuff just to make things especially difficult at times, there are also elements that seem too simple. Grinding is the main one...just ski on over near a rail and the work is done. The \"Survive It' runs also lose something because there is no downside to going as slow as possible and that doesn't feel real natural to do in a game of this nature.--Restart, Restart, Restart--Be prepared to restart drops often - there's just no way around that. The \"Rewind\" feature is useful for correcting quick errors (and placing Geotags) but it won't be found worthwhile in escaping devastating ones. When trying to beat a time or score one crucial mistake can be all that's needed to ruin a run and that leads to restarts.SUMMARYSSX has the potential to be an exceedingly fun game with a very addictive nature if one is able to get past the frustration that accompanies it. The tolerance level to those moments will ultimately determine how much value is gleaned from the product. Excellent on a technical level and delivering a fantastic socially-driven online experience makes it worthwhile to check out at the very least.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2012"}

It's got an all-star Nintendo cast with a couple of special guests from third-party titles and an interesting adventure mode.My problem with this game (and I realize I'm in a small minority here) is that the controls are just plain terrible and ruin the overall experience. I managed to get through a lot of Subspace Emissary (or whatever it's called) and unlocked most if not all of the characters, but the game does not allow the save data to be backed up, and when my Wii broke down for some unexplainable reason, those morons at Nintendo repair erased all the data when they fixed te console. Having to unlock everything again is not fun. It's the opposite of fun. It's a crap-fest with lousy controls that can make simple tasks like hitting switches and even jumping from on platform to another a frustrating chore. I don't know who thought requiring analog controls for side-scrollers was a good idea, but that person should be banned from having any input for game design. The d-pad can be used for moving, but only when using the Wii remote alone, which has more limited buttons; with a Classic Controller and GameCube controller (which only works with older Wiis), it's control stick only while the d-pads are used for taunting and, if you can somehow pull it off, changing Samus' look.The occasional auto-scrolling in the adventure mode that I originally saw in Super Mario Bros 3 also adds to the frustration.Now I get what some of you might be thinking: &#34;This guy sucks at video games and is blaming the games for his problems.&#34; I need only wait for some comments to confirm this. If you don't find the controls terrible, then you'll probably love this game, but that doesn't mean everyone has to.And in case you're wondering if this is some sort of Sony fanboy rant, I don't care for PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale either; that game is little more than a piss-poor clone (albeit with different characters) that blatantly reminds the player of the premium add-on content he or she didn't buy on the selection screens.I may edit my review from time to time, but I'm not changing my mind no matter how much flaming backlash I get.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2014"}

Over time, you'll do battle on the front lines of both sides as this shift reveals high-stakes arms threats and a terrifying glimpse of the future.HAWX: The Elite, High Altitude Warfare eXperimental SquadronYou'll begin the game as former U.S. Air Force Pilot David Crinshaw, assigned to provide air support for the well-known Ghost Recon team. You and your fellow HAWX pilots are some of the most highly-trained specialists in the world. Based out of Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, you're tasked with everything from testing secret and experimental aircraft weapon systems to carrying out combat and recon missions, training other top pilots, and attempting to capture enemy technologies.With the rise of the PMCs, your unique skills in higher demand than ever before.

HAWX goes above and beyond what I was expecting. The use of GeoEye for the environments, the great textured planes and just sheer number of aircraft available is staggering.For example, just the other day I was playing around with the \"Free Flight\" option. I picked a location and went through a couple of the planes to see how they would look and feel just flying around in an area. It was a lot of fun as I was skimming the water and then proceeded to go inverted over the water to earn a \"medal\" in the game for XP.After finishing the campaign, I am still working on unlocking the multitude of aircraft. You earn XP, and ranks which unlock aircraft and additional loadouts for each, by playing the campaign missions either by yourself or CO-OP over the PSN, or by competing in Team Deathmatches online.The gameplay itself is great. You have different views to chose from (3rd person, cockpit, and HUD view) in Assistance ON mode, which enables you to use the computer to calculate routes, intercepts, etc. And you also have Assistance OFF mode, which disables the limiter on your plane, allowing for you to pull off some complicated manuevers and aerial acrobatics while also giving you the viewpoint from almost a free observer point of view (great for dogfights, etc).The story is interesting, but the gameplay is really where it's at. The feel and sounds of the aircraft is fun to experience and that's where it really hooked me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2009"}

Scott Heitman","summary":"Cruelly Underappreciated...My Personal Game of the Year","reviewText":"The critical reception to Bionic Commando was anything but kind.  The PS3 version of the game is sitting on GameRankings with an aggregate score of 72%.  I've seen games get the short shrift before, but never so much as Bionic Commando.  I have a small confession to make;  I'm only halfway through the game, but I'm so enamored with it that I couldn't wait to write a review.  Here's the breakdown:Graphics: Stunning throughout.  Animations seem realistic (considering the subject matter at least) and environments are breathtaking.  Not much to say because there's nothing to complain about.Story:  I've heard that this aspect takes some criticism; apparently the ending is love it or hate it.  I'm enjoying the story partly because of the effective voice-acting.  Steve Blum always puts on a good performance, and he's effective here as Super-Joe.  I'm not familiar with the VA for the main character, but he certainly does a good job of making me believe he's enjoying the swinging as much as I am- which brings us to...Gameplay:  There's nothing else on the market like BC.  It's not an FPS or even a standard 3rd person shooter.  The main focus is on effective use of the bionic arm.  The result has been compared to the Spider-man games, but such a comparison leaves out the nuances that BC brings to the table.  First of all, the level design is superb.  Whereas the Spider-man levels games are typically limited to swinging around the same old skyscrapers, BC's levels are filled with all kinds of broken buildings, suspended railways, caverns, and more.  Even if the mechanics of the swinging were identical, the game would play much differently.  But the swinging requires more precision than SM.  Some players make the mistake of giving the game five minutes and deciding it sucks.  It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of using the arm, but once you've got it, you're in for some gameplay gold.  The reason the game \"works\", in my opinion, is that it doesn't focus on split-second reactions and near-impossible jumps.  Instead, the emphasis is on tactics.  How does one effectively navigate the war-torn landscape and attack ones' foes while evading their gun-fire?  Answering this question is the job of the player.  Using the arm, for instance, to swing into battle and then swing out to recover is a rewarding experience.  The boss battles, in particular, do a fantastic job of highlighting the difference between this game and your vanilla third person game.Sound:  WOW!  If you're familiar with the themes from past BC games, you'll recognize some remixed themes.  This soundtrack, however, is simply outstanding.  From the elegant piano theme in the main menu to the thundering symphonic arrangements during battle, these pieces do much to elevate the gameplay to something truly special.  On a related note, I intend to do some serious searching for the sheet music to the menu music; I would love to play that on the piano.Let's talk downsides for two seconds.  I've heard a lot of criticisms, and these are the two that I deem to be accurate:1) Radioactive out-of-bounds.  Linear games have the difficult task of creating some means to provide limits to the environments.  The standard but laughable solution of times past has been the familiar \"invisible wall\".  BC tries something new by simply killing the player if they stray out-of-bounds for too long.  It is explained that much of the city is irradiated and that our protagonist must avoid this stuff like the plague.  Most of the time, this radiation is clear enough to see.  But those few times it surprises you can get pretty annoying.  This solution to an old problem might even be elegant if well-implemented, but there are some weird choices here.  Sometimes, the UPPER HALF of a building will be irradiated.  Usually, level limits are lateral in natural, so coming across this can be vexing.2) Collectables.  See, you're gonna die a lot; this isn't an easy game (on Normal, at least).  Most games don't make you re-collect collectables if you die before reaching the next checkpoint.  Well, BC does.  Get used to it.These cons are really quite minor in comparison to the fantastic gameplay on offer.  Every major aspect of BC screams high production values, and the gameplay offers something truly novel and rewarding.  The price of BC has plummeted in most places.  I found it new for 20 dollars.  Don't believe the critics; Bionic Commando is an astonishing accomplishment.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2009"}

The unlockable and combat elements of the older title make it my sons favorite game to this day.  What this game Godzilla Unleashed adds is a story mode (with voice over and cutscenes) as well as faction meters to the gameplay, making the combinations of monster on monster mayhem endless.  The graphics are updated and look good enough(Wii).Ultimately all of the extra trimmings besides the new monsters don't add up to much but the extra options, play modes, and reward system don't hinder the game either.  The fun starts when you finally reach Tokyo in story mode and you see what the game has up its sleeve, depending on which monster you are playing as and which scenario you have picked from the occasionally branching story you will encounter new challenges and new monsters which you decide how and where to battle.  The controls for me after a very frustrating 1st session became second nature and I prefer them over the PS2 versions which handle nicely as well.  Bottome line here is you know whether this game strikes your anvil or not and the real decision is which system to buy it for, if you can get used to the Wii controls I think you will find them more responsive and smoother(eventually).  My 7 year old still prefers Melee with its old GCN controls, but I'll take the chaotic story mode of Unleased w/ Wii controls as it becomes much more rewarding as you progress.  The fun is somewhat dampened by the need to unlock your favorite monsters for the  multiplayer brawls but the single player romp is well made and worth playing through with multiple monsters anyway.
