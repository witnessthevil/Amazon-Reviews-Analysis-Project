AC3 was a good game, but I didn&#8217;t really care for the extended cut-away scenes.  If you love a whole storyline played out for you in between game play, I am sure you&#8217;d feel different.  But to me, I prefer to devote my playtime to, er&#8230;.game play.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, there is still plenty of cutaway scenes, but they are more concise and the graphics are better.As for game play, while the tone of the game is pirating and naval battle, over 50% of the game is played on land, so fear not &#8211; Pirates of The Caribbean this is not.The game does shed some of the Assassins versus Templar lore.  You assume the identity of one Edward Kenway.  The game opens as he prepares to hit the open seas, appropriating an Assassin&#8217;s cloak and joins up with a group of Templars.  They are seeking a device called The Observatory, which lets you locate anyone in the world.  After that stage is set, the gameplay &#8211; and pirating &#8211; begins!I enjoyed the land-based quests, which will be familiar play to you if you&#8217;ve played AC1, 2, or 3.  Play on the islands you visit is entertaining, but I found the islands smaller than cities in previous games.  Still there is a lot to cover. And the sea battles are a lot of fun.  You have to spend some time plotting how to attack and render a ship beaten, at which point you can board her or take scrap to help bolster your own pirate ship.  You can even deploy the ship in your own fleet.  While none of these are new gaming concepts, it is a lot of fun in AC4.The graphics are good, everything is responsive, and I really can&#8217;t say there was anything about this game that made me want to say &#8220;Why did they do that?&#8221;  Visually, again, the graphics tend to be very, very nice.I you are an AC fan, there is plenty here to keep you interested, and you will probably enjoy the new content, bouncing around the Caribbean.  If you happen not to be an AC fan, this game is different enough to be enjoyable to the general adventure game player, possibly even if you dislike dprior Ac versions.In the end, this is a really good game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0000A9Y11","description":"Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B006QRNKOO","description":"One of the most storied franchises in history soars to new heights. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword shakes up the tried-and-true adventure game formula and marks a turning point for the series. Link embarks on a sprawling adventure through the skies and across the continent when his childhood friend Zelda falls from their floating home in the sky beneath the clouds to the mysterious continent below. The introduction of full motion controls enabled by Wii MotionPlus technology synchronizes player movements with Link's actions while offering the most intuitive play control of any game in the series to date.","reviewerName":"WhitWire Reviews \"Ryan\"","summary":"Nintendo's Last Attempt at Keeping the Wii Alive","reviewText":"In the year 2011, Skyrim was the positively received by users of the Playstation 3; Batman: Arkham City was the most popular game for the Xbox 360. But for the Nintendo Wii, the most popular game released was The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword.For owners of the Nintendo Wii, last year was a bit of a bumpy ride. Rather than focus on their home console, Nintendo paid more attention to their new handheld console: the Nintendo 3DS. With the Wii's recent downfall in the amount of new games being created for it and the announcement of the Nintendo Wii U, things were looking down for the Nintendo Wii. However, with the arrival of The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, Nintendo makes their final attempt at keeping the Wii alive.This large, ever-expanding Wii game packs in so much into one little disc. Because I'm personally not one to jump directly into a game, I found it slightly annoying how large the game really was--as I'm not one to play video games for hours on end.While Skyward Sword can take hours to fully complete, all the many multiple features this game includes calls for a great replay value. I say this because you'll most likely find yourself replaying it over and over again to find hidden treasures you hadn't seen before. To this day I'm still finding objects around the world this game offers me.The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is the first 3D Zelda game I've ever owned. This being said, I'm not going to make any connections between this game and Ocarina of Time, The Wind Waker, etc.In terms of the storyline, the Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword takes place before any of the games in the Legend of Zelda franchise. The story begins when we're introduced to a land in the sky known as Skyloft. Link--the protagonist of our epic journey and the character you will be playing as--is on his way to celebrate the \"Wing Ceremony\", a tradition in which he hopes to acquire the label of a Skyloft knight.In order to become a knight, Link enters a race on a bird-like creature called a Loftwing. After you win the race, Zelda--who hasn't even reached the title of \"princess\" at this point--awards you with a sailcloth; later in the game, this sailcloth will be used as a parachute multiple times throughout the game.Not too long after Link gains his knighthood he and Zelda are caught in a storm while riding on her Loftwing. Before she can escape, Zelda falls of her Loftwing and makes her way into the land below Skyloft: the unexplored surface.When Link tells Zelda's father about his daughter's disappearance, he is given knight's clothes. Any fan of the Zelda franchise will recognize this uniform as the green, medieval clothes Link wears in every other Legend of Zelda game. From then on Link makes his way down to the surface and goes on a journey to save his friend.The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword can only be played with the Wii motion plus controller+Nunchuk combo. This being said, you won't be able to play the game with your standard Wii remote. Thankfully for me, my copy of Skyward Sword came with the golden Wiimote with motionplus controls.By pressing down the A button on your remote, you can make Link move faster with any action he performs. In order to be certain that players won't abuse this, Nintendo added a circular gauge that shows up whenever you use the A button. When this gauge empties, Link will huff and puff and will be rendered too weak to work until the gauge refills itself within a matter of about five seconds.Holding down the B trigger at the back of your remote will allow you to select a tool to use--whether that tool be your slingshot, your bow, your bug net, etc.Holding down the C button on your nunchuk will allow you to enter your \"Dowsing\" position, where you'll enter a first-person mode that helps you when looking for people by giving you a radar attribute. By using the motion controls can you point yourself in the direction of who you're looking for while in your \"Dowsing\" mode.As has been the case with every 3D Zelda game--ever since Ocarina of Time--you have the option of locking onto your enemies. In this game, however, you do so by pressing the Z button on your nunchuk. Whenever a person, monster, or a specific object with is within your reach, you can press the Z button to lock onto and interact with them. If there is not anything you can interact with nearby, pressing the Z button will only shift the camera directly behind Link.Now for my favorite control of the whole game: the sword controls. Much like the case with many other sword games for the Wii--such as the Red Steel series--you control your sword by swinging your remote around. Thanks to the motion plus you are given when you receive this game, you can thrust your sword in nine directions.These nine methods of thrusting of your sword can have an impact on how effective your attacks are. For example: a lot of enemies will be able to parry your attacks by holding up a defender at a specific angle. In order to combat against these defensive strategies, you will have to swing your Wiimote in the opposite direction to which your enemy's defender is at. This method of attack calls for much more interaction and strategy to come into your gameplay.For people who want to kill off their foes with fewer hits, you have the option of unleashing the true power of your sword. Simply by pointing your Wiimote up, Link will follow your action and point his sword \"Skyward\".Once skyward, your sword will start to charge up with energy. After a matter of about three seconds, your sword will be completely charged up. However, it won't remain charged up for long--so you'll have to use your energy before too long. But when you do use it, a ring will skyrocket from your sword and cut through almost everything in its way. This is a great way to fend off and defeat enemies in a matter of seconds.I found The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword to be a very enjoyable Wii game. I recommend any Wii owner to pick up a copy of Skyward Sword. Its vast, ever-expanding world will keep you on your toes for hours--not to mention all the action and strategy. While I personally found the game a bit too large for my taste, I'm sure many others will agree that this is still a fantastic game.If you own a Nintendo Wii and you have plenty of time on your hands, I recommend you at least try this out and see if you like it yourself.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I08DQI","reviewerName":"Carlos A. Ramos \"Voltaire Tempentry\"","summary":"A better Wii Remote experience.","reviewText":"Nintendo's Wii Remote has proved to be quite the revolutionary thing. It provided a new and fresh experience, and, with the help of Wii Sport, sold the Wii to millions of homes. It has an Infrared Pointer, motion sensing accelerometers, and a mini speaker on the front. The Wiimote has since been proven as a flashlight, a light saber, a katana, a steering wheel, a gun, etc.Now what you get in this neat $50 package is one black Wiimote along with a black newly redesigned \"vest\", \"jacket\", \"sleeve\", or \"condom\" for use with the stock Wiimote (sans Wii Motion Plus). You also get a black Wii Motion Plus device and a redesigned jacket for use with the Wiimote and the Motion Plus.The Wii Motion plus addition here is a big deal for several reasons. First of all, is the fact that this device has a stand alone price of $20, and when combined with the stand alone Wiimote ($40), you end up paying $10 more than what you would have you bought this combo pack. Second, is that Wiimotion Plus has become a new standard for several games, and more are being made all the time. Said games will REQUIRE motion plus to play, so you might as well get it now.Several games that require or are enhanced with WIIMotion Plus are-Wii Sports Resort-Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10-Grand Slam Tennis-Red Steel 2One of the first things people will notice about this new remote is obviously the color. Nintendo has swapped the sleek iPod inspired white for a very sexy black. The buttons have remained the same color (red for power, blue for Home), but those match very fluidly with the new black exterior.The functionality is the same, there are no new features, no noticeable improvements, at least on the technical side. The actual plastic material has been changed though, for the better. The top side remains with a glossy finish, but the underside, instead of mere plastic, there is now a very nice matte finish. It provides a better grip, and you'll find yourself with less sweaty hands. (note that this may be case with new White Wiimotes as well, but this is the first Wiimote ive bought in 2 years, so i wouldn't know).All in all, im very happy with my purchase. You get a Wiimote, WM+, and two \"jackets\" for just $50. You save some cash, and bag the WM+ that will be eventually needed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2009"}

So now he needs to figure out what the hell is going on and what can he do about it. inFamous plays as an open-world sandbox game with 3D platforming elements. You have full control of Cole at all times and you get to run, climb, glide and grind at will. (You can'ty swim because Cole \"feeds\" on electricity and water will hurt/kill him).  You can go freely around the city and accomplish missions as you prefer, though there are of course the main missions that drive the story, but you have certain freedom as far and how and when you can take on those. And then there's the Karma system of the games: Depending on the things you do, Cole can gain more \"good\" or \"evil\" reputation, to the point where he will be seen as either a \"Hero\" or \"Infamous\". This affects the story's outcome and events, Cole's appereance and Cole's surroundings. (more so in the 2nd game than the first).inFamous collection is a 2 disc bundle of inFamous and inFamous 2, as well as an included code to download \"Infamous: Festival of Blood\" which is a side game based on the inFamous 2 engine that is only available on the Playstation Network and involves Cole becoming a vampire.

The result is fun and frantic, if a bit too short-lived.Unreal II's best feature is its lush graphics engine. It's state of the art. All the locations, which range from bizarre alien worlds to those based on the filmAlien, exude dynamic realism. Human and alien characters are well-animated and rendered, but have a cartoonish exaggeration that clashes with the realism of the architecture. The designers were undoubtedly shooting for a comic-book look, which explains why the women look like blow-up dolls with bare midriffs and the men have hulking muscles. The monsters, too, ripple with strength and menace. This style will please some, but is less effective than the more realistic styles employed by similar titles--although at least the art direction is consistent throughout the game.Unrealcast you as a prisoner who--through both good and bad luck--was freed from confinement, but marooned on an alien world.

BubPros:Gorgeous graphicsDecent gameplayCons:Amateurish if consistent art designToo short","reviewerName":"Mark Hills \"Nobody gets me, I'm the wind, baby!\"","summary":"Beauty Without The Brains","reviewText":"There is no doubt that Unreal II: The Awakening is the current 'best looking game of all time'. It delivers staggering graphics that, while you need a power house of a machine to utilize, sets a new standard by which other games of this genre will be judged. At least until Doom III, (And that's just a retelling of the original Doom's story), is released later this year. Or Halo for the PC, also due out this year from Gearbox. Or Deus Ex- take your pick.Unreal II builds on the existing mythology established in the first Unreal (and in Return to Na-Pali), it even mentions the Tournaments and Liandri Corporation. Not to mention the three flavors of Skaarj reptile warriors- Big, Bigger and 'Oh my god!'. That aside, it is a totally new game that capitalizes on the Unreal name. However, I doubt very much Unreal II will have the same effect its predecessors will- it is graphically pretty, but isn't that good of a game even though it makes an effort to build a story better than the first ones did, even though, again, they are basically the same. As Terran Colonial Authority Marshall, John Dalton, a former Marine who had been disgraced, you ply the space lanes of the outer rim, 'bringing law to the lawless' in your ship the Atlantis (yawn!), with your crewmates.First up is the luscious Aida, whose pixelated polygons put Lara Croft to shame, she's basically second in command and gives you all your mission breifings. Aida also complains to you a lot. Next up is Isaak, another washout and drunk- he explains all your weapons and makes modifications to them. Finally is the ship's pilot, Ne'Ban, who is kind of like a little Vorlon, plus he's the only instantly likeable member of the crew and his turns of phrase are amusing. There is some interplay and development between all the characters, but its pretty minor. Unfortunately, it doesn't matter whether you interact with these people or not- if you skip a briefing from Isaak, it's not like you go on a mission without weapons or are unable to figure out what these weapons do.The missions revolve around obtaining seven pieces of this ancient artifact- while this isn't exactly a new story idea in science fiction or fantasy, it is also not one that is too difficult to make interesting. In Unreal II, however, they don't even try, because while it is a driving goal to obtain the next piece, it really could have been anything- a computer disk, a bag of money or whatever. It ultimately doesn't amount to very much when it is finally revealed what it does. It is of course wanted by everyone in the galaxy.Plus you can wander around the Atlantis between missions. This is great, but serves no purpose. You can open a few hatches and crawl around in some tunnels- but you can't DO anything to or with anything. You can't press buttons to make things happen, all you can do is look- a little like being in a Louvre. In fact, a lot of the game is like this - except for the things you're allowed to kill, environmental interaction is non-existent.The story aside, the programmers also dropped some things that were in the original that could have been useful in Unreal II- there are no portable light sources available for you to use- no flares or flashlights. I also suspect that even the story was tacked on and the game itself is just a showcase for Legend's and Digital Extreme's new graphics engine. As well there are numerous other games coming out that use the Unreal II engine, such as Deus Ex II, it will be interesting if they can get more out of it than the originators did. The music is a mixed bag, but no where near the same quality as Unreal or Unreal Tournament. Sound effects are pretty good, but nothing to write home about.Mission maps are quite large- expansive out door vistas on alien planets that eventually lead indoors in seamless transitions. Texture detail is superb and razor crisp- most things like signs and all but the smallest of computer displays, are readable. The engine is capable of so much detail- from waving grass and trees to flowing water, curves, curves and more curves, and creatures such as fish, birds and land critters that it gives everything a wonderful and very realistic organic look to it. It is often as much as fun to just explore the worlds you're on as it is to start shooting and killing bad guys. Character models, be they humans, Skaarj, mechanized marines, etc. are all first-rate, with highly detailed facial features and expressions.But the game play just isn't there- I finished the game in less than six hours total time. I got it on a Thursday and finished it that night. I felt let down- there wasn't enough to do, beyond accomplishing goals, the environment doesn't interact well- you can't even blow up trees, though you can kill all the fauna you come across. Here is a game that could have benefitted from Red Faction's Geo-Mod code- it could have made things more interesting. It was also reported that the Unreal Editor that shipped with the game was easier to use than previous versions. I loaded it up and wondered that if by 'easier' they meant 'harder and more complex'.So basically what we have is a spectacular looking game that delivers awesome visual splendor, but only mediocre game play. This was also one of the three games that I was really looking forward to in 2003, the others being Halo, and the sequel to the greatest game of all time, Homeworld 2. So far I'm zero for three. Unreal isn't a bad game, it's an okay game. It's that really good looking girl you knew in highschool- the one you found out was really shallow once you got to know her.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2003"}

This game has apparently cost Dennis Dyack his, you know, sanity and all --- so was his sacrifice worth it?Well, in terms of just gameplay, yeah. It's an easy-to-pick up and challenging as heck Diablo-style dungeon loot hack-and-slash affair. There is a wealth of customization options. The right stick offense works pretty well. There are the occasional issues with targeting, but that is the case with games with regular offensive controls, so it's not like it's a unique problem to this particular control set-up.You fight in four rather large areas with a collection of NPC allies that are beyond useless. Now, keep in mind, there are points where it's scripted for only you to make it, so even if you babysit then, they will die at a certain point. You don't get much time to rest as the game unleashes an absurd number of enemies to fight, so your hands will be forever full.Now, the story is crap. Idiotic crap, to boot. A weird attempted amalgamation of Norse mythology that just didn't click. The game plays as if this is a story you're already quite familiar with --- it'd be as if Star Wars STARTED with Empire Strikes Back. And while the worlds are large, they also have a very similar feel to them. No matter where you are, you end up in a large metallic dungeon.The enemies also, while numerous, are just the same thing. You have a few main types --- cannon fodder, the elemental enemies, the ones who can lob missiles at you, the leaders, and the trolls. And you'll fight THOUSANDS of these and the lack of any significant changes from one group to the next (undead enemies and goblin enemies don't look or act very differently) makes it all seem to be such a waste o' time. The bosses, while suitably massive, also tend to be BORING. Most bosses are killed by circle strafing with guns that don't seem to do any damage. 20 minute long fights are not rarities.Another problem is that there is so much loot than none of it seems special. You can get \"epic\" drops occasionally, but you get hundreds of drops every single level. It's hard to really get used to a weapon because you, inevitably, get a better one a few minutes later. And getting the best charms to enhance your weapons is pure luck --- I got to level 50 and never found a single one, in spite of getting everything I possibly could.The game is fun to play, but the problems are so glaring that is makes one actually wish they held it back a bit longer. I know the whole \"ten years in development\" thing, but the game just feels rushed. Changing engines a lot will do that, I suppose.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2010"}

It sad that Blizzard could create such a complex game which is ultimately dull.Im not going to be overly critical about the server being down. I give any online game a free pass to adjust servers the first week. I dont believe blizzard was \"lazy,\" theres just more factors to consider when you have such a large community of gamers. I'm not so forgiving with off-line games which are being released with an ever greater number of bugs....The good:The graphics are gorgeous. Their not as \"dark\" as diablo 2, but I think their up to par.Everyones teleported to a boss fightThe game is... well... perfectly executed. Very few bugs and awesome mechanics.The bigger invetory is also a welcome addition.Having extra pieces of equipent adds to my addiction.Your character constantly learns something new while leveling. This is rewarding and reinforcing.Tons and tons of skills to learn.Cooldowns are a nice addition but..... (read below)Lots of good loot.You can revive alliesThe game isnt as linear as several claimNo loot hogging, loot appears only on the individuals screenThe game is fairly long.Normal mode is challengingGreat boss battlesYou never know how bad a group of monsters will be. Some will totally annhilate if your not ready.The bad:The Blizzard creator of the monk said, \"We are creating a perfectly executed game. A perfectly executed game is better than a game with innovation but doesnt execute properly.\" If that was true, they might as well of made a Diablo 3 pong. I could pull out pong for the atari and play it without any errors, hours on end! But wait.... Innovation is just as important as execution.Next Ill touch on the DRM and the \"internet only\" gameplay. I do believe it is unfair. Theres a sick trend of gamers slowly losing their rights. Yes, this isnt the end of the world, but it does signify that were willing to give our rights away. Im fine with needing to verify a genuine copy of the game via internet. Heck, Ill verify it daily if I need to. But an internet connection required at all times? Hmm.... Well if blizzard pays for me to have a constant internet connection, sure! But that is just as likely as Diablo 4 being released before I need dentures.The fact that all characters of a class get the same skills limits the divirsity of characters. I like how in guild wars, titan quest, and several other games you choose 2 classes which gives you multiple combinations of characters. Or in diablo 2 I had to decide if I was creating the Jabazon / bowazan, etc. In Diablo 3, my monk skills will be identical to everyone elses. What the frack?Cooldowns are executed horribly. I dont need a cool down for a potion thank you. This limits the style of combat people can do. This is the same with skills, if I have the mana, spirit, etc, let me use the skill!Only four players online at once? Blah.You cant equip two skills form the same set, this further limits customizationI like how the entire game could be set to normal, nightmare, and hell in Diablo 2. In this game its can be done by chapters. This seems a bit strange and off-putish. It doesnt have the same intense feel.Im actually starting to miss scrolls of \"identify.\" The fact that most magic items are pre-identified or able to be identified with a simple click takes away the excitement... I miss the anticipation.Level cap is only 60... after that you play only for gear, not character developmentYou cant rejoin a bossfight if you die unless someone revives you, a bit of a painThe crafting systems.... Well.... not so funIn conclusion, Diablo 3 is a game that has a plethora of content with dozens of skills. The trade off is that it is overly simplified and there is little new. Nothing innovative, which is sad. Im ready for torchlight 2. In the meantime Diablo 3 is like an ugly child. Not what I want, but Ill love it all the same.....","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2012"}

This game does evoke some of the dark feeling that was present in both Burton and Nolan adaptations. Personally, I like Burton's vision much better and the game is not too far off. Gameplay wise though, the game is mediocre.Pros:Very nice moving storyInteresting choice of enemies (i.e., they chose some interesting characters from the comics and not just cliches)Great voice acting and dialogueGood use of flying and hovering using the cape - feels naturalImpressive scenes (and gameplay) involving ScarecrowCons:Annoying achievements questsQuite a few glitches both in sound and in graphics.. although not damaging for the experienceProblematic controls, unresponsive - you often get stuck in \"detective\" mode for example, which is... disorientating and irritatingRepetitive puzzles.

{"product_name":"B001E8VB6O","reviewerName":"T. Soatthiamroong","summary":"Almost Perfect","reviewText":"Pros:- Art direction, graphics, sounds and performances are top-notch.- Gameplay is great. Combat is fluid. Gadgets are fun to use. Controls are simple and effective. Camera does a decent job both in combat and exploration. The combination between action, stealth, and platforming are well-balanced.- Collectibles are rewarding. Normally, I don't care much about them. But collectibles in this game help fulfilling the story and also give you XPs needed for upgrades.- Challenge mode is a nice touch, especially when you can play as The Joker. You can use upgraded equipments and combos in this mode.Con:- No 'New Game+' feature means you have to start upgrading from zero if you want to play story mode again. The game doesn't give you a choice on that. If you want to fully upgrade Batman, you gotta get at least 80% of the collectibles.It's quite a big deal for me because having to explore the island and hunt down all collectibles every time I start a new game is kinda annoying. I just want to sadistically abuse as many enemies as possible right from the start, with my full potential. For a game of only 10-15 hour length, is that too much to ask?Even though the game lets you free roam the island after the ending to get all collectibles, but without any enemies left and upgrades don't carry over to the new game, what's the point?Note: This is not a pro or con. The game doesn't progress on a chapter basis, so there's no Chapter Select available either.In conclusion:The game is great, but its only flaw is also significant, so I deduct 1 star for the replay value issue.If you're okay with that, buy it, you'll love the game.  If you're not okay with that, rent it first.Anyway, I'm sure you'll like the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2009"}

That's all I have to say. Far Cry has raised the bar for everyone else now. Dramatically. The graphics are gorgeous. The environments massive, open and immersive. The AI is efficient and can be brutally cunning. The game is suspsenseful and thrilling. And add on top of that, the game is more than 25 hours long, but doesn't get boring. In fact, the last four or five missions of the game are some of the most thrilling not only in the game, but out of any first-person shooter on the market.This game is hard. VERY hard. Sometimes frustrating, and almost impossible. But never quite. It's challenging, but it's also very satisfying. The challenge adds an edge to the game that makes it extraordinarily exciting when you are crawling through the bushes, hoping to God that you shoot the last enemy before he shoots you, and praying that you find a health pack somewhere.The game is about 2/3 outdoor areas and about 1/3 indoor areas. The outdoor areas are by far, the strength of the game. They are so huge that it can take half an hour just to traverse across them.  The big huge areas give you a number of ways to approach your objective.  Lots of objectives have multiple paths for completing them.  They are lush jungles, full of beautiful and inviting rivers and lakes, trees, rocks, birds, and lots of vegetation. The rocks and vegetation provide you with the cover that you will need to stay alive.  Far Cry is as much of a stealth game as it is an action game. Enemies are too tough to face four or five at at time. You have to crawl slowly sometimes, sniping them from a distance, or ambushing them while they comb the jungle looking for you.The indoor areas look nice and have a creepy atomspheric feel to them, but they are frustrating to play through, and they feel like a ripoff of Half-Life. The monsters that you face are more annoying than anything, and some of them can kill you with one or two hits. The middle part of the game has lots of indoor, monster-filled areas and that is probably the weakness of the game.Far Cry rivals games like Halo and Splinter Cell when it comes to AI. The AI is not only great for stealth, but for action as well. This is very rare, since most games are only good at one or the other. They are efficient at using cover and searching for you when you are hiding. You can't just sit behind a rock a mile away and pick off guys by sniping them. They will actually hunt you down. Sometimes they will even send a helicopter up to hunt for you. When they find you, they will use cover and use grenades to flush you out.PC games have seen a few technological innovatios in the past year or so. Dynamic lighting and shadows, and realistic physics, to name a couple. Far Cry perfects these innovations, where other games have struggled. The physics engine is excellent, and so is the lighting. In one area, I watched in awe as a threw a grenade into the end of a crowded hallway, and watched as the explosion rocked the light. The light swung back and forth wildly, causing all of the shadows in the hallway to move in sync. Far Cry is loaded up with details like that. For instance, you can see the picture in the lens of your sniper rifle, even when you aren't zoomed in.The story for the game is sort of a disappointment. It's not really bad, but it would have been nice to have a better story to connect all of the nail-biting action.  This flaw sort of stands our more, since the rest of the game is so good.  The voice-acting isn't too good either, except for a couple of the friendly characters that help you. Otherwise, the sound for the game is excellent.Far Cry is such a pleasant surprise because it is not only full of technological innovations, but it backs them up with a really, really fun game. And then instead of ending after 8 hours, it manages to keep you hooked for 3 times longer.  So once the &quot;oooh&quot; and &quot;ahhh&quot; factor of the game wears off, your enjoyment of the game doesn't. If you can get over the near-impossible difficulty, then you would be committing a crime against yourself by not playing this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2004"}

I knew it is an older game so I didn't expect too much, but maybe my expectations are still too high for this game because I ended up uninstalling it after running through the 4th level. Here is why......switching weapon bug. After picking up a weapon I noticed that I can't can't switch it. I hold down the yellow button on the controller and press it and nothing happens. I sometimes reload the checkpoint and it is resolved. For a game this old this problem should have been resolved. I would pick up a sniper rifle because this is probably the best weapon in the game to have if you like to play like I do. Which is kill everything, but from a safe distance. And I wasn't able to use it. Not cool!...Ok so here is probably the most irritating thing in the game and the deal breaker for me. If anybody has ever played Halo 4 they will know what I am talking about. AI using suppressing fire type guns should not be able to casually aim and hit you over and over again from a distance of 400+ yards away. Also there really wasn't any stealthiness to the game other than the premade ways to do it by the developers. Once you come into any sort of area where the enemy is they automatically know where you are and will start shooting at you. Even through walls. As gamers we have moved past the days with having to deal with AI like this. I am not kidding. I would be croutching and walking really slow and BOOM! They would see me and me running to me to get me and alert the insane amount of enemies in the area I was trying to sneak through....There is an emphasis on being stealth in this game, but they don't give you moves or weapons to be stealthy with other than your stupid melee punch which doesn't work anyway because you can't get close enough to the enemy anyway because they will see you even if you sneak up from behind.So basically I learn really quick that if I wanted to play through this game I would need to put the difficulty on easy and just deal with the gun bug. After I got through Mission 4 with basically just gung hoeing and strafing through enemy areas I put this stupid game down. Far Cry 3 is obviously is way better than this game. I dunno if the pc version is any better. I'm hoping it's just a bad porting job done for Xbox. So if you have an Xbox and see this game. STEER CLEAR. If you have a PC.

Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"Leaves players in the dark","reviewText":"I purchased Alone in the Dark at the same time I bought Silent Hill: Homecoming.  I'm a sucker for survival horror, and both games came highly recommended.  The difference between the two is quite illuminating.There has been a trend recently to reverse the gamist influence of tabletop role-playing games on their video game counterparts.  Consoles don't lend themselves well to complex rules systems and designers find their beautifully rendered enemies disrupted by floating hit point numbers over their heads.  In response, Alone in the Dark goes full simulationist - forget the rules, this is all about horror!And so Alone in the Dark, like Silent Hill, starts out in media res. You learn to play as you go by ferociously clicking buttons to blink your eyes so you can see straight.  You play an amnesiac anti-hero with a secret connection to a certain stone held by a certain priest.  A bald villain, named Crowley (yet another mystical foe named after Aleister Crowley, the occultist), marches you to your doom until he is disrupted by something even scarier: extradimensional tears in the fabric of reality.Thing is, extradimensional tears aren't all that scary.  The entity that is in charge enjoys possessing hot chicks and growling in a deep voice, instantly rendering the villain rather mundane. Those looking for the Cthulhu Mythos-inspired connection that suffused the original Alone in the Dark will find the chatty archnemesis lacking.What Alone in the Dark does very well is completely conceal the rules from the player.  Our hero can only carry so many items in his jacket - no unlimited, unrealistic inventory here!  He can swing weapons or even light them on fire, and the fire mechanics allow him to do everything from blast explosive bottles out of the air to pouring flammable liquid on his bullets so they shoot fire.  Realistic, huh?There are no hit points, no health meters, and not much in the way of rules.  What Alone in the Dark lacks in gamist structure it makes up for in narrativist railroading, with a capital R.Alone in the Dark is hellbent on telling a story, and the developers just happen to drag the player along for the ride.  It even has a function to allow you to skip any scene, with a brief montage at the beginning of each replay to describe what happened \"previously, in Alone in the Dark...\" I played a car chase sequence fifty times before I gave up. I ran around with a flashlight trying to make some black goo not eat me (repeatedly watching the starting sequence of a sewer worker swearing effusively before being eaten) thirty times before I gave up. I teetered inside a precariously balanced bus on the edge of the cliff dozens of times before the game crashed.And so we have Alone in the Dark's problem - if you want to make a game all about story, it better be a good story.  Alone in the Dark provides absolutely no guidance as to what to do next.  You are guaranteed to die over and over until you figure it out, which renders any interesting cut scene or curious camera angle meaningless after the fifth time.  The game is a buggy mess too.  It crashes constantly; at one point, a villain just stood there and let me whack at him to no effect. Maybe he felt bad for me.Alone in the Dark tries hard, but like an action blockbuster, it has no interesting story to tell.  With stereotypical villains, enemies that aren't scary, frustrating camera angles, and a railroading plot that will have you tearing your hair out, Alone in the Dark will leave players alone in the dark.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2010"}

Not sure what I should do not as even the keys for my LAN game copies seem to have been registered by someone else. It's crazy!Anyway, as for the game, I found it to be most entertaining, or rather somewhat, but it lacked many features that would have made it a stellar classic. It doesn't have anywhere near the controls that were available in the previous Battlefield games, such as no prone mode. It also doesn't have a LAN mode or single map play mode, you have to either play the campaign or online. That will be fine for some, but I love to LAN, so that's a huge let-down for me. I have to say, it's more arcade than ever before, but I guess that's what was intended.I had this game given to me as a gift and I am sure I will find lots of fun in the single player campaign, but it just doesn't have the same old classic feel. Maybe it's the end of an era and we are now ushering in dumbed-down, spray-and-pray games that need countless play-time and add-ons to give the same feel as they did in the past.

Don't get me wrong you can take cover,just be carefull where you do it, that wall won't survive long.I like the fact you can go into an area in a vehicle or on foot.Do you flank left ,right,or shoot up the middle. It's all there for you to decide.The very beginning of the game is linear for the most part. Really its just a pseudo training level for you to get used to the new 'destructive' component. And boy is it ever satisfying to see the once formidable wall be blown to bits by a well place grenade launch from you. Very fun indeed.Climb up to an attic ,and you wanna go out the other side but can't ,well make a 'new' door through the wall with your gun mounted grenade launcher.  You have an endless supply of health in the form of a portable health booster in the form of an injection needle ,it momentarily recharges ,but its not long to recharge, I found myslef not worrying to much about taking damage as I can just get a shot from the health booster whenever needed. You'll respawn endlessly at well placed checkpoints ,much like multiplayer the single player respawns you close to the battle, you don't just restart a chapter like most single player campaigns.Being that I was in a bit of a drought , Battlefield is a nice refreshing change of pace.The graphics aren't fantastic , but what is fantastic is what happens when your destroy things in-game, they look good graphically and really provide a 'feeling' of being in a hot war zone,with ample amounts of destruction.Some of my gripes are that some of the buildings interiors are all very simular in each level ,and the controls have few options to configure to personal tastes. The enemy AI isn't to bright on the normal difficulty. I hope the harder setting is more of a challenge. Some of the weapons could have better 'scopes' on them ,and some aiming sights (LT) take up to much of the screen.Also another gripe I have in single player, is sometimes the battles are over too quick and your off to the next area. I wish the enemy AI would spawn more enemies ,as I find myself just getting started into a great fire-fight and suddenly it's over. Also the helicopter is insanely overpowerfull against 99% of enemy AI ,your almost invincible, but sometimes that's a good thing ,but I would prefer more of a challenge. Don't expect much realism in this game like RSV realistic difficulty, enemies in Battlefiled BC can takes tons of shots . This game is suited to the tastes of arcadey-like shooter fans.Online highlights: Most maps support 24 player, alsoThere's a new mode called 'Gold Rush' which involves the attack and defend mechanic , destroy the crates of gold or keep them intact. If the attackers win ,play moves onto the next stashes of gold ,until they're all gone or until the timer runs out.If the defenders win by holding their gold ,they win.'Gold Rush' is simple attack defend goal oriented that's simple and structured.While the buildings interiors are all very simular,actually on some levels they're carbon copies of eachother, but a good thing is on each level they do change ,from oil refineries ,to one of my favorites, a dictators golf course,you'll find yourself in a russian tank on a multi hole golf course,very nice touch,for a gag you can even ride in a golf-cart ,although it unwise at best,it's still funny to see four heavily armed men in a golf cart going into battle,if you so choose.The graphics will likely never 'wow' you ,but what should 'wow' you is the destructable environments, and as a whole package it does look good.Also riding in a tank mowing down trees like a giant lownmower somehow is sweetly satisfying.  Is it the best ,no, but it does offer a nice addition to the FPS ,genre.  There is some noticeable image tearing horizontally accross the screen.With somewhat of a shooter drought right now, Battlefield is just the right game to give me a shooter fix.

Morrowind and Neverwinter Nights far surpass Dungeon Siege II.Having said that, I highly recommend this game. It is extremely addictive and very fun. Aside from the story itself, I believe it's all the little details that make this game something special. For example:- No need for arrows (this does away with having to carry around stacks of arrows in your inventory, which is a trivial thing to have to do)- Auto health and mana regeneration (personally, this makes the experience more enjoyable because you don't have to worry so much about running back somewhere to get healed or constantly casting healing spells; characters also regain health upon death, unless they lose too much...this prevents the need for resurrection)- Auto-cast spells (you can set two spells to be automatically cast when necessary, such as healing or summon creature or buffing spells...you would constantly cast these spells anyway, so DS2 just does it for you)- No load times (not so important, but it definitely adds to the feel of a continuous gameplay experience)- Beautiful journal layout (quest entries, maps, books, quest items, etc. are all organized wonderfully in the journal)- Nice skill system (for specializing not only in one of four classes, but also in certain aspects of each class, such as fire magic for a mage, or dual-wielding for a fighter)- Health and mana potions use only as much as you need each time- You can sell back items for their real price (as opposed to buying something for 1000 gold and selling it when you don't need it for 50 gold!)Basically, my point is that this game was designed to take care of so many little details that other RPGs for some reason don't deal with. It makes the experience so much smoother and enjoyable. I have a lot of respect for the design that went into this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2005"}

A few reasons:-It plays very well. Think Forza 3 or Forza 4 with better graphics.  But that is the problem. It is an upgrade to those versions, but not by a ton in the graphics dept.  In all honesty, after playing it, we all thought, wow, that looks great, but then we went in the other room to play the 360 versions of Forza 3 or Forza 4 because they simply have more depth to them.  Once you are driving the cars, the graphics aren't enough of an upgrade where it makes a huge difference.-There is just too much content missing, or content you have to pay for. With the 360 versions of the game, you get a TON more cars and a LOT more tracks.  With Forza 5, you simply get a slight upgrade in graphics of the 360 versions, but with a lot less content,  And by a lot, I mean a LOT.Of course they want you to pay for extra cars and tracks.  If this game cost $29 at retail, I can understand charging for extra cars and tracks.  But not at full retail price.If you never played or owned any previous Forza games, this might be a good purchase. But if you own Forza 2, 3, or 4 for your 360, you will find this purchase a waste of money.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2014"}

And yet, discovery is around every corner, underneath every stone, behind every door, urging you onwards.  And of course, you're not alone.....but you'll learn that soon enough.The scan visor is pure genius:  reading the scattered documents speaks volumes, despite there being no voice acting at all.  You'll get chills reading discarded files of the evil Space Pirates' terrible experiments, and feel sadness at uncovering long-lost writings of the vanished Chozo race.  There are literally hundreds of items to scan - I mean, you can scan the GRASS, for goodness' sake.  In spite of this, there's no shortage of running, gunning action:  Metroid Prime is equal parts 30th-century Indiana Jones and Doom.The details make the game:  tilt your visor upwards on the Tallon Overworld and watch the rain splatter on it.  Tilt it downwards, and the rain runs off....and splashes off your energy cannon.  Run through lava-filled Magmoor Caverns and watch your visor fog up.  Detonate a bomb close-by, and Samus' eyes will reflect in the visor.  There's so much to see, you can spend hours just fooling around taking in the sights.Metroid Prime is a master creation that will be remembered for years to come.  It's technically brilliant on all fronts, constantly rewards, innovates and surprises, and is always coaxing you onward just...a little....longer.  Combat is perfect.  Control is perfect (once you get past what Halo and Quake may have taught you).  The map won't let you get lost.Nintendo and Retro have not only created the best game of 2002 in Metroid Prime, they've crafted one of the best ever.

{"product_name":"B00BGA9V2Q","reviewerName":"Alan Duquette","summary":"Very good with few flaws","reviewText":"I played it 5 times so I enjoyed it very much.  I reached level 60(3).  There were almost no flaws noted in any of the play or controls.this is what makes a game so playable.  Wish all games were so easy to like and learn and control.  Most have many issues with the controls being very confusing.  This one had some things like the pages where the abilities were applied being confusing as to what was happening.  Especially when using the arrows on the screen to scroll which changed the whole set up to the next slot or ability.  It could have been learn if I would have played with it but I got to the highest level I could without needing to use it too much thankfully.Also the &#34;automatic&#34; direction of the weapon aiming/striking could not be turned off, I think, as it kept swing or throwing in a different direction than I wanted it to  (At the less threatening enemy).There was one issue I had with corruption or something as all the aliens had the wrong voices.But this was a very fun game and was very good with Artificial Intelligence as the enemy would crowd around you as they would in real life.  Not sure but it also seemed the &#34;pawns&#34;  were actually protecting the bosses even by getting in the way of weapons.Aliens were very well  done and interesting both in sound and look.  Dynamics were very real looking when items were smashed etc.  Aliens would go over the edges of platforms realistically and often etc.  Stuff in background was almost interesting enough just to stand and watch what was going on all around you.  Allies getting swooped away by flying beasts, Giant monsters under the platforms, etc.  Maybe I have been playing the wrong games but this seems to far out do any of the games I've played in these respects.  Game was long enough and repayable enough too. (5 times for me)Wish I could wait 6 or more months to see if there will be more, but from all I can see now, there will be a extension only for the ps4 which makes no sense, to me, for a ps3 game.  The ps4 version is predicted for march but even that would be too long to hold the game for.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2014"}

Much of the game has been simplified, such as the emotions, which have gone from a menu to a single button.I have to say, I really like what they did with the magic and ranged attacks. I hardly used magic in the first two games. In Fable 3, I found myself using magic more than anything else. I was using a dual lightning/fire combo, which seemed to work amazingly well. The few monsters which survived hits from it were both stunned and knocked back, allowing me to cast another spell. It made the game rather easy, actually, but it was fun.My main gripe with this game is its promotion of homosexuality. In the Fable universe, about 25% of the NPC's are homosexual, as opposed to 3% in the real world. And, you get extra xp points for flirting with the same sex. The XP system, by the way, has been completely re-done, as if to simplify it to the 2nd grade level. No longer can you customize your character while leveling. Each character ends up being virtually the same. The only real choice is if you upgrade your melee/missile/spell damage first, second or third and what kind of magic you use.The real estate aspect of the game is a lot of fun, but I found the maintenence to be irritating. I would much rather have liked to put this on automatic, with say a 10% penalty on the rent.Another irritation was the constant change in the camera angle during combat. The game adds dramatic scenes to the combat, which abruptly force the camera angle to change, while you are still fighting in real time. It got me killed a few times and seriously injured dozens of times.Anyway, if you don't want your kids exposed to homosexual propaganda, skip this game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2011"}

Bakehorn","summary":"First DS Metroid game an unexpected gem","reviewText":"I've never really understood entrepreneurship and risk-taking. It's too, uh, risky for my tastes. Luckily, I'm not the one in charge of developing games for Nintendo, because once again they've completely blindsided me by taking one of their top franchises, Metroid, and mixed it with a completely random genre, pinball, creating a game that is simply one of the best of its kind. My first thought was, \"Who wants to play a Metroid pinball game?\" Well, I sure as hell wanted to once I tried the game out for the first time. After that, I was hooked. One pinball session turned into ten, minutes turned to hours, and as I learned the ropes...er, ramps of Metroid Prime Pinball, I've been made a fan.In the game you roll through seven of Metroid Prime's different environments to collect artifacts and eventually destroy bosses like Omega Pirate, Meta Ridley, and Metroid Prime. Of course, in typical Metroid style, you'll collect power-ups and backtrack through the different levels in order to progress. This makes the game quite challenging, but most pinball video games have a steep difficulty anyway.In order to collect these artifacts, you have to complete challenges that are almost always involved with destroying a certain number of enemies in a limited amount of time without sending your ball into the gutter. These challenges get pretty difficult but maintain a level of excitement as you try to kill off as many enemies as possible without losing a ball. Essentially that's what it always comes down to. I was surprised that my blood was pumping while playing a pinball video game, but it's that gripping and it's that exciting.I'm really impressed with the graphics and the sound that come from Metroid Prime Pinball. Nintendo almost perfectly captured the look and feel of the GameCube classic, from the wet-looking, rainy Tallon Overworld to the powdery, snowy Phendrana Drifts. Even the tiny enemy sprites look and act just like their slick GameCube counterparts. Of course, they make the exact same sound effects as well while the game's atmospheric music pounds in the background. Somehow a 2D pinball game captures the same feel as a super-detailed first-person shooter. It sure caught me off guard.I've mentioned it several times that I can't believe I enjoyed a pinball game so much, but it's really not all that surprising when you consider how well it captures the feeling of the source matter, Metroid Prime. Once you're finished with the final boss in the game's Multi Mission mode, there's the score-based Single Mission mode and a Wireless Multiplayer mode. That's all there is, so unfortunately there aren't many different modes of play. The Multi Mission mode is difficult but once you get the hang of the different levels, I'd say it only takes a few good sessions before you've completed the game. Still, this is the best pinball game you're going to play for a very long time. Even after one play-through, you'll want to play it over and over to get the highest score you possibly can. That's the charm of pinball, and Metroid Prime Pinball does it perfectly. Check it out if you're a Metroid fan, you might find yourself as addicted as I was.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2005"}

Not only does it add a lot in the multiplayer sphere, but it also gives single players something to do in the game. This was one of the things that bothered me the most in the first game - personally I do not like having to play games with other people because I started with the Atari and sharing my kills just doesn't feel good all the time. This doesn't mean I do not online play BUT I hate it all the time. Enter this selection of the game and everything it offers and - boom - you have something that makes almost everyone happy.One of the best things about the new game is simply the look, the number of enemies, and the selection and handling of all the weapons you use. If you thought the terrains were interesting in the first game as well, you'll love the new maps. Not only do you have to fight your way through different selections BUT you have a montage of different bosses and new zombie-types to kill your way through. Sure, there are the goodies that all came out but you also have clowns, different types of chargers, more dangerous boomers, and other stuff. You also have al types of weapons laying around to appeal to your killing pleasures. If you like long distance weapons, for example, you have a nice grenade launcher to set up with. If you like tactile weapons, you have a gun specifically suited for you, and, if you like rapid fire, you have weapons like the AK or the more Euro versions. You also have the wonders you carry, from some collected stuff that the spitters carry and that will attract zombies into fires or wherever you want them to bombs of all types.It's a zombie-killing dream.I also like the maps that a person has to work through because they have a lot to offer as well. They also make use of the different weapons you learn, and pay you back for putting in work when you know you need to practice range and firepower. I personally find myself trying to learn all of the weapons but do not like things like the AK, and I say that because they spit bullets but do not have any sort of accuracy. Honestly, I think you could do more damage with a grenade launcher than with this. As I said before, the maps make a lot of difference, too. When it comes to the specialized zombies, for example, they have to follow the features just like you and they suffer from it just like you. You also have pros and cons depending on the terrain, with different weapons working better or worse in these situations.The \"million zombie\" thing that is advertised - who knows. I do know that I have killed at least thirty thousand as one player and they are all beautifully rendered, and I have yet to tire of it. The game does have a few glitches in it and that should be worth mentioning, like where you walk into a wall or ceiling and cannot get out. Still, this happens only a little and does not take away from the freedom to enter closed doors in hotel rooms, to take when you want or need, or to gun down armies of the infected. And this is only touching on the one-player side because I know more on it that the other. I will leave the two-player + to others that are better schooled in it than I.All I know is, whether you like one or the other, this should settle well with you. A good buy for the zombie shooter in you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2009"}

Many players bought this game and are still playing today. However, I am not in the magical group of players and believe that this game gets old quick. This game is a routine game; once you realize you are doing the same thing over and over, again you will stop playing.Graphics- 5/10As you probably already know, the graphics for this game are horrible. I'm not saying they needed to great, but they could've been a little better. The game was originally made for the Nintendo 64, which actually explains it's poor graphics. You also are stuck in a top down view that really restricts what you can see most of the time. Looking for other characters is a task because the view is so annoying. There aren't many load times though, so you can move throughout the small world quickly. The ugly graphics can be forgiven, as they don't really affect the gameplay any.Story- 4/10There really is no story in this game. You have hopped on a train heading for a town. You have pretty much no money. Luckily for you, Tom Nook quickly offers you a tiny home to live in. He allows you to make payments on it. From that point on there is no story. You just visit with other critters in the world and talk to them. There is nothing going on to keep you interested in the game. All you do is pay Tom Nook money and buy things from his shop. You are truly free in this game, but I wish a little bit of a story were added.Sound- 4/10The game's sound is almost unbearable. The music is probably the only thing you can deal with on the game. Even then, it is usual an annoying tune that gets old quick. The characters talk in a weird language that is more annoying than the Sims. I suggest turning the animal language off in the beginning of the game. You will get so sick of hearing the way they talk.Gameplay- 6/10You need to collect cash to pay off Tom Nook. At first you will run a few errands for him that will act like more of a tutorial. After that you are on your own. You can furnish your home, run errands for people, and a few other things. Once you have paid off your house, you can upgrade it a few more times to get bigger and add extra floors. This is all fun for a couple weeks. Eventually you will realize that this is a routine game. You do the same thing every time you turn on the game. You check your mail, run errands, fish, sell everything, pay off Nook, save and quit. This gets really tedious once you get to the really expensive upgrades.You can have up to four people in a town though. If you have a couple other people to play with the game will become a lot better. If you have a town created on another memory card that is in slot two, you will be able to travel to that town and buy things from their shop. Trading fruit between towns can lead to a huge profit. You can even wreak havoc in another person's town by digging holes and leaving garbage lying around. It's up to you. Having a couple friends to play this with can really add to this game longevity.Difficulty- 5/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty)There is no skill required to play this game. The only hard part about this game is paying off Tom's insane fees. Other than that there are no hard parts. Finding items for the Museum may be difficult, but at the end of the day you only have to dig up whatever is there. If it isn't there then you wait until the next day. The game wasn't meant to be difficult though, so I will give it an average score in this section of scoring. The fact that the game is so easy helps if you want a bunch of friend's to play the game with you.Overall- 6/10I will admit that the game is pretty fun for the first few weeks. Once you hit point where you owe Tom around 700,000 bells (currency), you will realize that you are going to have to do the same tedious things over again to get enough money for it. You can probably play this game an hour or so a day and be done with it in a few weeks. I can only recommend purchasing this game if you have a couple friends that are willing to play this game with you. If not then just avoid this all together. It will get too tiresome too fast.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00HGLLRV2","description":"","reviewerName":"A Dying Breed","summary":"Decent but was hoping for better","reviewText":"I got hooked on Infamous ever since the PSN crash and the first game was offered for free. When I got my PS4, this was one one the games I got with it.First off, it's a great looking game but then that's what you come to expect with the next-gen PS console. The other PS4 game I got (Tomb Raider) definitely didn't disappoint in that department either. The controls are easy enough to get used to, even though they are different than the previous two. The storyline is a completely new one, with a few nods to the others but it stands on its own.Now, here's where I thought it was lackluster and and I'm wondering where all these 5 star &#34;amazing&#34; &#34;stellar&#34; and &#34;awesome&#34; reviews are coming from. How in the heck do you keep track of your health? The only thing you know is when you are close to dead or are are dead. It was much easier to recover or gain health before, just find a power line and voila! Now, you have to find a shard or some smoke to drain, which can be difficult in the midst of a fight. Or, find some cover, which if you're being surrounded by armed guards, particularly the ones with powers, can also be difficult. You don't seem to pose a real threat to the armed forces until your powers are highly upgraded, which will take quite awhile. You die way too easily. A few turret hits or a few armed guards surrounding you with gunfire is all it takes. Then when you die, you end up at the closest fast travel destination but if you already cleared that district, what's the point of being there? You have to then high tail it back to the district you're working on.Lastly, the game is very repetitive. Clear the main command center in a district, complete all the side missions, collect all the shards, do the showdown, onto the next district, then  wash, rinse, repeat. It gets really boring after awhile.Overall, there are definitely aspects to the game that are enjoyable but after the first 2, I expected to be blown away and this did far from that.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2014"}

However, in Visceral Games' newest title, Dante is not so much a poet but, instead, is a brutish thug who can slaughter the minions of Hell with few problems. In reality, Dante was a skinny, waifish little dude...but in the game, he is a huge brute. The game is God of War in everything but name, but is it fun?Dante was a Crusader here. His wife, Beatrice, made a deal with the Devil that he would be faithful during the Crusades ---- and she lost the bet. So, she is taken down to Hell and Dante has to battle through the Circles of Hell to free her soul from the grip of Satan. You have Virgil as your guide, providing you info on all of the Circles and the occasional relic to assist you in your quest. So, you must travel through the Circles of Hell, some of which seem to have little in common with the Sin they are claiming to demonstrate.Well, yeah. It actually is quite a bit of fun. And after having replayed the God of War collection before playing this, one realizes that the original game had a wealth of issues that have been addressed by titles ripping it off. The combat is easy to pick up and play, though while you can learn a ton of combos, you don't need them. Simple button-mashing will win your battles, and unless you play on the toughest difficulty, you will not find the battles terribly challenging.The game seems to revel in violence and nudity. You will see Beatrice's tits a lot. Almost comically frequently. For a chaste girl, she is naked A LOT. It seems a little odd. You get the occasional naked enemy, such as the boss who leaks out unbaptized babies (yes, you have to kill babies by the truckload in the name of God --- you figure it out) from her nipples and tosses them at you. Even the wife found it icky and she is rather unlikely to be offended by a game.The violence is not more over the top than GoW, which was exceptionally violent, but it is quite hard to miss how extremely violent the game is. Honestly, the enemies are a bit cookie-cutter. There is some variety, but it seems like you fight a lot of the same enemies over and over again. It seems to get a little bit old. It's a lot of fun to fight the fights, admittedly, but it does seem monotonous after a while.The game is not terribly long, but it is a fun enough ride when you play it. If you're an Achievement Whore, then it requires two playthroughs, so I guess it has replay value...sort of.If you like this game, I'd suggest waiting for God of War III or the price of this title to plummet, but otherwise, it's not a bad game. It's just not mind-blowing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2010"}

No towns or any real denizens to talk to means you're playing in a world that feels strangely empty with no life.NOTE: The Following Review is LongFinal Fantasy has always been something of a controversial series among fans.  The argument as to which Final Fantasy is the greatest will be a never-ending argument.  Final Fantasy XIII probably does one of the more radical departures from the series.  Some that many have gone to say that if it DIDN'T have the name Final Fantasy it would ultimately be a better game, given the legacy it has to live up to.  However, I tend to disagree.  Even if this weren't a Final Fantasy it would still be marred by the same problems.  It's not a bad game, it just asks a lot of the player's patience.Final Fantasy XIII begins in the middle of things, introducing us to two characters named Lightning and Sazh.  These two are on a train going off with civilians from Cocoon--a floating paradise above land (sort of)--to be purged.  That's not really why Lightning is there.  She wants to save her sister who has become a L'Cie, a race that bears a curse and is feared by the fal'Cie.  Things go much deeper than that, and in a nutshell Final Fantasy XIII doesn't have a bad premise, it's just that there's a lot of it.  Especially in the opening moments of the game.  As the game begins there is so much backstory to swallow that it's easy to be a little confused at the beginning.  However, there are certain things that detract from the story.  The voice acting isn't always so great and sometimes the dialog is really bad.What may not be so grand for Final Fantasy XIII is that it's a completely linear experience.  The JRPG in general (especially Final Fantasy) has ALWAYS been like this, but usually it is masked in the illusion that you can explore.  Usually by giving you a world map, towns etc.  But every Final Fantasy (save for the earliest entries in the series) have always been about telling you where to go and blocking off access to other areas until you get an airship or some vehicle (and even by then you've explored much of the world already).  Final Fantasy XIII strips away this illusion entirely, however.  There is no world map and no towns to explore.  For the first twenty hours or so you'll be pretty much running straight down a corridor.  There are a couple of branching paths every now and then but only to get some treasure chest before running right back to the path.  The issue here isn't actually that you're running straight down a corridor so much as it is that it makes the world Final Fantasy XIII takes place in rather stale.  It just doesn't come alive.  While it helps to keep the story front and center this approach just doesn't draw you into the world that Final Fantasy XIII takes place in.  All your shopping is basically done at save points.  And even when you find a place that might be considered a town, there are no denizens to speak of and are still those corridors you'll have to run down.The gameplay can be satisfying, but much like the rest of the game it requires patience.  The battle system goes back to some of the traditional Final Fantasy staples.  The ATB battle system here is a little different from the others in the sense that you can only control one character, and that you can stack up several attacks at once.  Your ATB gauge increases as time goes on.  At first only allowing for two or three different strings of attacks, and later allowing for up to six strings.  What makes it interesting is how you can stack.  You could say, stack three attacks followed by two castings of the Fire spell if you wanted.  It makes for some variety.  Some of the battles are fast paced as a result.  You can have the system choose to string attacks automatically for you if you wish.  You'll only be able to control one combatant, though and the rest of the time the game is controlling the other two.  Generally speaking, the other characters can handle themselves just fine.  The problem stems mostly from the fact that if the main character falls it's game over.  Your allies are not going to use items or anything to revive you.  The approach makes battling feel limited.But that's not the only reason battling can, and often does, feel limited.  Like the exploration it's several hours before the entire true nature of the battle system comes out.  And it's a shame because quite a few mechanics of Final Fantasy XIII's battle system aren't so bad.  In particular the paradigm system adds a new layer of strategy.  When you first begin the game all you can do is attack and use items.  But when the paradigm system is introduced you can set characters to different jobs to have them perform different tasks.  Ravagers can cast lots of different spells and use elemental strikes, Sentinels can take a lot of damage an serve as body guards.  Saboteurs can cast all kinds of debuffs while Synergists can cast tons of buffs.  Medics are healers and Commandos are your basic attackers.  The paradigm shift allows you to change everyone's job on the fly depending on how you set them up.  And each \"Paradigm Shift\" entails a different strategy.  For example, sending in two Ravagers and a Commando creates the paradigm shift \"Relentless assault\" which works for offensive attacks.  Two commandos and a medic makes the shift \"Tireless Charge\" which has two characters constantly attacking while one heals.  There are a lot of different combinations, but Final Fantasy XIII is going to make sure you understand this system.  Because if you don't the game is more than willing to punish you.  It's hard only if you find yourself at a loss of what paradigm to use against certain enemies.You can also develop these different classes for each character further.  As you battle you gain Crystal Points to be used in the Crystarium.  Using your CP you can increase a characters stats and learn new abilities.  It's similar to Final Fantasy X's sphere grid system in that regard.Another interesting concept of the battle system is the \"stagger.\"  As you attack enemies a gauge beneath them begins to fill up.  When it does they'll stagger opening themselves up to more damage.  There's a surprisingly large amount of strategy needed for Final Fantasy XIII.  It's just a shame that much like the rest of the game, it takes a while to open up.  Not all the different changes are available at the get go, which is to be expected, but you'll be a good ten hours or so into the game before the entire battle system is entirely opened up to you.You'll be a good 20 or 30 hours into the game (depending on your mileage) before you can even attempt a great deal of sidequests the game offers.  So Final Fantasy XIII does get bigger... it's just that you'll find yourself at the footsteps of the endgame before you finally feel as though the game has come into it's own.  Sure after you complete the game you can do a ton of side quests in the post game (and Final Fantasy XIII is filled with quite a few), but that means that you'll slog through 40 or so hours before you actually can.  If you have the patience for all of that you'll be fine, but there are bound to be a lot of gamers that don't like this steady approach of slowly piling things on. Most RPGs flesh out their systems or at least put the basics of it on the table long before the halfway point, but Final Fantasy XIII isn't that kind of game.  It can make longtime fans feel like it's holding your hand or babying you into some of its more complex systems.  But more importantly it just doesn't balance the game out.On the other hand Final Fantasy XIII can be fun to play.  Battling is often fun even if it takes forever for all the mechanics to be at the disposal of the player.  The game also has some nice production values.  It's a good looking game with a great presentation.  The music also isn't so bad with some of the tunes standing out quite fondly.  It's not all bad, it just feels unbalanced in how it presents much of this.Final Fantasy XIII isn't a bad game.  It just asks its audience to be extremely patient with it.  And you're going to have to exercise it as you watch the story unfold.  Battling is often fun, especially as more of the battle system becomes available, but getting there can feel like a test in tedium until that point.  The game is plentiful in sidequests but you'll have to wait a long time to get to that too.  Final Fantasy XIII isn't just missing staples that make it a great Final Fantasy game... but also just a great RPG.  While it's great to be able to just buy your equipment at every save point, Final Fantasy XIII's world feels pretty empty when you take out all the towns and denizens.  The stripping away of the illusion of freedom is a big hit.  As I said, most every RPG is big on telling you where to go and finding creative ways (or lazy, depending on how you look at it) to keep from getting too far ahead in the story.  But Final Fantasy XIII takes that to an extreme.  It's easy to feel bored for the first half of Final Fantasy XIII.  When you get to the point that the game allows you to explore and it opens up it becomes really fun.  But it shouldn't have to take that long to get to that.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"Steve","summary":"Review - Final Fantasy 13","reviewText":"I know alot of people are down on this game for whatever reasons they may be, but in my opinion I truthfully really enjoy playing this game.  I find this game quite fun to play and truthfully I find it absolutely addictive.I think one of the biggest issues with this game is how linear this game is in comparison to many of it predecessors.  And in this they are not incorrect at all.  However I will remind people that Final Fantasy X was quite linear itself until you get more than half way through, much like this one is.  I definately agree that the linear nature of this game definately did take away from what it could have been but in my opinion this aspect did not really ruin the game for me, that is my opinion of the matter.As to storyline, I think the storyline was actually quite good.  I think it develops nicely and that it has the perfect combination of layer including a love story, war, a family story and a darker more mysterious back-stories.  Additionally, this game had one of the most awesome opening sequences of any game that I have played to date.  Some of the cutscenes are boring and sappy, and could definately use some more figting but others are fast paced awesome and intense.The grapics and the game play in this game are great.  The graphics are crisp, clear and brilliant.  I like that monsters can be avoided much as they can be in FF12 but I do not like that they do not respawn, easily so you cant really farm them.  The leveling scheme is similiar to FF10 and does not actually include leveling but instead you spending points to upgrade your characters power, abilities ect.  I do like the inclusion of different classes of fighters (commando, ravager ect) though I did not like that you could not use your other abilities as another class.The battle sections are brilliantly done, however I do not like that they can be automated, ultimatly making the game a little too easy at times and making the computer play for itself.  I wish that the game gave you the option to choose your teams powers, as they ten to use powers you dont want them too at times (for instance if you have Fira and Fire, why in god's name are your computer controlled team using the weaker of the two!!).  While at times it can be quite easy, the game forces you to think strategically which powers you want to use and how you want your team set up md-battle.Lastly I think that the characters are absolutly awesome, with the exception of Hope who while being one of the best spell casters in the game is an annoying whiney baby.  I absolutly hate Hope's character with a passion, I think I hate hope as much as I hate Titus from FF10 for his stupidity and clulessness.  The two main characters Snow and Lightening are some of the best characters developed in the series in my opinion and they are both awesome, Sazh is also a great comic addition to the group, though in my opinion he is one of the weakest in your team.As the story arc progresses you control different characters at different times.  So for instance in the first 6 chapters the storylines switch between those of Snow, Lightning/Hope, Sazh/Vanilla, Hope/Vanilla or a combination of 3 of the mentioned.  As the story changes you go through different segments where you are forced to control a different combination of each character.  I think this is a great addition as it forces you to get aquainted with all of the team and it gets you used to all of their strengths and weaknesses.While the game does lack in several areas, the experience is very rich, in depth and is addictive.  I love this game and am quite addicted to it, but I do wish that they wouold have tweaked some aspects to make it even more fun.  Ultimtaley the game is a great game, that is missing the pieces that could have made it into an epic game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2012"}

Reminiscent of Bioshock","reviewText":"There are many lengthy reviews here so I will keep it short and sweet.PROS:This game can really suck you into it's world.  How you handle each situation really does effect your ending.  The stealth in this game was hard for me. I did a perfect stealth run through just one mission and it took me about 3 hours.  Maybe i happened to pick a long hard mission to do stealth, but regardless I didn't want to try it again.  It was fun, but i wanted the game to move along faster so i continued to play it aggressively.  But you can do a perfect stealth run through all the missions and you will get different out come and you will probably upgrade and use different powers.  So there is great re playability here.The secret to this game is saving a lot so you can go back and redo things if it doesn't play out like how you wanted.CONS:I can't think of any real negatives other than that it can feel like the game wants you to play it as stealth rather than aggressively.  It feels more satisfying and more along the lines that the creators intended in some areas.  But if you want to be agressive and kill, well you will be made to feel like as a-hole for it.  I guess that makes it more realistic, but for ppl like me that want to get through areas without so much hiding, it's not fun to have ppl treating you like a jerk for playing the game the way you desire.  But that is still not something that ruins the game.Overall i got a Bioshock feel with this game and I loved Bioshock 1 & 2.  This game is worth picking up really at any price.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2013"}

Nasty difficulty spikes (the eight or so level should be closer to the end) and the 'one path to the end of a platformer' standard which Super Mario World truely broke when it came out take the one star out of this otherwise superb game.While the graphics are fantastic for PS1, and moderate at worst for PS2, sometimes I find it hard to tell where, exactly, Crash is going to land.  Also this very much 3D platformer has 'side scrolling' sections where I become convinced that pressing down will make crash duck, not fall into a bottomless pit, water, or whatever else is in the foreground.  Saving can sometimes prove difficult, although, if you look in the right places, you can find a way to save after every significant area.  Also, often after completing certain difficult areas, you'll be able to do them again at any point you desire, good for getting the games bonuses.I haven't finished the game yet (I'm only half way through), so anything in this review could change, although it's unlikely.  Most Naughty Dog games are consistantly good or bad in every way.Anyway, the bonuses are usually earned by getting through a level opening EVERY box in the level without losing a single life.  Others are given through bonus levels, etc.A very great game for a great price.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2004"}
{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Alex \"47\"","summary":"The PSP... Ahhh.","reviewText":"When the PSP was announced, I was super excited; but I didn't know if i should get the DS or PSP. I got the DS because it came out first and in some ways I regret doing so; but anyways, I eventually got the PSP. This thing is great for so many ways I can't name them all, but i'll try.The Possibilities: Endless. You can put a whole lot of stuff on your PSP depending on which size memory card you have. ( the $50 or so 1 GB should be okay. ) You can put a huge load of music on it, you can get movies from the internet ( illegal though, obviously. ) and just put anything you want on it basically; you can even go on the internet on it.  (even though it is kinda hard to get used to.)The Games: Great. There are quite a few games out right now that are really good. Starwars Battlefront 2, Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, SOCOM: Fireteam Bravo, Tony Hawk Underground 2: Remix, and more. Much better games than the DS has.Overall Graphics: Fantastic. For a handheld, this is more than you'd expect. Fully 3D characters straight from Playstation or Playstation 2 style graphics.Overall Sound: Not too shabby. The sound when you are listening to music isn't extremely clear, but it's still convenient and works nicely. The game sound is very clear and games that went from consol to this, ( Battlefront, GTA ) Have just as good sound.Overall Control: Hard to get used to. The controls arent too easy most of the time because there is only one analog stick. Games like SW:BF2 still work well though if you play enough. it took me around an hour or maybe two to get used to the controls for that game; which is a shooter so I'm sure most shooters would be similar.Overall Fun: Straight up fun. Music, DVDs, Games, Surf the net, anything you can do it home on multiple different things is now on one tiny little handheld. Although you will find your battery running low quickly from your huge use from this thing, it's pretty much its only downfall. My suggestion:BUY IT!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2005"}
{"product_name":"B0029ZBZ0I","reviewerName":"Tobie \"broadbandfreak\"","summary":"Starts off with a strong kick, and then loses the wow factor near the end","reviewText":"Thus far, I have played the game 1 1/2 times. The first time was fun; the other 1/2, which is the replay value, not so much. The first time through, the game starts off strong. It introduces the characters, the enemies, and slowly introduces the antagonists as the story progresses. Around Chapter 6, the game starts to hit a hump; it's boring, and the progression is slow. It tries to pick up the pace a little bit later, but it just starts to lose that wow factor. There were times where I had to walk away from the screen because of the redundancy. The mechanics of the game are relatively similar to the ones used in Resident Evil 4, along with the traditional usage of inventory, minus the typewriters and storage boxes. It also incorporates the usage of a partner throughout the entire game, whereas the previous Resident Evil games only used this strategy in certain parts of the games. The graphics are perfectly beautiful, besides Crysis and Dead Space, Resident Evil 5 definitely pushed my Geforce 8800 GTS video card to its potential. The porting of the game from console to PC seems flawless; the game never once crashed or misbehaved. The one issue that often times haunts this game (as well as its predecessors) are the camera angles. I'm not sure what Capcom is thinking half the time, but the camera is placed in the most awkward spots, and there is no way to get around it, other than to keep moving. Some of the mini bosses are a little frustrating because if you make one bad move, it's almost guaranteed to be an instant death, which causes you to practically start the zone over from the beginning. The replay value of allowing you to keep your weapon upgrades, along with a whole new wardrobe can be rewarding somewhat, but it isn't quite enough to get past the humps of boring redundancy, and you're just begging for it to pick up again. I hope Capcom is done with the Resident Evil series; you can only kill zombies (and zombie-like mobs) for so long. The game ending to me seemed rather abrupt, like they didn't know how to end it, but they did it anyway. I would recommend this game to people who are die hard fans of the series, as it is hopefully the indicator of the ending of the series.I rated it 4/5 stars on the assumption of the initial one-time run through; in spite of the boring repetitiveness, the mechanics, diluted storyline, sounds, and visuals were enough to convince me to give it a 4 star rating.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2010"}

Sega Rally was one of my favorite games on the Sega Saturn (Sega Rally 2 for DC was horrible...the control was so broken!).  NEVER has a video game for any console or PC conveyed a sense of environment as well as Rallisport Challenge does.  The graphics are PHENOMENAL...everything from the clean, jaggy-free car models, grass, rocks and roads...it all looks so lifelike and solid!  And the lighting...when the track indicates &quot;early morning&quot;, &quot;Rainy afternoon&quot;, or &quot;evening&quot; as it's conditions, believe me, the tracks and the way they are lit are completely convincing.  You'll drive through some of these tracks (the most impressive are by far the Mediterranean, icy racing and hill climbing tracks) and you'll swear that you've actually driven through locales like this at some point in your life!  And yes, on the hill climbing sections you CAN tumble off the side of the mountain which to my knowledge has never been done in a rally racing console game! Another bonus, check out the cool reflective mapping on the cars!How's the gameplay?  In one word: PERFECT!  The game is challenging, but never to the point of controller-throwing frustration.  You'll find that part of the game's appeal is to find out exactly which car is suitable for the circuit you are going to attempt.  Here's a bonus tip....if you want to relive the glory days of Sega Rally 1 on your Sega Saturn, the Nissan Skyline and Lancia Delta control almost exactly like the default Lancia and Celica in SR1!  You'll find yourself practicing to get the art of powersliding down...it's not easy and the trick eventually comes down to using the handbrake in tandem with the normal brakes on the sharpest curves.  Believe me, once you finally have it down, being able to powerslide through the sharp turns in succession is one of the most skillfully satisfying abilities you can have as a gamer!The career mode is where you'll find yourself the most.  This consists of racing a small circuit of races--normally about 3 - 10.  The object is to come in first in the points total so that you can amass the most points in the career totals to unlock new courses and cars.  Great fun and you'll find yourself replaying many of the circuits with the new cars you unlocked to see how much better you can do!  There's plenty to do and see and the races actually require some skill unlike the plethora of NASCAR games on the market.The only downside is the soundtrack...just some generic techno that doesn't really do anything for me.Is Rallisport Challenge the best racing game on the XBOX?  I think so...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2002"}

Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct.

It is an amazing first person shooter and has everything you could want in a game and plenty more.  A long and fun single player campaign and a HUGE multiplayer experience for those gamers with xbox live (or split screen, LAN, etc).  The graphics of this game are amazing and really showed the true power of the Xbox.  From lighting, to the textures, everything is great to look at.  The single player campaign is definitely a fun experience and is well worth playing over and over again.  The ending is a bit, blah, but other than that it was awesome.  There are a lot of changes from the original Halo and in my opinion they are all for the better.  There are many new weapons and the ability to dual wield two smaller weapons, making for some great gameplay.  Overall, the single player game is enough to buy this game alone, but for those people looking for a great xbox live game, this is certainly the one to buy.The multiplayer experience of this game is awesome in every way.  CHEATERS obviously get in the way of having a perfectly fun experience, but aside from that its great.  Plus, lately I've come across less and less cheating over xbox live.  There is a unique ranking system, which ranks players from 1-50, 1 being the lowest and 50 the highest.  It's pretty much impossible to become a level 50 without cheating and I highly doubt it has been done before.  All of your wins and losses come into play here and your ranks are setup across different \"matchmaking playlists.\"  Some of the more popular examples are team slayer, team hardcore, and rumble slayer.  These playlists get updated regularly to please the gamers worldwide.  I must commend the Bungie team for doing such a good job with this.  They are even starting to ban more and more cheaters daily, something that is also great!  Overall, playing this game over xbox live can and will become an addiction (that is if you like the game).  Some people feel it's to \"run and gun\" to them, but in my opinion it is pure fun and excitement.  It definitely has \"pick up and play\" qualities, which makes it great for people who just want to do exactly that, pick up and play.  There is obviously some skill involved with this game, but because of the ranking system, players should be matched with others of there same skill level, another good thing.  A definite buy for all xbox and 360 owners looking for a great gaming experience.  Even though the game came out in 2004, it still lives up to standards and it still one of the most (usually most) played game over xbox live.  Now all we have to do is wait for Halo 3 and a new addiction will emerge! ?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct.

This game is good. This game is very good. Is it something that's going to force me into changing religions, asking my fiancee to paint herself Cortana purple, or naming my firstborn children \"Master\" and \"Chief\"? Uh, no. And because it's not the life-shaping experience a lot of people were looking for, it's naturally going to be called a slight disappointment. Which is a shame, because... like I said, this is an outstanding game.If you didn't like the way the first Halo played, you won't like the direction the sequel's gone, either. It's a natural progression from its predecessor, familiar enough to enable returning players to launch themselves right into the melee without missing more than a beat or two, but giving enough to appeal to gamers who didn't get a chance to try out the original. Throughout the first level, instructions and button assignments flash onto the screen from time to time if it looks like you're lost or out of sorts, and you're almost immediately given a chance to test out the new \"dual wielding\" weapon configuration, one of the game's biggest selling points. The longer you play, the more you'll start to understand which firearm combinations produce the best results and which are all but useless.Unlike the original, where most of your adventures were one-man assaults against insurmountable odds, a good portion of Halo 2's action takes place alongside friendly troops who surprised me by actually serving a purpose beyond \"human shield.\" These guys honestly know how to fight with the enemy and steer the game's various vehicles without abandoning you in a firefight, and while they still aren't quite on the same level as the Master Chief, it's nice to have a little intelligence by your side all the same. They'll tug at your conscience, screaming for help when they realize they're alone and outnumbered, boost your morale by immediately recognizing you and treating you as a celebrity, and lighten the mood by telling an off-color joke or two.One thing that especially caught me off-guard with this release was the story of the single-player \"campaign\" mode, and the great strides it had taken from its forefather. I remember reading somewhere during the game's development that Bungie was taking every measure possible to ensure that this \"top secret\" story wouldn't be leaked to the public... and truthfully I scoffed, recalling the passable at best storytelling of the original. I liked a lot of things about the first part of this story, (I thought the Halo ring itself was an outstanding idea, as was the revelation that it was, in actuality, an enormous weapon) but a vast majority of it was fightin' for fightin's sake with no real motivations tossed your way beyond \"Hey, those freaky alien guys are shooting at you. Go get 'em.\" In the sequel, not only has the storytelling been vastly improved, but the backstory has been fleshed out beyond anything I ever could've expected. While the first Halo embraced a sort of black or white, us vs. them theme of good and evil, the second moves dramatically into a world populated with shades of grey, of uncertainty and of realism.The subjects that this game covers from start to finish are staggering; the frequency of political corruption, the basis and fallibility of religion, the necessity and motivations of war, the existence of sentient life elsewhere in the universe... it seems like the writers were almost inviting a lot of heavy-handed, boring, long-winded monologues, but really the story's pace is quite manageable and no event seems out of place or forced. The characters deal with the situations as they present themselves, adjust their position as new facts come to light and begin to question their own motivations and beliefs when something staggeringly important goes down. Basically, Halo 2 is on par with a really, really good action / adventure / sci-fi movie. The big explosions and fight scenes happen at just the right moments, the weighty conversations don't take the player out of the story, and the cutscenes only serve to motivate you in the hours of gameplay that immediately follow. To overuse a cliched phrase, Halo 2's story blew me away. My only major complaint was the brutal cliffhanger the game chose to end on, which leaves players without the slightest sense of accomplishment and feeling a bit ripped off. It was so strangely placed, caught me so off guard that I was still clutching my controller, waiting for the cutscene to end and the action to resume, when the credits began to roll.The visual aspect of this game is a great triumph for the most part, really emphasizing the Xbox's strengths as a graphical powerhouse and delivering a product that would be technically impossible on the PS2. The creatively dynamic lighting isn't quite as impressive as it was in Splinter Cell, but the way that lighting affects the various textures in and around the field of battle more than make up for it. The Master Chief, all of his comrades, Cortana, the commanders, they all look worlds better than in the first Halo, even in its visually-tightened PC incarnation, and the dramatic improvements that have been made in the environments, objects and surrounding textures raise the bar even further. Warthogs and Ghosts are no longer impervious to gunfire, and slowly begin to show the signs of continued use before bursting into flames or sparks of electricity.My sole qualm with the graphics department is the decision that was made to live-render every single cutscene, from start to finish. I understand the motivations behind this decision, to deliver the knockout blow that would settle any questions about the Box's visual superiority once and for all, but the end result is more like a weak jab to the solar plexus. The Xbox has notable difficulty with these scenes at times, especially at their very beginnings, as textures will drop out entirely for a few moments before blinking back on again.I never had a problem with the audio in the first title, and actually considered it to be among the best at the time of its release, but the sequel managed to find areas for improvement even in that department. While Dolby Digital surround sound was available in the original, it pales in comparison to the completely immersive audio experience of its sequel. You can still hear which direction a rocket's coming from with your back turned, for all the good it'll do, but you can also pinpoint the location of a sniper based on the noise his scope makes and the crunches of his feet against the rocky terrain. The voice acting has been taken to the next level, even including a few celebrity guest-appearances, and the influx of talent seems to have inspired everyone from the culture-manipulating prophets to the meaningless grunts who seem to serve no purpose beyond dying a grisly death. I've really only experienced one game with voice acting that even came close to what you get with Halo 2... and that was in my favorite title of all time, the original Metal Gear Solid. And, keeping that comparison in mind, the symphonic score of the new Halo wipes the floor with that of MGS. The composition, effectively pairing a full orchestra with a hard rock / metal lead guitar, seems awkward in print but is a baffling success in context. It retains the credibility and drama of an epic war drama, while also introducing the futuristic, almost mechanical setting of the game itself, not to mention its target market. I've never even contemplated purchasing the full score to a video game in CD format, but Halo 2 changed my way of thinking.And, finally, there's the multiplayer mode(s), the real deal-breaker for many players, myself included. If it's any indication as to the game's addictive online quality, I haven't had a chance to finish a review in months thanks to the amount of time I've spent playing this thing over the internet. Easily one of the greatest strengths of the first game was its unbelievable multiplayer modes, and their uncanny ability to bring people together for hours and hours at a time, huddled around the same TV with the common goal of unloading on one another. Surprisingly, the sense of community that made the original so special has been effectively transferred to the online mode of its sequel, thanks to the use of Xbox Live's headsets, an easy, effective clan-building utility, an unheralded level-based matchmaking system and the understatedly simple means of inviting friends to join you in-game.In my review of the original Halo, I claimed it was \"worth buying an Xbox over,\" and it remains to this day one of the two highest-rated games I've ever scored... it, along with Goldeneye on the N64, scored a near-perfect 9.8. If the first was worth buying an Xbox all by its lonesome, its successor is worth buying both an Xbox and a subscription to Xbox Live over. It's improved upon nearly every single area I had issues with in the original, it's taken the existing storyline and expanded upon it to undeniable success and it's delivered one of the deepest, most life-altering online multiplayer modes I've ever seen. Halo 2 is the sequel all games should strive to deliver, retaining the best aspects of its predecessor while giving fans a whole new set of possibilities to master in the wait for the next chapter. The only things holding this back from a perfect score are the abrupt ending and a few rough patches in the graphical terrain. As is, this is still the best game I've reviewed to date. If you own an Xbox and haven't picked it up yet, you must be punishing yourself for something.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2005"}

It became an obsession for me. There has always been something about Kingdom Hearts that truely invests you in the character of Sora and those he crosses paths with. With the end of the first game, all I could think about was, what was going to happen. I must have played through the ending at least ten times, and watched the secret \"Deep Dive\" scene many more times.Now that Kingdom Hearts 2 is finally here, and after playing all the way through it in a week, the game lives up to nearly every expectation I had and then some. If the first game can change you life, then playing though the second(and actually paying attention to the bigger story, which there is a lot more of in KHII than KHI) will touch you in a way akin to a religious experience.We may never know just what it is about Kingdom Hearts (and especially its sequel) that so powerfully pulls a person in and makes them truely, deeply care about the story and its characters.Well, I could go on and on and on about how amazing Kingdom Hearts 2 is, but I will resist and give you a point by point breakdown.Gameplay 9/10 - Vastly improved. Maybe its just because Sora has grown up a bit and isn't tripping over his own feet anymore, but his movement is infinately smoother. The reaction commands add a new dimesion to battles, and are often a big part of the sometimes-cinematic boss battles.The mechanics of the game have improved too. This is seriously evident in the fight with Cerberus. The beast moves the way he should, instead of like a drunk elephant the way he did in the first game. Nothing EVER clips (solid objects or characters passing through one another), and I guess we have to chalk that up to all the years of playstation development experience that simply didn't exist when the first game was made. That experience really shows in the polish of the game.Graphics - 9/10 While not as spectacular as some games, every visual in Kingdom Hearts 2 is a true work of art. The graphics have been improved slightly over Kingdom Hearts one, which at the time, if you'll remember, was one of the best looking games in existance.Framerates stay solid in any situation, through cinematic crossfades and other effects, to fighting thousands (yes, literally thousands) of heartless at once.Music - 10/10 While alot of the music in Kingdom Hearts was really good (with the exeption of a number of disney worlds*cough* Wonderland *cough*), Kingdom Heats 2 blows the original away in this category. There was not one note played during the game that I found annoying or didn't like.From the haunting and truely beautiful intro theme, \"Sanctuary\" to the epic musics of battle to the soft background, to the numerous disney themes. All are composed so well, they will never get on your nerves nomatter how long you have to listen to them.Story/Cinematography/Acting - 10/10 With writting, direction and acting far above what is found in most video games, along with movie-quality cinematography creates an experience as compelling as an actual movie. Moreso even. The voice-cast alone is amazing, with almost every character voiced by their original actor(\"Ansem\" being the only notable exception).Difficultiy - While alot of people claim this game is too easy, maybe its better that way. It makes it easier for more people to experience the story, which is the real point of Kingdom Hearts. If you want harder gameplay, pick the \"proud\" setting, and don't equip any of Donald or Goofy's abilities, and don't do any extracurricular leveling up. \"Forgetting\" to equip Sora with good equipment helps there too.Conclusion - There is nothing more to debate. Buy this game. Its that simple. Buy it. There is no reason not to.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2006"}

That new developer Ruffian Games, taking over for Realtime Worlds, has left the original largely intact and added a couple of different elements and the notion of \"it ain't broke so don't fix it\" is not only the thought here, it's practically the mission statement. Well I'm going to preface with one thing: I've never played the original Crackdown. Having not owned an Xbox 360 since late 2008 with Crackdown being frustratingly unavailable in our town, the game never seemed within my reach so the nearer the sequel got, I figured \"eh, I'll save my experience for that game instead\" so what you're getting is a viewpoint on the game strictly based on the game's merits and troubles and not me constantly going \"oh it's worse than before\" or \"this is still the same\". So with that being said, how is Crackdown 2? Well I admit the hunt for orbs is a seductive mistress indeed but the gameplay is fun yet there's so much about it that seriously needs a tweak or 2.Story: &lt;snore....> oh, yeah, the story, I'm supposed to say something here right? Um, well you're an Agent part of the Agency, an organization specializing in training soldiers with enhancements to keep the peace in Pacific City. But mutated beings called \"Freaks\" (nice) are coming out at night to mess around with the townsfolk and cause havoc and it's up to you with optional 4 player co-op to set things right, and collect some delicious orbs while you're at it.Graphics: When the demo was first released and having played it, I personally thought the game just looked too dim and the lighting and detail just seemed incredibly small but in the full game I brought the brightness up which did make it look better but this isn't a \"holy crap!\"-inducing game as some screen tearing, somewhat lack of detail and in frequent cases, some pervasive slowdown didn't help things. But the draw distance is really impressive and the fact I barely ran into a load screen is quite cool as well.Sound/Music: If there's one thing I can say about the aural parts of the game is that the word \"serviceable\". The main form of voice acting comes from the narrator talking about your progress and my god can he be annoying. From telling you about things he already mentioned to berating you about killing your own men even though it was their own fault and even him mentioning how awesome achievements are (as in Xbox kind) makes me glad I can switch him off. Music is barely there and in a couple of cases it pops up and it kind of sounds cool but it's so intermittent and so scattered when you actually get a chance to hear it that you just kind of forget it cause you don't hear it that often. On the other hand, I love that radar-esque \"ping\" when you collect an orb.Gameplay: Honestly, this game should've just been Orb Collector: the Game as that is arguably the best part of it. There is that kind of addicting quality that builds to it as collecting agility orbs allows you to jump higher, further and run faster with every level gained and I finally see why people loved this part in Crackdown 1. It's like \"oh yeah, I got stuff to do? Oh well it can wait, I see some green things over there I need to collect\". You can also develop additional skills such as Firearms and Driving (which unlocks better guns and faster cars), Strength (which increases melee damage and adds new moves such as a Infamous-esque ground pound) to Explosives such as using grenade/rocket launchers and thrown grenades. You can also develop each skill through different races and events so at least there's always something to strive for.As far as the non-orb collecting parts, it's okay but it's not the highlight. The targeting is still awful from the demo so if I'm jumping towards someone, I expect my lock-on to go towards the guy I'm jumping to, not the innocent gas can that's 50 feet behind him. Not to mention the game structure can get extremely repetitive and the way it works is on every island, there's zones you have to clear of enemies to allow as resupplies and re-fitting your character. There's Project Sunburst antennas that shoot a beam of light and turning on a certain number will have the beams intersect, to which you go towards that area, jump down the hole and fight off waves of freaks as a beacon charges up which clears the area of freaks. Got all that? Good now do it a total of 9 times. That's right, it's Assassin's Creed all over again and while this game offers more side stuff to do than those damn flags, as far as story progression goes, that's it and the game might as well say \"get used to it, kid, cause you're going to be doing it a lot\".But my biggest gripe is the building design and I don't mean on an architectural level. I mean as a parkour, climb-up-the-walls level. Assassin's Creed and Infamous did this right, have the buildings be easily climbable regardless of what side it was but in this game since the majority of your time will be on rooftops (chasing those tasty orbs, doing rooftop races or activating beacons), having a wall have a massive gap with no ledge to grab onto is stupid and not to mention having overhangs which your character bumps his head on and I guarantee you more than once you'll wonder why the hell this building was designed this way and I bet anytime you look at a building, your analog stick will be aimed directly towards the sky because you want to actually make sure you can climb to the top. At times it felt like Ruffian just made the game and any complaints that were made fell on deaf ears so now that the sequel is out it's like \"oh no, you didn't like that? Well why didn't you say that before?\"The game does support to 4 players in co-op and there's apparently a competitive multiplayer on the game but I wouldn't touch it. As a Canadian, we often have games priced at rather bizarre levels and for us, Crackdown 2 is priced at 69.99. Yes, that's right, nearly 80 bucks for a game many say is exactly like the original which you can find for 20 and under (and apparently looks better too). Is the game worth a playthrough? Sure, especially if you have OCD as the amount of collectables will drive you insane (there's 500 agility orbs and that's not counting the on-foot races, vehicle races, renegade orbs, freak breaches, hidden orbs...) but is the game worth the high price? No.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000088KH9","description":"Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis the third in the successful mission-based stealth series that first appeared on the PlayStation in 1998; few changes have been made to the basic format. Players can once again choose to be either Rikimaru, the silent sword-wielding assassin, or Ayama, the acrobatic younger ninja. Both characters pass through the same game world, but each has slightly different goals that take them on different routes. A third character can be unlocked later on.During the first mission, you're required to choose a number of weapons to aid you in your immediate tasks. Throughout the game, more and more weapons--from melee to ranged weapons--are added to your arsenal depending on your performance during each level; your chosen weapons dictate how you approach the mission goals. The silent approach is always encouraged, and there's a variety of graphically satisfying stealth kills that will only work if you remain elusive and strike unexpectedly and silently.Aside from the stealth kills, the game is a mixed bag in terms of its graphics. Light shimmers off your sword menacingly, but the environments are bland and repetitive, and the game fails to maximize on differences between light and dark areas in ways that might have added to the experience. Also, the stealth dynamic is made less challenging by the shortsightedness and slow reactions of the enemy guards and the iffy AI. Since guards give up searching for you within seconds and are unable to follow you through doors, this potentially atmospheric and tactical stealth game is actually just a hack-and-slash arcade romp. Multiplayer options are included, though, so if you feel the need for a more realistic opponent, you may want to call a friend.Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis still an enjoyable experience despite its flaws. It&#x92;s just a shame that, after doing so much to establish and define the stealth-game genre, it fails to raise the bar or introduce any novel elements. The game feels more like an update of the first Tenchu, and while this is no bad thing, fans will probably be expecting more.--Chris Ryan, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"George Rownd","summary":"violent and stupid","reviewText":"The game is really fun.

{"product_name":"B000UW21A0","description":"Sony Uncharted: Drake's Fortune 98103 PC Games","reviewerName":"Yossarian","summary":"Oh glorious day.","reviewText":"Uncharted:  Drake's Fortune is one of those games that makes you remember why you play video games in the first place.  It combines good storytelling, excellent voice acting, tremendous gameplay, and an enjoyable loot gathering aspect into a cinematic experience beyond anything you'll experience in theaters.  It's a perfect encapsulation of why the video game industry has outpaced the film industry in revenues (and I also have a sneaking suspicion that the tv show Burn Notice pretty much ripped off the characters from this game).In Uncharted:  Drake's Fortune, you play a ne'er-do-well fortune hunter on the trail of El Dorado.  Along the way, you'll have to clamber all over mountainsides and cliffs, untangle puzzles, evade deadly traps, and blast your way through a host of enemies by way of your combat shotgun, pistol, grenades, or any other weapon at hand (including your fists).  Depending on the level you may be fighting off cave dwellers with a German WWII submachine gun, cleaning out a derelict Spanish mission church with a sniper rifle, or exchanging grenade throws with other mercenaries in the middle of a jungle ruin.  A huge amount of effort was put into the gameplay, affording you the ability to fire from the hip while on the run (even running away and firing behind you), ninja roll from one piece of cover to another if a grenade lands beside you, or even leap over an obstruction and kill someone with your bare hands.  Elaborate puzzles require you to shimmy along cliff walls or leap from pillar to pillar, while collapsing balconies or stake traps lurk to send you to your grisly demise.  It's a good time.  A system of rewards also makes it fun to find hidden treasures along the way, see how many headshots you can get, or aim for other bonuses or challenges.Drake's Fortune is not without its problems, although they do not greatly diminish the overall worth of the game.  My primary gripe lies with the stability of the game, which I have found suspect.  In particular, despite running offline on a high-powered PS3 with a nearly bare hard drive, the game freezes from time to time.  More bizarrely, it sometimes loses the ability to handle sound effects, particularly during cut scenes, which usually portends a freeze within the next 5-10 minutes.  All progress is lost, so once those bugs start manifesting I usually just restart rather than clear a level and lose it at the next cut screen.  Bear in mind this PS3 deftly handles other high-demand games such as Fallout 3 without a hiccup, so my suspicion is that it is not a hardware issue.The game can also be very challenging, particularly for those of us with aging fast twitch reflexes.  The use of cover is mandatory, and some foes (such as certain cave dwellers) will 1-shot you fairly often unless you use certain specific tactics -- such as running away in terror while firing behind you wildly.  The end boss sequence for the entire game is also comically impossible, the very definition of trial and error where only a precise sequence of tactics over the course of about 10 minutes gives you a chance at beating the game.  I died 38 times the first time I tried to beat the end level.  Yes, I started counting.  After a while it reminded me of the old Onion article about the video game character wondering why the cruel gods kept picking \"continue\" after each death.Anyway, despite these warts the game is tremendously fun and has a lot of replay value.  Having beaten it primarily as a shooter, I now plan to try it with a melee emphasis.  My 38-death record should fall shortly.  In the mean time, I highly recommend you check this game out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2010"}

Developed by Ensemble Studios,Halo Warsfor Xbox 360&nbsp;brings all the drama of a real-time strategy game to the popular Halo Universe. Set in the year 2531, before the initial Halo first-person shooter game, this game lets you control the human armies of UNSC in a whole new way..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; }Play as UNSC or Covenant and exploit your faction's unique strengths.View larger.Invade enemy strongholds full of advanced technology.View larger.Find ways to make the detailed environments work for you.View larger.Bring in air support to turn the tide of battle.View larger.Experience the Epic Battle from a New PerspectiveDefense, offense, and the ability to hold down a command center in the face of hostile attacks: there's a lot to think about when laying out tactics for an all-out alien war. Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You'll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that's just the beginning.UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary ConflictThe story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above.Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy FactionThat's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, butHalo Warshas been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle. And the UI is just as intuitive, so whether you're managing a unit of marines or a deadly machine, you can focus on creating a battle strategy instead of worrying about how to overcome a clumsy controller.No matter which faction you choose to play as, you can test your skills against those of other players in online skirmishes that allow up to six players with the New Xbox Experience through Xbox LIVE.","reviewerName":"Jonathan","summary":"A surprisingly good Halo RTS","reviewText":"Halo Wars for the Xbox 360 is a lot like whatThe Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-Earthwas for the PC. Both took a franchise that was very popular and turned it into a real-time strategy that was very simplistic but surprisingly fun, thus making it a gateway game for people who had never tried a strategy game before.Like BFME, Halo Wars offers the bare minimum of customization: bases are in fixed locations on the map, there are three basic types of units, and only one kind of resource. Without all the fixin's that us RTS vets are used to, though, this game is very intuitive, and even players who have never touched a strategy game in their life will have the hang of it within the first few missions of the campaign (which is excellent, by the way, but only playable on the UNSC side - you only play the Covenant in skirmish mode). The graphics in the game are also superb, comparable to BFME II played on the good graphics settings.The game has the standard 1000G available from Achievements, but spreads them out a lot. Each mission has a 5G Achievement attached to it. Sort of making up for that, you get five Achievements worth 250G (and a pair of gamer pictures) just from beating the campaign on any difficulty, two of them worth a whopping 70G apiece. Another 80G (and maybe more gamer pictures - haven't tried to get them yet) await those who beat the game on Hard (30G) and Legendary (50G) as well.A few things about the game did tick me off. Grouping units is nonexistent, and specialized selection is nearly absent - you can select individual units, a series of individual units, all units of one type, all in a general area, all on-screen, or all overall. This made planning multi-front assaults hard to execute (the \"all in a general area\" selection option did not always grab every unit in an area, and sometimes grabbed a separate unit that was near a clustered group that it could probably have been on-screen if the screen was aligned just so). There is a nice \"Automatic\" difficulty option in Skirmish mode, but it gets very hard very quickly (I went from a breezy 40 to a decent 60 to a hair-pulling 97 in three matches). Finally, when you play as the Covenant (or against them), you really have to look at your buildings to tell them apart. I still click on the building to see what it is. Thankfully, all the UNSC buildings look different enough that you can see what they are at a glance.Halo Wars is a good entry-level RTS, made even more impressive by the fact that it's on a console. Don't play this game looking for strategic depth, but it's a blast to play or watch being played.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2009"}

It supports Dolby Digital sound.","reviewerName":"JSiph","summary":"This game doesn't tell you a story, it makes you experience a story (psychologically)","reviewText":"Alan Wake is a game you've probably heard of as being an underrated game on the Xbox 360. While I agree it is underrated, I think enough people have talked about it that it's over-hyped and can be a letdown to gamers who aren't prepared for a slow-paced game. Even though it's a slow-paced game, Remedy, did an incredible job telling a story through a video game. This game is a psychological thriller and every fight, every challenge you face is so tense that it feels like you are living the game. Everything you do has you question whether or not Alan Wake will survive.The Story:- It's pretty much a story within a story (Storyception, if you will) as you play as the protagonist, Alan Wake, a famous writer who's having a major writer's block. So you and your wife, Alice go on vacation to a fictional town in Washington called, Bright Falls, where you have rented a cabin. Your wife is afraid of the dark and after having an argument, you are walking around the cabin outside when the lights inside the cabin go out. You run inside as Alice is screaming, she fell into the lake, you dive in to save her... Then you wake up right after a car crash, a week has passed and you are being attacked by darkness. The darkness can only be hurt in the light, so you and your trusty flashlight have to fight until dawn pretty much. I hope you enjoy this third-person shooter thriller game as much as I did.Pros:- This story is definitely the most well written story for a video game, extremely well thought out and extremely immersive. Every detail has a purpose. You feel as if you are Alan Wake- The few times you fight alongside AI/NPCs they actually don't get in the way, rather they help you quite a bit.- One of the funniest side characters in a video game. Barry.- The gameplay is simple yet unique. You have a flashlight, pistol, and maybe flareguns or shotguns (if you're lucky)- You are forced to conserve your items if you want to survive, the game doesn't give you infinite ammo or anything (makes it quite more challenging).- It's just about the right length of a game where you don''t get bored with it.- The achievements aren't all just a part of beating a level, they require some skill.- Not annoying voice acting.- All characters are unique.Cons:- There are quite a few collectibles (however, the manuscripts do provide more depth into the story)- You can't play Nightmare mode (the hardest difficulty), until after you beat the game once. While this does merit replaying the game because you can find all the manuscript pages, I find it would be more fun to do the hardest mode first.Other:- I got 595G on one playthrough on Hard.- There are 2 DLC episodes (if you buy Alan Wake new, it should come with a code for the first DLC episode) which each offer 250G and finish the story.You should buy if:- You are a fan of classical horror (Alfred Hitchcock, maybe even some Stephen King) because your mind makes it more scary than it actually is. That said, this is more of a thriller than a horror story.- You want to play a game that has quite a unique story.- It is under $20, you can probably find it new (in most retail stores) for around that price.- You understand that this is not a fast paced game.You shouldn't buy this if:- You want fast-paced action.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2014"}

One false step could get you thrown out of the hotel and forever seal the mystery of what happened on that dark Christmas eve so many years ago.","reviewerName":"punkviper","summary":"You'll want to like it more than you actually like it","reviewText":"Sure a noirish text adventure sounds like just the thing for DS owners who are sick of seeing every licensed pre-teen TV show property under the sun appearing on the handheld, but the truth (if you are honest about it) is that Hotel Dusk: Room 215 just doesn't end up cutting the mustard as a good game.  Sure, it has great intentions, but so have plenty of games that turn out dull & boring.Issues:Difficulty - Not to unleash any spoilers, but who lifts an aluminum file cabinet with a crowbar?!  And who identifies engraving on a pen with chalk (very tiny chalk in the corner of a chalkboard)?  The game lulls you to sleep with conversations that are so pointless as to be inane (it even tells you in the book, just treat people nicely and they will tell you everything you need to know.)  So it's ridiculously easy to pick the \"right\" conversations.  But then on the rare occasions when you have to solve a puzzle, it's either pointlessly easy, or so obtuse as to make no sense even once you've figured it out.  Those aren't 2 options i really look forward to: vacillating between pointlessly easy & pointlessly dumb.Graphics - Yes, the A-ha video animation is cute & pleasant (for a bit) but let's face facts: that hotel must be a dump because it is wretched to look at.  I mean, i can excuse the graphics if the story is good, but even i can't say too many kind words about these graphics.  Blocky textures, muddy color palettes, jagged lines, it's pretty much a mess.  Not exactly the lush graphics that lure you into a world, more like one that makes you  walk really fast through it so you don't have to painfully ogle it.Characters - Okay, Kyle Hyde is a pretty good main character, i'll give you that.  But almost everyone else is an irritating caricature that makes me say, \"Wow, i hate that guy...' or \"Wow, is she annoying.\"  A good game contains a hearty dose of likeable characters, otherwise it's like going to work at an office full of people you dislike.  Heck, i can do that in real life!So what you're left with, bottom line, is an occasionally interesting story that makes you put up with vapid commentary, muddy graphics, and a cast of folks who remind you of people you hate.  You can decide whether or not Hotel Dusk is worth your time to slog through so many negatives to get to the limited amount of good stuff.  Great idea, poor execution.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2007"}

It's an awesome game. its like a more matured mario kart game + motorstorm apocalypse's destruction.Replay Value- It is so much replay value to this game because level 2 destructions alter the race tracks opening up variety for each track.Controls- This game had me nervous when I saw that I would be drifting to be my powerplay levels, after just playing NFS HP and hating it because of spinning out or be frustrated by the handling of the cars. This game is perfect drifting wise and control wise, this is why I may never pick up NFS HP again.Overall- This game has split screen multiplayer offline(unlike NFS HP),great handling,great drifting,variety in tracks,car variety, even great music(that gets me pumped on certain tracks),so much fun that I can't praise this game enough. This game is a 9/10 in my book.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2012"}

In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms.

Five minutes into your first play you'll notice that they are similar, half an hour in and you'll notice that they have quite a lot in common, an hour in and you'll wonder how no one sued for plagiarism.While Prototype was set in a gloomy Manhattan Island and was very bloody and gory, inFamous takes place on the fictional Islands of Empire City and is a fairly bloodless game as most bad guys are killed with electric shocks. There's also no swearing, which makes it a safer option for discriminate parents.You play as Cole MacGrath, a bicycle messenger who is caught in the middle of a devastating blast which obliterates a chunk of the city. When he wakes he discovers that he has new electric powers and that the media is trying to pin the blame of the blast on him. It's up to the player to decide whether to use these new powers for good or evil (the Platinum trophy is dependent on both, requiring 2 play-throughs). The missions are based on restoring power to the islands and clearing out the feral gangs which have formed in the blackout. It gets a little bit repetitive but the most aggravating thing about the gameplay is the fact that Cole is constantly trying to grab ledges and surfaces as you attempt to free-run your way through the city. It makes smooth navigation very hard and can be a real pain during time-dependent missions. Also some of Cole's upgraded abilities are just too high-powered, meaning he'll blow himself up if you're fighting in close-quarters.Despite these complaints, it's a fairly easy-going game and one which you can play superficially without ever getting really involved. The comic-book cutscenes are very nice to look at, though the music is rather forgettable.The pros and cons when compared to Prototype are more or less even. It's worth playing for sure and worth picking up cheap.Graphics B+Sound B+Gameplay BLasting Appeal B-","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2013"}

I was absolutely surprised by the gameplay, which was deep, complex, but not frustrating. The weapon upgrades are a hoot, and the futuristic weapons scale up with the difficulty of the tougher enemies. Being able to upgrade weapons means you can keep the old WWII-era machine guns and awesome sniper rifle even later in the game to take down bad guys, due to the other upgrades to your character's abilities. Some of the bosses are unbalanced in their difficulty, requiring dozens of attempts to take them down but once you learn their weaknesses a second run through the game goes much more quickly. I've played the COD series, Battlefield series, and this game stands alone as a real gem. Ironically, I didn't touch it for YEARS because the old Xbox version was so horrible!

I don't think a lot of gamers were in their right minds when they bought this on March 27th for 250 U.S. bucks just to play Pilot Wings, a fighting game that was already on two of this gen's home consoles and many other games that lacked a spark. Some people just need new gadgets right away just 'cause they are new. The more patient (and I say smart) people will wait. And they did. For more updates and more games. By the time Christmas rolled around there were three new colors, more game options, a fantastic price drop of 80 bucks and plenty of updates to now make the system a steal. I asked for the system for Christmas and have not been letdown since I opened the packaging.The show stealer and much talked about feature of this system is obviously the 3D (without the need for special glasses). I've tried it with Super Mario 3D Land and it works well. It helps you judge the distance of platforms and such. Rayman 3D's use of this feature is also well implemented (even more so than Mario is in my opinion). Well maybe that's not a fair statement...Mario Land's 3D is used in a few more different ways but Rayman's 3D really seems to \"pop\" more. But remember: 1. Some people can't see 3D at all no matter how they try. And 2. No one under the age of 7 should be viewing the the top screen on the 3DS while the system's 3D bar is elevated to any level. It could damage their young, still developing eyes so keep it \"OFF\"/on the lowest possible level when they are watching or playing.The 3DS is capable of a myriad of things though, 3D just being one of them. There is an internet browser, a sound app, a camera app, a Mii Making app, an e-Shop, a Daily Log app, Face Raiders, AR games and many more that the original DS and DS Lite just didn't have. One of my favorite things about this video game system is the e-Shop. Enabling us to scroll through tons of stuff and view video games, videos and such as well as purchase content is amazing. I've only purchased the DSi game \"Magical Whip\" and \"The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX\" so far but I can tell I will be using the e-Shop for quite a bit, especially for watching videos of upcoming games and writing reviews on titles I've played.This is a good time to purchase the 3DS. With the game library only growing, the color lineup getting more and more robust and the promising system updates we've already seen, Nintendo is on a high. The system looks and feels pretty great. There are a few setbacks such as the two screens rubbing together when the 3DS is closed, and it leaving some temporary marks on the top screen. Or the fact that not all the games that people want to see are out yet.While the latter can still be seen as a minor problem, I commend Nintendo for trying their darndest in giving us quality games without rushing too much. Long live Nintendo!Final score ------> 9/10 (or 4.5/5)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2011"}

You still run as fast as you can to the end of the stage, stomp on enemies, hit powerup blocks and the like.  But of course why change what isn't broken.  Like the original SMG, SMG2 is a spiritual successor to Super Mario 64.  Once again, Nintendo uses their flagship mascot to put out a genre defining game.It could be argued to give SMG2 a lower score than the original merely because it isn't the giant leap forward the original was. I find this misguided.  Mario has always been about pinpoint control and perfect level design, two things shown here in spades.  There is not a single boring level and there is always something new to do.  Be it reaching new comet coins, solving puzzles or any of the other platforming activities.The game is difficult.  Not to breeze through and finish, but to find every star and comet coin.  This allows a gamer to feel accomplished after breezing through a selection of levels while finding enough to do for the hardcore gamer.  Its the perfect mix.No, it isn't HD graphics, but the art design is beautiful.  Simply put, some gamers have abandoned Nintendo because they feel they have outgrown Mario and the cartoonish ways.  However, they are missing out because Mario is still consistantly the best games available.  Amazing game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2010"}

It is a child-based game system between ages(3-13). PS2 is the best because of it's retail value and the fact that it has more games than XBOX and Gamecube and they also have much more discounted games than either of those systems. There are so many games to choose from when using PS2. Yes, the PS2 doesn't have as good as graphics as the XBOX but at least you dont need a remote control to play your dvds or cds, just use the paddle for PS2. Besides, Sony in general is the best name brand of the three. Microsoft is not noted for making good hardware products, their networking essentials do not work well at all. When XBOX first came out it had major issues of over-heating and in some instances I heard that some actually caught fire. I think Microsoft caught on to that and fixed the problem some-what. I work in retail for Circuit City and Gamecubes hradly sell at all, we never run out of it and it always seems that we run out of PS2's every single week.

B","summary":"Do I dare say, it's better then it's predecessor???","reviewText":"YES, yes i do.  I unlocked the gold cross in the orginal Modern Warfare(multiplayer), as well as finished the single player compaign, just to give you an idea of how many hours i put into it and my background going into this review.Modern Warfare 2 is a great all around FPS(first person shooter), but it's not perfect.The Good:Campaign, spec ops, and ofcourse, MULTIPLAYER.  And the thing that makes this game 5 stars is the value, if the disc came with just one of these on it, it would be worth full price.Campaign - I'm just starting this and will update later, but what i've played so far is what you would expect from the sequel to Modern Warfare.Spec Ops - Is a great addition to the game.  It's a series of single missions(not campaign missions) that you can play co-op via split screen or xbox live(no search system like in multiplayer, you have to have a friend to play with), or you can go solo, although they are difficult and made to play with another person.  And this uses a star system, more stars are awarded to you for playing/completing on harder difficulty settings, these stars are then used to unlock new levels.  Very fun and very addictive.  And there are a good amount, it looks like there might be around 20.Multiplayer - To me this is the meat of Modern Warfare 1&2.  They have kept the multiplayer formula from Modern Warfare 1 and added a significant amount to it.Now there is a ton of attachments that you can upgrade your gun with - different sights, heartbeat sensor, etc...Your side arm can be a shotgun, handgun, machine handgun, mini grenade launcher.The perks are also different and those can be upgraded as well(due to how many kills you get while that perk is equiped).The maps all seem well laid out, there are a lot more broken down city/urban area maps this time around.The Bad:Kill streaks!!!Don't get me wrong, you now how the ability to unlocked which kill streaks you want, which is great, and arrange them how you want to.  But the actual rewards for kill streaks are way too powerful, to the point of being ridiculous.  Not only can you call in the helicopter(just like in Modern Warfare 1), but now you can call in a harrier jet, heavy armored helicopter, the AC 130 etc...Take the harrier jet for example, i believe you get it after a 7(maybe 9) kill streak.  Once called, it stays hovering over the map for a loooooooooooooong time, and it takes out players twice as fast as the helicopter.  So that in it's own right is a little extreme, but what's worse is that it's incredibly difficult to take down.  Here in lies one of the biggest faults of MW2, they didn't supply the player with a balance arsenal inorder to deal with such kill streaks.  Atleast in MW1, you could take down the helicopter with two rockets or with alot of fire power from a LMG.  But the new rocket launcher in MW2 has a homing missle(which sounds awesome, but isn't) and you have to lock onto your target, so what this means is that you have to stand out in the open and what for about 3 seconds(1...2....3) while you have some crazy harrier or helicopter tearing you to shreds not to mention the other team who is trying to kill you, makes it extremly difficult.***UPDATE***I\"m currently at level 47 in multiplayer and now that i have some experience under my belt, it is NOT hard to take down helicopters or harrier jets at all, the AC130 is another story...  I think i was under the impression that it was because many of my early multiplayer games no one on my team felt it necessary to take down the opposing teams flight demon, whatever it may have been, so my team was just getting destroyed and no one seemed to mind.  But now that i  know how to use the second rocket launcher properly, it only takes one rocket to take down either one(once locked on), helicopter or harrier, the heavy armored helicopter takes 2 rockets.  I've been having a lot of fun destroying the enemies kill streak prize's.  It's easy, and you get 200-300 points for each one you take down.  I racked up almost a 1,000 points a couple of match's just in destroying helicopters/harriers, add that to kills, you're good to go.  Anyways, the rocket launcher is my second weapon of choice now.Also, some other things i have noticed while playing online is that the match making system needs an update, it is constantly adding me to games that are almost over.A note to a potential MW2 online player, i've noticed that sometimes, teams that i'm on and play against get destroyed, the other team over powers them so much so that they are forced in one corner of the map...that's NOT FUN, if that happens, drop out, find another game, it's alright, you're playing to have fun.  I\"m saying this because a lot of people just keep running into bullets, and then repeat.  If you're playing MW2 and not having fun because their is a huge mismatch between teams, drop out, enter another game, eventually you'll find a group that fits your play style.Also, unless your thicked skinned and don't mind people being animalistic, consider yourself warned that HALF(so it seems) of the people online, especially those that play MW2 are idiots, and make every kind of vulgar remark you can think of.  I'm also surprised to hear how many children are online playing this game.  Not only is this an adult game, but ONLINE??? listening to what i'm listening too, come on parents!  Alot of times i don't even wear my headset but keep it plugged into my controller because that way it's silent, no random person expressing how they hate their lives.  Anyways, i digress, but here is the update as promised.***End of UPDATE***The new additions to the kill streak system are great, they just need to really balance them out a bit, shorter time span, easier to take down, somthing....Also, some of the levels i've played thus far in the campaign seem to be a little too extreme for the sake of being extreme.  For example(!!!potential SPOILER!!!), the famous airport mission, where you are \"undercover\" and take over an airport and just kill all of the hostages in it, was done in poor taste.  There was no logical reasoning behind that mission, especially because once you've killed everyone your undercover is blown and they kill you(how the mission ends).  Wha???????  So was any of that necessary?  For story purposes they use that mission to start a hate reletionship with Russia and the US, but it could've been handled differently.  Anyways, i digress....The Verdict:This game is pretty tight all around.  But when it comes down to it, you're reading this because you know you're going to buy this game, or you might be thinking about it.  Therefore the best advice i can give you is this.If you like the first MW, you're going to like MW2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000K9OP2A","description":"Emotionally charged, stunningly beautiful, and delivering unprecedented dramatic character performance, Heavenly Sword&#x2122; showcases the power of PLAYSTATION&#xAE;3 (PS3&#x2122;) computer entertainment system. A dramatic tale of revenge sees Nariko, a fiery red-haired heroine, embark on a quest for vengeance against an invading King and his army. The story builds around the ancient Heavenly Sword, which once belonged to a powerful deity. It can never be wielded by a mortal without it slowly but inevitably draining their life-force.When the invading King (played by Andy Serkis) destroys the warrior clan that guards the Heavenly Sword, the clan leader&#x2019;s daughter, Nariko, takes up the sword in a desperate fight for survival. Nariko must now pay the ultimate price as she embarks on one last mission of vengeance against the King and his army before her life is finally and irreparably overtaken by the omnipotent Heavenly Sword&#x2026;","reviewerName":"Christopher Deweese","summary":"I Think I'm In Love!","reviewText":"Holy moly!  Nariko is perhaps the most stunning heroine I've ever seen in a game.  Is it possible to fall in love with a virtual creature?  She is truly beautiful, and those glimpses of her tush certainly are enjoyable.  However, Nariko isn't the only thing worth looking at in this game.  The environments are sweeping and astounding.  The music adds to the drama of an already engrossing story.  The fighting and action are truly top notch.  I've never been much for fighting games, but this is truly a fantastic game.At first, I found myself captivated by Nariko's beauty and body.  I had to get over that quickly since the enemy soldiers started attacking in droves.  The moves Nariko is capable of are truly acrobatic and fun to watch.  Initially, I was simply mashing the buttons.  As time went on I familiarized myself with the several combos that become available, which only heightened the combat experience.  I really enjoyed the camera angles as it followed the action.  It never seemed to detract from the gameplay, but rather, it created a much more cinematic feel than most games I play.The after touch feature was a lot of fun.  How often do you get to guide cannon balls and arrows in flight?  I've never experienced that before in a game, so that seemed pretty novel to me.  I also enjoyed doing it via the sixaxis controller.  Again, it added an entirely new dimension to the gameplay (tilting the controller to alter the objects trajectory, awesome).Heavenly Sword definitely shows what the PS3 is capable of.  It also shows how top notch production can add to the cinematic quality of a game.  The textures and rendering are as good as anything out there.  The voice acting is some of the best, and the cut scenes are probably the best I've ever seen.I hope I can get over the fact that Nariko is only virtual.  She embodies pretty much everything you could want in a woman (just don't tell my wife).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2007"}

When I broke down and bought another 360, it only made sense to get for me to by the Limited Edition of Fable 2...AGAIN.  Fable 2 is TRULY an AMAZING RPG, the story is great, the people within Albion are always funny, and enjoyable people that make Albion feel alive.  Fable has everything you could possibly want from an RPG.  Choices, repercussions for those choices.  The world changes around you changes from your choices.  Also, you can buy any home you want in the world of Albion, decorate it... rent it out to the citizens of the town that you bought the home in.

There are 80 levels in this game, six regular worlds, and a star road world that can be found by finding secret exits that are in various levels in the game also Each world and level is very unique and there are alot of levels from the classic mario games such as super mario bros 3 and super mario world in this game. This is a good game that is worth playing and it's worth the money. it's also just as good as super mario 3d land and it has alot of replay value. The bottom line is that, if you are a fan of mario games or just like platformer and adventure games in general then you cant go wrong with buying this It's one of the best nintendo 3ds games that is availible right now, and it's a very fun and easy game to play.

Until, that is, I got around to playing it, then I was just bored.Let me start by saying 'Bullet Witch' is ... OK.  There are worse game out there for the 360 that you could be playing.  If that sounds like faint praise ... well ... frankly, it is.  For any positives, I'm not sure what else to say.  The game's doing just enough good to keep it from being awful, but there are a slew of problems that keep it from being good too.The most obvious flaw I found is the A.I.  It's terrible, the enemies you'll fight are just flat out dumb, usually wandering around unaware of my presence until I'm virtually on top of them.The story's premise is pretty good, but, through the course of the game, you never really progress in it.  Your character kills demons ... just because.  The voice acting is also way below average.The graphics are about average, I've seen worse (faint praise again, I know).  At the same time, however, I've certainly been treated to light-years better in a third-person shooter &lt;cough> Gears of War &lt;cough>.Generally, the combat system is passable, but the menu-selection style it uses for spell casting is a little clunky and kind of tough to navigate through in the middle of a battle.  As was mentioned before, it's true, nothing can be hot-keyed to speed up your selection.  To be fair, the elemental spells you can cast are really cool looking and one of the games high-points.This was also brought up before, but bears mentioning again, 'Bullet Witch' is really short.  A previous reviewer put the game's completion time at about six hours, that's pretty close to the mark.  This is a rental, plain and simple.  In all, there's enough here to justify taking a look if you're really bored and out of stuff to play, but I just can't see plunking down fifty bucks to own a copy.  You'll be able to find a used copy for half of that soon enough.  If you want it that bad, just wait it out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2007"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, doubters say it would be suicide.

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game.

On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games as they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

They added more quick-travel, a lot better! Now it's not a walk-fest. Also has better graphics, obviously. There is a map (easy to read) that you can bring up that shows you an overview and what's what (in city sections). The map is about as good as Borderlands'. No more vehicle driving parts(Mako), thank goodness.The resource scanning from planets seems to be a tad annoying if you do it too much. It's fun and new at first, but after awhile it can become tedious. You don't have to scan and deplete every planet, if you did you would have way to much resources than you needed. I overdid it. I'd suggest only scanning only as much as you need, than it's not so bad.They added ammo which you have to reload, instead of heat overloading. The inventory and the way you store/upgrade your guns is also a little different. These don't seem to be improvements (take it or leave it).If you have your Mass Effect 1 saved game files, you can import your character. Your storyline will continue and you can have your guy/girl look the same as they did. I have the Steam version of Mass Effect 1 and got the retail of Mass Effect 2, and had no problems using my saved files from Mass Effect 1.The story is as good or better than the first and the characters they added are really awesome.

{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"buru buru piggu","summary":"Good concept ruined by poor controller execution","reviewText":"DJ Hero is, if you'll pardon the pun, the latest spin on the tried and true Guitar Hero franchise. You should already be familiar with such rhythm game concepts, but in case you're not, here's a quick overview:Colored shapes come traveling down lanes on the screen, like a conveyor belt. When they get to the bottom, you push the corresponding button(s) or perform the action indicated. In the case of DJ Hero, there are 3 tracks to mix and scratch, each represented by one of the colored lanes (green, red, and blue). When the colored circle comes traveling down, it means push the corresponding button on the turntable. When a segment looks like a patch of zipper material, it means to scratch the record while holding down the correspondingly colored button. When you see a big zig-zag on either the left or right track, that means to slide the cross-fader in the direction indicated. Score enough correct consecutive button presses and a meter builds, multiplying your score, just like Guitar Hero. Once it is fully charged, you can push the Euphoria button to unleash a supercharged mode where your score multiplier is doubled and cross-fading is automatic.Playing DJ sounds like fun, but it's not, due to the frustrating controller. The colored buttons on the turn table are arranged in a row, and the innermost button (blue) is too close to the center point, making the turntable very difficult and uncomfortable to spin. The buttons are slightly concave and textured with small grooves, but they are not deep enough or gripping enough to prevent fingers from slipping. Sweating will make it worse. After several minutes of playing, I found slippage to be a problem.Equally problematic is the cross-fader. The game requires you to slide the control to the left, center, or right. The slider is not a continuously smooth sliding control and it's unforgiving. It snaps into place in the middle and has to be snapped to register the hit. Due to the snapping, it is very easy to overshoot and miss the middle point, especially when you have to cross-fade multiple times in quick succession at certain points in the game. As a result, I was focusing on how much force to exert so as not to overshoot rather than actually playing the game. When a game forces you out of the experience to concentrate on the controls, it is bad design.If you are interested in this game, I would definitely recommend playing it for 10-15 minutes at a store before you decide. DJ Hero's website has a location finder.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Tamer","summary":"A MASTERPIECE!!!","reviewText":"I've been a Mario fan since 1989 and i've played many great Mario games.

Lindquist","summary":"Tried and True","reviewText":"There are very few people now adays that have not heard of a game called \"Counter-Strike.\" Originally designed as a free modification in 1998 on the award winning (and still gorgeous even to today's standards) Half-Life engine, Counter-Strike quickly became thousands of people's unbreakable addiction (including mine).What caused this to happen? The gameplay concept is rather simple and to the point? What keeps people playing?The answer to that question is both simple and complex. First we will start with the weapons and map geometry.WEAPONS AND MAP GEOMETRY: The game is extremely well rounded when it comes to the selection of weapons per side as well as how the map is designed for each side. Both teams have strategic points and and weaknesses on each map and unique weapons that fit some players over others. Another thing that keeps the gameplay random and strategic is that any player can pick up any fallen players weapon and switch what they have, no matter what team they are on and no matter how expensive it is. Heck, if the player is alive you two can STILL switch weapons with each other. You can be in combat with a player that has an M4 at one moment, then he can pop out with a scout the next. Theres tons of variation without making it get out of hand.GRAPHICS ENGINE: The graphics engine is extremely important. This doesnt only include the visuals but the flexability of what the developer is able to provide the world in the range in details, visuals, interactivity, sound, etc. For it's time, the Half-Life engine was EXTREMELY flexable compared to the other games out at the time and offered modders and developers something they had not seen before. Half-Life 2 is not only that but the entire revamped package. The Visuals are amazing and the types of details and interaction in maps is unbelieveable. CS:Source brings back so many of the original maps but with the touch up they needed. From particle effects to high definition Bloom lighting, realistic physics from the Havok engine, to knowing where a person is by the high quality sound effects and actually feeling like your there makes the experience more rich and vibrant then ever before.SOUND: As mentioned earlier, the sound is amazing. From being able to walk and actually hear other people's footsteps and knowing where they are, you are able to get the edge on another player. The guns all sound great and if a gun is powerful, you definitly know it. The atmosphere sounds really suck you in and enrich the experience.GAMEPLAY: The Gameplay is simple, yet varied. You can choose maps where you must either bomb or protect a certain point or maps where you have to escort hostiges to a safe zone. The original Counter-Strike had a mode where you had to protect a VIP which they have yet to bring back which is disapointing but the core gameplay is there and it rocks. With the weapons being even, the levels being diverse but well rounded and the gameplay smooth as can be, it's easy to get sucked in for one vital reason: To be better than the next guy. You can be on a hot streak for days and meet someone that wipes the floor with your face and theres nothing you can do about it but keep playing and try to improve. This game truly has a sense of skill and it truly shows right away if you dont have any. On top of that, you can be involved in some of the coolest shoot outs and make some of the best friends you'll have by joining clans and teams within the community.MODIFICATIONS: The irony here is that Counter-Strike started as a modification itself but now has grown to the level that people modify the modification itself. One that I personally like in particular that I can litterally sink hours into is a mod called \"Zombie Mod.\" It's concept is massivly addicting and fast paced. You start the round off as normal in modified versions or the original maps or custom ones made by the community (cities, towns, etc) but within seconds of starting, 1 player randomly turns into the zombie. Now, in CS in general, you can run faster if you have the knife out, but the zombies run much faster than you do at your very fastest. You have to either be much smarter than them, which can be hard because they are real people not AI controller bots, or you have to constantly shoot them to push them back. As a zombie, you only have a knife, a TON of life and nightvision to aid you but you can easily make the best of it in the dark close quarter maps that are available for the mod. If you ever slash another player once, he will then turn into a zombie to aid you in your quest for total conquest. This mod can honestly cause panic in you and the random feats of survival each round keeps you massivly addicted.All in all, this game has more replay value then any First Person Shooter I have ever seen. The concept is so simple and fund and you wont be able to put it down.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2007"}

I saw a few clips and the primitive 64-bit graphics made me vomit in my mouth. That said, I got this game and the strategy guide just for the heck of it. I quit playing after getting stuck in the 3rd dungeon. After a year or so I erased the file and started afresh. I fortunately got past that part and continued playing. And once I was done... wow. Just wow. Now understand I was never a fan if this franchise. In fact I loathed it with every fiber of my being along with Mario for leaving Metroid out in the dirt. But after I finished this game I became addicted to it. The graphics are gorgeous, the story is awesome, the gameplay is fantastic. What more can I say?

{"product_name":"B0009S4UOA","reviewerName":"Cobalt","summary":"More Balanced and Fair, But Still Relentlessly Brutal","reviewText":"The first Call Of Duty game, exclusively for the PC, was a strategic, realistic game that was immensely challenging and enjoyable.  However, the hardest difficulty, Veteran, took things a little too far.  The health pickups were completely gone, meaning any damage received was permanent.  Also, checkpoints wouldn't activate if your health was below 50%.  Combine this with enemies that were extremely accurate and did massive damage, and Veteran mode could be infuriating.  Luckily, its sequel, COD 2, introduces elements that make the game more balanced and fair, while still retaining a realistic, strategic atmosphere.  As a result, to this day, it remains one of the best WWII games ever created.Developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision, the biggest change to COD 2 is in its health system.  Instead of finding medkits to heal yourself, you have a regenerating health system that automatically heals you completely if you don't take any further damage.  Now this was all the way back in late 2005, when the seventh-generation was just beginning.  Regeneration, at the time, was completely revolutionary, and everyone embraced the fact that they didn't have to focus solely on avoiding damage or hunting for healthpacks.  This system allows you to take greater risks and experiment with a wider range of tactics, while still being able to recover if you do mess up.The core gameplay in COD 2 remains the same as the first.  You play as three different soldiers in three separate campaigns: American, British, and Russian, all of whom are fighting the Nazis at different places and times.  All four sides have their own unique set of weapons, some that are essentially carbon copies of each other, and others that can be vastly superior.  Since you're only allowed to carry two weapons at a time, the key to progressing through the camapign is to pick a loadout suitable for short and long-range combat while also enhancing your movement speed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2014"}

This game, is that game people!I'll just assume that if you are considering buying this, then you either had a Sega Genesis in the days of yore, or are at the very least way in to retro style games. With that caveat, I say to you that this game delivers, and keeps on delivering! Not only that but it delivers in a pretty attractive little package, and at a price point to the tune of 15 dollars, I suggest you pull on those red slippers and loop-de-loop your way on into town to snag a copy. Or... you could just pick it up right here, and have the hardworking delivery men bring it right to your doorstep!The GamesWell enough of my general yammering. What you are interested in is the games, am I right? Well how about like 40+? Sure that's a few games alright, but what are we talking here? I don't know about you, but I'm not really into the prospect of a 40 game pack if like 5 of the games are like Bubsy1,2,3, Bubsy 4 \"This Time its Personal\", Bubsy 5 \"the Bubsying\"... You get the picture. We want quality... and quantity! This disc has it! All the genres are well represented, with several platforming, action, RPG, puzzle, arcade, and beat em up games on offer. Chances are you will even find at least a handful of games on here that you used to own yourself.The HighlightsChronic Sonic: You've got more Sonic than you can shake a stick at here.Or if not a stick, then some stick like object in the idiom of the Sonic Games, but I'm at a loss so proxy in your own wit here for me readers! Even the gut wrenching Sonic Spinball makes and appearance if you are a masochist.The Golden Age: Does the name Ax Battler mean anything to you? If it does then chances are you, like me, have been jonesing for the days where you could just walk around with a friend cutting down goons and punting potions out of gnomes! Well you get all three Golden Axe Games. Golden Axe 1, Golden Axe 2 This time its personal, and Golden Axe 3, the Axening. What a bargain!Phinal Phantasy??: For a few out there, the name brand for the early RPG Didn't use Fs for the FUh sound. Those boys and girls might just have been playing some Phantasy Star! ... Or maybe they just weren't hooked on phonics! Either way, you've got 4 full length retro RPGs here to discover, or rediscover, or even dediscover somehow. I don't know. Do as you will! Only thing is, these are quality games. Check the dates these things came out if you want to know just how ahead of their time they were.All the Rage: Now listen gamers if you are like me, then you dream of the days when you can show up at your friends door, do some buddy arm grab, and then set out across town beating the unholy hell out of everyone that looks different from you! Punk rockers, wrestlers, karate guys,ax juggling carnies, dominatricies(sp?), tubby fire breathing baseball players? No one will be safe from your punchy wrath! All three Streets of Rage games are back! Team up with a friend, and god help the criminally aligned counter cultures of your city!Shining recommendation: Sega's popular Shining Force games go up to numero dos on this disc, and you also get shining in the darkness, or Hard as **** the game, as I like to call it. These things still hold up really well, and the character portraits are pretty good for the time. Lots of fun, well worth a revisit.And All THAT!: There's more, much more, and readers please; just because my brain is like a sieve and I can't think of more specific games, don't take that to mean the rest are all third rate garbage! There are some seriously surprising little gems in there! Don't count out the always fun Altered Beast, or Fantasy Zone, or Gain Ground, Kid Chameleon, and many many more.The short story, is that if you had a Sega Genesis, you might want to just go ahead and pick this game up. For the price of a movie ticket you get a whole heck of a lot of games, and it takes up a lot less space than all those big clunky genesis boxes too yep!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2011"}

There is a large universe for Jimmy, the main character, to navigate including the school where Jimmy attends and an extensive city map beyond the school for Jimmy to explore.The voice work is very good, and gives the campus bullies and teachers a very realistic feel.  The story is also pretty good, because it advances Jimmy from being a hated new kid at school, to one that gains respect of the varioius bully factions on campus.  I also enjoyed some of the other tasks you can accomplish, like collecting rubberbands or game cards or destroying gnomes throughout the city.The only reason I'm giving this game 4 stars instead of 5 is because it froze up about 5 or 10 times during the course of playing it.  However, for me, that wasn't enough to make the game not worth playing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2008"}

If you haven't played any of them yet, prepared to get VERY addicted, as you lead your civilization through a grand sweep of time, from the stone age right all the way to the modern age and beyond.  Casual gamers beware - you will become hard core after you buy this game.That said, Civ 3 isn't much different from the previous games - it doesn't change much in an already great formula.  So, if you still dig the Civ games, buy this now!  However, I found myself wishing for improvements in the areas that have always hurt this series:  The AI still mindlessly swarms all over the map;  the difficult levels are still just a &quot;cheating handicap&quot; for the computer;  the new diplomacy options are completely wasted on the moronic AI;  the warfare model is still rather crude;  blah, blah, blah.  Also, the basic Civ playstyle has changed in small but important ways, enough that I still prefer Alpha Centauri.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2001"}

This was the case with RAYMAN:LEGENDS. The artwork is deliciously fun, creative and beautiful. With a Mario Bros. type gameplay of exploring multiple areas with a left to right, jump, run, bonk on the head type gameplay, it brings an old fashion style of gameplay into the cartoon era.My son is always begging me to sit down and play games with him and usually the games sort of bore me within 5 minutes, but not this one. In fact, we played one of the side games (soccer: or Kung Foot) and did it for hours. My son is a pretty fun and funny kid, but I'm pretty sure I've never seen him laugh so hard, loud and long as I do while playing soccer.Some of the adventures get pretty hard and frustrating but I'd be disappointed if they were too easy. We've only played for a few hours and I'm pretty sure our adventures are not finished with this game. Before we know it, we'll be carving out these adventures left and right.The animation is a combination of pixar meets Don Bluth and I love it.

{"product_name":"B00DC7G2W8","reviewerName":"John S. Dean \"John\"","summary":"A mix of great and just alright...","reviewText":"My 10 year old and I love Mario Kart, as well as the Sonic racing games.  My son has been waiting for this for a long time.  I have as well just for the fun I can have with him.The good - the graphics really are well done for Mario Kart.  Granted, we're not talking Infamous Second Son here or Watchdogs Or even Assassin's Creed 4, but for Mario Kart, it looks really good.  Crisp graphics, vibrant colors, everything really looks great.The additional surfaces are a nice addition.  My son is used to the flying aspect from his 3DS and Mario Kart 7, but I like the \"stick to the walls\" addition in this one.  Some levels don't do the \"90 degrees up in the air\" parts of the track where that's necessary, but they *DO* offer that \"ride on the wall\" option in some sections of some of the normally flat tracks.  Helps get you up out of the normal area and gives you a few extra turbo sections to speed up on.But in the normal course of racing, that \"up in the air stick to the wall\" section really isn't that noticeable since you're seeing everything relative to YOUR point of view, so whether you're racing flat on the ground or up 90 degrees in the air, you just see the flat surface you're racing on, so your perspective is the same regardless unless you pay close attention to the horizon to see the changes.But it really is just more of the same.  The tracks look nicer, but for the ones that are duplicates of previous tracks, it's just the same thing but looking better.My biggest complaint is the drifting.  It's not as \"nice\" as earlier Mario Kart games, or as good as the Sega Sonic racing games.  There's not as much control over drifting here, it doesn't control the \"more drift or less drift\" as much as the others.  And I wish they had done the triggers as the forward / reverse acceleration, rather than the A button.  It's more awkward for us to hold the A button on the gamepad to go forward and use triggers to drift as it would've been to use the trigger for acceleration and the A button to drift.  I haven't dug yet into any controller customizations, so we'll see if we can adjust that, but out of the box I wish they had done it differently.Many levels have random things in different parts of the tracks as obstacles, and I like that bit of randomness.  One level has trollies, another has, obviously, the cows we're used to.  One has rolling objects.  Sometimes they're on the right side, sometimes they're in the middle, so it adds a bit of \"you better pay attention\" to the levels since you may have to drift more, or less, on some turns depending on what random thing you may hit around or after that turn.There seems to not be as much integration with the Game Pad as I would've liked.  You see the track and your position on it, you see who's in what position as far as the 1st through 12th go.  Personally, I wish they would've done the rear view in the mostly unused middle portion of the Game Pad.  And we won't even go into the decision someone made to not allow a two player local race without split screen.  Even Sonic's racing game allows the person on the gamepad to have the whole gamepad screen to themselves, and the person racing using the TV to have that whole screen for their view.  There's no excuse for this forced split screen in a local two player game.The initial load times are a noticeable amount longer than the last Wii game, but that's to be expected with the more detailed tracks and higher graphics.And for the \"Doesn't matter but still, really?\" category is the theme music while in the menus.  I can shut out the world and hear the Mario Kart theme from the Wii game and I enjoyed it.  This music in here for the menus really is a bit of a letdown comparatively, sounds more like what some late night show would have their band playing as the credits roll at the end.  Not inspired at all, but as I said, that doesn't count since it has nothing to do with gameplay, just something they COULD have done better.I also wish the default after the race wasn't \"watch highlights\" but \"next race\" since I have a tendency to hit the A button after races to skip all the superfluous stuff.  In this that drops you to watching movies of your race.  Fortunately if you're impatient and hit the A button and get dumped into the replay, the immediate default option is to get out of it again, so it's not too bad.Bottom line - if you or your kid likes Mario Kart, this is worth getting.  Bit of things here and there that make it less than maybe it could have been, but it still beats playing the original Wii Mario Kart over and over.  Nice change of pace, still the \"insanely simplistic\" controls of Mario Kart on the Wii compared to Sonic or something else, so it's still a great game for kids to enjoy, which is really where this made its mark anyway.You won't want this for realistic racing, it's not even on part with the Sega Sonic series for control and racing and difference between air, sea, and land even though this is brand new and the other has been around for a couple years.  But there is SOMETHING about Mario Kart that just makes it a timeless classic, and this is an enjoyable romp with better graphics, new levels and better looking old levels...Side note - so far I've only been hit ONCE by the annoying blue bomb that targets first place racers, and I've been in first place for 16 or 20 races...  I really dislike that thing, and it's always one of the biggest annoyances in the Mario Kart games, but in this version, it's not NEARLY as prevalent as it's been in previous versions.  Although I have to admit this is still the only game that can make me swear so profusely anyway...  And there's at least a pickup you can hold onto that stops the blue shell from hitting you.Worth getting for any Mario Kart fan, just be aware it still has its drawbacks...  And a bonus so far after playing it as long as I have (11 days now) is that so far, at least for me, it's been completely bug free.  Not often a new game comes out for newer consoles that doesn't have *SOME* bug to deal with.  But in here so far, not a single glitch.If they'd fix the split screen requirement for two people, this would become a 5 star game despite the other small annoyances.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2014"}

{"product_name":"B002I090AG","description":"","reviewerName":"AlexJouJou","summary":"If you are prone to headaches - limit 3D viewing time but it sure is FUN!","reviewText":"I've been a huge Nintendo fan since the GBA. So it stands to reason I'd get the 3DS. There are many good things about this system that make it an excellent purchase (perhaps not a \"must buy\" but a great purchase nonetheless!):- Graphics are sharp, crisp, colors pop and overall it is ultra pleasing to the eye- I love the color (I got Aqua Blue) and surprisingly it is not a fingerprint magnet- Enhanced options and potentially netflix and some game boy and game boy color remakes virtual- Analog stick is responsive, easy to use, and us fans can say Nintendo finally heard us!- I was very surprised to hear a rich vibrant sound coming from this unit. I didn't have headphones on and it was much better than the DSiXL unit- The menu navigations are good but the three buttons do take some getting used to- The stylus feels classy and I love the adjustability of it - very nice for all types of handsThere are many other benefits to this system and my fellow reviewer's have covered most of them. I myself use the unit to play games - I typically don't take photo's or surf the web or do various other sort of extra things. Sleep mode would be a good example - where you can put your 3DS in sleep mode and it does various things. If you are interested in those then check out the excellent video reviews posted.However I have a caveat for anyone that suffers from migraine's or headaches. I played for an hour and a half in 3D last night and I had a massive migraine this morning. I felt the beginnings of a headache last night but I didn't expect to be hit with the whole light sensitive, nausea and vomiting, misery of this morning. So I searched the net to find out if that was a potential issue and sure enough it is. Does that mean I won't play my 3DS? Heck no but I've found some hints and helps I'm going to list here so anyone who is like me can make a informed purchase choice:- Really work the slider to find the exact sweet spot - you will know when it is not because it is blurry. If you find yourself seeing blurry for any length of time (several minutes) then turn the 3D off for a while to rest your eyes- Wear your glasses if they are designed for this distance- Play 3D and 2D varying between the two and pay close attention to any sort of nausea, dizziness, blurred vision, etc.- Do not let your child under 7 play this and with kids 7 and older I'd really watch them - Nintendo has stated this 3D is not recommended for children's eyes that are not yet developed- Take frequent breaks and allow your eyes to do other things at different focus levels. So don't go, for example, from playing to reading which is usually about the same distance field. Try for shifts so that your eyes can focus at different levels and distances.I'm not negging on the system - because I am sure this effect of headaches will probably only affect a small percentage of the population. However when you are one of those few and realize your beloved new unit actually causes pain and misery - well you want to be sure that you do what you can to make sure others' don't suffer needlessly.Overall I am most impressed by this unit. I think it is a fantastic step for Nintendo who continue to break new ground with their products, and I can recommend it to adults and older children. I don't use the camera so I cannot comment on that. Of course the battery life is less - which is a bummer but much has been made of it already. I will update my review if I learn more on the headache issue and how to combat it or any further tips in that direction. The reason for the 4 stars is because I wish more had been made of the potential headache issue by Nintendo - I don't recall reading much research and, for those of us who are prone to this sort of thing, it would have been nicer to see this tested more thoroughly or if they did test it to release the results.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2011"}

The buttons are laid out well and easy to manipulate while the headset is on your head(+) The sound quality is very high, especially for a headset in this price range. The virtual 7.1 surround sound works amazingly well with bluray movies and games, providing a cheap and immersive experience - especially if you do not want to invest in a pricey sound system for your home. The overall audio quality is far superior to any other $100-$150 headset I've tried, but still below \"high end\" products. Note: the 7.1 surround only works with a PS3 or PS4, it is not supported when using this with a PC - for good reason, because your PC hardware and playback software may not support it(+) The hidden microphone is precise and clear. PSN friends mentioned how crisp I sounded, with no interference or accidental vocalizations(+) No hassle setup on PS4 or PC: just plug in the dongle and turn on the headsets(+) Quality fabrication for $100. Nothing remarkable, but it certainly doesn't feel cheap and seems like it will last. It folds up nicely for storage and features removable cover plates for customization(+) The ability to upload custom sound profiles using the companion app is a nice addition.

{"product_name":"B00008KTNW","reviewerName":"Kurt Angle fan \"Chris\"","summary":"NINJA GAIDAN","reviewText":"I've read EVERY review of amazon and I am going to mention the &quot;CONS&quot;DIFFICULTY - Normal is the lowest difficulty and it's perfect for me for a month of owning the game. People who say this is hard and have been playing games for 5 or more years and took 30 goes to beat the first boss are bad at games or this genre. The only help I got from this game is reading the \"be like a ninja and act like one by being fast\". There are ninjas that throw incerdintiary shuricans(that explode), soldiers that have rocket launchers and more enemies that will stress casual gamers.CAMERA - If you played DEVIL MAY CRY 1(fine camera)/STARWARS JEDI POWERBATTLES(worst camera ever when platform jumping)this will be easy to get used to. The camera rareley goes far to down on Ryo(it does it when going down stairs). It's a fast paced game so it would have been a bad idea to manually use the camera. Use the RIGHT TRIGGOR.REPETETIVE - People need to stop this because it'll take 50 years to make a non repetetive game. I think NINJA GAIDAN took 6 years to make. It's like saying TOP SPIN is repetetive because you just play tennis and PROJECT GOTHAM is because you drive. In this you wall jump, wind jump, bird jump, throw shuricuns, power attack, use ninpo, go into first person view, look for scarabs, play original ninja gaidan, face bosses, face bosses, have two throw attacks, many attacks of different weapons you can swim and more. Now that proves NINJA GAIDAN is not repetetive.RESPAWNING ENEMIES - They rareley respawnReviewers say having quick attack and interact at the same time is bad, this is bad for some because if you defeat 10 enemies you might walk through a door by accident and have to face them again but you can run away from enemies.SAVE POINTS - There're NOTHING wrong with the save points(apart from last chapter). Do people know that you can use them more than once.  Before a tank boss there is a save point that some will miss and when they die they do 20 mins of game play, you have to explore the levels and not rush.IT'S LINIER - That doesn't matter because people would be complaining about getting lost if it wasn't linier. Would anyone care if the jurney is great. I hate it in games if there're 3 routes to choose from and your're worried that there might be a secret.....NOT BEING ABLE TO QUIT - Push START and SELECT simultaniously for 2 secsGOING THROUGH SAME LEVELS AGAIN - This is like HALO(Asault on the control room) and DEVIL MAY CRY. The levels connect together better than Halo and as good or better than DEVIL MAY CRY. Different things happen such as having to swim instead of going on land, different enemies, graphics and a new rought is different sometimes. Whoever designed the layout of levels are clever.SHOPS ARE FAR AWAY FROM BOSSES - Reviewers said when facing a boss called ALMA for the first time they were low on health and it's hard to beat that b~tch.  What I DO IS IF I LOOSE  6 health potions in a battle I start it again to do better then I can face bosses with a fair amount(I used to perfect my stealth skills on SPLINTER CELL).Just like HALO/GRAND THEFT AUTO this game game doesn't get boring quickly.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2004"}

Rhodes","summary":"When the Galaxy Needs a Hero","reviewText":"Ratchet and Clank started things off with a bang on the Playstation 2.  Becoming a huge seller on the Playstation 2 by offering some dynamic platforming, weapons combat and puzzles.  When the Playstation 3 dropped down Insomniac games shifted focus from Ratchet and Clank and first gave us Resistance: Fall of Man.  A year into the PS3's life, however, and Insomniac Game brought back Ratchet and Clank with a whole new story and adventure.  Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction may be the best one in the series.Things are looking normal for our heroes who have saved the galaxy countless times.  Ratchet and Clank are just fixing a vehicle when they get a call from the Planetary Defense Center.  The city of Metropolis is under attack by an army that is being led by the evil Emperor Tachyon.  He's come to Metropolis for only one reason: To find and eradicate Ratchet--the last of the Lombax species.  And he's willing to level entire cities to do it.  Once Ratchet and Clank barely escape their quest takes them across the galaxy looking for the secrets of the past.  Why does Tachyon want to eliminate the Lombaxes?  And what was the Lombax secret?  The story, by all accounts, is much more heavily character focused than the other games which came before it.  In particular, you'll learn a lot more about Ratchet than you have in other games.  It makes for a more personal story and it's an exciting one.  It's filled with familiar characters and a few new ones.  It's also humorous in every way but also much more mature than most people really give it credit for.  There's a lot more heart in this story and makes a much more distinct connection with its characters.That being said, the only real issue with the story is that Tachyon just isn't an interesting character.  This is especially sad considering how present Dr. Nefarious was in Up Your Arsenal.  You'll rarely see what's going on for Tachyon or what he's doing.  He doesn't quite feel as absent as Drek does in the first one, but you rarely get the sense that Tachyon is really doing anything.  In some ways that's perfectly fine as the story going on with Ratchet and Clank is ultimately more satisfying and interesting than any game in the series thus far.  It more than makes up for the lack of focus on Tachyon because it keeps the focus on the main characters and really developing them.  It makes the story by far the most rewarding in the series.Ratchet and Clank has had a familiar formula for years and that doesn't change with Tools of Destruction.  Those familiar with any of the other games in the series will know what to expect.  There's a lot of running, jumping and blowing things up.  You'll find yourself collecting bolts aplenty to buy new weapons and armor.  There's not much here you haven't seen.  The weapons are certainly very fascinating, however.  There are some nice things here such as the new Tornado Launcher or being able to place down a swarm that will kill off the bad guys.  Like Up Your Arsenal each weapon is constantly leveling up.  What's new, however, is that you will not just gain bolts but Raritanium.  While Raritanium is nothing new to Ratchet and Clank, here it's actually used to purchase perks for your weapons such as more ammo, longer range or more power.  Each weapon also has a master perk that adds a new element.  For instance, the Fusion Bomb will have a master upgrade that allows each bomb to explode into a smaller set of bombs that may damage other enemies in the area.  Each weapon goes through five levels and once they hit level five they change into a totally different weapon.There are other editions, however.  You not only have weapons, but also devices that aren't always weapons but rather just things to help distract enemies.  The devices are usually independent of Ratchet.  For instance, you can use the Groovitron to make enemies dance in place, or use a Leech Bomb to drain their health.  You might not always need devices, but they add variety to the game.There is also a lot of space combat where you'll fly on rails and aim at various targets.  Usually these segments end with a boss fight as well.  None of these moments are challenging, however.  Which may be something about the game overall.  The first three Ratchet and Clank games were quite the challenge from time to time but Future: Tools if Destruction is a relatively simple game by comparison.  Your nanotech increases a lot easier than it did in the previous games.  But the most strange thing is that you'll rarely (if ever) find yourself short on bolts.  In previous games, grinding for bolts was a must, but in Future: Tools of Destruction you'll find you almost always have the right number of bolts.  And if you don't, it's never detrimental to buy a new weapon as your old ones will level up quite quickly and never be useless.  Your default weapons will still be enough to hold you over at the end.  But even then, you'll end up getting enough bolts almost purely by accident.  Bolts are everywhere, in large quantities and never stop coming.  You'll also find jackpot crates that double bolts.  Even if you manage to be having some trouble in Future: Tools of Destruction your nanotech will increase enough times that you'll eventually be able to dominate your foes purely based off the fact that you have too much health to be taken down.That's not to say it doesn't have its challenging moments.  It's only to say that eventually you'll succeed because the game has fewer limitations than previous games.  Your health is always restored when you go to a weapon shop, for instance, and sometimes there's one sitting right next to you in major battles.At the very least Future: Tools of Destruction does have some well designed areas, although it's a lot more linear than the other games.  For instance, in previous games you had various paths you could take the moment you touched down, but Future: Tools of Destruction is much more about making sure you progress through the games story.  Meaning that instead of being able to start off by going down three different paths only to find easy shortcuts back to your ship, you often only have one path to take to your next goal, which is never a mystery to you.  That's okay by me, as many of the game's locales are absolutely huge and populated with plenty of things to do such as puzzles, enemies aplenty and gold bolts to collect off the beaten path.  The feeling of exploration is still there, it's just that the various \"missions\" can't be done in nearly any order like previous games.Production wise, Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction may be the best the PS3 has to offer.  Despite originally releasing in 2007, the game still looks a lot better than you'd expect it to.  The cartoon like quality really helps a lot of the characters pop with detail.  It also helps that so much of the environments are colorful.  There's a lot of life in Ratchet and Clank and that really helps the game seem much bigger and more epic than it actually is.  In particular, the game's opening moments in Metropolis are some of the most amazing you'll see in the series.  But perhaps the most amazing thing is how well animated everything is in the game's various pre-rendered cutscenes or even in game.  There's a lot of detail and a lot of chaos that can go on.  And it rarely slows down when things happen such as enemies populating the screen or bolts flying around everywhere.The only real hiccup is that while the in game engine never buckles, the pre-rendered cutscenes sometimes do.  Sometimes the audio gets a little wonky and the actual speech doesn't match up with the lip movements.  This is actually rather sad as the voice acting and writing you see here is some of the best in the series.  So when a pre-rendered scene starts to buckle it's a little sad.  The animations and voice acting aren't just some of the best in the series, but some of the best I've ever seen of any game.Musically, Future: Tools of Destruction may have the best music in the series.  It's not quite as \"mechanical\" as some of the other tunes, but there are moments that much more emotionally investing and moments where the music really compliments the environments a lot.  It's a pretty amazing soundtrack overall, topped off by some fantastic sound effects.  Everything about the production values comes forth to make a really solid package.  One of the best uses of technology on the system you're likely to see.  If anything, the game is always running A LOT of things, making me wish that it could be installed instead of everything always constantly being read from the disk.  It's quite clear Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction is running A LOT of stuff and you'll hear it reading from the disc constantly.Overall, Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction is one of the best in the series.  It's got such an engrossing story and gameplay that's it's hard not to like it.  It's an ambitious game technologically that really showcases--even now--just what video games can be with the right art design and graphical prowess in place.  If you're a fan of Ratchet and Clank then Future: Tools of Destruction should not be missed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2012"}

Leading up to the PS4's launch, the graphics that were displayed in Killzone: Shadow Fall pushed me over the edge to go ahead and purchase the PS4. In addition to really enjoying both Killzone 2 and 3, it seemed like a more beautiful take on the Killzone universe.Sadly, it was all show and no go. Once I started playing, the hype instantly deflated. Killzone: Shadow Fall is, quite frankly, an awful, awful game.From the outside looking in, as a spectator, surely it looks like a competently made game, but it's really not. Other than the graphics, Killzone: Shadow Fall is a hodgepodge of bad design decisions. Level design ranges from mediocre to downright atrocious, enemy encounters aren't all that exciting, characters aren't memorable, story is completely throwaway, and the whole thing lacks something; it's a game that feels completely hollow, devoid of anything great.Worst of all, it's a very boring game from beginning to end, which may be the worst thing one could say about a video game.As for multiplayer, it's almost entirely dead at this point, and I can't blame anyone for not sticking around.I hate that I have to hate Killzone: Shadow Fall, but sometimes it's so much easier to hate than to love, and my oh my, Killzone: Shadow Fall is one easy game to hate.2/5Pros:GraphicsCons:Everything else","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2014"}

Note: you don't have to use VATS and you can always play the game as a FPS style like Halo.- Perks are abilities you earn within the game to give you different an useful abilities, they range from perks which can raise stats in different areas to ones that give special unique abilities like night vision and stealth running.GAME IT'S MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion (Xbox 360/PS3/PC)- Fallout 2 (PC)- Bioshock (Xbox 360/PS3/PC)- Fable 2 (Xbox 360)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- By killing your enemies in VATS you get to see them die in a much more gory way.- You can have a few Companions follow and help you in the game one of which is a Dog called Dog Meat, note you must meet these Companions in the game first and ask them to help you.- Your good and bad choices are tracked in game by a Karma system that will have some affect on your game. Example: certain missions will only open up when you have good/bad Karma and some dialogue with in game characters will be different depending on your Karma, and Karma affects the ending of the game (which there are many different endings).- In the limited collector's edition you can get an art book as well as a `making of\" DVD a soundtrack and a Pip boy bobble head (its cute).- Some limited collector's editions of this game (that can be found on Amazon) will give you a real to life replica of the Pip Boy 3000 to be used as a Bedside alarm clock.- There are many downloads for this game on Xbox Live Marketplace, all which expand the world and gameplay of Fallout 3. The download packs are: Operation Anchorage, The Pitt, Broken Steel, Point Lookout, and Mothership Zeta.- This game is also for the PC and PS3 (although the PS3 version has no option to download content - but getting the Game of the Year version gives you access to Operation Anchorage, The Pitt, and Broken Steel for PS3).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2009"}

For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"Sylph StarWind \"sylphstarwind35\"","summary":"Awesome (read the book too)","reviewText":"I really like this game. I think it has the most difference from the original. It looks great, with the environments matching those in Silent Hill. But since there isn't blood everywhere, you can see a little better. The camera angles are annoying sometimes, and it's especially confusing in the beginning. It's tough to control, because you turn as slowly as the zombies and you can't really control the gun. It would be nice if you could blow off zombie heads by pointing the gun up just a little, but you can't. There are weapons that shoot off their heads anyway, like the Magnum. And if you use the shotgun right, you can use that to do it, too. There are no good melee weapons, and you'd get killed trying to kill much with the knife. The voice acting was alright, and I had sympathy for some of the characters. There is some replay value because there are different difficulties, such as invisible enemy and real survivor.

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Scott Peterson \"I.T.

I have to say I am pleased that somebody finally did an open world game based in the old west. The scenery is simply breathtaking, as is the audio. From bullet richochets to some awe-inspring thunder, the game really delivers on those levels. The graphics are great aside from a few small things. For example, hair and beards look terrible, but otherwise its very pleasing.I like the main character. Being a Rockstar game, I really expected them to make him a total cliche, but he is actually a personable chap.I haven't quite finished the game yet, but the length seems to be pretty good and the multiplayer options are pretty nice, although I would have liked to see them tied to the single player game a bit more. You end up doing the same things over again in multiplayer for your challenges, but not a big deal.The Cons:Some graphical glitches and freezes.Poor autosave feature.I would also have liked it to be more of an RPG in terms of being able to \"build\" your character. There is no leveling of any kind, and no way to make build your character around your style of play.Quests seem pretty few and far between for the first half of the game, but after you hit Mexico they really pick up.Lack of instruction on many things. Dueling is one example.The way that they kick the game off was pretty, well, stupid. Marston goes to the fort and tries to get the guy to turn himself in. Fair enough...but when the guy says NO, Marston casually goes for his gun and gets shot. If our hero is really that stupid, perhaps he shouldn't be our hero?Quests seem very disconnected and random. Its not a huge deal, but after playing some of the other RPG's like Mass Effect 2 and Dragon Age, it really made it stand out.One other complaint I have is the \"bounty\" feature in multiplayer. There is no progression of effort to take your character down like we saw with the GTA series. For example, it doesn't matter if you have a bounty of $20 or $2,000, they really don't try any harder to take you out. Also, when you are in a posse, your bounties go up individually rather than collectively, which I found odd. So if you have a big posse of 8 buddies and you want to hit the $5,000 mark, you are in a for a very long wait because you all have to share the guys they send at you, which like I said never increases.Enemy AI is laughable sometimes, especially in multiplayer. The idiot enemies will pile up outside the wall of a town and just sit there like morons.Overall a great game that was a long time coming and I applaud Rockstar for doing it. With a few tweaks on the next installment they will truly have a legendary game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2010"}

Especially Tekken...and sometimes Street Fighter. So I was psyched there would be a crossover game between the two. With 38 fighters and a dozen more for dlc. So i got the game. Its good but the game has its flaws... A lot of them.Despite there are 38 fighters, do to it being specific for tag teams. Only pre exisiting teams have endings with the exception of the final bosses and one ordinary ending if you use a made up team. So a total of 21 endings in all. Which is fine but enough endings.  But each of the teams have their own intro video explaining why they teamed, a rivalary video, and the ending. The story is ok at best. An object falls from space that has magical properties called Pandora, and now everyone wants to use it for good, evil or stop it.A really annoying thing is, when playing arcade, your matches will be interupted by people who want to play you online. Your match will end and it will take you directly online to accept or decline. If you decline or after the match ends, you are taking back to the last part you left off. Its annoying if you are about to win or trying to watch a cutscene. This will happen if you have internet or do t turn that off.Now if you are a newbie, expect to get your butt kicked online or on hard difficulty. But there are modes to help you get better like turtoil and practice.Now this game does Street Fighter justice but I cant say the same for Tekken. Dont expect to play 1on1 matches, no matter the mode its tag team. Also unlike most tag games, if one of the fighters gets KO'ed, that team loses no matter how much energy the other has. Also their is a gem system where you can increase a certain attribute of a fighter.Despite the flaws, its a fun game. Im getting the hang of the gameplay after doing the turtoils. Ive learned to turn off the battle requests. If you love Street Fighter get this. If you love Tekken consider this or wait. There are plans to release a simular game but more for Tekken fans, in another words the other way around.Pros:-38 fights (19 from each game)-All of the 18 set fighters each have an intro, rival and endimg videos-Turtoils, and training modes help newbies get good-Great for Street Fighter fans gameplay wise-12 dlcCons:-Despite 38 fighters there are only 21 different endings-If you forget to turn if off, your arcade matches will be interupted by people wanting to play you.-The gameplay is so complex that newbies will get their butts kicked online-Ok storyline-Doesnt feel like a Tekken game-No one on one matchesNeutral:-Only 1 fighter needs to be kO'ed to win or loose-the gem system-A different version thats makes the game more for Tekken fans","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2012"}

As one of five distinct character types, players explore the world ofDiablo II, journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed. Diablo, lord of terror and youngest of the three prime evils, awakes from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo takes control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within. The hero doesn't realize that his selfless act will not only ensure Diablo's victory, but will also irrevocably damn his soul for all time.","reviewerName":"Michael Newberg","summary":"Wow, was I wrong!","reviewText":"A while back, I did a review of this game.

Black Ops II is simply not fun to me.","reviewText":"As a veteran FPS gamer, I never really felt compelled to play any COD title. In the past, I've played several iterations on different platforms and always felt those games were just middle of the pack. Nothing special but not terrible either. That said, since I missed the last few COD releases and the multiplayer options have grown, I figured I'll jump back in with Black Ops II and see how the game has progressed.After a few weeks of playing campaign and multiplayer, I'm even more unimpressed than ever. Here's why:CAMPAIGN- In most games, I like variety. For example, in Halo, you know how fun it is when you hop in a Scorpion or Mantis, right? I don't feel this way at all. The vehicles, the strategic elements, horseback riding, etc... the play isn't all the great and for this game, I'd actually dread those moments.- The shooting isn't very precise.- The story is subpar, as if it was written by a pre-teen.- The breadth of maps is nice but many are missing depth. Just not a very vast world.MULTIPLAYER- Generally harder to tell the difference between your teammates and the enemy than most other PVP games.- Maps are average. None of them stand out to me as incredibly well-designed.- Audio realism is terrible. Why can't I hear a guy carrying 40 pounds of guns and ammo running up behind me.- There are more idiots here than any other game I can think of. I can only play with headphones.The bottom line is, I expected evolution but all I got was a rehashed game that is simply not all that fun.

You interact with NPCs that provide you with a different variety of quest types etc, so leveling is pretty seemless. Going from 1-60 can be done totally solo with little difficulty and a maximum amount of enjoyment. Essentially WoW before 60 is comparable to something like Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. The downside is once you reach 60 the scope of progression in the game changes. You are 60, you don't have to level anymore and there are no AA points to get. The only thing you will be doing solo is faction farming for Argent Dawn, etc..or killing guys in a certain area to get a rare drop (Like the Dwarven Hand Cannon for hunters). There are group level instances before 60 which you do need groups for, but generally you can gimpify them by being 5-10 levels above it. Once you reach 60 the content left for you is completing the high level instances (on a side note all the instances are very well done and fun). You can't gimpify them by being a higher level and you need a full group of 5 people which you can pretty much mix and match and don't need a perfect group but they do need to be people that can play good together.Eventually those pan out and your instances are complete or you run through them more times to help friends or obtain loot. After that it's raiding, and if you think there are no timesinks in WoW like there are in EQ....bzzzt...wrong. For example, keying up for Onyx's lair is a huge undertaking, requiring hitting the same \"zones\" a lot of times to get keyed.The downsides and difficulties of WoW are the fact that it plays like Morrowind until you hit 60 then it's a culture shock where you have to change gears from a solo/duo mentality to becoming more focused on grouping. I have mixed feelings here. Compared to EQ..leveling is fun and enjoyable without having to sit in one spot looking for a group/getting one together and kill the same 20 things over and over to ding but the upside to this is you have to group where you will meet people and it prepares you for the endgame, making connections to tackle raiding. So in WoW, unless you have a group of people that you know and communicate with before hitting 60 then troubles will hit you as the \"shock\" hits you. It's like \"hmm no more quests and i need 4 people to do BRD or BRS\". When WoW was first out there was virtually nobody looking for groups. Now that WoW has been out for awhile, there are hundreds of people in town and LFG channels trying to make connections to group.There is also the people playing, which is a HUGE factor in any MMORPG. What type of people are playing? Final Fantasy Online as well as Lineage's gameplay appealed to many Western Gamers but the community aspect wasn't there for them simply because it was primarily Asian..and Americans are not notorious for knowing more than one language...just for speaking louder so maybe a non-American will understand you.Well for WoW, there is a big population of the Battle.Net mouseclickatmach5 kiddies from the Warcraft and Starcraft RTS games. They are generally very young and annoying as hell. There was a similiar population when EQ first came out, but they filtered out faster in EQ simply because even at the low levels...EQ takes a lot more dedication and attention to progress. It will take much longer for them to filter out as they realize there is a lot of depth in completing high end raiding content, that you can't just click/drag and attack something to win. Additionally, being loud, obnoxious and retarded does not endear people to working with you to group or raid. However, on the pure PVP servers the population will be slightly different imo due to the fact that there are people that can sit for hours each day and PK until their eyeballs fall out and that is fun for em.The major upside that EQ has over every other MMORPG which will generally draw people back is....well, the people. People make the MMORPG whether it's the drama of their interaction or the friendships you make. Even the despised people of EQ servers play because they are still interacting with someone albiet not on the best terms, but there are people who enjoy tormenting others to rectify some problem they have in reality or getting attention of some form. Who knows really...what is fun for one person, won't be for another.The primary point is that in EQ you have communites of people that are for the most part, intelligent and mature that can work together to some degree to accomplish bigger things having some type of fun. WoW and EQ2 are developing their playerbase and may reach that point, or may not. It will take another 4-6 months imo to see what happens on the WOW/EQ2 servers to see if they can reach the ability to establish, entertain and maintain a long standing community which EQ has done fairly successfully for years.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2005"}

{"product_name":"B002BRZ6UE","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"Crysis 2 brings \"Maximum\" Gameplay to the table...","reviewText":"Crysis 2 is a game that I am sure many people were anticipating, and also skeptical about.  While the first game had some hard core graphics it clearly was more of a visual benchmark than game at times.  Going forward Crytek has made some changes to the formula, most for the better, and produced a high quality game that will not disappoint both fans of the original Crysis and FPS gamers in general.GAMEPLAY - Single playerRight off the bat Crysis 2 doesn't hold much back.  The campaign starts quickly and holds its pace fairly well throughout the near 12 hour SP campaign.  If you played the MP Demo for Crysis 2 you will feel right at home with what changes have been made to the suit controls, as well as what to expect visually from the game and the AI itself.  This game comes across as a solid shooter.  During the campaign you will have many tools at your disposal to dispatch your foes including a variety of weapons, suit powers, environment items etc.  The suit powers are very stream-line on the console version, having been mapped to your controller.  Running automatically enables speed, while thumb buttons controlled the Armor and Stealth.  You have the ability to customize your weapons load-out via unlocking mods you find throughout the campaign as well as upgrading your suit via contact with Alien DNA.What impressed me the most about Crysis 2 was not actually the graphics, but the thought put into the gameplay. While enemy AI can be pretty stupid at times (I played on SOLDIER difficulty) the game gives you plenty of methods in which to tackle areas.  You could stealth past everyone; stealth assassinate everyone; RAMBO your way though; use strength to toss enemies about or perhaps pick up an object and smash em with it.  While the campaign has a typical \"Linear\" aspect to it, the variety at your disposal makes tackling the areas feel fresh each time and just a blast to change up your gameplay style.Multi-Player: I have not tackled MP that much but from what I've played, expect your typical formula for MP in Crysis 2.  If you played the MP demo then you would have an idea what to expect really.  What I did like was the \"custom class\" concept where as using your unlocks you can create a unique build for Multi-Player.  A nice little concept that keeps the MP feeling fresh I think.STORY/SOUNDOkay.. this is Crysis we're talking about so don't expect a riveting storyline like RPGs might bring to the table.  The storyline isn't bad though as you could tell there was an effort put in to make a normal storyline here; It kind of is just enough to keep you occupied during cut-scenes and give you a good reason to go forward essentially.  ** SOUND in this game is just awesome!  I thought Killzone 3 had some wild sound effects, Crysis 2 pretty much takes the cake!  The weapon sound effects are very quality, including the nice echo effects when firing rounds off in an open quiet area.  The voice acting is 'average' I'd say. Not bad but not award winning acting either. The sound track this game has is mind blowing!!  The tracks are very epic and will have your blood pumping from start to finish with how good the music sets the tone.GRAPHICSThe graphics are stunning especially for a console game.  Are they the best...hard to tell but then again I really have not seen a game best this game graphically. On the PC however this game is just insane.  Running it at 1920x1080 w/ full setting will just blow your mind.  Once you see it on the PC it becomes quite obvious that the console versions had stuff held back.  Even with the graphics toned down they still do look great, but there are some small hickups.  I found a few times the frame-rate chugged a little bit in high volume areas especially with fires or explosions.  There is also some texture flickering going on in certain spots that are hard to ignore, also accompanied by texture pop-ins.  For the graphical level this game pumps out I am not surprised though, especially once you see how large some areas can be.  The alien design this time around I enjoyed. They had a lot more detail put into them and a better variety as well.REPLAY/LENGTHFor the campaign, on soldier difficulty, it took me about 10-11 hours to complete.  I was not rushing though the game and I mixed it up between stealth and Rambo style.  I could see this campaign being about 11-13 hrs for people who LOVE stealth killing, or as short as 8 hours if you simply run past certain areas without bothering to fight.  This puts the Length of the game at a decent length.  There is plenty going on in the campaign and I could find myself playing through the campaign a few times more as the gameplay really lends itself to creativity/variety (a bit like Bulletstorm just without the Skill-Shot system).  Throw in some decent MP that has some longevity to it and you got yourself a game that could easily last you well until the next big shooter hits the market.OVERALL (93% 9.3/A-)I gotta say this game is just the complete package.  Having played Bulletstorm, Killzone 3 and Crysis 2 there is a clear line between all three games.  Crysis 2 for me, falls in the category of a fantastic, long SP campaign with a solid MP setup.  The gameplay has great variety to it and, in my opinion, worth revisiting a few times.  The multi-player is quality, clearly not just *tacked on*, and it brings a lot of fun to the table making for even more variety in the game itself.  I give Crysis 2 a 93%... It is a game well worth playing and adding to your FPS collection**NOTE: Killzone 3 and Crysis 2 are both fantastic games. I scored KZ3 a 91%.  While I feel Killzone 3 has a better overall MP element (for the PS3), Crysis 2 feels like a more complete package due to a better SP-Campaign(in my opinion).  Graphically I feel Crysis 2 is better but also contains more graphical glitching**NOTE: The PS3 version ran almost flawless for me (except for rare FPS drops and the graphical hick-ups).  I wouldn't worry to much about performance when it comes to 360 vs PS3. Get the game on whichever system you feel more comfortable with.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2011"}

Danzig","summary":"Best GT To Date","reviewText":"As others have pointed out, there's nothing revolutionary about GT4 compared to the previous games in the series.  Still it's an excellent evolution of the best driving simulator available, and the game probably gives you more for your money than any other title available for the PS2 or any other console either.  The handling is spot-on, and the graphics are so awesome (almost photo realistic), that it's hard sometimes to keep your mind on the race when you see individuals in the crowd of spectators moving -- or even stepping out in the road in front of you and taking your photo!  (Fortunately, they jump out of the way in time as you zoom through at 100 mph!)  This game is truly a car nut's dream, with some 600 models to choose from, including pick-ups and classics.  I've had the game for a week now, and I've just barely skimmed the surface of all the cars to try and courses to race.  Last night I tried dirt racing for the first time, including a course on the edge of the Grand Canyon, and again the graphics were so mind-blowing I felt as if I had taken a mini-vacation to that beautiful spot.  Other scenic spots include Tahiti, Paris, the Alps -- the list goes on and on.  As some reviewers have mentioned, it takes a while to appreciate the full appeal and value of this game; your first used car isn't very fast out of the gate, and you have to win some races to earn the cash to upgrade horsepower and handling.  Then comes the moment when you win your first tricked-out race car -- in my case, a souped-up red Nissan called a Nismo packing some serious ponies under the hood.  Whoo hoo!!!  Sure, there are plenty of things to nitpick, from the crappy music (not unusual in racing games -- I just turn it off)to the less-than-brilliant AI of your opponents.  But these and other shortcomings are minor compared to the pleasures derived from the MONTHS of vehicular activity that await you.  As another reviewer noted, this is a game that will keep you up past your bedtime and stay in your mind when you probably should be thinking of other things (like trying to earn a living in this wretched Bushist economy).

{"product_name":"B003O6E620","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"Signatures are onerous.\"","summary":"A Bare-Bones, Multiplayer Approach Leaves Single Players in the Cold","reviewText":"With All For One, the series abandons its single-player roots and shoots for multiplayer action. You can play the game by yourself if you want, but the experience is definitely lacking. It's odd to play through a level with only Ratchet and an AI-controlled Clank and then in the ensuing cutscene see Qwark and Dr. Nefarious standing next to you as if they had been by your side the whole time. It's clear the game wasn't intended as merely a two or three player game: in order to get the \"full effect\", there should be four players. This is asking a bunch, for a couple of reasons: one, not everyone has three friends they can play with; and two, the many problems and glitches in Sony's online network make playing online impossible for some people. For example, I have a fast internet connection and all my devices work fine on it except my PS3, which for some odd reason gets extremely slow download speeds. It's so slow that there's no way I could play All For One online--the server would laugh in my face before I even got to the create-game screen.Multiplayer issues aside, All For One is disappointing also for its bare-bones approach. Whereas previous games in the series were filled out with a rich story and multiple cutscenes, All For One shakes things down to simply \"creating\" a game and getting into the multiplayer action.  The game's menu support system has also been drastically cut down. Forget about rereading all those help desk messages, move descriptions, item explanations, and the like. Nothing of the sort is offered in All For One.The game is simply about four people running around causing chaos and mayhem: that's it. Even the weapons are all just rehashses of previous weapons in the series. There's no sense of excitement when you obtain a new one, because you've had it before in previous games.There is also no real sense of challenge in the game. Even on Hard difficulty, the game is mind-numbingly easy. Die and you simply respawn right where you were.  Enemy design and variation are disappointing. Even the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense. In all the other Ratchet and Clank titles, there is at least one interesting female character that plays a major or semi-major role. In All for One, the feminine gender is conspicuously absent, except for the presence of a little girl named Susie who instantly wins your heart.The AI-controlled Clank for the single player game is one of the worst AIs I've ever seen in a game. He is just so completely stupid. He constantly falls off ledges or into environmental hazards, and during the mini-games in which you attempt to unlock pieces of the RYNO armor by way of teamwork, he sometimes will not do what is required of him.What it comes down to is that if you're looking for a great single player game, stick with Crack in Time or Tools of Destruction. All For One offers an entirely different experience, one that will be a disappointing one for many players.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2012"}

I've been a fan of Crash Bandicoot, and actually it was that series that compelled me to choose a PlayStation over a Saturn (thank goodness), so I quickly became of fan of platforming games. Not to mention that I loved Super Mario 64, but, since I didn't own an N64, I was forced to play it only when I visited my cousin's.One day, while browsing my local Blockbuster, my sister saw a cover with monkeys on it. With that and Rugrats, she checked out the counter with my selections, and we went home that day to play games. I don't remember what games I checked out (FFIX?), but Ape Escape was the one title we played together until we had to return it.Her following birthday, I bought it for her. You may think, \"Oh, that's nice,\" but I bought it because I actually wanted to play it...It was the first game I've ever completed in its entirety, and I go back from time to time to replay it, no matter how many times I've caught the monkeys. The sequels are good, but this stands out as the first game to fully require the DualShock controller, and the music in this installment is my favorite in the series.Monkeys have taken over different periods of history, and so it's your job to catch them all and bring down the leader. You get helpful gadgetry along the way, and they're all extremely useful and you'll find yourself using them all to the very end. Sometimes some games give you arsenals that become obsolete a few levels later; not here. Every level can use all your tools.The boss fights are sparse, but the final boss more than makes up for it. It remains one of my most favorite boss battles, though, by today's standards, it's pretty easy.I write this review only a couple weeks after my latest playthrough, and the game still holds up extremely well. I thought that, with my years of gaming experience, catching the monkeys would be a lot easier. While I know most of the game's secrets, and the easier levels were far easier than before, the monkeys still prove a challenge to capture. The patterns for boss fights are easy to get down, and I experienced no degradation in my original copy of the game when playing on a PS3.This game should be a requirement for all PlayStation owners.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2014"}

The real tragedy is that with a bit more playtesting and polish this could have been a good game.  However, someone thought that frustrating, repetitive gameplay might be fun.On the good side, the game looks nice for a 5-year-old PS2 game. The ship-to-ship battles are actually fun in an arcadey kind of way, There are a good number of missions (20), and the skirmish mode is okay for a little while. The campaign story was all over the place and didn't make sense in some instances. But there was a good spread of enemies and missions over the various eras, and you get to fly the different Federation ships. I even liked the music, and they got William Shatner to narrate the mission intros.Now, the bad parts.  Where to start? Many of the missions are very frustrating.  Even the tutorial missions (yeah, the one with the rings) are super annoying. The average player will end up redoing some mission objectives dozens of times before successfully completing them. And generally it's the same kind of bad missions: fly through these rings, follow those warp trails, escort that weak ship, beat the timer, wash, rinse & repeat. It's just poor level design and really should not have passed the quality-control people at Besthesda.  The game becomes a chore really quickly, and I found that I could only take it in small doses before playing something else.  It's really a shame, since the Star Trek license should be a good starting point for coming up with decent games.  I really do hope that Bethesda has given up the license.  They have thoroughly abused it with games like Encounters and Star Trek: Legacy (Star Trek: Conquest is pretty good, though simplistic).One major warning: If you have an older PS2 like me, there is a good chance that you will not even be able to play this game out of the box. For some silly reason, the game is on a cd instead of a dvd. I got it to run by tweaking my PS2, which required opening it up and adjusting the spindel that controls the height of the disk.

C. Orr","summary":"Fun, But Offers Nothing New","reviewText":"When \"Resident Evil 4\" appeared in 2004, first on the Gamecube and then on the PlayStation 2, it was a miracle of reinvention for a series badly in need of one.  The over-the-shoulder view replaced the isometric backdrop of the previous games, but the new format retained enough of the old flavour -and not to mention control scheme- to make it feel like a classic Resi game.  \"Resident Evil 5\" is simply an expertly-made, online-enabled and often lushly-presented continuation of this trend,.  Although this really comes as no surprise, the series is starting to show its age, and Resi 5 should be seen as an action game for Resi fans rather than the new, younger breed of game fans raised on titles such as \"Gears Of War\" 1 and 2, and first-person shooters.Resi 5 is what you would expect from a top-tier game made by Capcom: good graphical presentation, wonderful character animation in cut scenes, wooden characters, a story and dialogue that appears to have been written on a napkin in a  lunch break, predictable set-pieces and huge, ridiculous boss fights.  In short, a general air of competent, don't-wreck-a-selling-formaula malaise hangs over the whole production.The much-vaunted graphical rehash is pretty impressive, although the backgrounds still retain the pre-rendered vibe of classic Resident Evil games.  The detail, right from dust, detail on brickwork, lens flare and little bugs scurrying around the environments, to partner Sheva Alomar's bronzed skin and Chris Redfield's rippling biceps is impressive. However, the very contrasty colour palette remains a constant issue: dark colours constantly bleed into lighter colours, presumable in an effort to replicate the blinding, enervating sunlight of Africa.  There is also a nagging air of inconsistency and laziness in some of the presentation, compared to other stunning games I have played recently, such as \"Killzone 2\".One of the main selling points of the game is the presence of a partner.  While this wrecks any real sense of terror, it provides ample opportunity for an on- and offline co-op mode.  Co-op is tremendous fun, although the inability to trade weapons and ammo with online partners in real time is irritating.  Of course, this mode depends on the ability of the person you are playing with, but sometimes you will uncover a new approach to tackling a certain section or even using weapons in the game by watching your partner.However, the main issue with the game is simply the control scheme.  While Resi 4 could get away with continuing the ponderous and static turn-and-shoot model of the older games, Resi 5 is a next-gen game.  The generally good presentation only goes to highlight the absurdity of a supposedly tough, muscle-bound character being forced to fire weapons while standing still, then turn, run away to reload, and then repeat the process.  The absence of any reliable dodge technique being mapped permanently to a controller button and the still rather ponderous reactions of the controllable characters only add to the irritation.Perhaps the crux of the new game problem is this: as the game is no longer a survival horror game, with a fully-armed and very capable sidekick at your side virtually the whole time taking much of the horror out of the survival, the vulnerability that comes with this control scheme has disappeared.  The controls now seem slow rather than heightening any tension.\"Resident Evil 5\" is a very good addition to the Resident Evil canon.  It doesn't break any barriers down to those who have always hated Resi games, or to those raised on the run-and-gun masterworks of the last few years, such as the Gears Of War games.  And it certainly doesn't add more than expected to its illustrious predecessor.  Capcom doesn't care, because they have sold millions of units of the game already.  But perhaps this should mark the end of the tank-like control scheme so famous in Resi games.  Running and shooting?  Perhaps Chris, Sheva, et al. need to learn a little multitasking.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"Hendo","summary":"Solid Entry for Microsoft Into the Nex Gen Console War","reviewText":"This is a review in progress and will updated in often in the coming weeks.The good:1. The Kinect works much better than its predecessor.I've mostly only used the new Kinect for voice commands and facial recognition, and these things are a bigger emphasis than motion at least at this point. Voice commands work most of the time, and facial recognition is actually pretty cool. I like being logged in just by sitting down.The Kinect doesn't actually have true voice recognition. If two people who each have profiles sit down and one says \"Xbox Go Home\" it will take you to that person's profile. If the other says the same thing, it will take you to that person's profile. But this isn't because the Kinect recognizes your voice. It actually recognizes your face and can tell where your voice is coming from. Either way, it's a neat trick.Navigating menus with Kinect works pretty well most of the time, and being able to say \"Xbox Go Home\" and zip out of the game you're playing without losing a beat or having to pause is a pretty cool feature. You can also \"snap\" programs to the side of the screen so that you can have your game loading off to the side while you watch TV, or whatever other little multi-tasking thing it is you're doing. This is handy, but like so many of the Kinect voice features it's not necessary.2. The User Interface is very clean and accessible.At least, the Xbox One UI feels much simpler and easier to navigate than the bloated Xbox 360 UI. Actually, I think it's cleaner than the PS4 UI which relies far too heavily on social streams. Then again, I'm the type of gamer who really doesn't want to be bombarded by social media while I play games (or games while I play social media, for that matter.) But I still prefer the XMB system on the PS3 and PSP though - clean, simple, and it just worked.Of course, we'll have to see how the Xbox One UI evolves, and once ads start popping up I may change my mind. For now, the UI is broken down into three pieces: The \"pins\" on the left, the home screen in the center, and the store on the right. It's all neat and tidy, and the home screen shows your most recent activity which is convenient.3. The Xbox One has an OK lineup of games.I think the PS4 dropped the ball on launch titles. Microsoft has done a better job, bringing us games like Dead Rising 3 and Killer Instinct. Mind you, these are not terribly memorable or important games, but they're a better lineup than Sony's.4. Amazing, comfortable controller.Why fix something that isn't broken? I'm not sure the triggers work as well, and that's a problem, but the controller feels very at home in my hands. There's nothing revolutionary here, but the controller has a nice grip. There are also rumbles in the triggers themselves, and some games (such as the new Forza) take advantage of this new sensory input.I'm glad not too much was changed from what was already a perfectly fine controller. Sony needed to make major changes from the DualShock 3; Microsoft didn't for its Xbox One controller.What I don't like about the Xbox One so far:1. Kinect isn't perfect.It isn't perfect all of the time and it really needs to be. When it doesn't get the right voice command, it can be frustrating. Frustrating enough to turn your back on this newfangled thing and just use the buttons on the controller. This is the trick with Kinect: It can't be mostly good, it has to be always perfect. Until Microsoft gets it always perfect, it's still just a work in progress and we're all just beta testers.2. Load times are still a bit slow.I really wanted the next-generation of consoles to have no load times at all, ever, period. Being able to basically instantly resume games is a nice touch, but initial load times when starting a game are still longer than I'd hoped. This will most likely approve over time on the developer side once they begin to optimize games for the Xbox One.3. Graphics are okay but not great, at least not yet.Ryse: Son of Rome looks really good; Dead Rising 3 looks pretty good; Crimson Dragon looks terrible. The graphics on Xbox One are all over the map, and they aren't nearly the sort of generational leap many hoped for. I'm not a graphics nut, and when I want really spectacular graphics I play on my PC. And I also acknowledge that we're very early into this generation so games will continue to look better and better but--there's always a but--I still think Microsoft could have come out with a machine capable of putting out better looking games.These are good looking games, but not a huge leap from the best looking games on PS3 and Xbox 360. The last huge leap we saw in terms of graphics was when the Sega Dreamcast released, and blew everything currently out there away.4. The Xbox One has a huge foot print, and to top it off, there is a huge power brick that is necessary to power your Xbox One. How was Sony able to cram the thing into a PS4?Overall, I would give the Xbox One a 4 out of 5 stars. It's a solid system, especially since Microsoft reversed some of those ridiculous restrictions early on. Still lots of improvements and potential to be made with the Kinect.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game.

No other RPG has been able to hold a candle to the game on the Gameboy Advance. That is, until now. Course, it ain't no other series stealing its' crown...It's Golden Sun: The Lost Age. The second installment of the series which picks up mere moments after the first one ends.So, what can I say about Golden Sun: The Lost Age? Well, Let's see...For starters, it's a much deeper,  more involving RPG than its' forerunner and a more challenging game, overall. There's a new group of adventurers to control, mysterious new continents to explore, new magical attacks to master, and challenging new puzzles to figure out. If you didn't clear your data from the first game- you can even manage two groups in the game.The only downfall in the game is it looks, sounds, and plays almost identically to the first game. Considering how awesome the first game was, that's not a bad thing at all. Camelot is smart enough to know they shouldn't mess up a good thing. It's the story that matters in an RPG, anyways, and they definitely have an interesting one in the second installment.Personally, I think this is an awesome followup to the first game.

Rhodes","summary":"A great selection of games and all but its the system itself","reviewText":"The PS2 has incredibly good games and the biggest library of all the consoles but as my title says, it is the system itself that needs some help.  The PS2 requires more patience and you've got to do more to take care of it!What I'll start out with first are the graphics.  The PS2 came out in 2000 and for then these graphics are great! But you start to notice a few things.  The first being that the graphics are incredibly blocky when compared to that of the XBOX or Gamecube. They're not as smooth.  Not only that but the PS2 runs INCREDIBLY slow at times.  Some games you'll see it loading for quite some time.Second, the system isn't all its cracked up to be when taking care of it.  I've already had my PS2 break on me twice!  Apparently, Sony didn't tell people that putting it in the verticle stance could move your eye and damage your mother board.  Leave it in the horizontal position it's much safer that way. Also, you have to take your system in to get cleaned...A LOT. After a while the console will stop reading blue-disc and PSOne games.  After that, your DVD player kicks out (which also means DVD PS2 games won't be played) and you'll need to clean the lense.  I haven't had to clean out my XBOX or GCN ONCE since I got them and they're going on to being three years old! It doesn't even take a year before I have to clean out my PS2 again.Thrid problem, you have to go out and purchase a memory card! This wouldn't be such a problem if they weren't so damn expensive!  All it's used for is for me to save the data of a game!  Why do I need to pay more for the memory card than I do the controller?This isn't really a problem but this console doesn't come with a game. I remember that when I purchased a PSX I got a demo disc showcasing its games. This doesn't include one. Not a problem but the overall cost will come out to be quite a bit when you've got to buy the console, a game, a memory card and second controller.Also, the game only has two controller ports!  Forcing you to buy a multitap. The good news, many games only support two players so its not a total loss and you won't HAVE to buy a multitap.Also, just because it's backwards compatible with the PSOne doesn't mean your PSOne controllers will work flawlessly. Some games will actually require that you use a Dual Shock 2 controller instead (since the original PSX controller doesn't have Pressure sensative buttons). But your PS2 controller WILL work with your PSOne.But the selection of games on the PS2 are great.  Many games are worth the buy, really they are.  There are also many genres to choose from.  The casual RPGer will be quite at home here with his or her PS2.  So the games are great and because its been out a year longer than the other two it has a larger selection of games.The system also has nice backward compatibility.  You can play just about any PSOne game on here.  What are the chances that you'll have one of the sixteen games that don't work? And even they play on the PS2 with little to no problems.However, the PS2's cons do hold it back quite a bit.  The system is flawless as far as games go, several great games out there to choose from, but the system itself isn't all that special.So the Good+Backwards compatible with your PSOne (even the controllers)+Good selection of games+Hey, it's a DVD player, PSOne, CD player and PS2 all in one!But the bad-You'll still need to buy a Dual Shock 2 Controller since some games don't support the original Dual Shock 1.-Putting the system in the vertical stance means the possibility of damaging your mother board AND moving the lense exists which means you may need to get it repaired if you put in this position. DON'T put it in the vertical stance unless you have a vertical stand.-Only two controller ports-System needs to be cleaned often-LONG load times-DVD's skip from time to time. Might as well use a regular DVD player-Memory cards aren't all that cheap","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00012BSJ4","description":"When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better.

The game itself is the most beautiful 2D experience in Metroid history, easily eclipsing Super Metroid or Fusion with its superior animation and level design. Planet Zebes has never looked so good and so menacing. The extra content after the battle with Mother Brain is a surprise and helps flesh out the story more. By the time you have completed the game you will want to do it all over again. In fact I have already gone through it twice and plan on a third adventure in the near future.Trust me, it is short like most of the best SNES and NES games were but since you want to replay it over and over you easily get hours and hours of enjoyment that doesn't require 20+ hours of your life each sitting. People are finally beginning to understand that games don't all have to be 40 hours to be good; in fact I play Super Mario Bros. 3 often enough to be in the thousands of hours.This game includes:-Extra Material to Flesh out the storyline-Comic book style cut scenes-Tons of animation (sweet!)-Great soundtrack (must hear!)-A wide assortment of weapons not found in the original-Power ups new to the first Metroid like Charge Beam-A overworld map not found in the originalThis game is everything Fusion or Super Metroid is but better.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2004"}

I was a devout Sony fan and was holding out for my PSP. My husband surprised me with my PSP for Christmas 2 years ago and I was in love! At least I was for a couple of weeks until I realized that the game library was severely lacking any titles that I really wanted to play.Still wanting a hand-held gaming device, I looked into the DS shortly after the Lite was released. I haven't looked back since! I've had my DS for over a year now and I am in love all over again. The DS really is a revolutionary device. We've had touch screen devices for years, but never a dedicated gaming device with a touch screen. Before I bought the DS, I thought the idea of a touch screen was rather gimmicky, but let me tell you, it adds SO much to the experience. You feel like you are really interacting with your puppies in Nintendogs and you're really cooking up that great stew in Cooking Mama. It just adds so much to the immersion, which I would never have thought possible on this tiny device. I have never had any issues with my touch screen. It has always been perfectly responsive and has never let me down. Gameplay is seamless and the touch screen controls become second nature. PSP has great graphics, I agree, but when forced to choose between great graphics and truly engaging and fun gameplay, I choose the latter.DS Lite also wins out on size. Even vs the PSP Slim, it is still smaller and easier to slip in my purse to take with me wherever I go. It's light, comfortable in your hands, and the controls are placed just right so that playing is easy and enjoyable.Where the DS truly shines, however, is it's game library. You have a huge range to choose from, from kid's edutainment (thank you!!) to girly games where you take care of babies/puppies to games where you cook meals and design hair and wardrobe to games that adults love as much as kids like Brain Age and Super Mario Bros. and the like. The DS really has something for everyone.I do notice, however, that my husband, brothers and dad don't really play the DS much. It seems to be geared toward girls and kids, which I certainly don't mind because that's a first in the gaming world. I've been gaming since I was 5 years old on the Atari and I appreciate a system that acknowledges that girls and little kids, like my 3-year-old son, like video games, too, and we want to do more than blow up buildings and shoot people (no thanks!!).The DS is intuitive enough for my 3-year-old to control, though I would not buy a DS for a child of this age range. He is very responsible with it and handles it very well, but there aren't a whole lot of games that are geared for his age range and that just makes for frustration. Opt for a Leapster instead for a few years, which also features a great touch screen and a huge educational game library.I can't rave enough about the DS, but I will recommend that you pick up a few essentials if you are planning on buying one. Find yourself some Hori screen protectors. They are AWESOME! And really necessary to prolong the life of your DS. I would never play without them. The screens are naturally very resistant to scratches, but for a few dollars you can add some great protection and completely erase the worry of scratches from your mind.Also, pick up a crystal case if the DS is going to be played with by a child or young adult. For under $10 you can completely protect the exterior of the DS from scratches and dings and it does not add much bulk to the unit. I was a nervous wreck every time my son played my DS until I got a crystal case.Last, get a nice carrying case. Don't just toss it in a bag and be content with that. For girls, ALS Industries makes an ADORABLE purse carrying case which is big enough for the DS, several game cases (I have 9 in mine right now), earbuds, charger, extra styli, you name it. Walmart, Best Buy, Circuit City, they all carry them. And for the record, they're the perfect size for your PSP and Archos 5, too. :)Take care of your DS and it will last you for years to come. Durability has never been an issue with Nintendo products. I still have my original NES and it still works like new, 20 years later!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2008"}

For those of us who find games like Oblivion and Fallout 3 to be too open, too wide and too daunting this is a great game.The story begins simply with a fairly long chapter that eases you into the game without being a boring tutorial. At the end of you will become the first human \"spector\" - a CIA like opporitive charged with tracking a traitor who is threatening the univirse. Once the opening is complete you have a ship and the galaxy is at your disposal, you can roam free and explore, follow side quest in your journal or go on about the main mission. You pick up six party members along the way and can take two at a time, just like with FF, they have to be in your party to earn experience and you have to keep them all armed and have the equipment updated and modified.Here's the downside, the menu screen sucks. Arming your parting and upgrading and modifying weapons and armor is boring and time consuming. The screen requires you to keep clicking to other screens and then back for each weapon and each mod and each character gets four weapons and 2 mods per plus armor with mods.The level up is a familular point-distribution that lets you decide were your stronger and when.The battle is supposed to be complex, it's got RPG style controls that allow you to control your party, but it's clunky and annoying, I just let the npg's do thier thing and worry about the main character -- who can be male or female and decently customized but will always be \"sheppard\" so I made the first name \"German.\"I play this on my tower:AMD Phenom 64x true-quad core 1.6X4ghz black edition2 X BFG NVidia GX250 with 2 gig DDR4 with SLI and PhysX8 Gig NVidia SLI low-latency ramHT Claro 7.1 soundI run on all settings high with 60fps @ 900X1400 resolution and have no lag, screen tear or loading times.I also have this on Xbox 360 -- loading is constant, but fairly quick, screen tears regularly and the graphic quality is inferior.

Nicholson","summary":"L4D2...2009 Game of the Year in on-line co-op","reviewText":"Well the much anticipated L4D2 has finally arrived. Better that the original L4D?...hard to say, it's different, with the focus of zombie attacks more frequent and in larger numbers.I'll give a brief overview of the game and then a few comments on game play.THE GAME:L4D2 features 5 new co-op campaigns, survival, versus and 2 new  on-line modes...1.)Scavenge, where survivors must find hidden gas cans within the map to keep generators going, all the while being attacked by other on-line players acting as the infected.2.)Realism, where there are no 'glowing objects' to help you. Your teammates don't glow so if they get separated from you, you don't have any idea where they are. Also weapons and explosives caches don't glow so you'll have to search every room to find these items. And finally, it takes head shots if you want  to kill the zombies easier. (body shots will also work...you just need a lot more of them).You get to play one of 4 new characters; either Coach, Nick, Ellis or Rochelle and travel the south eastern U.S. from Savannah, Georgia to New Orleans in your quest to survive. Opposing your attempt to escape are hordes of zombies and several new special-infected, including the 'charger', the 'jockey' and the 'spitter', all of whom we saw in the demo. However,  each of the 5 different campaigns has its own unique species of infected, found only within that particular map.Helping you stay alive are several new guns (most of which can be laser equipped and some even have larger magazines)and ammo. This includes a 30 shot sniper rifle, a grenade launcher, a couple of shotguns, a couple of hand machine guns and of course, the last ditch resort for ammo conservation...dual pistols. The new ammo includes incendiary rounds, explosive rounds and of course rocket propelled grenades.And if guns and ammo don't it, there's always melee...this is the one area of the game that is quite different than the original L4D (in which melee was basically  a defensive action to fend off the hordes). The melee portion of the action has become definitely more offensively minded in L4D2. There are a multitude of new melee weapons, including a baseball bat, frying pans, guitars, axes, chain saws, machetes etc. just to mention a few. And these weapons are very lethal, each dealing out its own brand of carnage.In addition to carrying pipe bombs and molotovs you now also have the option of packing an adrenalin shot, a defibrillator (to revive a 'recently' dead comrade) or a vial of boomer puke with which you can throw on the infected so they will attack each other.Game Play:1.)In general, L4D2 seems harder than L4D; harder because the hordes seem (at least to me) a little faster and in larger numbers. 'Normal' difficulty in L4D2 requires the same dedicated co-op attitude and team play as was needed on 'Advanced' difficulty in L4D.2.)I have found that melee has become a major factor in Zombie fighting, especially  with hordes that seem to attack with large numbers and eventually are able to  get in up-close and personal. There is something gratifying...something SO deeply  primal about melee; hearing the thwunk of a baseball bat as it decapitates one of the undead, you can almost feel the impact. And watching someone else use a chainsaw...well, it's simply unbelievable!3.)The new special infected are quite unique and can be a major factor, especially during the finales. And while the Jockey and Charger can be very irritating, it is the 'Spitter' that has became the 'queen of annoyance' in L4D2. And the tactics that are so successful for all other infected (hordes and specials) of staying together as a tight, compact unit, is absolutely the worst thing you can do when come across a 'spitter'. She usually comes out when your least able to defend against her (often in the middle of a horde attack) and can take your health from deep green to a few red bars in a  matter of seconds if you aren't aware she's attacked you. She is a royal pain!4.)Finales are typically chaotic; some more frantic than others. To me for example, the endings of Dead Center and The Parish are arguable the hardest (and absolutely require a team effort), Dark Carnival would be next with Hard Rain and Swamp Fever maybe a little easier than the others. Obviously a subjective opinion.Conclusions:A game of unrelenting attack from zombies; zombies that seem to come with greater haste and larger numbers then their counterparts in L4D.L4D2 is a game requiring organized and disciplined team play. Players that play alone or are not team-orientated, will be quickly dispatched.Melee has became a integral part of game play and is absolutely needed to be successful (and melee is SO satisfying to play).The finales are absolute chaos; often exhausting and frequently frustrating,  but very satisfying if your lucky enough to make it through.And the maps: the maps are better than I could ever have hoped for! Each with truly great graphics and incredible layouts.L4D2 will likely be the 2009 Game of the Year in the on-line co-op genre; nothing else comes close.  5 StarsR.

As far as portable systems go, the PSP has tons of features that beat the competition hands down.  But for every feature the PSP has, there's baggage to go with it.  It's online capability has varying degrees of troubles, and the future of it's capability of playing UMD movies is up in the air as well.  Poor sales of UMD movies have left the future of the format in question, even though a majority of the movies look great on the PSP's slick screen.  No matter how many features a video game system has however, when it comes down to it, the most important matter are the games, and this is what really hurts the PSP.  As of this typing, there is no single killer app for the system, and there's only a handful of games that are worth owning.  Daxter, GTA: Liberty City Stories, Twisted Metal: Head On, and Mega Man: Maverick Hunter are the best games for the PSP, with a host of RPG's and lame console conversions as well.  Most of these games are hindered by the fact that there's only one analog stick, which makes the camera controls in games like Daxter, GTA, and a few more quite cumbersome.  As far as system capabilities and features go, the PSP can't be beat, but it's future is uncertain at best, and it's direct competition, Nintendo's DS, may not have everything the PSP does feature wise, but it has a much, much better library of games.  All in all, as of right now, the best thing to do is stick with the DS until the PSP proves that it has staying power and better quality games, but if it's one thing that Sony has proven it can do over the years in the world of video games, it's that they never fail to surprise, so hopefully the best days of the system are ahead.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2006"}

Plus, there was only one game mode (at least with the Palm version).Bejeweled Twist has many significant improvements that make the original game concept a lot more fun.First, and most important is that you now rotate groups of jewels to create matches. The jewels are rotated clockwise only, in groups of four. This change gives you more ability to develop a strategy than the original game, which just allowed you to swap two jewels at a time(at least with the Palm version).The \"twist\" concept also gave the game designers the freedom to create a number of different game modes, so Bejeweled Twist offers something for everyone.The Classic Mode is a lot of fun because it becomes more challenging at each successive level and ends when your skill and luck run out.Challenge Mode may appeal to people who like solving puzzles, allowing you to unlock new challenges as you progress.In Zen Mode, you can zone out and make endless matches, sort-of the electronic equivalent of popping bubble wrap.If you thrive on playing under a time constraint, there is a five-minute Blitz Mode.The graphics are very snappy, and the game runs on Vista(Home Premium)without a hitch.If you liked the original Bejeweled, you'll have a blast with Bejeweled Twist.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2008"}

Your task is to find amysterious girl named Elizabeth and return her to New York unharmed. Seems easy enough, right? Wrong. During your journey in Columbia, you'll really question your motives and learn more about who Elizabeth really is, and why these people want her so badly. I won't spoil anything, but the story of Bioshock Infinite is fantastic, and you'll really grow to love these characters. The ending is truly satisfying, and it doesn't leave any questions unanswered.The visuals in Bioshock Infinite are amazing, and they really help to suck you into this immersive world. As you're shot up into the sky and see Columbia for the first time, you'll be left in awe at this gorgeous place. Many people roam around the city, filled with cheer. But you'll soon come to realize what a horrible place Columbia really is. Its people hate foreigners of any kind, hurting or even killing any person that isn't white (provided they aren't already being forced to work in the factories). The citizens of Columbia worship the Founding Fathers, and are wholeheartedly devoted to their fanatical leader, Father Comstock. At one point in the game you'll even see people revering a statue of John Wilkes Booth! Some foreigners, tired of the discrimination and abuse of their races, make up the Vox Populi (\"voice of the people\" in Latin), a ragtag group of common people who lead a civil war against the ultranationalist Founders, who blindly defend the Prophet. DeWitt is caught in the middle of all this, and doesn't want any part of it. Booker is a very cynical and reserved fellow, one who doesn't care much for the people of Columbia. But that all changes when he finds Elizabeth, an intelligent, optimistic young girl who has been locked up in a tower for all of her life. She tries to bring out the best in Booker, who has had a dark and troubled past. You'll quickly find that Elizabeth has an astonishing ability; she can open up tears in the environment, objects or weapons brought in from another dimension. These really change combat, as you can have Elizabeth conjure up some cover, a shotgun, or health kits and nearly any point. She'll also toss you ammo, coins, or salts (your fuel for using Vigors) at just the right time during combat. All of these don't make the game too easy, though: you'll find quite a challenge in Columbia on some of the higher difficulties.One of the best new additions to Infinite was the Sky-Line system. With the push of a button, your character can use his awesome Sky-Hook to attach onto a Sky-Line and travel around Columbia in a fun and easy way. The controls on the Sky-Line are extremely intuitive, and you'll quickly learn your way around the sky. You can also use these to get an edge during combat, whether you slow down and do some precision aiming, go by your enemies in quick and lethal assaults, or even drop right onto them with a Sky-Line Strike. You can also use your Sky-Hook to perform brutal executions on your enemies when their health is low enough, and I'm sure you gore lovers out there will get some fun out of this.There are many weapons available in Bioshock Infinite: this is a very good thing, but one of my major gripes with the game are that you can only carry two at once. This really limits some of your strategies during the game, and it can be quite frustrating if you keep on dying during a tough fight just because you didn't have the best tools for the job at hand. There are eight Vigors in total for you to use, and some of these are pretty cool. However, I didn't really use them that often: I played on Medium difficulty, and rarely ever needed to use them. That may not be the case for the higher difficulties, but so far for me, they haven't been all that useful so far. Many vending machines are scattered throughout Columbia, where you can buy health, salts, ammo, gun upgrades, vigors, and vigor upgrades. Money can be found all throughout Columbia, and I've noticed that enemies' bodies drop many more items than in the original Bioshock. When you die in Bioshock Infinite, there isn't really that much of a punishment: you simply lose some money, regain a bit of health and ammo, and respawn a few paces away from where you died. Your enemies regenerate a bit of health, too. There are 80 Voxophones (audio journal entries) and 37 Kinetoscopes (brief silent films) hidden throughout Columbia, and locating these will reveal much of the backstory, giving you a deeper understanding of Columbia. Bioshock Infinite is mildly difficult: I'm a decent gamer with a lot of FPS's under my belt, and I didn;t have a lot of trouble on Medium difficulty. Sure, there were some challenging bits, but nothing way too frustrating. However, for the ultra-hardcore gamers, there's 1999 Mode, a new difficulty level unlocked after your first completion of the game (or with a special code activated at the main menu). In this mode, you're severely punished when you die, enemies are much more lethal than before, items are scarce, and you don't take nearly as much damage as normal. I've heard that this is insanely difficult, and I'm sure that you hardcore gamers will get a kick out of it.Overall, Bioshock Infinite is a fantastic game. The characters, visuals, voice acting, gameplay, and story are amazing, and it's a fun and perilous journey through Columbia. There are a few gripes that I have with the game, but in the end, they don't really detract from the overall experience that much. If you buy one game a year, then this should definitely be a consideration. If you're a huge singleplayer fan like me, then this should be right up your alley. Even if you're a more multiplayer-oriented player, then you should still give it a try! I promise you that it will be worth your while. I hope that this helped, and thanks for reading!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2013"}

I was definitely buying Arkham Origins, regardless of the things I was hearing and reading about it. I'll admit that my expectations were lowered due to the fact that a different group made the game. However, might I be so bold as to say this is the best Batman game I've ever played? Lets find out.Combat - It's pretty much the same combat system as before, which will always be a good thing in my book. Some have argued the combat feels a bit 'stiff', but I didn't notice that. The only difference that kind of stood out is the difficulty of some of the fights. I really looked forward to fighting huge groups of enemies in Arkham Asylum and Arkham City because it became easy once I got the hang of things. Arkham Origins' fights are lengthy and difficult, and at times feel like a total button masher. I'll explain what I mean: I've played more than my fair share of action games on the PS3. There's only been two games that caused me to experience forearm fatigue because of the button mashing fighting. Those games are Heavenly Sword (demo version) and now Arkham Origins. This is a prequel, so perhaps the fighting is difficult because they're wanting to emphasize that Batman is early on in his career, I don't know. At any rate, it gets a little easier when you acquire a certain gadget that I'll discuss in the next paragraph.Weaponry - If you've played any of the previous Batman games, you'll know he mainly uses gadgets as opposed to weapons, and that trend continues. The usual gadgets are present, so I'll focus on the new additions. We all know about the remote controlled batarangs; well now there's a remote controlled batclaw! Awesome, right? It doesn't really directly affect combat, I mainly used it to connect to far away grapple points. The concussion detonator actually does affect combat. It'll cause enemies to be momentarily dazed, giving you the chance to move in and put in work! The glue grenade is used to shut off those ever so annoying steam valves (or you can use the grenades on enemies too). Now to my favorite addition - The shock gloves!!! Here's how they work: You build up the battery by pounding on bad guys. Once fully charged, each melee strike will be accompanied by an electric shock. This made the tougher combat more enjoyable and a little easier :-)Enemies - I noticed a few new enemy types sprinkled here and there. The ones that stood out were the ninjas, the dudes with the venom filled canisters on their backs, and the brutes. The ninjas were different because you'll have to plan your strikes against them, as opposed to straight button mashing. I've been hearing a lot of negative things about the boss battles, and I don't understand why. In my opinion, each one was a little different and required some technique. Ok, the first one was a button mashing affair, but the others really weren't. You probably recall me saying I've played several PS3 action type games. Well, the final boss battle is the most terrifying boss battle I've ever encountered!  I'm tempted to explain why, but I can't do so without giving spoilers. Some people are smart enough to give details without spoiling the game, but I'm sure in the hell not...Miscellaneous - Don't worry guys and gals, there's plenty of sidemissons with some pretty cool enemy encounters. You will not see the usual Riddler puzzles (thank God), but there are still collectables around town. Also, you'll get an opportunity to solve crimes, similar to how it's done in LA Noir, if you're familiar with that game. If you're into multiplayer, that feature is available in a Batman game for the first time. Arkham Origins didn't feel quite as long as the others, but it took me about 28 hours to complete (that includes the sidemissions and me screwing around in the city).The only negative thing about the game is very minor, but I still thought I'd mention it. The graphics are not as good as the previous two games, but that's not a big deal to me. After finishing Arkham Origins, I felt it was the best Batman game I've ever played. I had tons of fun, and was constantly looking forward to what might happen next. I'll be honest, if you play this game and you don't think it's at least 4 stars, I'll be shocked.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"M.

{"product_name":"B002I094AC","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"\"We're Star Fox!\"","reviewText":"Back in 1997 when the Nintendo 64 was enjoying success, Star Fox 64 was one of the must have titles.  It had some of the best graphics you could find, some exciting gameplay and was--then--one of the few video games to utilize voice acting.  Almost everything about the experience was new and different.  In this day and age certain aspects don't hold up as well.  On the other hand, the game itself is still fun.  It's not quite as amazing as it was in 1997, but it's still a lot of fun.Star Fox 64 isn't really much for story.  Aside from the opening crawl there isn't really a whole lot of story.  All you need to know is that Andross has declared war on the Lylat system and it's up to team Star Fox to stop him by flying across the galaxy to his homeworld of venom to put an end to his plans.  The game has around fifteen different levels but you'll only play through seven of them.  Two of them will always be the same.  No matter what you'll begin in Corneria and end in Venom.The basics of play haven't really changed at all.  Star Fox is an on-rails shooter where you'll cruise through the levels shooting at other flying enemies that get in your way.  You can charge your laser for more powerful shots, fire bombs and perform certain maneuvers such as doing barrel rolls to deflect shots, performing somersaults to dodge certain enemies or use the boost to get through certain obstacles.  For the most part, if you played the game on the Nintendo 64 nothing has changed on a gameplay level.Star Fox 64 is a short game.  There's no getting around that.  The game can easily be bested in a single sitting.  Thanks to the branching paths through the main campaign, however, there's some replay value here.  Most of the levels have certain tasks you can perform to go down different paths.  For example, in the first mission if you save Falco while he's being chased and then show him some smooth flying by flying under the arches on the water you'll go down a completely different path.  If you find any particular level too challenging the game will allow to change course.  Those who play well and showcase some of their chops will travel down a harder path.  Those who struggle too much get taken down an easier path.  Most of the levels are short and snappy, but they don't always come without challenge.  Some stages are busy throwing quite a bit at you.  One moment you're soaring through Corneria the next you're in an asteroid field dodging those... and then you find yourself on Solar where your Arwing is constantly taking heat damage.For the most part there isn't much out there quite like Star Fox 64 because you don't find that many games on rails in quite the same manner anymore.  This gives it a unique feel, but it hasn't really changed a whole lot from the N64 version released so long ago.  The game plays and feels exactly the same.  You won't find places populated by new enemies or anything strangely out of the ordinary.  It's pretty much an exact port.That's not to say there are no tweaks.  The most obvious is the graphical enhancement.  It stays true to the art style but many of the games stages have noticeably more detail.  But it sticks so well to the art style that those who haven't played the game in a long time would swear it ALWAYS looked like this.  It didn't.  Just looking at the water on Corneria alone or looking at the map of the Lylat system shows some noticeable changes in the graphics.  Everything is smoother and prettier.  The voices have also been re-recorded.  You may notice a line or two altered but some of the most familiar lines (\"Do a barrel roll!\") have stayed the same.  The soundtrack has also been remastered.  It's still familiar in every way it's just been updated.The biggest addition to the game are without a doubt the Gyro-Controls.  You can move and tilt your 3DS to control your Arwing.  This sounds good in theory, but in execution you'll forget about it after a while--the novel wears off.  The classic way to play is the way to go.  Using the circle pad and face buttons is just all around easier.  Especially because the Gyro-Controls are sensitive.  The slightest tilt of your 3DS will cause your Arwing to respond in kind and this makes certain moments more challenging than they have to be.  If you insist in playing the game withe the 3D on then the Gyro-Controls will only cause everything to be fuzzy thanks to your constant movements.The multiplayer isn't really much to write home about, however.  It's cool that your picture will pop up and all, but there isn't much to the multiplayer experience.  You can't go online (and even if you could I'm sure you'd have to deal with Nintendo's awful friend code system) and unless you've got some friends to play with it isn't engaging.  You'll quickly forget about the multiplayer at some point and jump right back into the main campaign.For those who enjoyed the game way back on the Nintendo 64 nostalgia alone is powerful enough to make it worth looking into.  For those who have never tried it before, it's worth taking a look into because the game still plays rather well even today, in part because there just aren't that many games out there like it.  It's on the short side but it has a lot of replay value and at the end of the day it's just fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2011"}

{"product_name":"B003GSZ9ZE","description":"","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"Solid standard stuff","reviewText":"I haven't played any other Fear games and so this might explain why the plot was completely lost on me. Two brothers brought up in a sterile experimental facility observed at play, at sleep and at war. Okay got that. For some reason though one of them doesn't talk and both boys really don't look alike at all. I'd like to see the milkman as I'm pretty sure we're looking at two different dads here. But regardless of the confusing fable presented in Fear 3, no good game's success should fall on the shoulders of the story being told however lackluster it may be. I mean, did we really care who the Space Invaders were? Nahh.So what you have is a solid FPS. Not really much variety of weaponry, and since you can only carry two weapons at a time it makes sense to have a long range and a short range with you and the shotgun and three-burst semi do the job thorough out the game nicely. There's slow-mo bullet time fodder which isn't nearly as satisfying as I expected as most bad guys take loads of rounds and in some cases many reloads to fall and often don't drop before bullet time has drained. For example there's a particular type of glowing blue bad guy that even in the game's easiest setting, Recruit, takes an inordinate amount of lead to drop. It does get kind of old at times.The atmosphere is obviously something worked on long on hard by the devs and there's at least a couple of truly spine-tingling moments in Fear. Usually these scares weren't so much from the 'BOO!' gotchas but more from some naturally creepy surroundings and audio that have been nicely constructed to induce suitable 'wet my pants' moments.Each chapter, or interval, usually is based around a particular location; supermarket, airport, broken bridge etc although later chapters are much shorter than earlier ones and this resulted in a quick wrap-up feel to the game especially the final boss battle.One factor I do like is once done, you can begin the game from the point of view of Fettel the more vocal of the two brothers. Without spoiling things, Fettel's abilities are more supernatural than Point Man's and add a really refreshing slant to a subsequent play through. The single player campaign also has an RPG element with rewards such as extra health or new abilities being awarded based on your performance and those stats are carried through from one play through to the next. Anything that gives more replayability should be applauded.Obviously the game has been also heavily tuned for co-op which unfortunately along with MP I did not play. No matter though as I felt I got more than enough game out of the single player mode and despite there being little new here I enjoyed the game for what it is.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2011"}

I just can't get behind a character who is a stereotype.  Scantily clad females with with inhuman proportions really don't hold my interest in a gaming environment. This new take on the Croft character is a breath of fresh air. She is more life like and real,  she shows weakness and vulnerability.  All too often the characters in games are almost godlike and superhuman. And while to some degree they have to be,  it's nice to see a character that is truly in danger and best of all she knows it.The gameplay is steller. Platforming has never been more fluid... I especially like the rock climbing portions. It seems fast, fluid, and responsive. Nothing like the old tomb raider games. It's also very open,  not linear like Uncharted. Alot of the collectibles are found by experimenting with the terrain and seeing where you can climb next.  The gunplay is accurate, naturally weighted, and visceral... I love the new archery fad in these next gen games. Everything feels polished and awesome. This game takes what worked in uncharted and captilizes on it. But uncharted did the same with the old tomb raiders so all is fair.Last the story because the graphics are obviously good. The story fits alot like a toned down lord of the flies or heart of darkness origin for the enemies and our heroione just happens to be caught in the middle of it. Well shipwrecked.

{"product_name":"B004FS8LYK","description":"","reviewerName":"P. Hardy","summary":"\"Go and Save Yourself. And Take it out on me.\" - \"TOMB RAIDER (2013)\" Review (SPOILERS)","reviewText":"INTRO:Since \"The Angel of Darkness\", the cultural icon known as \"Tomb Raider\" has struggled to find its balance and place in an era where platforming and puzzle games have become Unicorns in the video game franchise. More importantly, \"Tomb Raider\" has struggled to resemble some form of a competent game. The Lady Lara Croft appeared to have done just in 2006 with Crystal Dynamics and the release of \"Tomb Raider Legend\". As an action platformer and puzzle game, \"Legend\" was one of the best \"Tomb Raider\" experiences I've had since I played the original game back in 2001 when I first got a PlayStation 2 for Christmas. I can say the same of \"Anniversary\" and \"Underworld\" as well.Yet, with the jaded community who's followed Lara Croft through every evolution of her character's history --- be it through comics, movies or the dismal video games that followed after \"Tomb Raider III\" pre-Dynamics, it simply wasn't enough. And for whatever reason, after the less than stellar success of \"Tomb Raider Underworld\", Crystal Dynamics went to back to the drawing board with Lara.But instead of addressing their own follies in regards to writing and game mechanics, their philosophy with the announcement of a reboot of \"Tomb Raider\", was that the problem lie with Lara Croft herself and not so much their inability to deliver a decent product. Riding on the coattails of the \"grimdark\" fad that was seemingly sparked with Christopher Nolan's \"Batman Begins\" in 2005, Crystal Dynamic's aim was not only make Lara Croft \"human\", but put her through the ringer by placing emphasis on physical and mental torture of what it would take to survive on a seemingly deserted island.At first glance there's not much wrong with that premise; it seems like a solid idea overall, but further contemplation raises the question of \"why\" exactly the train of thought today's world is that in order for an audience to connect with a character, they have to be emotionally and physically tortured.Secondly, the only real problem Lara Croft truly suffered as a character was the mere fact that she was often promoted to be an object (and that she was stuck in a series of bad games). You could never really say Lara Croft experienced the same respect in the media as Ridley Scott and James Cameron's Ellen Ripley for breaking the preconceived notions of what a female character could be or do. Sexual objectification is a large part of what makes Lara Croft an \"icon\" in the media; there isn't a promotional photograph from the \"golden days\" where Lara wasn't posing for the camera in ways that were specifically catering to the male gaze (and to add insult to injury there was a \"Nude Raider\" mod created, further pinpointing her role as \"ionic\" character based solely on her assets). And then there were the \"Croft Babes\", models created to sell the game to the massive during premieres or conventions. Yet, despite all of that, for a lot of gamers (more importantly, to a lot of gamers who happen to be female) the character's strengths lies more with her independence and strength borne out of the fact that she could tango with the wackiest enemies --- animal, male, female, supernatural --- and was never thought of anything less than \"action girl\". Sure, her character was about as deep as James Bond (and if I have to be specific, Movie!Bond), but a \"weak\" character is something you could never call Lara Croft. She was a hardboiled character with the noir of Max Payne and a smart mouth with a doctorate no less.Thus, when Crystal Dynamic's primary advertisement seemed more aimed at passive-aggressively knocking Lara Croft as she was and declaring \"New Croft\" was somehow a revolutionary take on a character who suffered but a few minor problems connected to sexism and bad writing, I had to wonder whether or not we were seeing the same character and playing the same game. The biggest compliment I could probably give them is recreating the character to suit the physicality of real woman's body as opposed to continually catering to the 3D Doll-esque model as they've done in the last three games under their tenure. Outside of that, their promotion of the game and the narrative the game itself speaks more to the points they keep on missing than anything that progresses \"Tomb Raider\" forward.GAMEPLAY:\"Tomb Raider\" is, at best, an \"Uncharted\" clone with the worst of Ubisoft's \"Far Cry 3\" RPG and hunting elements--- aka busywork at best, grinding at worst. It brings nothing new to the table as a game and sparks revolution in nothing. If were talking game changers here, there's nothing \"Resident Evil 4\" or \"Gears of War\" about it. If I could call \"Tomb Raider\" anything in regards to its mechanics, it's the \"Halo 4\" of franchise; inoffensive, but enjoyable. Everything, to how Lara travels through the environment, how she finds artifacts and narrates (a feeble way of reminding the audience \"she's an archaeologist, see?\") down to how the world is built around Lara's actions screams of Naughty Dog influence, who in turn were inspired by \"Tomb Raider\", \"Prince of Persia\" and \"Indiana Jones\", only they do it better than the pioneer herself. The environmental puzzles, while fun when you can figure them out, are a pain in the rear end when you can't.As per the usual with games of these types, I found myself getting frustrated for merely over complicating what was arguably a insultingly simple puzzle (merry-go-round cargo cages, and the temple puzzles that utilized the wind) to the point of rage quit. To the best of my knowledge, \"Tomb Raider\" doesn't use that one helpful tool in \"Uncharted\" known as \"Press R2 for a bloody obvious Hint\". Why can't puzzles be a nice blend of enjoyable and challenging like they were in \"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\"? I might've gotten equally frustrated, but for whatever reason, I never felt like I was being judged for missing obvious points when I finally succeeded and squealed with elation (seriously, screw that \"Well\" level before the \"Baths\" level, but reaching the top and being greeted by a horde of Blue Sand Monster types was the greatest feeling in the world). As far as puzzles go, they're by no means challenging... unless you're like me who thinks the developers put that much thought into it and I go the extremely long way around figuring it out. Their a blend of zip-line, explosive and use arrow to hook movable object. They feel mandatory, but not something that naturally fits with the environment or the gameplay.Animal hunting is probably something I went out of my way to avoid when the game didn't require it and it usually didn't after the tutorial. Not only does it trivialize the disembowelment of animal for an almost useless mechanic that never holds any bearing narratively, it's just badly done. A quick swipe at an animal and you've got a screen full of stale jelly and useless experience points. If they really wanted to make this mechanic make sense, they should've take a page out of Jasper Byrne's \"Lone Survivor\" and made it a necessity that Lara hunt for food and water under the threat of starving to death; otherwise it's unnecessary, just like the whole skill point/tree itself. Crystal Dynamics also decides to take a page out of Visceral Games' \"Dead Space\" and gleefully puts Lara Croft through the ringer of some truly gruesome death sequences that not only break the atmosphere of the game, but raise the question of whether or not they missed the point with Visceral's \"so-over-the-top-its-hilarious\" montage of death altogether. Sure, the game has its typical fall to your death then cut to back scenes, but they're far outnumbered by the aforementioned. There are death scenes then there's fetishism with killing a character on the phallic symbols of the world presented in game.The biggest negative I can speak of, really, is the lack of choices in regards to how approach the enemies. The game sells itself wholly on the concept of \"survival\", but it only gives you a sole option on how to \"survive\" the ordeal on the island. Never is there a time where you can simply evade or be urged to run from the crazed islanders when they outnumber you or otherwise, instead your only option is use the ice axe, gun and handful of dirt against them in combat. Combat, basically, is your only option when dealing with survival.The stealth elements in this regard, are wasted. Stealth is merely an extension of combat; sneaking up behind enemies allows you to kill them silently, but just as soon as someone notices their missing --- well, get your gun ready, you're in for a fight. And from there it's all matter of how much your patience can deal with killing your opponents as \"Tomb Raider\" offers nothing new in the respect of \"Mortal Kombat\"-esque deaths without the parody levels of gore and decapitation. Enemies barely allow you to recover or breathe once they've found you and it's a half-n-half of challenging and downright bothersome. If I thought throwing my controller at the screen could KO an enemy I would probably do it at the risk of my screen's life.Enemies later faced in the game, \"The Storm Guard\", are a re-skinned version of the heavy armored enemies (and the \"Guardians\" practically lifted from \"Uncharted 2\") and they're no more fun to kill than they were when they were guys with riot shields. On top of that, the game never translates Lara's inexperience with weapons or combat into the gameplay itself, primarily concerned with catering to the gamer(s) who don't want to be faced with the challenge of dealing with, say, the trembling arms of a young girl who's never handled a pistol or a machine gun when she's knocked back from the recoil. If they had integrate RPG-elements into the game, then its focus should've been on improving Lara as a efficient combatant or stealth operative as opposed to focusing on the weapons. Show us that Lara is inexperienced and afraid instead of fitting the game with the tried and true combat mechanics that will work to their advantage, but to the detriment of the story. A sort of \"panic/inexperience mode\" that progressively lessens the better she gets with weaponry or evasion.Quick Time Events suck; in an age where these things are becoming more and more of intrusion, robbing the player of any control, \"Tomb Raider\" could've done with a lot less QTE. There's not much more to it that, they suck.So, does all of the above make it a bad game? No, far from it; \"Tomb Raider\", is actually pretty fun mechanically speaking. The illusion of an open world invites the player to grouse around environments that aren't teeming with enemies and take in the world with specific intention of being admired by a playing or viewing audience. The best time I probably had was creating ziplines and going down ziplines, especially the bit wherein I had jump across a network of them to get down to the beach level. Crystal Dynamic's biggest problem with \"Tomb Raider\" games post \"Legend\" is that they were never willing innovate or spruce up problems they created and thus fell into a rut. While \"Tomb Raider\" is a mere rehash of familiar gameplay from experiences that offered them in far better games, it's nice to see that they finally did something about the combat FINALLY. So while this sounds like I didn't have a good time with the mechanics, there's not much to say about the parts I enjoyed other than \"I had fun\".STORY:Rhianna Pratchett doesn't exactly have the greatest track record in regards to her screenplays for video games. \"Heavenly Sword's\" narrative as equally as frustrating as its overly-tight and unresponsive mechanics/controls; her patch work quilting of \"Mirror's Edge\" doesn't beholden her much in any way either. The narrative in both were so equally irrelevant that it's easy to dismiss them when both games primary concern were with its gameplay and not its story. Here is a different tale altogether. Here, they want you to care about these characters; they want to be a human drama piece cobbled around a video game. It's the entire reason why they've supposedly gone this direction as opposed simply making a \"Tomb Raider\" game with better mechanics and a little more thought in its plot.To say nothing of Crystal Dynamic's announcing the writer as a means to deflect their poor advertisement of the game as \"protection simulator\", \"we're not sexist, the writer's a female\" and \"oh, that's not an attempted rape scene, you're just seeing things\", Rhianna and Crystal Dynamics attempt to deal with an issue that neither really understand or try to. The game truly tries to make a grand statement on the issue of survival --- being pushed into a corner and clawing your way out to safety, but its intentions fall flatter than bread rising.Lara Croft's \"transformation\" in the character Dynamics so badly wanted to steer her away from is not only forced, it never feels genuine. In fact, the character development (or lack thereof) runs at the pace of a movie set for 90s minutes only and I've seen 90 minute movies handle character development better than this game does. To say nothing of the action-vs.-story elements that never match up with each other, the narrative has characters make grandiose statements about survival and sacrifice, but none of it translates. It all feels like something Rihanna read off a cue card, a few articles about surviving impossible situations and PTSD and never quite digested the enormity of the meaning behind harrowing ordeals like the one they put Lara through. Unlike the \"Sam gets captured\" scene that's been removed in favor of Lara merely blacking out in the presence of a person she clearly doesn't and shouldn't trust, the attempted rape scene still exists and it's still used as the starting point of \"Lara will become stronger because of this\", but it's not a natural progression, especially for a game that literally skips all introductions of characters and sets up the game with the bloody teaser trailer from 2011 with some sequences chopped out.By the time Lara starts being snappish at her crewmates and behaving as if she knows how to survive better than the lot of them (when they're pretty much even the scale of \"still alive\"), it's pretty game breaking and speaks of Pratchett's laziness in regards to development. The storyline never once saddles the player with the consequences of the actions of the cult or the actions of Lara; there is no remorse on Lara's part for taking lives (the game practically glorifies her execution styled kill moves and combat in general, however optional), however \"justified\" she may be. She more or less becomes one of the crazed cultists herself, spouting angry lines more befitted to Kurt Russell in \"Tombstone\" because the situation there gave you a reason, an example as why Wyatt Earp would declare himself the pale rider of the Revelations. Here, Lara doesn't and isn't given that reason, not one that works anyway. Moreover, it just wrecks the experience.The \"Apocalyptic Log\", messages left about by various inhabitants of the island about the supernatural power of a Japanese Queen/Priestess preventing them from escape, doesn't do much to lend atmosphere to the game. What's more, one left behind Lara's crew raises the question \"when did they find the time to find a pencil and write a last will and testament?\" It worked in \"Dead Space\", because the audio logs are presumably auto-recorded by the character's RIG (the green thing on their backs) and text logs were written then characters are in hiding or before stuff hit the fan. \"Tomb Raider\" disregards situational necessities like this and goes \"whatever\". Even worse, there's a moment with the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the game leaves a letter he had no time to write and declares Lara \"the daughter he never had\" despite the fact that he has a daughter with Joslin Reyes, one the crewmen that accompanied him, and their interaction with each other doesn't imply they kept secrets from each other and Joslin's back story pretty much confirms he knows he has a daughter.And while we're on it, the characters in the game are forgettable. Like Lara, no development is afforded to any of them and the game is completely comfortable with forgetting they exist. There were times where I couldn't tell one survivor from the other unless they were speaking with an accent or had garish yellow, green or blue subtitles to signify their character. Roth is a pretty bland character who exists only pep talks that suffer from greeting card mentality; when he dies they pretty much ruin the entire moment with a disembodied pep talk from the grave and then Lara repeating what \"he might've said\" to her if he were still alive. The only thing missing at that point was a glowing blue ghost. Jonah Maiava is the obligatory \"magical Kiwi\" who \"senses\" something's wrong with the island and provides Lara with a new bow (and that's really about it); Joslin Reyes is the cop turned mechanic who provides little to nothing to the story beyond \"fall in line or we leave you, Lara\" (fine with me, really); Samantha and Alex are the obligatory damsels in distress for Lara to rescue (Samantha contains the one pet-peeve I can't stand: people calling other people \"sweetie\"); Angus Grimaldi is \"Cookie\" Farnsworth from \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\"; and the archaeologist James Whitman does a poor service as an unintentional villain in any respect of that field; he's so clumsily inserted into the narrative as an antagonist that I often wonder if his infrequent appearances were a result of being a character added at the last minute.The villains, the crazy cultists are no more convincing as characters than they are as a threat. The antagonist, bad guy with a hood #10823 (I can't remember his name), poses no more of a threat to the player or Lara as a character than Katherine Marlowe in \"Uncharted 3\", only he lacks her presence. Either way, he's just as easy to kill.Another irk I've with the story is that it places so much emphasis on Lara's father, Richard Croft (Lord Croft, whatever his name is in this canon) and as usual the mother is all but forgotten outside of being the reason Lara even exists in an in-universe perspective. This is a major disappointment after \"Legend\" and \"Underworld\" placed so much importance of the disappearance and relationship Lara had with her mother, Amelia Croft. Basically, I'm tired of mothers being shoved off to the side and the fathers being praised like their the only element in a child's life that matters.To sum it all up, \"Tomb Raider's\" story is bad. In retrospect, it's bad like \"Fary Cry 3\" is bad. It's writers try to tackle a subject that neither have no real understanding or respect from within either gameplay or narrative perspective. A big name with a famous father does little to help its credibility. It's just another rotten rung in the long line of bad stories presented by Lara Croft.PRESENTATION:Visually speaking the game is a hit-or-miss. The environments, to be sure, are gorgeous. In fact, if I were a betting man, I'd say most of the development team's efforts went into the creation of the world around Lara and not so much Lara and her companions. As it is, the in-game cinematics presenting the characters in motion is downright reminiscent of Square Enix cinematic pre-PS3 era; sure it looks better than anything a PS2 could process, but the overall presentation of the characters in the game is pretty disappointing when you consider the hardware. Mouths barely move in sync with the voice acting and almost look as if they don't open at all in some instances. Everything on their models are stiff and almost appear to be molded out of clay. Honestly, I think they could've done far better than what they did here with the graphics, character wise. Otherwise, they've won the gold star for environments.Jason Graves' score pales in comparison to Troels Brun Folmann's mammoth score of atmosphere, mood and adventure for \"Legend\"; the latter composer is sorely missed in this regard as Graves' composition simply sounds like a continuation of his \"Dead Space\" scores (all three of them). He hits all the same marks --- chaotic melodies, experimental sounds with unconventional instruments, not unlike Brian Reitzell did with \"30 Days of Night (2007)\" --- and maintains just about the same themes, only instead of violin, the piano is king here in \"Tomb Raider\". That said, it's not a horrible score it's merely unremarkable, especially when you consider the masterpiece Troels left us with in 2006.Voice acting on the other hand, tends to fall flat and never extends beyond serviceable. Camilla Luddington fails to the carry the game as the voice of Lara Croft; while the character is intentionally made unsure and lacks what a veteran actress like Keeley Hawes might've brought to the table as a mature Lara Croft, even when youth is taken into account, Luddington's green gills as a performer are apparent throughout her performance. It's largely up to the voice actors around her to pick up the slack, yet they're no more remarkable than Luddington herself. Basically, I'm beginning to suspect the forgettable performances here in this game are largely a result of the script and the direction offered. If that's the case, then they should've hired someone on both spectrums who could at least get some kind of memorable performance.The game's audio overall is great; wearing a pair of headphones or simply playing game without them still manages to deliver the strengths of the environment through incidental sounds; the rustling of trees, nearby animals, the crash of water against stone and rushing water in general all service to immerse you in the environments when the story and acting cannot.OVERALL:As far as third-person-shooters with platforming and puzzle elements go, \"Tomb Raider\" is unremarkable, but it's fun. Mechanically, I could call it a great game. Narratively, it's a awful and insulting; don't tote to want to deliver on themes you can't handle unless you can come correct and do it right. The characters, including Lara herself, are forgettable. Altogether it's a half-n-half of a game you're bound to have fun with. However, as a \"Tomb Raider\" game --- whose elements were literally borne of the adventure puzzles and platforming and depended on them --- it's a complete failure.\"Tomb Raider\" fans looking for a return to form won't find it here; Dynamics, like every other developer, has pretty much abandoned any kind of focus on 100% puzzle-and-platforming, the only positive in this regard is improved combat. The negative is that the old guard that made \"Tomb Raider\" what it is is going to be dumped to wayside for some pale imitation of \"Uncharted\" to placate those who'll play it to focus on the TPS elements. Nevertheless I can recommend this game to those who are looking for a great third person shoot and do so without hesitation. The \"Tomb Raider\" reboot gets a generous 3 out of 5.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2013"}

You are given choices in some missions so you can choose to sneak in and away, or engage the enemy. Other missions, however, have specific goals, and it even goes so far to give you free reign in the beginning (a point to reach however you see fit) and then change the rules when you get there (kill all the enemies in the room).

Whether they are open world, first person shooter, rpg etc I will play them all. When I first saw Watchdogs premier at E3 oh so long ago I got so excited and was visually convinced by the beautiful graphics and intriguing story/gaming ideas that this was going to be a truly unique gaming adventure. Fast forward into the future and I must say that Watchdogs is not all it is cracked up to be.I don't agree with Ubisoft's decision to downgrade the graphics on the Playstation 3 to 720p  when the machine is fully capable of running games at 1080p. Although the console is technically now proceeded by the Playstation 4 that doesn't mean you shouldn't get the most out of your software.Like other reviews have suggested, if you have played previous Grand Theft Auto titles or Infamous titles then you will be very familiar with the gaming format of Watchdogs. It's truly nothing new your character is put in a &#34;dangerous&#34; situation in which he must escape and this is your first mission and introduction to your  basic &#34;hacking powers&#34;.  These include hacking cameras, ATM machines, and cars to name a few.Eventually you will try and evade the authorities (sound familiar) and do so either on foot or in a car that is conveniently provided to you by an associate in a nearby garage (*nudge to GTA).  Oh and it's not that you're a bad driver, the controls in this game aren't a 10 by any means.I shall not give away the rest of the game but essentially you go through missions in a open map world to unravel the story.Taking into account the Story, controls and Graphics I would give Watchdogs a 6 out of 10 on the PS3. It's an average game, and the controls and graphics really let it down on the PS3. If you're going to invest in Watchdogs I would try it on a Next Gen Console or PC.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2014"}

I haven't encountered one save issue since I've gotten it, and I've beaten it 2 times and then some.The game isn't to be taken for an Oblivion/Fallout-clone-gone-wrong, because it just isn't anything of the likes. It's a rather fantastic, semi-open world free roam, zombie game. The system is wonderful for what the developers had to work with, and it does a good job of executing things. With that being said, it does execute world events (planes flying by / people on speakers/noises) at awkward times, and leaves you wondering either where is that sound coming from or...just plain what?I've seen reviews talk about the zombies as if they were very AI-rrific, hard to kill, and relentless; this is pretty true for the most part. However, once you get the hang of killing them, the excitement of a hardcore 1 vs 1 zombie battle goes away. The only thing that continues, to this day, to kill me are the Infected. In this game, Infected doesn't refer to the entirety of the zombies, but only a type.There are Walkers, Infected, Thugs, Suiciders, Rams, Floaters, and Butchers -- and not to forget Raskol gang members, they aren't zombies, but gun-wielding humans.Walkers are just your average zombie: if they see you, they stumble your way to attack.Infected are...think zombies on steroids. They can see you at great distances, letting out an otherwise terrifying scream letting you KNOW they've spotted you, running -- not stumbling, RUNNING at you, and attacking in 3-hit bursts. It's hard to kill them because they almost purposely circle around you while destroying you, and if you don't know which direction they are hitting you in, you might just go ahead and call yourself dead. (They aren't glitchy, if you gathered that from what I said, they are just too smart and annoying to come across.I'll leave the other zombies for your experience. I can't even remember how long the game is, but it does have replay value. It's a good enough length for such a game, the environments change at just about the same time you start getting tired of the current one, which keeps the game a bit more interesting.Online play is fun, but it gets kinda messy for 2 reasons. The only way to pause the game is if all the players in co-op have also paused the game. An icon will appear in the top left of the screen, a pause indication. That's letting you know that someone paused the game. That's a good thing, however the messy part comes in when you try to actually communicate with another player.If you just randomly joined someone's game, there is no in-game chat system, you either need a Microphone or to add them and open a chat room. Meaning you have to pause the game just to speak, and if no one else pauses the game while you're talking, you're defenseless against zombie attacks. The other reason this gets messy, but also a good thing I suppose, is that you can track any quest you want, regardless of what quests your other partners are tracking.It causes a sense of separation when people just start going where they want, splitting from the rest of the group. And at times, not knowing what quest the other person is tracking. Although, don't get me wrong, there IS a way to check what quest everyone else is tracking, and that's by opening the quest window, and you'll see a player's icon and name next to a quest, that's how you know which they are tracking.Sadly, quite a few (new) players don't know that, so it makes just jumping into a random game and experiencing someone's first time annoying and messy.If it seems like my review is lacking any emotion, it's probably because it is :( like I've said above, I don't feel too much like writing a review! I just figured I'd do so since I re-stumbled across this listing. I might as well just end with pros and cons!PROS*Semi-Open World and Free Roam gameplay. (It's free roam and open world, but you have to zone to different areas of the island, which means load screens, but other than that, it's 100% free roam.)*Being first person and focusing on melee combat might seem weird, but it does a nice job of it, and you never really get tired of using a melee-wep.*The game is QUITE scary when you play alone, it's not as much when you play with someone else though (or maybe it is for some.) Listening to the shouts of zombies in a random direction alerts you that they are gonna start pelting you with attacks soon enough. The scary part comes in when you don't know where they are coming from!*Game is a decent length, and you change environments at the point where the current one gets a little boring. It has decent replay value, and has a current (as of 12/05/11) DLC, and more on the way.*Overall fun, and a good rental if not buy.CONS*Online Co-Op can get very messy and unorganized, which causes the game to become less fun, and loses it's \"scare\" factor when people are running experiencing stuff without you.*Isn't a game that you can continuously play (is this really a bad thing though?) It starts becoming boring after a certain point, and it's best to just turn it off before you risk just not wanting to play it for a while.There really aren't many cons about the game. Judging it from what this game has, and how well it was executed, it's a really good game. There really isn't much I would change about it. It doesn't leave a lasting impression like \"this is my favorite game!\" but it's a true zombie killing game, which earns respect in my book.I think that's all I have to say, as I said above, I didn't have that reviewing power for this review, but I hope I covered the basics!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2011"}

Occasionally when you get out of a vehicle or press the quick item menu your movement will be restricted to going forward and backward, unable to move side ways or aim. Imagine how fun this is when a horde of zombies is closing in...Then there's the problem of items/weapons disappearing from the quick menu after being killed and respawned. Every time this annoyance occurs you have to hit Select/pause game and re-add your items to the quick menu.And not the last your character decides to switch to using fists instead of your current weapon in use. All these issues are random and kill all the fun.If it wasn't for all these quirks this would have been a solid game for me but surprisingly I managed to get through over 70% of the campaign which as many have pointed out consists of repeating quests (get gas, medicine, food, turn off this, turn off that, bring this, bring that etc).On the plus side graphics and effects are beautifully rendered and the ambient tracks get very engaging when in combat.I wish I could give this five stars as I'm sure the developers and designers meant well but this is alpha quality software that shouldn't have been released until all these major bugs were fixed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001COTC3E","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Feels just like the consoles, but also suffers the same issues","reviewText":"The Good: Amazing visuals, voice acting, good story for Resistance fans, solid mechanics that work, fun boss fights, great weapons, addictive multiplayerThe Bad: Long winded campaign that's stretched thin, can be so difficult you'll want to quit, gets boring and repetitive about halfway through, a few broken mechanicsWell before you read this review I've NEVER played any of the PS3 Resistance games. With that said RR is a great game, but is extremely hard and has a few flaws that bring it down quite a bit. While I can say RR is slightly overrated, it's really only for Resistance fans (well and newcomers...kind of). You play as John Grayson who is part of the Marquis (a French resistance army fighting against the alien Chimera horde). While Chimera aren't as cool as Helghast, Locusts, or even Covenant they are pretty damn creepy.One of the first things I have to get out-of-the-way is that RR uses the Syphon Filter engine and, unfortunately, feels a lot like said games. RR plays similar to the SF games, but with tweaked controls and the engine is, of course, updated. You have a new `snap\" cover system which means Grayson will duck behind, or snap against, cover and this is both useful and annoying. Sometimes when you wanna quickly get out of cover Grayson will \"stick\" to the cover exposing you to certain enemies. There is no blind fire so this makes it hard to shoot enemies when you don't have some type of shield (more on those later) since you're completely exposed. Switching weapons is fairly simple since holding down the right D-pad button pauses the game briefly so you can choose your weapon. This allows a tactical advantage and gives you a minute to think.There are a lot of useful weapons in the game, but my favorite is the BM00001 which is a Chimeran weapon that shoots plasma rounds, but secondary fire charges these and they can be bounced around and kill multiple enemies (they home in on the enemy). Charging all 45 rounds can make a super powerful shot and kills up to 3 enemies at once. Another useful weapon is he sniper rifle which slows down time when you zoom in. Another great (and probably the most fun) is the Auger which has a non-movable deployable shield and can shoot through infinite amounts of solid objects AND even shows you enemies through objects. While ammo for the latter two are scarce...that's the downfall of having fun weapons. While the 7-8 weapons are fun you never feel they're enough and you tend to run out of ammo in the wrong situations.Playing on normal I always had too much ammo when enemies were scarce, but the later levels (trust me there's a LOT of later levels) when you have the most powerful of enemies coming after you in swarms you pinching rounds and that's a no-no in shooters. I felt like I was playing a survival horror than a TPS. I never even bothered finishing the whole since 1. The game got to damned frustrating since late in the game too many enemies are thrown at you at once with scarce health and ammo. 2. The game seemed to never end since I was 6 hours into the game and had no idea where the end was. I know the Syphon Filter games were a bit short, but c'mon this is a PORTABLE game; especially when it's as repetitive as it is. You feel you're just wiping out enemy after enemy and this gets boring about half way through. Sure there are some FPS mech sections (they're pretty fun), but a lot of the game is just repetition. Don't get me wrong the game is completely playable, but the last half feels tacked on and stretched thin.The game has great boss fights, cool weapons, good mechanics, and amazing visuals. These are some of the best on the PSP and if you've played SF: Logan's Shadow you'll know what I'm talking about. The game's story is really only for Resistance fans and I know I would have had to have played previous Resistance games to have understood this. The multiplayer however is what keeps you coming back.If you played SF multiplayer you'll know what I'm talking about. The maps are pretty big, there's little lag, and everything's easy to navigate so you can jump right in. Of course you can collect intel like in the SF games, and there are skill points (Ratchet & Clank fans know what these are), but they are really hard to get since you have to just be lucky and do something right. Think of these as Xbox 360 achievements or PS3 Trophies, but without knowing how to get them...yeah kind of dumb. To be honest this whole game is for Resistance fans only, but this is also some of the best portable action you're going to get.Oh by the way: YOU CAN CHANGE THE CONTROL SCHEME!!!

{"product_name":"B0050SYY5E","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Wertz \"Imautobot\"","summary":"Like watching a Greek Tragedy.","reviewText":"Before I begin, let me say that I own Halo 1,2,3, and Reach.  I've even read some of the books.By the time I got to Reach, my love of the franchise had dwindled quite a bit, but I played the hell out of Halo in LAN parties and I really felt I needed Halo CE Anniversary so I could experience some quality nostalgia.I played through the whole campaign, and it's pretty much the same.  Though it would seem there was a plot point added involving a cutscene where Guilty Spark 343 has a conversation with an unidentified construct.  I don't recall that being in the original and If 343 Industries intends to change Halo history, then I'm going to be a tad miffed.  Or should I say, more miffed.I expected this to be a multiplayer gem.  It's not.  First mistake, they didn't remake all the original Halo multiplayer maps, or if they did, they aren't included on the disc.  Second mistake, NONE of the maps are on the disc!  You need a download code which is included, so access to XBL is essential.  Third mistake, not making the consumer aware of this before purchase.I expected this game to have NO fewer features than the original, and I am livid that there are only 6 multiplayer maps available and that they aren't even all from the original Halo.  I feel like I was robbed, and I am expecting 343 Industries to try and sell me the other half of the game VIA DLC.  I will not buy that.  I bought the original, I bought the sequels, and I've had enough.  This idea that you can nickel and dime your customers to death has been played out by EA.  If you're going to pull that crap you need to release the base game for free like Farmville and make your money solely off the DLC.Does the game look nice, yes.  I'll give it that.  It's even kind of neat that you can switch between the 2 game engines.  But even at the most intense moments, the game still seems to suffer from nasty frame rate issues, which is kind of sad because graphically I think they could have made it look better.  Just a hunch, but that limitation is probably caused by the hardware being made to run both engines simultaneously.Also, I realize that it's basically the same single player game that was produced 10 years ago.  But having played so many other games since then, you become aware of just how stupidly repetitive the campaign is.  By the time you're trying to get the index and following 343 around like a lap dog you begin to be so annoyed that you want to shoot yourself in the head.  Which loops back to the main problem.  Halo's saving grace was always the multiplayer.  Releasing this without all the original maps makes this game essentially worthless.  I mean the very LEAST they should have done was port the original maps over without bothering to gussy them up.  Just having those available for online multiplayer would have made it a worthy purchase.  But I guess they settled for the least they could have done instead of the least they should have done.So this is where I part ways with the Halo Franchise.  I'm not giving you another penny.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2011"}

As far as the game goes the visual graphics and gameplay have been slightly improved, nothing major but it already looked so it's not like alot needed to be changed.  Something I did see an improvement on was the Defense, on both sides of the ball.  Its easier to keep up with your opponent as opposed to last year where you'd get burned by just reaching in.  And you can say good bye to those easy pick-n-roll buckets because the AI will pick it off most of the time unless its well passed.

Enter the Nintendo Wii remote.Obviously you're allowed to aim with the Wii remote as the ubiquitous laser sight is replaced with an ever-present cross hair.  This allows for considerably better accuracy and reaction time.  My first time through my accuracy was around 75% (I know, I'm a terrible person) and my reaction time was pitiful.  With the Wii edition my accuracy went up to 90% and better reaction time.  The downside is the cross hair is always there and can be slightly annoying; I think the laser sighting would've been more appropriate and only present when aiming.  Another downside is you cannot aim scoped weapons (rifles and launchers) with the Wii remote, but with the nunchuck.  It might be better to have allowed aiming with the Wii remote similar to Call of Duty 3 but that's my preference.Pertaining to the gameplay and graphics they're almost no different than the PSXII or Gamecube version; if there is a difference I certainly didn't notice it.  Don't let this deter you as the gameplay makes up for that and if you're like me and started with the Gamecube version, you get all the bonuses of the PSXII version only you can aim better.  You get the five chapters of Separate Ways (Ada's quest), the special costume 2 set (mafia outfit and Thompson for Leon and the suit of armor for Ashley (annoying to hear but boy it comes in handy A LOT in the castle).Lastly, there's one Wii exclusive element and that is the trailer for Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles... and there was much rejoicing (Monty Python \"yay\").  Not much cool stuff for the Wii but oh well.  The release price, however, sets it apart from other Wii titles to the point where it's cheaper than most to purchase.Overall RE4 for Wii is worth purchasing if you're a Wii owner; it improves your game and you can still enjoy the classic arcade blowing heads off spree.  Wheee!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2007"}

I mean there are a lot of bad reviews about it and even I rated it about average and gave it two stars for the fun factor cause of the controls. I spen the whole weekend playing and then got cramps in my left hand from pressing the R2 button just to swing. Look bottomline is that this game is a good rental if you get it from gamefly and give it a good try. But for me it just was not fun cause of the handcramps and it just was not that fun to keep up with it. Give it a try you might like it. I grew up on BC and had a lot of fun playing the other titles. This just felt rushed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2009"}

Great stealth type gameplay (if your into that)2. Quite challenging if you want to make it through the game without killing anyone. (can also be a con)3. Story is interesting.4. Characters are different.5. A bit of a bioshock feel to it. (could also be a con)6. Not afraid to be a new story.7. It went on slightly longer then I expected.Cons-1. It kinda takes a few things from other games.2. It might not allow for a sequel.3. You have to work your bum off in order to get the good ending it seems like.4. The story can become predictable after a certain point.Detailed summary:I got interested in this game right when I saw the mask on the cover. I had heard about it a bit here and there when it was first being teased. I kept it on my radar but didn't pay to much attention to it at first. Then later on after the price had gone down I payed a bit more attention to it and saw it looked quite fun so I got it.If any of you have seen game play trailers and such you can already spot that the game takes a few ideas from other games. That isn't always a bad thing but just something worth noting.I found the story to be slightly interesting (maybe not the best but still pretty good). Near the middle of the game though it can be slightly predictable what is going to happen.You are stuck with 2 main weapons. You get a sword and a crossbow/pistol for weapons. You do get to switch out the sword for special powers however they are only a few extra ones and they are limited by how much (mana?) you have. Some of the powers are fun but in order to upgrade them all the way or get enough variety you need to go find these special things.The main way I played was stealthy. The other ways could be quite difficult at times. I have found though that sometimes it felt like there really was no way to bypass certain areas just doing stealth. And with certain stealth areas you would have to wait, studying the routes the guards/enemies go over and over again just to find the best spot to go through or strike.There was little secrets and cool places to go around but for the most part there were only a handful of buildings you could actually go in, in this game. Each level had a few where you could only go in one room and out through the other window. That is a minor problem though.And for the story at one point I felt I was getting close to the end but was surprised to find it kept going a bit longer.One character in particular is one I would like them to go into more detail with if they make more games which is the man you receive your powers from. He is someone who you can be unsure of and also mesmerized by. That kind of quality isn't found often and when you do it seems like it doesn't last long before you lose that character.One con that was quite annoying at the end of the game was that there is some ways you have to play in order to get the very good ending. There appears to be three endings. A good, a neutral, and a bad ending. I killed a few guards near the beginning of the game unaware of how to bypass them and that I should try not to kill them but for most of the game I only knocked out the enemies yet I ended up with an evil ending it seemed. I was quite annoyed by that. The only way to figure it out is if you get lucky or look it up online on how to get the certain endings and its still somewhat criptic. It appears you have to be less &#34;chaotic&#34; or something like that to get the good ending. Although a lot of online guides don't expand on what that means. So even with trying not to kill all the guards/enemies you can still end up with the ending you don't desire.All in all it was a fun game. Although it felt like it didn't leave much room for a sequel at least not with the main characters. It wrapped it all up in the last scenes which is a shame. I expect they will make a sequel but it will be a completely different character.I would say its fun and you should give it a try if you like what you see in the trailers and pictures. It can be quite challenging from a stealth standpoint. I hope this review has helped at least one person in their decision on this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2013"}
