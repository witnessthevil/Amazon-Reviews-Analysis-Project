{"product_name":"B0000A03CX","description":"Build and successfully run a farm, plus build a successful life with family and friends. Takes the best qualities of the Harvest Moon series and adds more animals, more vegetables and more drama.","reviewerName":"GintaxAlvissforever","summary":"A Simple Harvest Moon Game For Beginners","reviewText":"This was my first Harvest Moon game in the series and it's very memorable for being ridiculously wrong and not giving you that many options (not like a beginner would notice).You're given a farm (which I admit is actually the biggest and most generous farm in the entire franchise) with a cow and some tools and you just make a living. Now you would think the game goes fast given there are 10 days per season but then you realize that the clock is VERY slow. You have to find something to do and go to bed on time...actually the game doesn't allow you to go to bed on time without waking up at a specific time without an alarm clock (that you can only get during year 2). So you have to estimate when to go to bed and make sure you don't oversleep.The game's time overall is inconsistent making it \"more realistic\". The game rains whenever it feels like it, snows when it's sunny and sometimes having thunder storms. As they say, \"The weather man is never right!\" And it applies to this game.It gets worse when some years take forever to complete because of the short time. Year 3 takes 120 days in game before you can move to year 4 and that will basically ruin your chances of having fun and going to the next chapter of yoru life (and the worse part is this is the point in the game where you'll probably have every item you can afford in game).Besides the farm though, there isn't much to do outside of the farm like other Harvest Moon games. You can talk to the villagers, play some games, fish and mine but that's about it given how small the valley is.The game forces you to marry in the 1st year (40 days) or get a game over (yes you get a game over if you don't marry). You can only choose from 3 (4 in the special edition) girls in the town. All have different personalities and they're all easy to woo (except Nami who can be wooed in the fall but that's 10 days to get her to fall for you and that by itself is difficult). The thing is that the game will make you feel horrible for not marrying the other two girls and whoever you don't marry, year 2 shows how much you screwed them over (Nami goes back home if you don't marry her but comes back if her friendship was high and you trigger an event). Which is another thing. Time really passes in this game and characters move in, die or are born as a result of being in this valley. The game goes for 5 years and you do die after your child becomes an adult and makes a decision on his career choice.My final verdict? It's one of the more tedious Harvest Moon games with limited options in everything you do AND sell (the merchant will buy off anything from you but it couldn't be like other games where you put it in the shipping box) but the cool thing is the aging of the child to an adult and the fact you can cross any type of fruit and vegetable to get a second generation and a third generation fruit you name yourself and can make a lot of money because of it. I would personally buy the other Harvest Moon games for a game that goes faster, more options and a better story overall because there really is no story in the game that drives you to do anything.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000TVT8PI","reviewerName":"A. C. Ege/Acedoh \"acedoh\"","summary":"A Leap Forward in So Many Ways!","reviewText":"For all of you considering the PS3 this is one of the best choices you can make when it comes to home entertainment.  Gaming and multimedia are taken to the next level.First getting my hands on the PS3 made me realize that this is the largest Playstation conosle by volume and weight they have ever come out with. I quickly realized how sturdy and well made this product is. The plastic that is used is solid and heavy duty. I also realized how easy dust and fingerprints attract to the shiny finish which is both plastic and fake chrome. Connecting the PS3 was the easy part. Unlike the Wii and 360 Sony has left the power station inside the console. Which means you only need one heavy duty plug to connect. From the back of the console you have many choices for video and audio outputs. The standard AV outlet is there which allows you to play with the cables it comes with or to buy component cables for high definition viewing. You also have a optical digital output for full digital sound. New to any video game console is HDMI output. This allows you to have the PS3 in full high definiton video and audio. HDMI is capable of a full digital signal allowing 1080p true high definition picture. It is also capable of unleashing 7.1 high definition sound. So audiophiles should be happy about what this console offers. On the front end you get three memory card slots which are hidden behing a plastic door...so as to not diminish the appearance of the PS3. Also they included four USB outlets. This allows you to connect various devices like a photo camera, internet camera, mouse, or even a printer. The Sony PS3 has a feature that allows it to be on standby at all times. Which is similar to the other consoles. I will talk more about this feature on the PS3 further in the review.I would like to cover all the interface options the PS3 accompanies seperately so consumers can become aware of all the advantages this console carries. For those of you familiar with the Playstation Portable this interface is almost exactly the same.You are able to create seperate logins for anyone who uses the PS3. This allows for each person to go online with their information. Although it doesn't really have many more advantages than that right now it is rather insignificant.Next is the system settings. This allows the user to adapt the PS3 to their television and sound system. You can adjust the high defention settings to fit the maximum resolution of your t.v. You also have setting for your blue tooth devices and internet connections. The PS3 comes with built in wi-fi which seems to have a strong connection that gives you almost seamless online use.The PS3 also has a photo viewer. You can download photos by two different means. One is by using your camera and connecting it via USB. I haven't checked to see how viable this option is. Next you can download the pictures with a memory card. This operation is rather simple and downloads are quick. Generally you get your standard slide shows although they have a fun feature. It allows you to view your pictures on a blank canvas as they fall onto the blank canvas. Slide shows are best when you set them to your music.Next is the music player. You can dowload songs by two different means. One being memory card and the other cd. Songs download much quicker via memory card than cd. Although Sony has talked about having downloads via the internet which I think would go over very well. You can listen to music while viewing a feature that uses colors and textures. It is your standard music viewer...nothing special there.I want to talk about one of the most notorious features of the PS3. The Bluray player. Most of you now know what a Bluray player is and does. I have viewed numerous movies on it. I have also viewed these movies on two different hdtv's. One a 1080p and a 1080i. I really did not notice much of a picture difference. After viewing a few movies on the XBox 360 hddvd player and the PS3 Bluray player I really did not notice much of a difference. One thing I have noticed about hd movies is that the ones more than a couple years older have a slightly grainy appearance since they were remastered for high definition. Newly made movies appear crystal clear with vivid colors and tremoundous definition. The PS3 does allow you to view regular DVD's which can make the transition that much easier.  The regular DVD movies are upscaled on your HDTV allowing an excellent picture.  For many of the new movies it is almost difficult to notice a difference in a DVD picture and Blu-ray picture.Now would be the gameplay part of the interface. This keeps track of the game disc you may have in the player or also games or demos that you have downloaded. This interface is rather simple and easy to negotiate. For any PS2 owner it also carries your virtual memory card with all your game data. As far as the games go I have played numerous games plus several demos. The games that are non exclusive like Madden Football are deficent on the PS3 compared  to XBox 360 counterparts. The game speed is smooth and polished. The visuals on exclusive PS3 games like Heavenly Sword and Ratchet and Clank is quite impressive. The PS3 seems to create a living vivid environment with the ability to create many textures and surfaces. Game demos like Motorstorm and Gran Turismo HD show what the PS3 is capable of. Amazing graphics and sound quality will become apparent in many of the games this holiday season and beyond. I have also enjoyed the few full games that are downloadable. The games have enhanced hd graphics and are affordable at only $7.99-$9.99. What I have enjoyed is online gaming. With the PS3 you don't have to pay any added fees. The gameplay was seamless and quick and allows you to use a blue tooth headset when playing. I also believe you can use your PS2 headset via USB. The online gaming is virtually the same as the 360.Lastly I will cover the online features of the PS3. On the interface online is a big part. From the browser to having friends and checking your mail. Of course the largest feature is the Playstation store. Which is obviously not very unique. The 360 has a market which could be considered the pedigree for consoles. The Wii is limited to just classic video games. The Playstation store is decent right now with very numerous items to download. You have games, demos, and movie trailers. The store will continue to grow and has a nice feature that allows you to dowload PSone games for the Playstation Portable (PSP). After dowloading it to your PS3 then you transfer it via USB to your PSP. Also a very intriguing feature that I think is really amazing is called remote play. When your PSP is integrated into your PS3 you have the ability to view and listen to stuff on your PS3 anywhere in the world with your PSP. All you need is a wifi connection. I have tried this feature out and it's really enjoyable. I was able to view movie trailers and listen to my music on my PSP. The feature is nice although it is supposed to work when the PS3 is on standby. It did not work for me then. Only when the PS3 was on and set for remote play.There are also two features that are becoming more apparent for owners.  Folding at Home is a beneficial program that works with Stanford University.  The program runs when your PS3 is idle.  What it does is run computations that help scientists work for many cures to diseases.  A beneficial plus to the PS3.  I can vouch for having my PS3 on nonstop 24 hours a day 7 days a week for many months without any problems.  Secondly I want to talk about HOME.  No not your real home but the PS3 program that will be available early 2008.  This program will be a virtual online social interface allowing you to meet numerous other PS3 players.  I have been allowed to participate on the Beta version and I must say this has extreme potential.2008 will be an exciting year for PS3 owners.  The experience is already excellent with over a dozen very good games.  The PS3 will have over a half dozen superb games releasing next year.  Games like Gran Turismo 5, Killzone 2, Little Big Planet, Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy are just the beginning.  If any of these games suit you it would be an excellent reason to own a PS3.In closing I will say without a doubt the PS3 has been quite an experience. I feel the $500 is well worth it for the features you get. Wifi, Bluray, memory card readers, HDMI, and of course the game playing.I believe many of you are on the fence and trying to justify a large scale purchase like this. The games are here and the experience is superb. If you want a wonderful living room centerpiece that will provide numerous hours of use the PS3 is the way to go.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2007"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Still fun despite its flaws","reviewText":"When Capcom announced they would be porting Dead Rising over to the Wii, we all pretty much figured that there would be a number of elements that would be lost in the translation.  Well, there definitely are, but for the most part, Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop still manages to provide some good, zombie slaying fun despite its flaws.  First and foremost, the graphics engine has taken a serious spiral, which has been expected, but seriously, is this the best the game could look on the Wii?  The Wii may not be a technical powerhouse, but you'll find plenty more good looking games on the system.  By comparison, Resident Evil 4 looks better, and that was a last-gen game.  Gameplay wise, taking out hordes of zombies is still plenty fun, even though there aren't quite as many as what was found on the XBox 360 version.  The biggest flaw of the game besides the graphics engine however is the removal of the ability to take pictures, which was a key (and fun) feature in the original game.  Removing using Frank's camera, shrinking down the zombie population, and cutting the corners technically don't quite kill Dead Rising however, as the game still provides enough short bursts of fun to keep you interested.  Besides slaughtering the undead, there is a lot to explore in the shopping mall, and the Wii-mote controls work quite well also.  All in all, Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop may not be the exact same game that hit the XBox 360, but if you don't own one and own a Wii and are looking to have a bit of fun, this game is worth a look at the very least.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2009"}

Mefford","summary":"I wanted to love this","reviewText":"This games is so close but so far away.  I am enjoying playing it but that is marred with constant frustrations and annoyances.The game will lockup on you.  Generally while loading, but occasionally at other times.  You will have to stand up and walk over to your Xbox and hard reboot to get going again.  This happens so frequently that it is to be expected amongst a party that someone will drop and be missing for a bit.Installing the game to the hard drive greatly mitigates the lockup problem, though not completely.Sometimes the frame rates in this game drop so low that it becomes unplayable.  Specific areas on some maps are especially challenged in this regard, so much so that they must be avoided during game play.There are glitches in the saving of progress.  I had to re-start a chunk of the campaign in order to move forward because something did not save correctly the day before, when I was seconds from the final cinematic.  My friend lost all of his campaign progress to such a glitch and now will have to restart the entire campaign in order to complete it.Server browser and matchmaking is old school.  Find a server manually and jump in, let your friends know which one so they can join you, hopefully there is still space.  The filters are not effective and show full servers when you say you want 1-5 open slots only.  Once you are all on the same server, just pray their is room on the same team and squad.  Why you cant create and join as a squad is beyond me.Textures are very dumbed down. I suspect this was the way to make the game scale from Xbox 360 to Xbox One.  Use low quality textures and then you dont have to tweak the polygon count as much.  I expect this game to look much better on Xbox One.Many maps are too large for the team sizes.  It is clear they were constructed for the epic battles to come on the Xbox One platform.  But the maps feel empty on the current generation.This game punishes the beginner.  After the first week I was ready to snap this disc in two and never play it again.  The weapons you start with don't kill flies let alone your opponents.  The sites are poor and your equipment options lacking.  Meanwhile you are having your head repeatedly popped by some clown not even a pixel tall on top of a tower a mile high with a 40x scope.  With some persistence you start to get some functional weapons, but it is a slow road, when competing with kids that are able to play full time, and have now unlocked everything.  There was no concern for balance in this game.Vehicles are a constant frustration.  A good pilot can dominate an entire team.  The weapons you have to stop the vehicles are only moderately effective.  It literally takes a team to effectively take down a vehicle.  I.E. one man sighting with another shooting to score high damage hits, or multiple players firing rockets at the vehicle.  The veteran players driving these vehicles will disable the inexperienced driver in seconds.  A tank takes about 5 rocket hits before it is disabled unless it is being repaired, in which case you cannot reload rockets fast enough to out pace the repair. Perhaps as I rank up I will unlock some amazing vehicle stopper, but for now they are a threat that can really make the game not fun at times.  Your first attempt to get even by flying a helicopter yourself will quite likely end with the helicopter upside down in flames in seconds.So that all said this game has alot going for it.  The maps are unique and open.  There is a wide variety of multiplayer modes. There is a wide variety of weapons.  It really isn't terribly too hard to get your team together on a squad, but it does take a couple rounds on a server.  It is very fun and rewarding to a tactical team that works together.  The campaign is very well done so far.To give some perspective, I am an older gamer.  I grew up playing Doom and Quake. Eventually I graduated to Rainbow Six.  I was strictly a PC Gamer, but got tired of buying a new video card with every release.  Finally I decided to move to console. I enjoyed the Rainbow Six games there until a very excellent game came out, Modern Warfare (the original).  Two unfortunate things happened though with this release.  First they ripped off so many features from Rainbow Six and stole the fan base that the Rainbow Six franchise died. Second, Infinity Ward party ways with Activision and Activision reheated and served the same soup six years in a row calling it revolutionary each time because they added another vegetable to the soup.  It was still vegetable soup.So I have been looking for a new game.  Something a bit more tactical, where I can join my friends and compete against others and it matters that we are working together.  I tried BF3 but was late to the game and couldn't get into it.  I really had high hopes for this game and while it is enjoyable, the lockups, terrible frame rates, low quality textures and general unfinished quality of the game mar the experience.  I guess it was just that important to beat COD by a week, that they shipped unfinished.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2013"}

It's OK but it gets boring kinda fast.There are various games to play but only some of them are fun. I have yet to unlock all of the games but I must say that the \"Piano Player\" mini game is by far the worst. It doesn't feel intuitive and I was actually looking forward to it.\"Rock Paper Scissors\" is fun though once you get the hang of it. But it drags out too long.One of my favorites is \"Memory Sprint\" which basically has you following one of the men as he is in a race. Many men will pass him and you have to see what place he finishes in. He will be passed first and then he will gain speed and fall back again over and over until he hits the finish line.

Convery","summary":"Huge style points.","reviewText":"Manhunt for PS2 is an awesome gaming experience.  I picked the game up about a year ago.  I haven't finished it yet (like quite a few games on my shelf) but it's one I really need to go back to and finish.Why style points?  Because it oozes with a style that works.  Dark, gritty, voyeuristic violence.  The James Earl Cash/Director relationship is a satire on how far TV will go to satisfy a sick demand.  Satire done well, indeed.The whole ghetto is wired, video cameras dangling from graffitied brick.  The whole setting for the game is dark, giving James Earl Cash a clandestine shroud.  Gang members patrol the streets, knowing their end of the Director's bargain, knowing that some wussbag is on the loose (JEC) in these slums.In game controls are as good as you'd expect from the GTA games.  You'll really need to prove your mastery of controller when you've been discovered and decide to flee the gang of scvmbags chasing you.  I give controls 4/5 stars.The gameplay is perfect.  Know that Manhunt is a creepy-crawler; slow moving game, wait till the gangbangers got their back to you, release yourself from the dumptsers shadow, make your move.  Pray no scvmbag allies are in the vicinity as you execute a mild/medium/hard attack on your victim.  If you're clear, drag the remains to an alley or behind your respite of a dumpster.  This is the sum of the gameplay.  If this doesn't sound fun, don't bother.  Personally, I enjoy taking my time with a game such as this.  Miniscule (if any) amount of guns ablazing in open areas.  Another area to note in Gameplay, is the optional use of the PS2 headset.  Right, put it on and use your voice to attract enemies.  Very nice touch, being that the Director alsos communicates to you through this headpiece.Graphically speaking, Manhunt is great.  The style is dripping like coagulating gang member blood.  The atmospheres are so moody, the Director takes you to slums, garbage dumps, cracked out tenements (Max Payne reminscing).  Environments are perfect for this type of game.  Style points also alotted to the villians, especially Smiley Face Gangster.  Love the irony.Final Note:  It's an uproariously controversial game.  Manhunt begs the question of \"how far is too far\".  Taken in context, however, viewing the total picture as situational, and dare I say art, Manhunt is a very gitty and grimy experience that loses nothing if you can appreciate heavy dark satire.  Which brings me to my next point in saying that none of Manhunt is done \"just for the sake of being so\".  That award (gulp) goes to \"State of Emergency\".  But you already know about that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2005"}

{"product_name":"B002TDIEEK","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"What Street Fighter 4 should've been in the first place.","reviewText":"I only played Street Fighter 4 a couple of times before I realized that I just plain didn't like it. And that's pretty bad coming from someone who grew up with the series, playing the first incarnation of Street Fighter 2 when it hit arcades in the early 90s. Something seemed off to me, balance was horrible, and the online modes were lackluster. Plus it seemed like there was a lot missing that they could've put in, but didn't just so they could make the release date. Sure enough, Super Street Fighter 4 was announced just a few months later. So I waited, and once I saw gameplay of the new characters and the changes they made to the original cast, I went and pre-ordered it, knowing I wouldn't be disappointed. Obviously, I wasn't, given the title of this review and the ratings, and anyone who was disappointed with the first SF4 should at least give this a rental/borrow.First things first, the new characters. While I wish they would've added a few more unique characters (like Oro, so then we could have the 4 true masters in one title finally!), the characters they added all rock for the most part, and getting to see Dudley take on Balrog is something that needs to be seen for yourself in order to experience the gentlemanly bad-assedry. Juri's pretty rad too, and once I played as her in the Training mode just to see her moves, I could see why there are so many people playing as her online. The original cast from SF4 got changed here and there, like some attacks having different priority, being slowed down, or not being invincible during an EX move. Sagat and Ryu were notorious for being god-like in the previous version, and here...they're still pretty tough, but not -as- impossible to take down as they were. Trust me when I say that if you play competitively, the tiers list will be quite different from the SF4 tiers. Heck, I think Cody's an automatic upper tier just because his knife attacks do chip damage while being blocked and one of his Ultras can almost always hit you when you're on the ground.Online modes have been revamped as well, and it's so much better from what it used to be. There's little to no lag most of the time when I'm playing people in the same region, though sometimes there'll be a quick freeze for both players, and then it goes back to normal. Endless Battle is similar to the mode in the Dead or Alive 2 remake for Xbox, where a person hosts a game, then others keep playing them until they're defeated. This can be a true test of skill if you think you're all that. I still wish there was a way to do rematches when a match ends in the Ranked Battle, so I wouldn't have to go right back to the Network menu to pick another match type, but it's not that big of a complaint. I did have some problems with trying to join another person's Ranked Match. Sometimes it would say that there was a problem, and ask if I wanted to try again, only to have another problem. If this happens to you, just host your own game. SSF4 is so hot, there's ALWAYS someone to play against. Heck, look at Super Street Fighter 2 HD Remix- there's ALWAYS someone to play against on there too, and that thing's been out for a while.There are a few extra features, like titles and icons you can earn through Arcade, Network and Challenge modes, and there's also a completely new set of trophies to earn here. Nope, they didn't just port over the old list from SF4, everything's new and you'll have to earn them again. Costume packs from SF4 transfer over to SSF4, and that 'bonus' that Capcom talked about for people who have their SF4 files still saved...is just an extra color. It's a cool filter [that only works for the original color] that gives you a comic book look, similar to the style in Valkyria Chronicles. Capcom also gave a couple of characters an extra Rival scene in Arcade mode, but unfortunately, Gen and Akuma didn't get one. The opening and ending animated scenes are still horrible, but eh, how often do fighting games get good endings in Arcade mode? I would've liked Capcom to have finally made a Story mode like what Guilty Gear and BlazBlue had. They've been sitting back while the fans figure out what's actually going on with the story for way too long. Even the endings here, which are completely different from those in SF4, don't explain much if they have anything to do with the story, and what they do explain is often left for you to figure out (like Akuma's).The graphics remain the same from SF4 of course, but the new animations for new Ultras can range from incredible to incredibly goofy (like Akuma's new Tasmanian Devil Ultra). There are a lot of new tracks to listen to, and I'm happy to say all of them are just as memorable as the old themes from the first Street Fighter 2. You gotta love Cody's theme, and especially the new Dudley mix. As with the last game, you can also set the voices to English or Japanese...or mix and match and choose who you want to speak either language. 'very good for those people who whine about 'omg da english subs sux0rz' all the time and think it affects gameplay.All in all, despite the few problems here, I'm glad I waited for this. Oh heck, I was actually hyped for this game, and I -never- get like that for anything. While I love BlazBlue, Street Fighter tends to be the fighting game series that I always play the most, and with SF4, it looks like it'll be staying that way for a while. Now if Guilty Gear X3 comes out...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2010"}

And there have been a lot of great RPG's in the past as well.  Baldur's Gate is a great RPG that seems to have fallen right in the middle of the golden age of RPG's however.Few can deny the ease one can slip into a game of Diablo or Dungeon Siege.  Few can argue how fun it is to build a deep character on Everquest or Arcanum.  However, few of these games ever appealed to me like BG did.  Here is why...First, Baldur's Gate makes the unusual RPG decision to let the gamer control ALL of the party members, their every move and spell, something I wish was picked up more for other RPGs.  This means that while maybe its not very \"realistic\" the player can really be sure what direction a battle goes.  Also, BG lets players pause and give commands at will and does not give the player any trouble with setting up chains of spells or items.  This is nice.  Finally, BG is very story driven and, not unsurprising, the story is fantastic.  You play as the son of a dead god who is swept away by the currents of your destiny.  Between Shadows of Ahm and Throne of Bhaal, your avatar will be put through many a grinder and it will amaze you how great it all is.Some have found BG less fun because of its hardcore D & D roots.  Armor is counted by how many dice roll points are removed from each attack i.e. a -13 armor must be attacked by a +3 weapon and a dice roll of...10.  It's more complicated than that though.  I obviously managed to play the game without really knowing what was going on technically so most others can too.  Its surprisingly idiot proof.  Also, for those of you out there who like to gather stuff in game, BG is awesome because the magic items not only each have a story but are wonderfully varied rather than being simple level ups or + weapons.  It adds a little something.Problems?  Besides replacing crack in most lives as the new addiction, BG has few.  There are some persistent bugs that even the newest patches fail to fix and, for all its efforts to the contrary, getting into the game at first can be a hurdle.  Graphics are dated by any standard and will not drop any jaws as Dungeon Siege did.  Naturally none of this really effects playability but it's worth noting.  Lastly, the story is great, no doubt.  Some people, however, may not like how it ends.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2004"}

Using a sword and shield, you'll slash your way through five beautifully detailed worlds. Power-ups can be found in chests and won through fighting enemies, but require being equipped in \"lock spots\" should you want to keep them even if you die (you start out with three lock spots, but one more is obtained each time you beat a boss). The cinemas are a nice addition to the story, and the overall length of the game is about right (it will most likely take about 7-10 hours to beat the first time through). The only flaws that bring down Maximo are the occasionally frustrating camera and difficulty. The camera doesn't exacty give you free reign, as often you will find yourself in the corner trying to position it while taking a few hits. Also, some of the later levels may prove to be too frustrating for some. The control is perfect, it's just that there are a lot of tricky jumps and slippery areas that make the game a little more tedious than it should be. Still, I've played games in my day that were much more stressful and annoying, so it's tolerable. Ultimately, Maximo achieves the task of combining old style gameplay with a 3D environment, and could well be considered a classic years from now.

Having one cartridge lets up to four GBA players compete in one  minigame. Gamers can play two additional minigames if each player owns a  cartridge.

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular.

I had seen the commericals and I'm an Xbox fan, so I was glad to get something a little different than the usual RPGs or Shoot-em-ups I always play.From the very start, this game bothered me; you have to &#34;install&#34; it, meaning, you can't play this on a normal XBox 360 with 4 Gigs of storage.  You need close to 8 gigs to &#34;install&#34; the game before you can play it.  The game is TWO discs; one to &#34;install&#34; it, and the other is the game itself.  I had to take a memory card and hook it up to my 360's USB port, and thankfully, that worked.  It took awhile to &#34;install&#34;, but I did get the game working.  I understand the need to do that - but I don't like it.  A game should work on a system despite the system's limitaitons; every Nintendo 64 game worked with the Nintendo 64. You didn't need more memory or storage - that's the rule.  That's the whole reason why we buy consoles; so we don't have to worry whether or not a game will work correctly.Despite my not liking it's intall procedure, the game is OK.  The graphics are really good, the control is rock-solid (although I question some of the buttons usage), and it's very much like a GTA feel, only you're a hacker instead of a madman.  The gameplay is fun - you hack nearby items, cameras, doors, etc.  You distract people and sneak by.  You trail people, try to catch them / hurt them.  But - and here is my main flaw - if you mess up, if you are &#34;caught&#34; or seen, the game will end and you have to wait a good minute or so for it to re-load some prior saved game.  You can only save the game in your hotel room or certain safehouses; very GTA Vice City.  How come I can't save wherever and whenever I want???  The game-over-reload screen killed me and made the game tedious rather than fun.It didn't live up to the hype, which was disappointing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2014"}

Working in the proximity of the palace, Leonard stumbles on a plot to kidnap the enigmatic Princess Cisna. As he helps her escape he also becomes aware of his connection to a transformative power which allows him to take on the ancient shape, and harness the devastating power of the White Knight. Yet there are other elements at work here as well, including the forces of an evil wizard with powers that stretch back to the same ancient times which produced the White Knight. With the help of his friends and the power of the White Knight, these are the forces that Leonard will have to face in his quests.GameplayWhite Knight Chroniclesis a Japanese RPG (JRPG) centered around a turn-based battle system in a local single player story-driven campaign that is supported by online multiplayer functionality. Gameplay questing occurs from a third-person perspective and follows Leonard and up to three other AI companions, which can include the customizable character that players assume in multiplayer mode. Once quest members are assembled, players utilize the strengths of the overall group as a whole, and are able to switch between characters at will. Combat being turn-based, players must be able to cue up and control the actions of each character in quick sequence for each combat scenario faced. The game facilitates this via the Function Palette, located in its Battle Preparation menu, allowing players to prepare in advance a series of commands for each character to carry out. These can involve magic or weapons use and can be merged into combos. Multiple palettes can be saved, making it possible to optimize actions for specific types of enemies, and making for quick changing of commands. As with any RPG, throughout quests players accumulate experience which allows their character to level up, purchase items and abilities and generally grow stronger with an eye towards besting the increasingly challenging creatures, bosses and situations faced.Online MultiplayerAlong with a compelling single player campaign,White Knight Chroniclesalso contains an exciting online multiplayer component. Within this, up to four players can engage in more than 50 multiplayer quests, with each player creating their own unique customizable character which can be leveled up in a combined group effort, and take advantage of created items and new skills. Although unique to the online game mode, which is designed for multiplayer action, these quests can also be played alone if players wish. In addition to this functionality available in the online multiplayer mode also includes a variety of ways to interact with the widerWhite Knight Chroniclescommunity on the PlayStation 3 platform. Included in this is town building through the Georama functionality, which allows players to construct a town to their own specifications that can be populated offline with characters from throughout the single player campaign and then taken online where it serves as a base for quests hosted by players, as well as a persistent online location that other players can visit and buy items your town's population has for sale. The game also offers an online interface known as GeoNet that allows players to communicate with others via blogs, forums, quest logs and voice chat functionality, as well as post snapshots from their journeys using the Crystal Camera in-game tool.Key Game FeaturesWhite Knight Transformation- During single player combat players can transform into the giant White Knight, gaining the ability to challenge large enemies as well as troops of soldiers throughout the adventure.The Customizable Avatar Character- Using a wide array of sliders and customization options, players are able to create a unique character that can join the adventure in single player mode as well as online.Combo Battle System- Engage in an accessible, active turn-based battle system that caters to players of all levels allowing both default attack settings and a system for for maximum damage.JRPG (Japanese RPG) Action for PS3- Experience true JRPG action on PS3 that incorporates a variety of online gameplay elements.Beautiful Environments- Players traverse through 13 stages, as well as visit up to six towns/villages to visit and purchase items at shops or interact with NPCs.

{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Darth Borg","summary":"I really enjoyed Diablo 3","reviewText":"My story is simple enough. I was planning to re-activate my world of warcraft account so I logged into my account and I see a free trail of the starter edition of Diablo 3 which is essentially first 13 levels of the game. I had so far not bought Diablo 3 because I have seen so many negative reviews everywhere and didn't wanted to spend my money on it. So I was like well the starter edition is free till level 13, let me try it first and experience myself the hell-spawn that many are claiming Diablo 3 to be. To my utter amazement I was hooked onto the game long before even reaching level 13. There is just something about the hellish/demonic angle of the game, the utter fun of hacking'n'slashing all these demons into a red gooey mess with body parts flying everywhere and of course the shiny loot gathering. I also find the graphics very nice (on maximum settings), the world is nicely detailed and the dungeons really immerse you into the feeling of what a journey through hell might be and the game very much reminded me of the first two Hellraiser movies. So I went ahead and bought the game and have not regretted a single day of my play-through having paid good money for the game.Well I have just finished my first play through as a Barbarian and now replaying the game as a Demon hunter. I have played Diablo 2 and its expansion many years ago..I think almost a decade ago and had great fun with it. And coming to play Diablo 3 so many years later I found it to be a worthy successor to Diablo 2. Yes, I might criticized for saying just what I did but I am a casual player who is just looking for some fun/exciting game-play on the weekends and I got that from Diablo 3 in spades. I found the four acts entertaining, nicely paced and boss battles were enjoyable plus I really liked the some of the achievements which looks to be lot more tailored to your game play. Some of the companions story-lines were also engaging and I liked the constant banter with them much like the Dragon Age series as it makes the game world feel a little more alive. I also enjoyed crafting in the game which is exactly how I like a virtual profession to be; not complex or anything just being functional and not boring or becoming a repetitive chore (at least at the normal level).So in a nutshell I will recommend that you at least try the 'starter edition of Diablo 3' (which is free) and make up your own mind. The first thirteen levels are more than enough for you to know whether you will like or hate the game rather than base your opinions on others. I personally have had great fun playing Diablo 3 and feel my monies spent were worth it. The disclaimer is that I am a casual player who likes the hack'n'slash genre and is not into any really involved aspects of the game like the pvp (though I may try it if they ever implement team-based battlegrounds) or gearing up your character with the best tier armor/weapons/builds or trying all difficulty levels  etc. Just like Diablo 2, I will most likely take 2 classes up-to max level via normal difficulty and be done with Diablo 3 until the expansion gets released which I have heard is on its way. And that is great news to me... :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2013"}

It combines fun action, stealthy sneaking around (much like Metal Gear Solid), riddle solving and all around love for the source material. You can tell a lot of effort went into making this game for both hardcore fans and those just looking for a good time.Of course it wouldn't be Batman without all the toys. The gadgets are so much fun, whether you are grappling up a wall or controlling a batarang to take out hordes of enemies. You can't help but think of Jack Nicholson saying \"Where does he get those wonderful toys\" as you unlock more and more of Batman's arsenal. I also love how the hand to hand fight scenes play out. You can string along massive combos and counters by free flowing from one opponent to the next. The two vision modes are pretty cool, but I feel you have to stay in detective mode more often that I would have liked. It's neat finding all the little secrets, but you loose the detailed graphics when hunting for clues. Minor gripe aside, this game also has great voice acting from Kevin Conroy (Batman) and Mark Hamill (The Joker), who steals the show as expected. You can expect a movie quality story and dialogue to go along with the eye catching graphics.Easily worth a buy, whether you think you're a Batman fan or not. If nothing else, this should help hold you over until Christopher Nolan's next Batman flick. Heck, make this into a movie.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2009"}

I skipped buying the Wii when it came out cause I wasn't into the motion controller idea. I played other peoples systems and liked it well enough just not enough to fork over my money. I was never a fan on Nintendo's poor 3rd party support. And I knew the specs were basically a slightly souped up gamecube.So when the big N advertised that they were going to try to shift away from being a company that depends mainly on first party games to survive to be more competitive I was interested.The big game pad controller is like some sort of amalgamation of an tablet PC and a gameboy. (Maybe a supersized DS.)I got my hands on one of them and hooked it up. Setting the system up is no more difficult than any of the other ones out there these days, If you can set up a Wii, and Xbox, or a PS3 you can handle this.The update. Yes it is about an hour long and if you mess it up you can potentially ruin your system. (do NOT power it down while updating it.) But again it is nothing new. My PS3 had to do a half hour update when I opened it up as did my X box.The system is small. about 12\"x6\"x3\". It has no HD, just 8gb of flash memory. Which is clearly sufficient for saves. Where this can be a problem I foresee is downloaded games. 8GB will run out fast. Thankfully it is easy to expand. It has a SD card slot, that can accept the High cap SD cards. 4 USB ports for add ons. (and an external HD is one option) The discs are same size as DVD's and Blue ray. And they seem to have a very high capacity for data on them. (1 disc contains Mass effect 3, the extended cut endings and most of the DLC for the multiplayer,from the ashes DLC, on top of the interactive comic.) To compare that to the Xbox, the game was a 2 disc set with none of that on disc. The PS3 was one disc with none of it again.Now for my big gripe.I do not know what happened here, but I will explain the problem.I took my system over to a friends house to try it out with them on the new SMB Wii u game. Once I set it up the system stopped working. I could get to the main menu and select the game to start, but then it would stay trying to load the software, and not move on. We waited ten minutes. I was afraid I had broken my machine, but once I got home it worked fine as if nothing had happened. So the system was not broken, but it seems taking it over to another place and having a game party may not be an option.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2012"}

Footprints will be left in mud, for example, but only until it rains and then they will wash away. Lara's shirt will also get wet, and she's more likely to lose her grip if she is standing on a slippery, rain-soaked ledge. When the sun comes out, her shirt will dry and the slippery surfaces regain their friction.In Underworld, Lara also has a lot more flexibility in how she makes her way through a level, as there is often more than one way to get from here to there. She can now climb walls with texture and rocky outcroppings to reach areas she previously wouldn't have been able to access.All of these additions have been made to give the game a non-linear, open feel. Players can interactive with the environment by doing things they find to be intuitive, and the game will respond in an appropriate way. When Lara interacts with trees, for example, she will push aside leaves using either one or two hands depending on whether or not she's holding something. These details give a lifelike, immersive sensation to the game.New Melee Combat SystemUnderworld introduces a new melee combat system that requires players to strategically strike with offensive, defensive, and evasive maneuvers. Lara can now attack enemies with different punches, kicks, knees, and other acrobatic onslaughts. Items lying on the ground, such as poles that were previously walked on, can be picked up and swung at enemies. Players can also perform a greater variety of actions with weapons; for example, Lara can now hold onto a ledge with one hand and fire a gun with the other.Realistic Enemy and Animal AIThe AI in Tomb Raider: Underworld has also taken a big step forward--both enemies and animals now make independent decisions based on their surroundings, employ ambush and squad tactics when fighting, and will retreat if deemed necessary.With updated graphics and a more immersive and realistic gameplay, Tomb Raider: Underworld will have both fans and newcomers excited about the newest installment in this popular video game-pinup franchise.Tomb Raider: Underworld is loaded with a new melee combat system, various weapons, and smarter AI for both enemies and animals.","reviewerName":"Matt D.

I just about lost it on the timed motorcycle run through xixalba. A fore warning that you have to save before completing the midgard serpent puzzle or you will be kicking yourself big time! The reason is that you will be doing that motorcycle run at least 20 times before you beat the timer and starting from where you last saved. I didn't save my first time and had to do the whole level from scratch. You might have to google your way out of a puzzle as well because they are way complex. Puzzles within puzzles.

Willard","summary":"Seriously flawed","reviewText":"First and foremost, I have a PC that plays games like Batman Arkham Asylum with no problems and that game looks amazing. Dead Island is so flawed, it is one of those games you just want to give up on after only a short time playing.- It would ONLY install under an administrator account. It refused to run the install under my main account.- It defaulted to medium specs even though my PC is \"High-end\". I set the specs for high details, restarted and it looked aweful. There were serious jaggies and lighting issues (blooming). By the trailers and cut scenes, there's some serious misrepresentation of the developer quality.- Upon game start, there is an axe on the floor and you CANNOT pick it up?? You are forced to search luggage and cabinets for gear and $$ but have no access to any weapons to defend yourself. This is not a fun way to start a game.- Shortly after moving to another floor, you are attacked by magically spawning zombies that you cannot defend against. They block your path to your destination so after dying approximately 10 times, I gave up. I tried sprinting past them...NOPE. I tried leading them away to another area but they kill you in only a few hits so...NOPE.- On the PC there is a point where you have to force your way through a door. It tells you to press \"RS\". What the heck is \"RS\"? There's nothing in the manual about this and there's nothing in the controls section about it. Turns out it means \"Shake your mouse\"??!! Who made this game?A game where you die over and over (and over) just isn't fun to me.The only postives are:- You can choose from 4 interesting charactersBlack woman that is an ex-cop (Specialty - guns  My fav character)Small woman that is Asian (Uses Blades)Average sized white man with a \"Thrown weapons\" specialtyBig black man with a meelee weapon specialtyAll of them are cool characters.- (Positive) If you die, it auto-saved the loot you picked up along the way. You do not have to go back through a room and re-loot it. (Negative) Now.. Auto-save's SUCK and from what I've read, there is 1 save only. At this time, I am not at my home PC so I can't tell you if there is a save option for you on the main screen to overwrite the auto-save. But, it did auto-save somewhat frequently. Sorry I can't give more info on this.I do not recommend buying this game. Sorry. It's more frustrating than it is fun.

One of the games that people were wanting was a Twisted Metal to play on the go. So, Sony gives us Twisted Metal: Head On. I must admit, I've been a Twisted Metal fanatic for quite sometime but this one blows them all away(except for TM2: World Tour and Twisted Metal Black, of course)...quite literally..;). I was simply amazed when I first booted up my PSP and saw Head On in action. It does provide fast-paced vehicular combat and destruction for an addictive pick-up and play experience. The fact that I can play this on the go is what blows me away..I just can't believe it. Out of all the PSP games I have, this is the one that has kept me occupied the longest.There's plenty of replayability in the form of minigames with unlockables and secrets to be had. There are a few secret characters to unlock, both by completing the story mode normally and by finding secrets buried within the levels. The Minigame challenges will unlock added extras for single and multiplayer games, which I won't spoil for you here.Head-On gets it's visual/graphical inspiration from Twisted Metal 2: World Tour. The levels are bright, vivid and colorful.You get 9 levels to do battle on. There's the Big Blue Stadium, Los Angeles, Paris, Egypt, Roman Ruins, Russia, Greece, Monaco, Tokyo--which consists of Tokyo Streets and Tokyo Rooftops. You'll meet Dark Tooth & Tower Tooth(wait'll see Sweet Tooth now) on Tokyo Streets in the end. Let me warn you, though, Tower Tooth is a doozy of a boss to beat. There is a simple way to beat him that involves staying somewhere in the open where he can't get to you but I'll let you figure that one out. The only time you'll have to venture out is to gather ammo. Course, my nephew beat Tower Tooth without my strategy so to each his own--I guess. Again, I warn you, he's tough so you'll have to keep on the go.What bothers me with the game though, not that I'm complaining, is the fact that Incognito could've did so much more with the game. Kinda like they did, somewhat, with Twisted Metal Black. I could think of a hundred different ways to improve on the game. Introducing a few (more appealing) new characters into the fold(like it did in Black), new vehicles, as well as new weapons, different strategies to beat other combatants by.  In order to keep hardcore fans interested, you need to keep the game fresh and new...you know? Maybe Incognito can rectify that if they make a sequel to Head On. That being said, there's nothing more wrong with the game that I could find. It's a fine return to the gameplay of old.Other than that, Head-On is fun-fun-fun..a must have for all PSP owners. It's one of the better ones in the lineup of PSP launch titles.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2005"}

Longtime fans have witnessed it evolve from a typical sci-fi platformer with a threadbare story to a Pixar-style epic with some pretty heavy and universal themes. This review is meant to appeal to both longtime fans and casual gamers looking for a good game to pick up.1. STORY. This is the conclusion to the story that began in \"Tools of Destruction\", yet also a conclusion to the series that began with the original \"Ratchet & Clank\". Any questions lingering since the beginning of the series are answered in the \"Future\" trilogy. As the conclusion to a three-parter, it is both satisfying and occasionally predictable, though there are enough little twists to keep things interesting. Having Ratchet and Clank split up for the majority of the game has been a bone of contention for some, but to me it adds a breath of fresh air to the gameplay as Clank is instead replaced by the ever-amusing Qwark and the only other Lombax left in the universe, Alister Azimuth. Splitting the gameplay between Ratchet's typical platforming and Clank's refreshingly original time-based gameplay makes both characters feel more powerful, if that makes sense. Overall, the story is a fitting conclusion for longtime fans, and is interesting enough to keep newcomers playing. And for those who don't know the story of \"Future\", there's a cutscene at the beginning that explains it all. (4/5)2. GRAPHICS. This is undeniably one of THE best-looking games for the PS3 thus far, and the first Ratchet level alone, Zolar Forest, blows Cameron's vaunted \"Avatar\" straight out of the water. Rendered in beautiful 1080p, or even in 480i standard definition, \"A Crack in Time\" is a sight for sore eyes. The colors pop, the textures haven't looked this good since \"Up Your Arsenal\", the lighting effects are stunning, and the space-based sequences are enough to make any sci-fi buff squeal with delight. From Zolar Forest's glistening waterfalls and brilliant greenery to the shadowy interior of Krell Canyon, the graphics are some of the best I have ever seen and look great on either SD or full-blown HD. (5/5)3. PLAYABILITY. Since I play with \"lock-strafe\" or \"shooter\" mode (the camera \"locks\" to whatever location you put it in, and Ratchet turns with it when a weapon is drawn), I can't say too much about the default camera with Ratchet, but it works brilliantly with Clank. It never gets \"hung up\" or suddenly \"pops\" from spot to spot, either, which is fantastic for an action platformer. As for the controls, they are wonderfully tight and sensitive, so whether you are making daring leaps or fighting in the Battleplex arena, the controls will not fail you. Clank's time-based puzzles are nice additions, as well, being anywhere along the spectrum from simple button-pressing to occasionally mind-numbing brain teasers. They are like Sudoku for gamers. Thankfully, if you get stuck, eventually the option to skip the puzzle will come up, but you will miss out on bolts if you choose to do that! (5/5)5. LENGTH. When I first got the game back in December of 2009, I beat it in thirteen hours by not hardly leaving the PS3 and rushing a bit through the main story on Easy. If you play on Easy, with the story and main missions in mind, without taking too much time out for anything else, you can easily beat this game in less than fifteen hours. The long list of Trophies and Skill Points that come with the game, however, keep the replay value relatively high. The series staple, Challenge Mode, also adds a note of difficulty that is most noticeable when beating the game on Medium and then beginning Challenge Mode on Hard. The difficulty is tailored just right according to its chosen level. Whether you are a casual gamer with little time to spare, or a hardcore longtime fan, the game's length and replay value leaves little to be disappointed about. (4/5)6. SOUND. Undoubtedly one of the best-sounding games for the PS3, as well. Everything from weapon effects to the chatter between enemies to the radio stations sound absolutely amazing. The voice acting is top-notch Hollywood quality. The radio stations that can be played during space-based missions (and continue playing even on the moons) are creative and vibrant, with House of Synth and Deep Space Jams being standouts. The music used for the cutscenes is also top-notch, with the music for the opening and ending cutscenes being definite notables. Some of the background music for worlds can become annoying, however, such as the music used for Vapedia and the Battleplex. Thankfully, there is a Music Volume option in Sound on the Options menu. Additionally, if the chatter from your allies or enemies becomes too annoying, there is also a Speech Volume option. In general, the music makes the game highly atmospheric and immersive, and the sound effects accent all of the above quite nicely. (3/5)7. WEAPONS/ARMOR. Honestly one of the more disappointing aspects. While some weapons such as Mr. Zurkon (now a weapon instead of a device), the Groovitron (also now a weapon), the RYNO V, the Rift Inducer 5000, and the Constructo Shotgun are great additions that will probably be used a lot, the other weapons don't quite stand up to scrutiny. They are rather reminiscent of the selection available in the original \"Ratchet & Clank\" game, though for some, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. There are a few weapons you probably will not purchase at all, unless you are going for the Trophy. Also, the armor selection seems somewhat bland - there is not much incentive for going past the third suit for the Hyperflux armor, considering that on Hard in Challenge Mode you will probably get a good chunk of your health taken out fairly often anyway. Still, being able to upgrade to Omega versions of weapons that have reached Level 5 is nice, and often gives a little \"oomph\" to weapons that previously had none. (3/5)8. OVERALL. Though the game will appeal most to longtime fans (made obvious by the occasional news broadcasts in the radio channels, during which Kip and Pepper will discuss such things as Angela Cross's status as a Lombax), it is still interesting enough for the casual gamer. One can skip \"Tools of Destruction\" (advisable, due to its somewhat glitchy and unstable nature as a PS3 launch title) and the downloadable game \"Quest for Booty\" entirely and not be lost. It's pretty obvious how much time, effort, and dare I say it, love, Insomniac Games put into this title.PROS:- High replay value- Amazing graphics and sound, even on standard-definition screens- Great ending to the entire series- Tight controls- Great time-based and platforming gameplayCONS:- Somewhat short length- Not many weapon choices- Occasionally annoying background music- Battleplex challenges can get really tedious","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2010"}

I purchased the miniature console with several games, and less than a year later I sold it all off. The problem with the Vita to me became apparent. Sony has created this incredible hardware (albeit expensive at the time $250+) and for more than 12 months never treated it like it deserved. The design was beautiful, the OLED screen really made games and HD videos look crisp and clear, and unlike it's predecessor (the PSP) it had REAL miniature analog sticks (something that had been long since criticized on the PSP). Adding the rear touchpad gave it another cool new feature that could be used for anything the studios dreamed up, this concept was also implemented on the PlayStation 4 controller.The PS Vita's interface is almost identical to the PlayStation 3. Unlike the PSP, which used now obsolete 'UMDs' (Universal Media Disc), the Vita uses little game cards instead. Now that the PS4 has been released one of the things Sony has started to do right, has been to implement the use of the Vita with the PlayStation 4 in cross play and remote play situations. What this means is that I could be playing a game on my Vita in one room while my PlayStation 4 is running in another. This is something of a draw for me, and may convince me to go back and purchase another Vita. However, I still find it a bit irritating that there are not enough triple A titles for this incredible little machine.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S.

With or without bluetooth headset is up to you.I'm absolutely addicted to this game. It's an aggressive, action-packed, and diverse third person shooter. The map selection might appear to be limited, but the multiple variations on the maps make each layout play quite differently. Plus a new map download is weeks away.The weapon and vehicle choices are also fun. I, for one, almost never fly the Warhawk (I need more practice). I stick to the tanks, and the land mines are my weapon of choice.The online community is alive and competitive. The servers have many games with up to 32 players. And I'm obsessed with improving my character stats on the \"ranked\" servers (first play user hosted unranked games for practice!). Warhawk isn't a perfect game, but it's great fun and so far, after a few months, I haven't grown bored.But back to my first paragraph. The download version only lets your play Warhawk with the main account on your PS3, while the retail version allows all users to play. So, IF YOU AND YOUR BROTHER BOTH WANT TO PLAY and both want to keep track of your own stats, then the downloaded version is really going to DISAPPOINT you. Buy the disc version and be happy. Also, you can't re-sell the downloaded version. If you buy the disc version and hate the game, at least you can get some of your money back on the used market.The game is loud, has lots of explosions, and nothing but fighting. No story. No master characters. Just random users across the globe doing their best to maul one another. It's great fun! I could do without the bad seeds (potty mouths, ignoramuses) in the online community, but you get that with any online game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000UW21A0","description":"Sony Uncharted: Drake's Fortune 98103 PC Games","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"very solid, enjoyable game","reviewText":"Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is a very fun PS3 exclusive that reminded me a lot of the beloved Tomb Raider series on the original Playstation.  Both games have that Indiana Jones-ish vibe where a charismatic lead character is searching for treasure, all the while overcoming traps, enemies and obstacles.  Both games employ a mix of action, platforming and puzzle solving.  And while Uncharted has drastically scaled back the challenge factor (unfortunately an all too common trend in video games nowadays), it utilizes the capabilities of the PS3 to create a gaming experience that moves wholly past Tomb Raider into something fresh and organic.  Uncharted feels familiar, but is undoubtedly next gen.  Your character is small and vulnerable among such huge and stunning environments, giving the game a very epic feel.  And while not perfect, Uncharted is an extremely fun and satisfying adventure that all owners of a PS3 should experience.The star of this game, to me, is the environments.  As I write this review in late 2010, the game is already three years old but still looks absolutely incredible and is, in fact, one of the best looking games I've played on the console.  Especially in the outdoor settings, the colors are vibrant and everything around you feels very real and alive.  The indoors feel murky and claustrophobic.  There is fine attention paid to detail.  The way the game seamlessly melds the environments between gameplay and cutscenes is very impressive.  It's simply an amazing looking game, and you'll find yourself just stopping your character and moving the camera around so you can take it in.  It's an impressive technical achievement.  The gameplay itself is tight.  Controls were easy to pick up, responsive and accurate.  The platforming was loads of fun and reminded me not only of the aforementioned Tomb Raider games, but also of the games from the old 8 & 16 bit days.  The cinematic feel of the game's events led to some very intense moments that really stand out.  The story was interesting enough to keep me engaged, the characters were very likable, and the dialogue and voice acting was top notch and entertaining.There are a lot of gunfights in this game, and from a control perspective, everything works fine.  It uses a Gears of War-style cover system of combat that suits the game very well.  My problem with the gunfights was that far too often, especially in the first half of the game, you would be needing to battle your way down some sort of narrow corridor, so it was just a matter of covering, waiting for a head to pop out, shooting the head, moving forward a bit more, covering again, and repeating.  There were A LOT of fights like that and it started to feel a bit repetitive after a while.  Fortunately, as you progress further into the game, the majority of the battle environments open up into almost an arena-type scenario that resemble a small map that you would find in a FPS, and the gunfights become much more fun, and much more strategy is required in order to advance.  This is where I really learned to enjoy the combat and found myself wishing there were more battles like that earlier in the game.Also, it's a short game.  I beat it in 11 hours, but it could've been done quicker if I had wanted to.  Nevertheless, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is an excellent game.  Its beautiful, fast paced and a lot of fun to play.  I look forward to playing the sequel.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00005U8TQ","description":"Spider-Man: The Movieallows fans to play as Spider-Man in several highly detailed 3-D environments inspired by the Columbia Pictures/Marvel Entertainment live-action feature film (due for release in May of 2002). This full-roaming action-adventure game allows players to jump into the suit of a fledgling Marvel superhero and learn how to battle the forces of evil.

I'm Spiderman!","reviewText":"I gave this game a rent a little while ago, and was pleasantly surprised. Those of you who played the first Spider Man game for the Playstation will remember it's stengths and weaknesses well. Some levels (the outdoor ones notably) were a lot of fun, and the one-liners spidey shot at villains were great. But later on the gameplay lost a lot of its excitement and the levels got frustrating. Who wants to play through a hard section expecting to get to save, and then find that they are only half-way through a level?Spider Man the Movie for PS2 solves the problems that plagued the original nicely, while enhancing the gameplay of the best levels of the original. The levels have nice variety, from the outdoor webslinging (it's not realistic to web the sky itself, but hey, I'm not complaining), to cool boss fights that mostly consist of simply dodging attacks and beating up the bad guy (the way it should be). And low and behold, every time you complete a hard section, you get to save (YES!!).I actually like the game better than the movie, if you can believe that. The reason why is simple. It's more exciting, and it's more like Spider Man. Instead of character interaction you don't really care about, you get non-stop action. It feels more like the cartoon show that came out a few years back. Just when Spidey thinks he can finally breathe, there's something or someone else threatening to destroy something. Cool. And of course my biggest problem with the movie was the abscence of the trademark Spidey one-liners (I actually had a friend who was an extra in the movie, and told me about a great classic Spider Man one-liner that was cut from the movie). This game has got tons of them. And though they may repeat a bit too much, they're still great.Lastly, I'd like to say that for better or worse, this game features voices straight from the movie. I really don't like Tobey Mcguire as Spider-Man all that much, but everyone else does a super job. And the cinematics in the game are cool, too.At the price this game is going for right now, you might as well buy it. Funny I forgot to mention it before, this game is A LOT of fun. I loved playing it. And isn't that what matters most in the end?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2002"}

There is a lot of good to say about this game, but unfortunately, there is also quite a bit of negative to say about the game. Over the past decade or so, thanks to the massive Grand Theft Auto series, the free roaming game has taken on many different platforms from racing to superhero, but none have paled in comparison to the GTA franchise. Assassins Creed was ready to change all that with its deep storyline, detailed and large maps, realistic characters and a free running system that would allow you to scale and jump across buildings to escape your enemy.The plot is mainly set in 2012 and Desmond Mile, a bartender is kidnapped by Abstergo Industries to be used as a test subject for the Animus Device. The device calls up the memories of an individual's ancient ancestors and Desmond just so happens to be the ancestor of an Assassin during the Third Crusade of the Holy Land during 1191. The majority of the game places you in the shoes of Desmond's ancestor, Altar Ibn La-Ahad ('''''' ''' '' ''', Arabic: \"The Flying One, Son of None\" or \"The Bird, Son of None\") during his quest to assassinate 9 people in Damascus, Acre and Jerusalem, who are seen by the Assassins brotherhood as troublemakers and their demise would bring peace between the Crusader and Saracen forces.The plot is certainly deep and steeped in historical splendour, but with that the game play falls flat in a lot of ways. The free running and climbing aspect is superb and certainly replaces the need for any type of car jacking, but when it comes to one of the best assassins of that time, you would expect the combat sequences to be much better than they are. In this, it's simply a one button system in which you draw your weapon and just hit the melee button at the right time. The reversal killing sequences are kind of cool, but the overall combat system is weak to say the least. Stealth killing can be fun and the blending sequences are interesting, but again, they just tend to fall flat and become very boring indeed. The missions generally consist of investigations such as eavesdropping, pick pocketing and interrogation in order for you to gain information about your targets location, then the assassination itself.The settings are immensely detailed and are truly amazing to look at from a very tall point within the city. The other civilians seem realistic but also very generic as they don't differ at all and really only seem to consist of those who carry pots on their heads, preachers, crazy people and just people walking by. There is so much that could have made this game an undisputable 5 star winner, but the negatives really drag it down in a dramatic way which is a disappointment. The conspiratorial aspect of the plot is what is most interesting and things such as the Knights Templar featured within the game are something I will be researching just out of interest. Looking forward, it seems like the sequel may repair the short comings of this game to make one hell of a gaming experience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2009"}

Johnson","summary":"Geat sound and graphics - but way 2 hard and gamplay lacking","reviewText":"After hearing all the hype on this game I decided to give it a try.Graphics:The graphics in this game are the best I have seen in any racer yet. the cars and the cities look amazingly real and the cars show off a showroom shine and reflects all lights that come from the city around them. The details are amazing as well. Your driving can be actually seen shifting gears as you speed down the city streets. The cities show off spectacular lighting effects and even have logos of popular resturants.Sound:Next to the Graphics the sound is the second best part of this game. Different vehicles have different engine noises. The Ferraris gives off a high pitched roar while other cars have lower sounding engines. Everytime you shift you can hear the engine actually changing gears and it is pretty realistic sounding. Aside from the cars, you have a wide range of music tunes to choose from while your driving, depending on what city your in you have the option of choosing 3 different local radio stations which each play about 6 different songs. If you are in Japan, you will actually hear Japanese music being spoken in Japanese! When you get tired of the radio you can choose from your \"CD\" collection which is included on the game CD. When you get tired of that, you can always play your own music while you drive.GameplayThe controls are very responsive and are not loose like alot of other racing games; which is a good thing. When you press left or right to turn, your car does not spin out of control...most of the time.  Sometimes when your turning a corner at 15 MPH your car will mysteriously start spinning for no apparant reason.  Also the computer seems to have \"tank\" cars.  By that I mean, if your racing against the computer, all he has to do is just \"tap\" you and your car goes spinning out of control.  However if you ram into the computer at 50 MPH it will keep moving as if you did not even hit him.  That is very stupid and frustrating to say the least.  The gameplay gets pretty impossible after you reach a certain level. Unless you have hours upon hours to spend each day just restarting the same race over and over again, you will probally never get all of the cars and tracks.PresentationThis is where I feel the game is most lacking. First of all, there are not that many cars compared to other racing games. While most of the cars on the game are great, it is missing a lot that I would have like to have seen in this game. Where is the Lamborghini? M3? M5? Mclauren?. They have a Chevy Camaro, Subarau Impreza and even a Ford Focus, but they don't have a Mustang Cobra. In fact the only car represented by Ford is the Focus, big dissapointment. No Honda's either, but they do have a mitsubishi lancer. Strange. This game needs more cars period.In addition to the lack of cars, I am not too crazy about the \"Kudos\" system. Basically what it is, is that you get points for \"cool\" things you do, (ie. sliding, spining, getting air time etc). The kudos you earn add up and depending on how many you get, you can unlock new cars and levels. This is not as easy as it sounds, because while your kudos are adding up, if you hit a wall or a cone, you lose all of the kudos you will have earned, very frustating especially when \"unlocking\" the next level or car depends on if you earn enough Kudos. The kudos system makes the game VERY difficult, and after while it becomes more frustrating then challenging. It seems like the game concentrates more on how many cool tricks you can do rather than how good you can drive. This is racing not an X-games competition.Finally one more bad thing about the game play, While the city driving can be very fun, the tracks the game does have are not made in such a way that you can ever reach top speed in your car. They do have a speed challenge course, but it still is not made in such a way were you can actually maintain your speed.  The track has two straight-a-ways but end in a hairpin turn where you almost have to come to a complete stop to turn. The highest speed I ever gotten was 152 in the Ferrari F50, and since I was out of road I crashed into the wall. The Ferrari has a top speed of over 200 MPH, I would have liked to have reached this speed, in a race. I remember in Need For Speed 2, I was able to get 238 MPH in the GT90, and actually was able to keep it there for a few seconds. This is impossible in PGR, which takes away from the game.  What is the point of having all those fast cars if you can't really see what they can do?  If they werent goign to let you get over 150 MPH in your car then they should have had all Sedans and Coupes in this game rather than exotic sports cars!ConclusionOverall I am dissapointed in this game. While the sound and graphics are the best I have ever seen, the amount of cars and gameplay is lacking. This game is not for everyone, some people might like the Kudos system, but it is not for me; I I just want to race not see how many cool tricks I can do; who cares that I can slide and spin on a turn going 80 MPH?, or see how many cones I can drive through.  (Again, this is supposed to be a racing game not a driver's ed course.)  If you want to spend hours and hours (and I mean HOURS) trying to gain kudos points just to unlock new cars and tracks then this game is for you. If you just want to race and push your car to its limit then wait on another racing game to come out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2002"}

Cheaper than the other systems but actually more when you add in the remote!","reviewText":"What is it with Nintendo as of late? They seem to have turned into the new sega with all their addons and accessories just to play their already scaled down games.So far just to play the handful of games I own for the Wii I had to buy the Wii mote, Nunchuck, Classic controller, Game Cube Controller, the Madcatz Arcade Stick (a must have for capcom fighters) and this Motion plus thing just to get my original wii mote to work better.For the money I dropped into the Wii I could of purchased a system that offered more of the type of games I was interested in playing and not this overpriced partyware/fitness console.Oh it might sound like I'm bashing the Wii but honestly I'm just dissapointed with the direction Nintendo has gone in as of late. I've always supported Nintendo and brought just about every console they released but I think this will be my last one for now.The Wii motion plus is just an attachment that connects to the bottom of your wii mote. It comes with a rubber grip but no rubber grip for the nunchuck? Why is that? because Nintendo wants you to spend more money and buy the Nunchuck grip seperately or spend another 20 bucks as it only comes packaged with the grip for the standard wii mote. The wii mote plus is a lot more accurate. I thought it was a gimmick but it really does improve the responsiveness of the standard wii mote.There you have it. Pay 20 bucks to correct Nintendo's flawed wii-mote design.Well... what more can I say about the product? I didn't have to buy it, but I brought it because I wanted to improve the game play on the few wii games that I do own. Even still I'm bitter that I spent $20.00 on something that should of been more like 5 or 10 dollars. I'd rather put that towards purchasing a game than fixing Nintendo's problem. It's something that you honestly do need because it corrects an error with the current wii mote. Despite what they advertise it as this is really a fix for the controller.1 star because this product shouldn't even exist.

The Sims 3 is a must have for sim fans. Most of the people who gave this game low reviews did so because their computer can't run the game. Or they have a bad graphics card. My computer is over 5 years old and I can run the game just fine. I have a very good graphics card. That's very important. The graphics in this game are gorgeous. Yes, the sims 3 is different from the previous games. It's supposed to be different. It's a new game. In the sims 3 you can do many things that you wanted to do in previous games like click on a neighbor's house and actually go inside and visit them. You can visit any place on the map that you can click on. Some places like the grocey store, you can't see inside. Who cares though? It's a grocey store. It's not that exciting. My biggest complaint when this game came out back in July was story mode. In story mode, the neighborhood changes without your imput. Sims get married, age die etc. Sounds good, right? It's not. In the Sims 3, you have to choose an active household to play. each time you want to switch between homes, you have to designate that home as an active household. Lets say you have two families. The Perez family and The Jones family. You are currently playing the Perez family. You decide to switc to the Jones family. While you are playing the Jones family, the Perez family will continue to play without you. They were get job promotions, get fired, die, marry, kids will get kicked out of school, etc Sucks, right? I hated that. EA knew many sim fans wouldn't like the storyline gameplay so they added the option to turn it off. The only problem was that the option did not work. For months I was forced to play only one family. I am one of those players who likes to control everything. I did not want my family playing without me. EA made several patches and claimed to fix the storyline toggler. After several months it was finally fixed. Now we can play with the storyline mode turned off. The sim families you don't play are still sort of active, but no major life changes happen while you are playing another family. The only gripe I still have is that even with the storymode turned off, sim kids don't always go to school or do their homework. It's weird because they automatically do these things when I play with them, but when I switch homes they suddenly forget to do anything. So, if you do choose to get this game and play the game like I do..don't play one family for more than a couple of days. You need to check in on the families to make sure you're not losing any kids. It's not my preferred way to play, but it's playable. I wish the playmode was the same as the sims 2 were my families would not play while I was playing a different family. This game is enjoyable enough that I don't let that one problem ruin the experience for me.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2009"}

Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition is a limited-time offer including the 2009 &#x2018;RPG of the Year' Dragon Age Origins, the Dragon Age Origins-Awakening expansion pack, plus all nine additional content packs.","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"An Epic Western Style RPG","reviewText":"As a long-time RPG player my feelings toward Dragon Age: Origins are hard to neatly categorize into the \"love it\" or \"hate it\" groups. Rather my assessment of the game is that it falls somewhere between those two camps. There are moments in the game that are sheer brilliance then other times where things start to drag along and become mundane.If you're familiar with previous Bioware RPGs then you'll likely feel right at home with DAO. This game is decidedly a western RPG. Typical of the genre you'll have a plethora of choices to make from seemingly endless dialogue trees; extreme character customization right down to the facial hair and voice your character uses. Right from the start you'll choose your race - Elf, Human or Dwarf. Up next is your class; for example choosing the Elf race will next bring up choices for Dalish Elf - a more traditional elf of the forest. Alternatively you could choose City Elf - sort of an Elven underclass that lives in the slums of human cities. The story and dialogue will adjust accordingly.At any given time you can have up to 4 party members (including your main character) at one time. Each party member has a list of macros that you can set up for a particular action in a given situation. For example you can have your mage healer set up to cast `heal' on any characters HP that drops below a certain threshold, i.e. HP>50% = Heal. Though the macro system is deep it is also frustrating in certain situations. For example there isn't a macro to have your mage healer revive a character. That requires you to switch characters mid-battle and cast the spell yourself. In other cases some of my characters would use healing items at the slightest bit of damage even when explicitly setup not to.The story in DAO is a highlight though inevitable comparisons to Lord of the Rings will be made. Your character will assume the role of a Grey Warden. In Ferelden (where the story takes place) the Grey Wardens are almost mythological heroes that rise up whenever an evil called the Archdemon rises his Darkspawn army to throw the world into darkness and ruin. Darkspawn like Orcs in LotR rise from deep underground to destroy all life. Personally I enjoyed the similarities between DAO and LotR. As a huge LotR fan DAO felt like it was paying homage to Tolkien's classic epics.Graphics on the PS3 are good but not exactly great. As expected the PC is where the graphics of the game really shine but Bioware deserves commendation for keeping things mostly running smoothly on the PS3, especially when the on-screen action really ratchets up.The musical soundtrack is impressive. Each area in the game has its own music that you'll grow to recognize and attribute to specific regions and races.As a complete package DAO might just be the best deal you can spend your gaming dollar on. More so if you consider getting the Ultimate Edition Package. Featuring 3 races and 5 different main story arcs, multiple endings and a plethora of dialogue choices impacting everything around you, replay value is sky high. I would recommend opting for the Ultimate Edition right off the bat as it includes all of the pricey DLC.As I mentioned at the beginning of my review there are some low spots in DAO that I couldn't overlook. For one thing a game of this size is bound to have some glitches/bugs and DAO does have its fair share. I ran into various problems throughout my time with the game including missions that I couldn't finish because my characters would suddenly be unable to attack. Sidequests that I couldn't close and receive credit for because a NPC would disappear or the game simply wouldn't let me close out the quest. Many of these problems are documented and several require rebooting and loading a previous save. So be cautioned to always keep multiple save files just to be safe, particularly before entering areas where there's no exiting until the mission is cleared.Second, this game isn't easy particularly if you're playing through with the Warrior Class. At several points you'll be at a severe disadvantage going up against groups of ranged foes that can destroy you in seconds. It seems a bit unfair and leads to some frustrating moments. The game does allow you to drop the difficulty at any time for those that want to choose that route. Personally I think it highlights the unbalance in the game.Lastly, for those looking for JRPG style depth it simply isn't here. Because the story can twist and turn at your will, the story tends to remain more superficial. Many of the quests are simple fetch quests that can grow tiresome.All in all Dragon Age: Origins is a game worth playing and worth owning. Recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2011"}

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both?

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

Methinks they doth protest too much.  I'm not finished (in fact stats screen says about 20%), and am not sure when I will finish.  After the first hour or so in any one sitting the button mashing and loading screens become so tedious I'll never likely spend more than an hour of contiguous time with this game before quitting and putting in something else.  For example one of the early boss sequences requires a number of timed, scripted button presses to accomplish the final defeat.  Miss one of these timed items a bit, and back you go to the start of the sequence (after a loonnngggg loading screen) fight through a number of smaller sequences, dance around for awhile draining the boss' health, then get back to the scripted, timed button sequence, and miss one, then...  you get the idea.  Similar challenges/tedium for some of the 2D jumper sequences.  Also there are not too many options for the battle (no stealth, sniper type combat, little use for environment like exploding canisters etc, only up close mashing).  The gore is abundant, but not emotionally impactful.  The characters suffering defeat are mostly faceless, non-human, caricatures eliciting little sympathy.  They are horror abstractions almost, less disturbing than depiction of much less violent, but realistic, animal abuse a la \"Animal Cops.\"  Maybe this gets better as it goes along, but I'm not optimistic.

Yet, many of us don't seem to find the time, or our muscles intend on giving out as we age. For Nintendo, they had shown that brilliantly before when they had developed Wii Fit. The game really changed the scope on how we can exercise not just with fun, but with strength as well. I was definitely surprised about how amazing the game really was. But yet, many of us weren't just satisfied with the original game, and were seeking other help for balance. Well, many other exercise games were developed to help us stay more in fit with ourselves, but Wii Fit stood out, and now with a sequel, Wii Fit Plus, it definitely continues to show how much Nintendo has changed the way we play and get in shape better with ourselves.Wii Fit Plus for the Nintendo Wii, is definitely one of the stand out games that makes it worth while. The game features a lot of exercising routines that can help us get better in tune with the way we can stay in shape. The game features several strengthening exercises from Yoga, to virtual hula hoop, all the way to snowboarding downhill a slope. The graphics are really good, but the game isn't about graphics, it is about really keeping in tune to our health. There are 70 different training exercises from yoga like balancing in a tree pose, to push-ups to strengthen your abs, all the way to taking golf shots by simply balancing yourself to the goal. The control can really be accurate with not only your weight, but definitely with your body image too. I personally like how friendly it was with kids and adults too. But my only gripe is telling you in big numbers how truthful your body weight can really be. Nevertheless, it does show that you need your exercise for your age, and your health as well. I only wish they had more games and exercises specifically designed only for the legs. Other than that, it definitely is worth the money.If you really are getting a game to exercise with virtually, Wii Fit Plus is definitely it. Wii fit was definitely the starter for anyone that wants strong virtual training for its money. While it might cost a lot for the board and the game, it definitely is worth its money. I definitely recommend this not just for kids, but for adults as well. While Nintendo is focusing its hype on the upcoming Wii U, this game is worth it for the original Wii from start to finish.There have been so many games that have spun off of Wii Fit, but this is the most striking one. If you've loved Wii Fit, buy Wii Fit Plus.Graphics: B 1/2+Sound: B+Control: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B+Overall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2011"}

To stop the Elementals and Cortex's new weapon, Crash or Coco (a fully playable character for the first time) will face five game hubs, 25 dynamic levels, and five unique bosses, as well as a new character that will rock the Crash world.You can complete specific levels of the game to play as Crash's fiery sister. Coco will have a wide variety of moves and animations tailored to fit her personality. New free-roam sections will be implemented within certain levels of the game. These sections feature puzzles and hidden areas never before seen in a Crash game. New bosses and minibosses offer up a Noah's Ark-sized list of new creatures. The game also has an all-new graphics engine that brings vivid life to environments and characters like never before.","reviewerName":"Nick","summary":"a review focusing on the GAME, NOT the load time","reviewText":"Since everyone here has already griped about the long load times for the game, which are annoying by the way, i will focus my review on the actual game.  The game is great for PS2, crash looks sharper than ever on the PS2.  But is it really worth it, if you havent played the regular playstation versions?  The answer is probably not.  Its still running straight forward or vice versa, and the levels are richly textured and have alot of fun things to do in them.  But since all of the Crashes for the PSX go for less than 15 bux now, i suggest saving your money and playing them first.  They are just as good, not graphics wise, but gameplay and level wise.  Yet if you are a fan of the series this is not one to be missed.  If you want a platformer for your PS2, Jak And Daxter is the obvious superior choice- theres no comparison... but if you need another one, this game is actually pretty good!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2002"}

I wouldn't say the game is worth a penny more. reason because the game is really short. even so in that short time you will take part in  one of the best stories I played in any shooter to date. (even better then Gears story) The story also has alot of emotion and WTF moments. The excellent voice acting even makes it better.The MP is trash and the online community is dead. I wouldn't buy this game if you want to play a shooter for mp there are better TPS's out there.Form start too finish  you will enter a room full of bad guys  get in cover and shoot them. After that you are followed by a cut-scene then you preceded too repeat those steps again. There also was some choices you could make in the game .All together there are 3 choices , but only the last choice you makes matters too what ending you get. The ending cut scene is the same no matter what. But the commentary will be different.overall I enjoyed this game  and I think if the game was any longer it would of killed the story because of the repetitive gameplay. I beat the game in 6 hours I know some have beaten the game in 4 hours. I think this game should of also had coplay which it doesn't at the time.

The game itself is more of a story that at brief times drags but overall is very compelling till the end.  Characters that draw you in and cause you to care and by that I mainly mean Clementine the little girl.  I think if you have kids you will see where the draw will come from to keep that little girl safe.  So if you wanna kick the crap out of zombies or hi jack cars there are games for that.  I don't want to go into a spoilers review since there will be plenty of those to come soon.  If you know what this game is and how it all plays I think you will enjoy it but if you aren't sure just download the demo.I am one of those people that prefers disc over digital downloads so I had to pick this version up.  Story wise the game is very strong and engrossing but will be over before you know it so its best to get drawn in since the story is what will pull you in.  Sometimes you think you made a difference in the story only to find it really doesn't matter by the end with how the game wraps up or certain scenes play out.  Such as early on you may decide to save a certain character only to have them die no matter what kind of hurts the game since its so much about choice.  Then again it also shows that no matter what decisions you make certain things will happen and some you can't prevent.  To me the end of the game kind of had be Mass Effect 3'd but it didn't kick me in the groin and rip me apart.  The end of the fourth episode was no surprise since I saw it coming but the end of the fifth I felt closed too fast.  It had an emotional draw and I wish they would of drug out the ending moments with the characters a little longer.Gameplay is hit and miss since there overall isn't much of it which is a shame since to me is when the most intense moments occur.  By that I mean the action scenes of course when you have to make some button presses to get out of a zombie eating your face but I think action fans may find it lacking in this category.  It feels very fitting of the game I believe but some will come away with a feeling of disappointment.  The puzzle parts are quite easy and you can run from place to place really quick since most are simply move certain things around or getting other things.  Then again when having to make quick decisions in a limited time is also stressing not knowing if the outcome will be good or ill.Graphics are nice with a comic book cell shade color to it with fits it perfectly.  The characters look great and it fits the world and everything has a murky sense to it.  Sometimes you may see a scene that looks like a painting or something but overall it looks great.  The sound is typical of the genre but the actual music is fantastic and moving at times and really shows in intense moments.Controls are good and the interface is very easy to get the hang of and especially the quick time events.  It is relatively easy to pick up on but one thing you will notice is that the game often has hiccups after actions or certain clips.  Overall its very tight and easy to get use to but if you are familiar with this game company you will know what to expect.  Its not like you will smash your controller in frustration or anything but the game isn't godly perfection.  Most interactions are point and click when your characters are near a object so don't expect some level of interaction thats gonna blow you away.Though the game had me wondering why it went in certain directions I never let it deter me.  I know I like certain episodes better than others and looked at my watch in disbelief at how fast I ran through some.  With that said this game had me from start to finish and it's been a delight seeing how everything played out.  The story is one of the few games that has really drawn me in and caused an emotional stir.  I didn't cry or anything but my heart strings were continually played on.  I have this weird thing that I find it hard to be the bad guy or callous jerk in the games I play so it really had me wanting my characters to live on.  The game closes with a cliff hanger though I didn't like Lee's fate it told his story very well.  If you look at it as Lee's Tale you won't be to surprised with the end.The game is around ten hours but odds are you can run through in a lot less time. My advice is just enjoy it and enjoy the fact that a company made a game that wasn't a FPS or RPG but a story driven game that will leave you wanting Season 2 quick.  I think its worth a play just to see if you like it or not but I know it is simply not going to be for everyone.  I think this will be a game people talk about for years to come like a Mass Effect or Harold Eats A Ham Sandwich, its just one of those games I think people will want to talk about.  Hope you enjoy as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0088I7L76","description":"","reviewerName":"rodjoh \"rodjoh\"","summary":"It's a mortal combat, with Superman, friends and foes.","reviewText":"I would have never thought that one of the best fighting games of this console generation would feature Superman, Batman and all the  other DC super friends. But here we are with Injustice, and its awesome.This game was created by Netherrealm Studios, the same people that brought us the 2011 version of Mortal Kombat... which was all kinds of great. If Ed Boon could make his legendary but overly complicated MK cast relevant again, we didn't expect any less when they announced they were working on a fighting game with DCs famous and villians. (I'm ignoring that other game where both franchises merged because I haven't played it and at this point I doubt I will.)Injustice feels a lot like Mortal Kombat 2011 really, the flow and feel of the battles, the commands for special moves and fighting engine will feel right at home if you played MK. But even if you didn't, it will all feel great. Injustice has 3D graphics but plays as a 2D fighter, and it feels \"Outstanding\". (Did you read that in Shao Kahn's voice? Did you? High five!)But then, Injustice does have its own game mechanics. Each character has a super move, a power enhancer and then there's this duel-clash thing that I still haven't figure out all that well. Anyway, I won't go into those details, but all of them are welcome variables that can mark the difference on each fight. The controls are quite simple actually, but since there's a lot of things that can alter a battle, mastering a fighter will take its time.And if that wasn't enough, then you would love to know that each battle stage is more than just a thematic backdrop. Each stage has interactive objects that can be used as either movement support for you, or to attack your opponent. These are easily triggered with one button so its all about having good timing. Also not all characters react the same to each stage element, so that's another thing to consider. So as you see, for a 2D fighter that could very well end up being a button mash-fest, there are quiet a few things you should keep in mind. And button mashing will not help you with them.As far as the Injustice cast, all the great people are there: Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Batman, Superman, Nightwing (wut), and more. Even Hawkgirl. And there's the villians too... Lex Luthor, The Joker, Harley Quinn and more. It is a great cast already, although a bit biased towards the Batman crowd. Netherrealm Studios also have added more characters via DLC... If you don't mind throwing some additional bucks for them, you can add even more fighters to the cast (including that ONE Mortal Kombat guy they just couldn't resist to throw in).There are a couple things I don't like about Injustice though. First of all, I appreciate they added a Story Mode which sort of tries to justify the fact that DC heroes are fighting each other, and I like that the Story mode is divided into chapters like in Mortal Kombat. But the story itself is a hot mess that really makes no sense and has a poor ending to be honest. At least they tried though, and you will understand why they named the game Injustice after playing it.Another thing I don't like is also an issue present in Mortal Kombat 2011: I don't know what it is, but all the character models look plasticky and weird... its not like they look bad cuz they don't, they are very detailed and all, but they don't look as realistic as you would expect 3D models from this generation to look. I don't know if that is a deliberate design choice by the developers or what, but its a bit weird looking.Ultimately though, this is a fun game. It plays great, feels great and it has iconic characters that everyone loves (right?) So you can't go wrong with it. If you like fighting games and if you like the cast of Justice League, then this is for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002I0JBL4","description":"","reviewerName":"Jon","summary":"Duke is back, BUT dated and SLOW load times","reviewText":"This is for single player campaign mode only.I was expecting more out of this game.  I don't know, it felt very linear to me.  I think it's great that they finally came out with a long-awaited sequel, but I guess it feels like the Duke Nukem style and plot is now the same style and plot of SO many other games out there, so it just feels like what WAS innovative, edgy, and original back in the 90's is now really just sort of another FPS humans-vs-aliens game.Frankly probably what I'm having the most issues with are the load times.  The load times KILL me!!!  Figuratively.  I'm generally a very patient person, and normally with stuff like this I don't care, but they are really long for a PS3 game.  I don't know if they're at PS1 levels, but definitely no better than PS2.  This gets really, really irritating when you're say, fighting a boss you haven't faced before so you don't have the experience of killing him so you subsequently die a few times.  But every time you die you have to wait a good 30 seconds to a minute for the game to load again, so ultimately if you do die a few times then you're sitting through load times as much as you're fighting the boss.The game feels \"attitude\"-wise like Bulletstorm.  I know it's not good to compare games, but it really felt like I was just playing Bulletstorm again, but with the ability to do less with your weapons and abilities.  I wish they'd let you take breaks from the fighting more and be able to clown around Duke's base and home more.  That would've been nice with this game.I give this game three stars because it's definitely long enough, and the graphics are sweet, you can interact with the environment a lot, and it is no better or no worse then any standard, average FPS game out there.  The enemies are tough, and there are points where the scope of your surroundings is nice and big.Bottom-line: As I said, while kudos to the patient game creators for putting out another Duke product after so long, unfortunately because the gaming industry has long-since caught up with the alien FPS games this felt very average and almost outdated.  I'd say it's probably worth paying $30 for though, since it is entertaining enough that you won't feel cheated, but you very well will probably be left wishing they'd done more.  While I did give it three stars, I would have given the game 2.5 stars out of five if I could on Amazon - it is very middle-of-the-road.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2011"}

I pre-ordered Dead Space 3 which I only do for games I'm really excited about. After reading reviews on Amazon prior to popping the game in I was concerned that it would not live up to the hype due to the gripes I kept hearing about too much action, not enough horror bla bla bla. Well I can tell you that this IS Dead Space and more. The game has to evolve people and Visceral did the job while still keeping the heart of DS in tact. This is a big budget blockbuster of a game and the good kind. The graphics, sound, gameplay are all top notch. If you're a fan definitely get this game and if you haven't had the pleasure (terror) of playing any of the Dead Space games what are you waiting for?The addition of weapons crafting is a little intimidating at first but it's a welcome addition and a hell of a lot of fun. Isaac is an Engineer and this takes advantage of that fact. I've heard alot about nano transactions but they are TOTALLY OPTIONAL. I prefer to explore and scavenge throughout the dark foreboding areas of the game for my needs. It adds to the tension and suspense, plus prolongs gameplay. If you don't have the time for that, hey feel free to microtransact lol. It's a personal preference/choice. Choice is a good thing. Now if you could only get stuff you need by buying it then I would say screw EA.Pros-Gameplay: Top notch, fluid, responsive.Sound:  Wow! How could they improve the sound on the first two? I don't know but they did. I have a 7.2 system driven by a Yamaha receiver and the sound literlly rocks the house. (My wife's not too happy about that lol!)Graphics: Great detail. Seamless action. Nice lighting and particle effects.Presentation: Polished, Hollywood style set pieces. Looking out the window of the USM Eudora is breathtaking.Story:  Probably the weakest part of the game but still not bad.Music:  Again, great soundtrack fit for a Hollywood movie. Really helps immerse you in the experience.Cons-Makes me feel like I'm going into cardiac arrest lol! Actually that's a good thing right?Ellie got a boob job.

But, even in this short of a span I already know this isn't a game I'm going to put my money down on.  I played BF 1942 and loved it.  This game looks very vehicle dependent.  Being on foot is pretty worthless.  Even if you are an anti-tank player, it really does no good as the anti-tank missles don't home in and are almost impossible to get a kill on a vehicle at almost any distance.  There are aircraft all ove the place, as well as anti-aircraft missle turrets you can jump into.  The only problem is they are \"suppose\" be be heat seaking missles, but almost NEVER hit their target.  The aircraft can drop flares to throw off the homing ability, but even when they never drop flares, I was only ONCE able to get a kill.  So, for the most part, aircraft can fly around unapposed.You'll find yourself getting killed from no where a lot.  I'll be running along and all of a sudden I'm dead.  I don't know where it came from, or what it was.  It gives you an indicator to show what direction it is coming from, but you almost never see what is shooting at you.If you love spawn killing, then this game is for you.  I would spawn into a base and have a tank 15 feet from me pointed right at me.  You don't even have a chance to move before you are dead.  And for those of you that played BF 1942 and remember how bad spawn killing could be, it's 10 times worse now.The sniper is hard to use.  I would shoot and shoot and shoot sometimes at a motionless target, yet they wouldn't die.  Maybe this game doesn't let you shoot as far as you can see, I don't know.  Part of the problem is the scope itself.  With one of the sniper rifles, the crosshairs block what you are trying to aim at.  You can't really try to go for a head shot, because you can't tell if you are on the head because the crosshairs are always in the way.  With the other sniper I used, it used a crosshair system I wasn't use to, and I could never tell if I was even getting close.To me this game was exactly like the BF 1942 mod Modern Combat.  The vehicles are the same, weapons are pretty much the same, and even has some of the same problems that Modern Combat had, like the difficulty using sniper scopes and the dependency on vehicles.  If you like the Modern Combat mod, then this game may be for you.  But, I never could get into it, and I can't get into this game either.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2005"}

Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Nathan Beauchamp \"ConsumerAdvocate (nathan(at...","summary":"Awesome","reviewText":"F.E.A.R. 2 is everything that F.E.A.R. was and more. They've improved everything: level design (no more repetitive environments), game play (there is still 'bullet time' but it's explained this time around), weapons feel powerful and are way fun to use, the scariness hasn't lost a step from the original, and the visuals are freakish, scary, and very well done. This a game that is best played at night and by yourself to best experience the horror of it all.The game is relatively short, and replay value is average. Once you've experienced the big reveals and the shocking moments, the game will lose some intensity the next time through. However, it's still massively fun to play, and killing zombies never gets old.I do wish that the plot was developed a bit more and that things from the first three games were explained better. There are as many questions after completing FEAR:2 as there are answers. It's likely they'll roll out a few more expansion packs like they did with the original, and maybe those will tie things up (but not so tightly there isn't room for FEAR:3!).Overall this game is a blast, and will give you a scare if you let yourself get immersed in the story. The first person cut scenes are well done, and keep you immersed in the story. This is a pretty awesome game, and well worth owning.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2009"}

Think of Serious Same as a graphic update to Doom.  The game adds all the cool transparencies, lens flares, and other lighting effects, but it's pretty much a lot of running around in giant arenas and shooting everything that comes at you.My only complaint is the shotgun is too slow to reload in my opinion compared to the other FPS's out there.  You may find yourself using the rocket launcher more often.  Don't expect much AI - they all just run at you and either blow up or start swinging.

{"product_name":"B00020BV1A","reviewerName":"R. Jensen","summary":"Good game","reviewText":"I do like this game mainly due to how different it feels from other Star Wars games. While their are other 1st person SW games, this one is different in that it feels like enemies and allies act more like real life combatents instead of you playing a game and killing enemies. Another difference is you actually do need to think in order to beat this game instead of mindlessly blasting enemies like in Dark Empire. Another surprising aspect was how well the game was designed, the maps show great detail and they hook you in making you feel claustrophobic in some spots or make you feel overwhelmed in others. Also the storyline was not bad.Nontheless I do have problems, one problem is that droids in this game feel a lot harder to destroy then in other games. Main reason I feel this way though is because I'm used to Battlefront or being a jedi so it was easy to kill them. Still I've always felt the droids should be easier to kill. Also there is one level involving a bridge fight where enemies keep spawning from multiple dispensors that is almost impossible to win unless you get lucky at the very start. This is one situation where you do have to think but this level goes to show the game is harder then it looks.Still it's a fun time and much enjoyment can be gained from this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2014"}

People expressed a lot of freezing or lagging, I haven't had any as I have played 2 seasons so far. I play 6 minute quarters because honestly.. 15 minutes in game time each in my real life? That would be almost 2 hours or more of playing this game each scenario. If you play your quarters with lots of minutes, that might be why you have so much freezing up on your Dynasty mode, but not mine.Gameplay, I can't say much for it. Honestly I play on All-American and it's really crap. This is why I give the game a 3 out of 5 overall. When I play this game I realize, when I do screen passes the linemen really run past a block, without any effort of the computerized programmed linemen, are suppose to block.. No not really they run to the right or left then up the field without blocking.When passing, I cannot express how much B.S. you will experience in the pass game. INT after INT. It is outrageous honestly. You can be a A+ team and play a C- team. If you air raid or pass the ball a lot, then INT's just come as nothing. They are much more common in this football game than I have ever experienced.The other thing is, when ever I call an audible to make a run-play, the computer instantly picks this up, automatically sends the SS, FS, and all Linebackers to the front of the line showing blitz. --- Really ??? Yes. Really, the computer can read your mind and your plays. It doesn't matter what you do unless you want to burn a timeout on 4th and 1 with a minute to go in the 4th qtr. down by 3. Sure thing.The Computer also can gut you in the air pass game whenever it feels like it too. This is another thing about the game. You can play a 3 man d-line and have everyone else playing pass with zone coverage and Man-2-Man. This will not work, when the computer wants to score or make a play, it makes a play unless you somehow switch your player and make the play happen yourself, thus making it a \"User Pick\" or \"User Sack\" etc.The Graphics are good, they are an upgrade from '11 but they could have been better honestly. When playing, I noticed the entire marching band in the background of the stands were all the same people and all colored Black. I'm not saying anything bad, just saying the game creators need to put time into the detail and environment and not just copy paste every thing.What gamers are looking for now, is feeling the atmosphere when playing, thus making it feel real.I really feel no connection with the game other than I am a college football fan who happens to play games as well.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2012"}

Justice murdered Afro's father to claim the 'Number One' headband, giving himself the chance to rule the worldAfro Samurai is based on the popular and stylistic anime of the same name.View larger.with powers akin to a god. The only one allowed to challenge Number One is the person with the 'Number Two' headband, but unfortunately for Afro, the current owner of the headband, anybody and everybody can, and does, challenge Number Two. But never fear, as this new title includes brand new material and background for fans of the series and newcomers alike to enjoy.Loads of Stylized ActionAfro Samurai brings gamers a balanced experienced, with stylistic combat and acrobatic platforming combined with the ability to dynamically slice and dismember enemies in unending ways. While gamers can hack and slash their way through many foes by combining heavy and light attacks with just two buttons, accomplished players will master moves like the Deep Throat Killer, where they pierce their opponent's neck and rip everything loose in a crimson splash.Players will also need to learn the Focus maneuver with its bullet-time effect. This allows the user to slow down time and designate a specific strike zone, which with the right timing and skill can allow Afro to cleave an enemy in two or slice a limb completely off. And since characters are not pre-rendered you don't just get a canned scene when you cut through your enemy, giving you endless ways and means to cut your enemies down to size. This ethos is applied game-wide, as Afro is allowed to interact with anything and everything in his environment to help him on his journey.Star-Studded Supporting CastSamuel L. Jackson reprises his role as both Afro and Ninja in the game, and the same striking art style that made the anime series so popular provides the unique look and feel across beautifully animated open environments. And for those of you who are wondering, developers Namco Bandai let Jackson ad-lib a lot, so be prepared for his branded vulgarity and the M rating it helps the game earn.Meanwhile, Ron Pearlman and Kelly Hu continue on in their roles as Justice and Okiku, while RZA of Wu-Tang Clan fame has created all new tracks for the hip-hop inspired soundtrack. And thanks to an innovative gameplay system, the enemy AI and tone of the game are affected by the beat of the musical score, for a truly immersing experience.With its visual stunning graphics, and fluid and graceful movements, Afro Samurai will provide hours of entertaining, balletic action. Add to this ground-breaking elements like health that is represented by the blood on your clothes, or your enemies', and you have a game that simply can not be passed up.Slice and dice your enemies in a glorious number of different ways.","reviewerName":"James \"James S.\"","summary":"Good game, awesome sound track too!","reviewText":"I dont know why people are hatin on this game.

In that game, Joker had masterminded a scheme that trapped Batman in Arkham while the inmates ran loose. It ended in a climatic showdown between Joker and Batman. BATMAN ARKHAM CITY takes places a year later. Arkham Asylum has been razed and Hugo Strange in partnership with Mayor Quincy Sharp (the former warden of Arkham Asylum) has bought much of old Gotham City and transformed it into a massive prison for criminals and the clinically insane alike. However, anyone who opposes the prison are kidnapped and sent to Arkham City themselves. At a protest event against the facility and Strange's announcement of an unknown event called Protocol 10, Bruce Wayne is kidnapped and sent inside. It's all a part of Batman's master plan to find out exactly what is going on. His adventure over the night brings him face to face with Two Face, the Penguin, Joker, Ra al Ghul, and Mister Freeze just to name a few. There's also side missions that bring Batman in contact with characters as diverse as Azrael, Hush, and Deadshot. In addition, the Riddler has a role to play as Arkham City is loaded with trophies to collect, riddles to solve, and puzzles to complete.The voice acting is some of the finest of all time. Kevin Conroy reprises his role as Batman and Mark Hamill give his final performance as Joker. Several animated series and video games later, these two actors are the definite vocal performers of the roles. The other villains and characters are well-done, too.The graphics for the game are top-notch. This looks and feels like you are in the world of Batman. This is perhaps, the best representation in any medium of Gotham City and the world in which Batman lives. Never before has Gotham looked so menacing, threatening, and real.Control is relatively easy and some the only flaw from BATMAN ARKHAM ASYLUM, odd camera angles, has been fixed. The gameplay is fairly easy, though as the game progresses it might prove challenging for a complete beginner. All the weapons from ASYLUM are back, but there are new ones and some of the old ones can be upgraded to make them even more useful.The voice acting is some of the finest of all time. Kevin Conroy reprises his role as Batman and Mark Hamill give his final performance as Joker.

At the time of the release of the game, only those who buy the game or buy the code can play the Catwoman story. I have no doubt that eventually this storyline as well as the soon-to-be-released storylines of Robin and Nightwing will all be available on a \"Greatest Hit\" or \"Game of the Year\" version of the game.Overall, BATMAN ARKHAM CITY is a fine video game.

You can still read my Amazon review of the Fallout/Fallout 2 bundle from about 10 years ago.  But it seems like just yesterday that Fallout 3 hit the stands, pushing the series into the 21st century and giving us all hundreds of hours of hilarious, laser filled, limb-crippling fun.  To say I've been looking forward to New Vegas is to put it mildly.  So where do I come out?  To be honest, a little confused and frustrated.I purposefully avoided spoilers as to either plot or development of NV.  But it's pretty clear that NV was intended to be a 3D throwback to Fallout/Fallout 2.  In everything from the geckos to the damage thresholds to faction reputations to the more eclectic array of weapons, the designers were clearly mindful of many of the little details that made the world and experience so rich and replayable for us old timers.  So why am I frustrated?For starters, it's not clear whether NV wants to be an expansion or a stand alone game.  It's certainly long enough to stand on its own, but so much of the game is directly lifted from Fallout 3 that it's hard to pretend you're even in a different (and, according to the story, not even nuked) area of the country.  When you are able to recognize individual house ruins or even particular rocks from what you've seen in Fallout 3, the ability to pretend this is a completely different game is quickly lost.  The first knife I found was identical to the ones in Fallout 3, right down to the sheen and nicks on the blade.  Same with the baseball bat.  Even the burnt out RVs are the same.At the same time, much of what is \"new\" doesn't seem to have any distinguishing substance.  Frag grenades are now sticks of dynamite.  Giant cockroaches are now giant mantis thingies.  Nuka colas, while still around, are largely replaced by \"sarsaparilla\" bottles.  Wild feral dogs are replaced by coyotes.  And on and on.  Even the skill books seem to be the same, although there are additional comic book style ones that are only temporary (the logic for these evades me, since they give a huge skill bonus but that you apparently forget it somehow).  While a variety of new-ish things have been added or restored from the old games, such as an expanded ammo mill, the ability to \"craft\" foodstuffs at campfires and the like, and doctor's bags for fixing crippled limbs, it all feels like a surface coating to Fallout 3 rather than a new game in its own right.So if you loved Fallout 3, why does this matter?  Well, in sum the \"new\" items and features don't mesh very well.  Although you can choose to start with 2 new \"talents\" at level 1, most of the talents are either worthless or actively harmful to your character.  You only get perks every 2 levels now (and there's still a level cap), and it's also much harder to max out skills.  Many of the new items seem fairly rare, and require a large number of components in order to create or forge new items.  The \"iron sights\" don't work particularly well even at higher skill levels, and there seems to be a new annoying condition threshold below which your weapon effectively becomes useless (in other words, the \"broken\" 0 cond from Fallout 3 effectively occurs faster).  In short, much of the experience you gained in Fallout 3 works against you in New Vegas, because the game is extremely similar but larded with a bunch of annoying new variables and features that you have to worry about.  If NV was really a new game (or had come first) this might have been fine, but as a large expansion it is annoying.Ultimately, I found NV more fatiguing than it is enjoyable.  You have the same sense of experience you'd have after hundreds of hours of Fallout 3 time, but without the reassuring familiarity and comfort of knowing what exactly is going on or how to craft and maintain effective equipment.  When you add in the numerous bugs and freezes I've experienced on my XBox 360, you really do find yourself wondering why you don't just go back and play Fallout 3 instead.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2010"}

In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme inChinatown Warsutilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons.Key Game Features:The Largest DS Game Ever- Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.Endless Gameplay- Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.Street Economics- Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.Play with Friends- Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.Bragging Rights- Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.PDA Interface- Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.Online Bragging Rights and MultiplayerCare has been taken to ensure that players can share theirChinatown Warsexperiences with friends and fellow players in different ways. First, players will have access to theChinatown Warsas well as the greaterGrand Theft Autocommunities through the Rockstar Games Social Club. Here they can chat, trade commodities, purchase special in-game items with in-game currency, check the leaderboards and compete in online tournaments. The DS' Wi-Fi capabilities also gives players the opportunity to take their game online as they battle for supremacy in their own little corner of Liberty City in both head-to-head and co-op multiplayer battles.","reviewerName":"J.S. Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"Back to the Basics!  A Total Win for GTA","reviewText":"I've been reading some reviews and I had to add my own thoughts.This game is an absolute victory for the Grand Theft Auto series.  There is so much that this game includes that it easily outshines the recent GTA IV on the gamut of modern generation gaming consoles.As far as story, it really doesn't change much from the way we all know our GTA games to act - you're an Asian kid who game to the US and is immediately drawn into a turf war between a few feuding gangs.  You end up fighting against all of them amidst the various characters and missions, and in the end... ...well, you'll just have to find out.What made the DS version successful and so crazily unique was the gameplay.  In recent GTA games we've started seeing the immersion of technology INTO the games.  Now we use cell phones to communicate, get missions, even take pictures and stalk targets.  In this game, we're given a full-fledged PDA which actually acts as the main menu of the game.  We can plot GPS routes, check email, and - in quite possible the greatest idea EVER in GTA-land, order \"Ammu-Nation\" weapons to be delivered directly to our safehouses.  Obviously the PDA inclusion is fine and all, but the fact that it actually FEELS like you're using the PDA with touch controls via your lower DS screen just makes it that much more fun.  From the lower screen you can instantly access different sections of your PDA, such as GPS navigation or email.  Also, the scrolling feature with your DS works as good as an iPhone - it is absolutely a joy to use.The game is viewed from a top-down screen position.  At first you feel like you're playing the original GTA series which debuted on PC in the late 90's.  This can cause a few issues, such as being shot at from a distance which you can't see, or when driving at high speeds with little time to react to traffic and turns.  It's a limitation for sure, but not of the game - for the fact that you're playing this game on a tiny hand-held gaming platform, it really makes sense.  And with the draw-distance limitation, they've added plenty of style to make up for the loss.  For example, NPC vehicles driving through town have working turn signals - I've ever seen a car with four-ways activated as the driver got out to investigate a pedestrian it just struck (and sadly, killed...)  You'll randomly encounter police chases, or even ambulances on way to a call.  You'll drive under subway tracks complete with random-generated subway cars passing overhead, or even be shadowed by the occasional flying helicopter.  It FEELS like a modern GTA game, just from a different perspective.And it just keeps getting better.  Borrowed from GTA IV are the \"random characters\" which you might notice on your map - triggers to random and often hilarious side-missions.  There are drug vans and Ammu-Nation vehicles to steal and pillage, unique stunt jumps to attempt (which are honestly increasingly difficult due to the top-down view,) and - thankfully back from the dead - garages in which to store you're \"hard-earned\" automotive possessions.  And of course the usual collectibles - this time in the form of surveillance cameras which must be destroyed with grenades or molotov cocktails - which this time you can make yourself!!I've been playing Chinatown Wars for well over 20 hours and still haven't finished the storyline.  That, for $30-$40 bucks is a win in itself.  That I've had so much fun during the whole process certainly seals the deal.  I hope to see more hand-held GTA games just like this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2009"}

Manning","summary":"Meh...It's Okay","reviewText":"As a Playstation gamer I really try and have all the necessary equipment to have the full playstation experience. I bought the camera shortly after I received my system, and it's okay.That's it...it's okay. It's not awesome, or amazing, or even used that often.Let me get this out there - I know it's nothing like Kinect, and I don't expect it to be. The playroom game that comes installed in the system is actually very clever. I sat there playing around with it, shooting out little androids that walked around on my carpet (through the TV) and my son had a blast watching them. But besides the playroom, there's nothing really to do with it except video message and chat.The reason this gets 3 stars though is because of it's unreliable facial recognition. When I set up the camera I took snapshots of my face to allow the camera to activate the PS4 when it recognized me. The first couple times I tried it out it worked great, but every other time up to now, every single time I power on the PS4 and put my face in the middle of the screen...nothing happens. I don't know if mine is broke? (It still works in the playroom fine) or if I'm doing something wrong, but I can't get the camera to recognize me what so ever now.My advice is to skip this piece of equipment for now. It's not a bad item, and for the most part it works, but the times it doesn't, paired with the lack of support for it, makes the camera &#34;meh&#34; to me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00005LOXE","description":"The two classic RPGs in this compilation not only represent hours upon hours of story, character, and action, they also present the background for two recent bestselling, critically hailed games:Final Fantasy IXandChrono Cross.With all the different names for the original 1991 release of the first title in this compilation (Final Fantasy IVin Japan,Final Fantasy IIin the U.S.), role-players new to the game may get confused. Make no mistake, though:Final Fantasy Chroniclesmarks the first time this pivotal installment of the cherished game series has ever been available on the PlayStation. InFinal Fantasy IV, players take on the role of Cecil, a loyal captain who questions the orders of his king, and for it is sent to slay a mysterious beast in a nearby valley.InChrono Trigger, Chrono must follow princess Marle's teleportation through time and locate her before an intergalactic parasite arrives to destroy the world. The original game, also on the PlayStation for the first time, was one of the first nonlinear role-playing games. The decisions that players make during the game will point them toward one of more than a dozen possible endings.These new versions retain the authentic Japanese SNES stories and characters while updating their graphics and adding new full-motion video sequences and other features.","reviewerName":"Destitute","summary":"Two epic RPG's in one package!","reviewText":"Two RPG masterpieces, Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger, have beenre-released in this great package with some nice additions. I'll be reviewing the two games.FINAL FANTASY IVINTRO: In 1991, FFIV was originally released in America for the SNES under the name, \"Final Fantasy II.\" But the SNES version was pretty flawed. For one thing, they censored the script and and it was horribly translated. Another thing is that they took out a few things, such as the Developer's Room. Also, they toned down the difficulty. Now the game has been re-released for the PS1 with the complete, uncut script, Developer's Room, and a harder difficulty.GAMEPLAY: This was the first FF game to have more than the number of characters in your party. (you can have up to five characters in your party. Sweet!) The game has lots of secrets, spells, weapons, and summons. It's a really addicting RPG with a great challenge.GRAPHICS: Meh. It was made in 1991, so of course the graphics look outdated. But they were good for the time.SOUND: Not much to say about the sound. It's your standard SNES sound.MUSIC: I love the music in this game. Even 14 years later, the music still packs a punch. I especially love the boss music. It's very catchy.STORY: This game has a great story. I won't spoil it for you, but the story is very original, filled with plot twists.ADDED EXTRAS: Besides having the complete, uncut game, not much. Just an FMV scene.CHRONO TRIGGERINTRO: Ten years ago, CT was released for the SNES. Even now, it's still one of the most loved and popular RPG's ever. Now it's been re-released with a ton of extras.GAMEPLAY: CT is an RPG. However, there are things that are special about this game. For one thing the battle system is unique. You can use moves that combine different characters. It's a bit hard to explain.Another thing that makes this game unique is the fact that you can time travel. You can alter the past, and have fun. Plus, more eras mean more sidequests.GRAPHICS: Very ahead of its time. CT's graphics were beautiful, from the colorful 2D textures, to the forests, the graphics were topnotch.MUSIC: Like most RPG's, CT has an epic musical score.SOUND: Pretty good for 1995.STORY: The story, I believe, is solid. It isn't the best RPG story ever, but it is easy to understand and very entertaining.REPLAY VALUE: Most RPG's don't really have a replay value, but this does. Once you beat the game, you can do a New Game+, which allows you to start the game over with everything you had on the first game. Plus, there are many, [and I mean MANY!] endings to unlock.ADDED EXTRAS: Awesome anime cutscenes, and much more!OVERALL: Two epic RPG's in one package. A must have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2005"}

About 10 to 15 hours depending on how many sidequests you do, to finish the main game. You can Be Evil,Good, or a little mix of both. If your a Fan of RPG'S with more of a free form fighting,this is your game. The graphics arent spectacular but there pretty good. I just wish they wouldv'e made it longer with more options. Like KOTOR or MORROWIND ,those two games seriously raised the bar for RPG'S. But SUDEKI ,highly underrated, Has some really awesome eye candy graphics in the later stages .Well I cant say I love this game and I cant say I hate it. It's not dark enough for me .It seemed a little kiddie like to me. SUDEKI has a darker cooler edge to it. But Fable is an all around good game. Groundbreaking ,not really,but still a good all around RPG. Just don't expect to be blown away ,unless your new to gaming or on the younger side,or maybe this game just fits your style . But I'm a 35 yr old so Think of that when your reading this review. I remember when the paddle game PONG  came out in the 70's . we were like whoa dude . Now look at these games they blow my mind . HALO2,DOOM3,SPLINTER CELL 3, I'm can't wait till they hit the XBOX. And what about (KOTOR 2) oh yeah baby come to papa.Anyways ,In conclusion FABLE ,overhyped YES, bad game NO.

I was disappointed when I found out that compared to the arcade and Dreamcast ports, the PS2 version suffers from some minor slowdown and surprisingly, horribly muffled sound effects. This proves one of two things...either Capcom didn't spend much effort into making this conversion, or the PS2 simply has poor 2D sprite processing abilities. If you played the Dreamcast version recently you will notice an obvious difference, trust me. The gameplay remains intact however, and the slowdown is minimal (it only occurs during the most intense moments and when the score is being tallied at the end of a match). All and all, it's still a decent port...just not up to par with the Dreamcast one. If you own the Dreamcast version, there's no reason to get the PS2 version unless you just want to have access to it on a system with a wider user base (and a better controller I might add).

In 2003 we finally saw the follow up, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance.  While the original game gained a strong cult following, Tactics Advance had a love/hate relationship with many gamers.  With that in mind, Final Fantasy Tactics A2 is very much in tune with its predecessor on the Gameboy Advance.  If you enjoyed Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, you'll more than likely enjoy this one.  If Final Fantasy Tactics Advance wasn't your cup of tea, then Tactics Advance A2 doesn't do much to make you like it.  It sticks to many of its conventions and in turn, suffers from many of the same problems.  It's problems, however, don't have as great an impact, and that overall helps Final Fantasy Tactics A2 be a better game than the Gameboy Advance outing.Final Fantasy Tactics A2 focuses on Luso, a school student who is geared up for summer vacation.  Unfortunately, his lazy ways have made the teacher want to straighten him out and instead of beginning his summer vacation right away, Luso is sent to the library to help clean it up.  While he's there, he stumbles upon a book where the pages are blank.  When he finally writes his name in the book he's transported to the world of Ivalice where he'll meet up with a clan who agrees to help him find a way home.  Essentially, your main goal is the same as the first Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, to find a way home.  The story isn't all that great.  It's fairly forgettable, as a matter of fact.  However, where Tactics A2 falls in story, it makes up for in gameplay.Throughout the game, you'll visit pubs which will display missions for you to undertake.  Once you select a mission you'll have to go to the location and carry out the duty.  When in battle, Final Fantasy Tactics A2 plays like most other Strategy RPGs.  You'll send your warriors into battle, move them a certain number of spaces and execute attacks against the enemy.  Battles can, at times, be a little sluggish.  Even the simplest battles can last for a half an hour at most, but the amount of strategy needed is pretty deep.  As is the game's job system which can really put a spin on how easy or difficult a battle can be.The job system is easily the best part of the game.  You can choose a wide variety of jobs.  Warriors, Mages and Summoners alike.  The job a character can choose depends on their race.  For example, a Viera can't become a Soldier.  You'll unlock more jobs based on how many abilities you learn for other jobs.  Abilities are learned through a character's equipment.  This is both good and bad.  It's simple to gain ability points, all you have to do is finish a battle.  However, learning abilities is a slow task.  While most can be learned in one or two battles, the fact that most battles will take a while to finish makes learning abilities take a little longer.  Additionally, once you start needing 300 or 400 Ability Points to learn an ability, it's that much longer.  Along those lines, since it goes based on your equipment, it's not always a good idea to go into battle with the best equipment.  In terms of strategy, Final Fantasy Tactics A2 emphasizes it more so than most Strategy RPGs out there.  A slight hiccup in your jobs or abilities can cost you a battle.  The strategy involved in the game is very in-depth.Another feature that returns from Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is the judge system.  In every battle there are certain laws you must obey.  To compensate, however, the judge also lets you have a privilege that will boost certain stats like strength, agility, etc.  Breaking a law doesn't have nearly as harsh of a punishment this time around.  If you break the law you lose your privilege and you can't revive any fallen characters.  You'll want to follow the law as much as possible.  Doing so can net you some bonus items, some of which are rare.  The judge system works better in Tactics A2, but it still suffers the same problems.  There are simple laws to obey such as not using a specific spell in combat, but there are still some outright ridiculous laws to beware of.  In one battle, for example, it was against the law to miss the enemy.The game also lets you use the stylus if you want.  While the stylus controls seem like a perfect fit, they'll often slow you down.  It's to the point where the stylus controls feel more tacked on than anything else.Visually, Final Fantasy Tactics A2 is breathtaking.  The battlefields are very well designed and colorful.  The sprites are detailed as are the characters portraits.  The spell animations are also pretty good looking, vibrant and colorful. What's even better is the games overall art design which is nothing short of fantastic. If there was anything to fret over, it would be that the game is isometric 3D and not fully 3D.  This means that the camera stays fixed throughout the entire battle.  You can't rotate it or anything and that'll become a problem when your characters get bunched up and you can't see them.  The top screen is used to display the turn order by showing the sprites.  It's detailed but the sprites also looks a little pixelated when they're enlarged on the top screen.  Nonetheless, Final Fantasy Tactics A2 is an incredible looking game.In terms of music, most of it you'll have heard before.  Much of the music you here in Final Fantasy Tactics A2 is remixed from either Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, or Final Fantasy XII.  Most of it is good music, although if you didn't really like the soundtrack to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance or Final Fantasy XII, you probably won't find this one to be too memorable either.In the end Final Fantasy Tactics A2 is a better game than Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, but still doesn't manage to be as memorable as the original Final Fantasy Tactics.  While it has a forgettable storyline, it's deep, strategic and engaging gameplay will keep the player immersed for hours to come.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2008"}

{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Paslay","summary":"What the Wii should've been.","reviewText":"I remember waiting outside in the frigid cold for the Wii to be launched in 2006. I was first in line, blew the better part of the weekend but when I finally drove home with the next generation of gaming system in a box by my side, it was all worth it. 1 to 1 motion gaming, swinging Link's sword, playing sports like the pros and a myriad of other not yet known uses for this new type of gaming filled my imagination during the drive. I couldn't get home fast enough. Then came the unboxing... Wait, what's this bar with the chord? Is this IR?? You've got to be kidding me... I felt like a kid who just found out the secret behind his favorite magic trick. I'm sure many of you have your similar stories, cursing Nintendo's name as you waggled through mediocre software, finally breaking down and spending another few hundred on an Xbox or Playstation (or both).So my point is, I was more than a bit wary with the Wii U. I kept going back and forth, researching, poking it in the store. Finally my wife decided to make the decision for me and I now have the Wii U deluxe console. Forgetting the immediate plus, that I didn't have to freeze my hindquarters off waiting outside a store for it, it's a pretty amazing piece of hardware. Nintendo apparently learned from the shortage in 2006 and produced a number of these units. Don't be fooled into paying some gouger on Amazon or Ebay astronomical prices, this deluxe edition is $350 and the standard (which I would recommend against buying) is $300 and there are plenty of retailers restocking every day.The first question, Deluxe or Standard? I will answer your question with a question. Do you feel that 24 extra gigs of storage, a game that retails for $60, 2 years of 10% points back on all Wii U eShop purchases, a gamepad cradle, a stand so you can put your system upright is worth $50? If you answered yes, then buy the Deluxe. If you answered, \"I absolutely must have this console in white!!!\" then buy the Standard. Something to also note, unless you're using an external harddrive, the Standard model is unable to download full retail games from the eShop due to the size of the game.Output is via HDMI cable and is included in the box. If you don't have an HDMI in, then I believe there is a separate adapter you can purchase. There are two cradles for the single gamepad included. One is just a safe place to set it when it isn't in use, the other is a charging dock. The A/C adaptor plugs into the base and it charges the gamepad while it's in the cradle. Of course you can still plug the A/C adapter into the gamepad directly if you want to use it while charging too. Only one gamepad works per Wii U. Understand that outputting video to the gamepad and screen simultaneously takes extra processing power. Five players all with active video gamepads would bring the console to its knees. So single player gamepad (or Wiimote) Multi-player Wiimote only.The gamepad is fantastic in my opinion. I'm an adult and don't have nearly the amount of time I used to to grind levels and play video games in general. Because of this, I tend to gravitate more towards the portable system. My Vita and 3DS get far more use than my PS3 and 360. Also if my wife is home and wants to watch TV or a movie, game over. With the Wii U gamepad, I can keep playing. If I'm playing an RPG that's getting a bit grindy, I can flip over to the PS3 and put something on Netflix to take the edge off the monotony. It feels great in your hands, it's solid but not overly weighty, everything is right there, buttons are positioned where they should be. My only complaint about the gamepad is that the colors aren't quite as vivid. The screen is a little washed out compared to my TV. The touchscreen is responsive and the whole system is essentially controlled via the gamepad. Not only that, but your gamepad can also control your TV/Cable box with TVii. It's a really great system that essentially turns your gamepad into a univeral remote. I've been getting about 5-6 hours per charge on the gamepad.Graphically, yes, the Wii U is superior to the PS3 and 360. You can look up side by side comparisons. The visuals of the Wii U are top notch. NEW Super Mario Bros. U looks great as well as Assassin's Creed III and Mass Effect 3. Textures, lighting and shading are all rendered beautifully. The launch lineup is probably the strongest a Nintendo console has seen largely due to the number of current PS3 and 360 games being ported. There's plenty there for early adopters to enjoy.Currently, Sony and Microsoft are stating that their next platforms will noticeably exceed the graphical capabilities of the Wii U. The overall success of the Wii U will depend on how big the graphical difference is and more importantly whether or not we will still see the amount of 3rd party support once the new Sony and MS platforms are out. This will depend on how easy the Wii U is to develop for and how easy it will be for developers to continue to port their software. If the difference is marginal than the hardware advantages the gamepad provides may make the Wii U stand as a shoulder to shoulder competitor with the next generation of consoles. Keep in mind that console graphics only get better with time as developers figure out the ins and outs of the consoles and better game engines are developed. See Final Fantasy VII (released early in the Playstation lifecycle) and Final Fantasy IX (released late in the Playstation lifecycle) as an example. By the time Sony and MS release their new platforms there may not be as much of a graphical difference as anticipated at first due to this factor. Only time will tell.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2012"}

It didn't feel like much was changed. I pay a lot of attention to the story of the game, and halo 2 was a little bit of a repeat. With killzone I got what I was looking for. There are frantic fights on every level of this game. A lot of skill and patience are needed. Each playable character (4 total) has a different style. One is the basic soldier. The only woman is good with percision and accuracy. Another is a crazy all-out-war nut with high powered wepons that rip through the enemys, and the last is a spy that use the enemys wepons with higher accuracy. All in all, I love this game. I dont have a network adapter, so I can't participate in the online experience, But another thing this game has that halo doesn't is the ability to play bots, or A.I. so if you want to play one of the many multiplayer games, you dont need to have another person.

The story follows from AC2, but this time we get to play during the American Revolution.  This is the best aspect of the game.  I recently beat the game and it became very anti-climatic.  After everything that you're required to do, get to do, and complete through the first 10 chapters, I must say the last two chapters and tasks are quite a let down.  Without spoiling the ending, I will leave a brief thought.  The ending was disappointing not only because of the outcome, but also the lack of actual control you have towards the end.  Again, I will not go into game detail, but towards the end, it seems like their are more cutscenes than actual gameplay.

Tilley Jr. \"goatman_1\"","summary":"Game of the Year?","reviewText":"For months, I've been eagerly awaiting one of the most anticipated games of the year: Neverwinter Nights.  The day I picked it up, I decided to pick up Warcraft 3 while I was at it on a whim.  I loved Starcraft, although I wasn't a big fan of Diablo.  After playing Neverwinter for a few hours, I decided to see what Warcraft 3 was about... and I haven't played Neverwinter Nights since.Warcraft is one of the best games I've ever played.  It seems to get everything right.  First of all, it looks amazing.  Instead of abandoning the old cartoonish feel of the first two games, Blizzard has improved upon it with 3D graphics and vibrant colors that are a pleasure to look at.  The environments, characters and troops look beautiful. The sound is equally amazing.  Lightning thunders, battles roar, orcs scream and music crescendos in a multitude of formats.  I've experimented with EAS and Dolby Surround and prefer Dolby.  The voice talents are also excellent, whether we're talking about peons, heroes or, my personal favorites: goblins.  &quot;Are you threatening me?&quot;The gameplay is revolutionary in it's simplicity.  Many of the newer RTS games I've bought, like Empire Earth for example, have an overwhelming amount of units which require a lot of micromanagement.  By adding RPG and squad based elements to the pre-existing framework, WC3 goes for quality over quantity.  You can't simply overwhelm your opponent with superior numbers.  Instead you have to actually apply squad based tactics more common in games like Freedom Force or X-Com.The most noticeable new feature is the inclusion of &quot;Heros&quot;, powerful units capable of leveling up and gaining extraordinary powers and attributes.  The heroes drive the story and gameplay in both single, and multiplayer games.  In the single player campaign, they are the Stars of the show complete with their own motivations and eccentricities.  In multiplayer mode, they can turn the tide of battle singlehandedly.  Between the four races there are about 12 of them (three for each race) which doesn't include the unique characters from the single player campaign.Technically I found it a lot less demanding than the last three or four games I've bought (Neverwinter Nights and Morrowind seemed to need a lot of resources).  I've heard otehr reviewers with better machines than mine complaining about lag, but I haven't had any problems.  I have a 1ghz processor, 512 megs of RAM and a 64meg Radeon video card.  This baby scrolls like glass with everything cranked to the max.The biggest and best feature of Warcraft 3 is the world itself.  WC3 has personality whcih is most evident in the four races.  I don't think I have a favorite race, but the Night Elves definitely have the best buildings: living trees that can actually uproot and relocate.  The single player campaign is excellent, complete with epic storyline, colorful characters, scenic locations and some of the best cut-scene animations I've ever seen in a game.  There are more twists and turns than most of the movies that came out this summer.  The well-written well-executed story is THE reason to own this game, but the multiplayer element will keep you playing it indefinitely.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2002"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYV70","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Beautiful and Fun!","reviewText":"When I first heard, it's Skyrim with Guns, I was skeptical...  But I gotta say Far Cry 3 delivers!Concept:  10/10It's an open ended first person shooter set in a jungle controlled by drug dealing, kidnapping, murdering pirates, and a small native resistance with spiritual beliefs.  There are an arsenal of weapons, ways to travel, a long campaign, and a ton of side missions.  Far Cry 3 manages to pull all of these things off nicely!Story:  10/10A group of friends go on vacation to the tropics!  It's all fun and games until they get kidnapped by psychotic pirates, who want to ransom / torture them.  It really feels like you walked right into a Lionsgate film.  The characters are well developed, the writing is quoteable, and the acting is good!  You'll be motivated to kill the bad guys and save your friends!Graphics:  10/10The island is beautiful and in between gun battles, it feels like you are really on a tropical island paradise.  It's even nice to stop and enjoy the view once in a while... until a leopard jumps out of the bushes and bites your face.  Or you found out the hard way that the game has crocodiles.The characters are very well rendered and nicely animated, too.  There's an occasional strange animation, and that's the game's only graphic flaw.Gameplay:  9.5/10The gameplay is GREAT!  Everything is FUN and tuned to make you feel like the ultimate bad ass!  So if there's a jeep full of bad guys driving buy, you can hide in the underbrush, and as it passes, you can jump out and shotgun the driver.  In the real world, the driver would die, the jeep would slow down, and the enemies would attack.  But not in Far Cry 3!  The jeep speeds up, goes out of control, and explodes!!!  It makes you feel awesome!The majority of the game involves killing bad guys and taking out bases.  The AI is predictable and the game gives you tools to plan your strategy.  Do you hide and snipe?  Do you run and gun?  Do you use high explosives?  Do you use a silenced SMG?  Do you use a Heavy Machine Gun?  Do you use a knife?  It's up to you and all of these strategies pay off!When you fight any base, the first thing you want to do is use your camera or a scoped weapon and look at the enemies.  An icon will appear over their heads and stay there, telling you what kind of AI it is.  A lightning bolt means charger.  Fangs mean hostile animal like a guard dog.  A skull means it's a gunner.  Armor, means that the guy is nearly bulletproof and probably carries a heavy machine gun or flame thrower.  A targeting reticle is a sniper.  These icons stay over their heads and once an enemy has been marked, you can track them and even see them through walls (shaded).  So, if you see 2 snipers, and 2 chargers, you can hide, plant some landmines between them and you, and take out the two snipers if you are fast.  The chargers will see you and come running...  and blow up when they hit your mines.  Just about every strategy you employ will work, and it makes you feel awesome!The AI also attacks the last place they saw you, so if you're overrun,  you can drop mines or C4 and then sneak away.  When they search the bushes, you can blow them up or flank them with a grenade launcher.  There are also a ton of upgrades in the skill tree for the game.  At higher levels, you can stealth kill 3 guys in 2 seconds.There are also poker games, checkpoint driving missions, base missions where you must kill the commander with a knife, target shooting missions, and hunting missions, which are really fun!  Unless a tiger attacks you while you're trying to snipe something.Far Cry 3 also features a simple crafting and upgrade system.  You want a new ammo pouch?  Kill 2 of a specific type of animal.  You want to carry more money, kill 2 of another type of animal.  It's really fun and easy to upgrade your gear.  This isn't the type of grinding game where they make you kill 50 goblins just because.There is fast travel to every city and base you have conquered and there are abandoned cars, boats, hang gliders, etc... all over the island.  It's really easy to get anywhere you want in 5 minutes.  If you prefer to run to your destination, you'll be able to pick herbs and hunt animals along the way.Multiplayer:  7/10The multiplayer is pretty standard Call of Duty Style death matches, but there are some twists.  The first time you are killed, you can cling to life by mashing A, and an ally can revive you.  The opposing team doesn't get credit for the kill.  You also get a battle cry, which gives your nearby allies a boost!  Other than that you get upgradeable skills, guns, grenades, etc...  It's pretty fun, but the main reason to play this game is for the campaign.Replay Value:  10/10The campaign has 2 different endings and you may want to play through it twice because it's really fun!  The game will take about 20-50 hours to finish, depending on how many side quests you do.  And the multiplayer is decent.  You'll get your money's worth here.Maturity:  M!!!This game is SUPER M Rated!  Swearing, torture, murder, gore, drugs, prostitutes, etc...  If you let your 11 year old play this, you need a slap.Overall:  10/10Far Cry 3 is great and delivers on everything as promised.

{"product_name":"B00007KUU8","reviewerName":"S. Morales","summary":"Explosive Sequal to the Original","reviewText":"MGS2 remake, Substance, while having its flaws is most definitely one of the greatest games available on the PS2. The stealth action genre has many copycats (all well recieved by critics though). This time around we control a new FOX Hound infiltrator codenamed Raiden (real name Jack), and while it's a disppointment for Snake fans, Raiden controls just about the same and you'll soon get over it. Let's see why this is a great game...Eyes and Ears: 4.5/5: While the graphics are definitely a huge step above MGS1 on the PSOne, the sound is conventially the same (or tweaked to a level but I didn't notice: the gunshot sounds, intense music, noise collision detection, and voice acting are just as fantastic as they were in the first game). Framerates are still smooth and while the cutscenes in the game are greatly acted with stellar dramatic animation, they are WAY TOO LONG, but more on that later. The camera work never hinders the action or the gameplay, because you have the free movement of looking wherever you want, but even as you move about, it's still very well placed. My only gripe with the visuals were the mostly plain colors used throughout the game. See, because of the story, there's only 2 places in the entire game you play through(you control Snake on a ship as an intro to the game, but it's short) so variety in areas is lacking, but the actual content of the game will soon get your mind off it.Hands: 5/5: Again Hideo Kojima has made certain to give us super tight controls so navigation through this game is never a problem. Given all the control options there are, it's important that it's all responsive. Unfortunately, with so much there comes a learning curve, so make sure to read over the instruction manual before starting the game (thankfully a new feature in the game is a small tutorial of every available action move), but if you don't the new substance remake has a huge set of customizable virtual training missions, so get some practice if you've never played a MGS game before. This is also a fun extra after you've beat the game... time yourself and see how fast you can get through the training missions.Brains: 5/5: While many complain that the story is a little too complex to comprehend (I admit I got lost with all the characters and their motives), don't worry too much about it, the core story is really all you need to know. Things actually become very interesting at the very end where Raiden encounters a surprise about his fellow comrades, and some brilliant philosophy is brought in.As far as the gameplay, enemies are just as fun to take down as they were in the original MGS. Sneaking around them is also a blast. There is a rescue and protection mission that is pretty challenging also.Hormones: 4.5/5: Everything in this game becomes more and more fun as you go along, as you'll become more accustomed to the controls and variety of moves. Although it's fun, it's not perfect. If there's one thing I didn't like it would have to be the feeling of being handheld throughout the game. The cutscenes seems to do a lot of what I could be doing myself, and if you die or \"lose\" a mission, you'll be able to start RIGHT where you left off, so challenge isn't really an issue here as there's no real \"fear\" in dying, know what I mean? (by this I mean, while some situations may be hard to get through, all it really takes is patience and a quick finger). The save anywhere option makes it even easier (though, I played it through on easy mode, try the hard or extra hard mode after finishing the game, it'll be great fun to play it through again.)The extras on this new edition consist of a dogtag mode (where you can collect dogtags off henchmen thoughout the game, and collect them all in a folder, big deal). There's also a skateboard mode where you can Tony Hawk LITE your way through areas in the game on a skateboard and rack up points. While that's somewhat fun, don't expect Tony Hawk depth. So if you've already bought the original edition, there's really no reason to buy this one. But the big one here is the cut-scene length, at the end of the game there's one that lasts about a half hour! There's gotta be a better way of progressing the story along, it almost felt at times that I wasn't really a part of it. A \"movie-game\" is a good idea, just don't make it so much that the player feels like he actually IS watching a movie and NOT playing a video game.Overall, keep in mind none of the flaws in this game are designer-type problems, like bad controls, idiotic puzzles, lazy level design, etc, but more of things you feel like nitpicking at, and I honestly couldn't think of a better way to do them to optimally progress the story along. The game is great, plain and simple, and with enthrall all fans of action/adventure/stealth type games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2005"}

Nathan Hale.View larger.This sequel introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers.View larger.Resistance 2 takes up right where Resistance: Fall of Man left off. Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"Greg Sword \"DETfaninATL\"","summary":"A marked improvement over the first in nearly every way.","reviewText":"Resistance : Fall Of Man gave PS3 players their own proprietary FPS, and Resistance 2 improves upon it in pretty much every significant wayTHE GOOD : There's a lot to like about Resistance 2, but one of the first things you notice right away is the marked improvement in graphics from the previous title. Resistance : FOM was a very good game and had fairly good graphics. But from the first moment you crawl from the wreckage of your downed craft and see the towering alien vessel before you, you know the second installment in this series is a marked improvement over the first. The scenery, weapons, Chimera, and additional characters all have a significantly improved look to them. The scenery is lush and vibrant compared to the first games stark and, at times drab, scenery. I seem to remember a lot of Resistance : FOM being very grey and brown for some reason. Not so with Resistance 2. The beautiful scenery makes for a harsh contrast against the games' violent and unrelenting invaders, which serves this title well. Though there are MANY scenes and levels that serve as a good example of this, none is more striking than when you first come up to street level and walk out into the open to see San Francisco burning in the distance, with the Golden Gate bridge next to you and an entire armada of invading Chimeran ships hovering above the destroyed city. You can't help but stop and admire the frightening beauty of it for a few moments as you pan the camera around to take in the full scope and magnitude of the devastation before you. In addition to the improved graphics the game ups the ante with some of the new Chimera you face. Back again are the same foot soldiers, Steelheads, Ravagers and Titans, but they've brought some new foes in the Chameleons, Furies, Grimms and most noticeably the bosses themselves. They range in size from 2-story Marauders to skyscraper-high Leviathans. And they're ALL fascinating to behold. Like the Chimera, many of the same weapons return from the original but there are new weapons to use as well. And all of them are fun and powerful. Even a simple, small gun like the Magnum is made fun to use by the secondary fire function that all the weapons in the game have. All in all this is a very fun, very good looking FPS that will provide many fun hours of entertainment...... for at least the first play-through or two. Which brings me to .....THE BAD: While this game has much to like about it, and the positives far outweigh the negatives, there are definitely some weak points in Resistance 2. Not the least of which is, after you've played this game once through, it loses a significant bit of its' appeal. That is to say, outside of the online modes or co-op, this game has very low replay value. By the second time through, I was pretty much ready to be done with the game and move on. And not because it's a bad or boring game - not at all- it's just because once you've played this through, you know what to expect and where to expect it and how to formulate a battle strategy for it. IE, the enjoyability of this game relies a great bit on the element of surprise. Not even changing the difficulty level varies it up significantly enough to make a significant difference. Something else I was less than thrilled about (and I realize this is purely personal) is that some of the PS3 Trophies for this game are online or co-op trophies. While I realize that online play is fantastic fun, I also don't like having to rely on others to achieve the trophies I'm after. Besides, not everybody plays online either. Even a game like Call Of Duty : Modern Warfare 2, which is THE go-to game for online FPS play, understands this and all of the trophies are 'offline' trophies. Again, it's a personal gripe, but IMHO, a valid one. One last gripe about the trophies is that there is one trophy which requires you to get 10,000 kills in online matches. 10,000!!! Whew! That trophy alone will take longer than all the others...... combined! I know that complaints about PS3 trophies are minor, but at the same time they're a part of the game and to some, a significant part. Other than the 2 basic things I've already gone through, there isn't much else not to like, other than maybe the game gets a tad glitchy at times or freezes up altogether for a few seconds. Besides that, the plot is paper thin and not engaging at all, but who plays games like this for the literary value? As one last item of interest here, the game is painfully linear, in that it doesn't allow for too much exploration. I realize this is a mechanism to keep you moving forward and on the right path, but it's at times inconsistent.THE BOTTOM LINE : All in all, this is a pretty solid game. If you have a PS3 and are into FPS's, especially with a sci-fi twist, this is a fantastic game. It's worth buying if you're into online play and if not, it's maybe only worth renting, depending on your preferences, because, as I mentioned the single-player campaign has moderately low replay value.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2010"}

You score points by having a strong finish in the mini-games, which ultimately may lead to an overall win.Fusion Frenzy contains 45 mini-games; and, although many of them are just different variations of a theme, there is enough variety to give the game plenty of play value.

While the game can only accommodate a maximum of four players, I have played with as much as eight by rotating controllers. The mini-games move along fast enough that no has a chance to get board.Of course, this game is not for everyone. If you are a hard-core gamer who spends more time with your Xbox than sleeping and attending school combined (or if you were thinking about purchasing this as a gift for said gamer), this probable isn't the game for you.

I have been playing for like 20 years already (yeah, i am that old, 34 and counting ;)), and I am not really too emotional about games anymore. Don't take me wrong, it is my only hobby, and I play a lot. I would say I saw it all already. Skyrim returned me that already nearly forgotten feeling of wonder and owe I had as a teenager. Like the first time I played Gothic 1-2, or M&M; games, or Morrowind. By some reason Oblivion did not work for me, but Skyrim worked a miracle. Now I cannot sleep or concentrate on my job, because I am totally under the influence of this digitized drug called TES 5 Skyrim.It is so addictive it should be illegal, or at least should come with a warning from surgeon general and with a list of crisis hot-line number for addicted players.

Sonic returns alongside his old buds Tails and Knuckles with some other characters to once again battle Dr. Robotnik.  While you can tell this game was designed primarily for younger kids, older gamers will love playing Sonic Adventure.  The levels are massive, the graphics are unbelieveable, and the virtual pet Chao is a cool addition to an allready awesome game.  The only problem is the camera angle can get awkward very quickly on certain levels, causing you to misjudge your distance when you jump and leading to frustrating deaths, but when you get the hang of it, it becomes simple.  All in all, the one Dreamcast game (along with Shenmue which is very recommended) that is essential in your collection if you own a Dreamcast.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2002"}

This one is a LOT of fun, for a short time!  It's as if someone had a great idea for a game, but rushed it out and never finished it.  Basically, you draw clouds for Baby Mario to glide down from a tree on, circling coins to throw at him to collect as the circles make a bubble to make them movable, and circling enemies to bubble them in and protect Mario.  Yoshi catches Mario at the bottom of the tree, if you make it, and then you do a platform run that is similar, but horizonal---you make bridges with clouds and collect coins, and also fruit for Yoshi, so he can shoot enemies more directly.  In one mode you are trying to get a certain score, in another, to get as far as you can.  You unlock a few more modes by doing this.  It sounds simple, but the levels are well designed, and in the marathon mode, they come up randomly, so you never know what's coming next.  It's very addictive trying to get Mario further!  However, we unlocked all the modes fairly quickly, and there really isn't anything else to aim for except getting very high scores---you don't WIN the game, you don't collect anything new to use, you just play on and on and on.  We only have one DS---we did unlock a 2 player mode which my son tried with a friend---he said it really wasn't too different than anything else included except you were competing with another player for a high score.  I can't say I didn't enjoy this game, but I don't think we'll ever play it much more---so it was a bit pricey and a little disappointing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2005"}

Ware","summary":"Fun game for kids and adults","reviewText":"Rayman for the Wii U is kind of your typical obstacle course type video game.  In the game you run, jump, smash, and hit your way through different levels of courses.  I found that the game is fun and is good for kids who are comfortable with video games but might be frustrating for kids under 5 as it takes some coordination.  The Wii U version tries to take advantage of the Wii U controller by offering specific play for on the console only and for on TV only.  This is the first time I have seen this approach in a game and it is a nice feature but missed on a few areas.  I played a game on the console only which gives the game a Ipad feel by using the touch and move features of the controller.  To move through the course you have to touch and swipe things with your finger as well as turn the controller to move different things in the game.  Kids will find this familiar if they already play games on an Ipadd or Itouch type device.  Only thing that I didn't like is that in the course I played the touch, swipe, and move was used too much.  They are nice features for specific things but when used to much in the game it becomes a distraction in my mind.I found the game play to fun and not too challenging where frustration sets in.  Overall this is a good game for parents and kids and offers a non-violent game everyone can play.  It takes advantage of the Wii U features but might use them too much at times.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2013"}

I have played this game about 5 times, every time I found something different and fun to do.  The great thing about this game besides it can really caught your imagination and make you extremely addict to it, is the versatility of the story, you can decide whether you want to follow the main plot step by step, or if you want to do side missions instead just for fun.  Even you can decide if the mission is too difficult to skip it and continue the main plot, the impact will be minimum to the overall story, and believe me you will come back later for more so eventually you will complete those missions.At the beginning you can be very confused on what are you doing, but the game starts to make sense after the third major mission is completed.

Well it was at the beginning, that is until I reached the first boss level.I cannot get past this level at all! For those who play first person shooters all the time, this boss is probably easy to beat. But for people like me, who don't play all the time or prefer adventure/platform games, this is VERY frustrating! Not only do you have to shoot about six creatures called \"splinters\" who don't die easy, after you kill them, a larger one comes down to take their place. You have to scan the large splinter, which leaves you absolutely vulnerable, because if you don't you won't be able to progress through the game. And even though it pauses while it's downloading the info into your visor, once that's through the large splinter completes it's attack, inflicting huge amounts of damage!Once you destroy this large splinter, another one will take it's place called the \"dark splinter.\" Mind you, you are trapped in a cage and CANNOT run away and there's nothing to jump behind! And these enemies come one after another so there's no time to regroup!By the time I reach the dark splinter, my energy level is critically low and there's no way to recharge, so all it takes is one or two hits or accidentally bumping into this creature to end the game.NOT fun! And there's no way to set the game difficulty to easy, it's either normal or hard. NO cheat codes either, that I can find on the internet, that would supply you with infinite energy.And if it's this difficult for the first boss, I'd hate to see what the other ones are like.

Prepare to experience an RPG unlike any other. Welcome to the world ofShadow Hearts.","reviewerName":"Quercus Alba","summary":"Perfect Dark RPG In Every Way","reviewText":"I just finished \"Shadow Hearts\" last night.  It was one of the best games I've ever played.  I spent about 40 hours beating it, although there were some side quests I skipped, which I will do when I play it again in the future.This is a dark-themed game, but more in a thought-provoking way as opposed to physical gore.  It does have some moments of humor, too.  I would list \"pros\" and \"cons\" for this game, but I can't think of any \"cons,\" so here are the \"pros\" -Six playable characters that are all interesting and truly memorable.  I liked Yuri, Alice, and Margarete best, but all are memorable and have different strengths.  You have some freedom to choose between them at times, which I appreciated.Deep, memorable story with a big epic ending that compares favorably with the best of Final Fantasy series.Judgement Ring combat system that injects a bit of timing into turn-based combat.  I felt that it worked great - combat was turn-based, and during boss fights particularly, I found myself considering multiple options and plotting actions a couple of rounds into the future, yet with the judgement ring, the effectiveness of actions still hinged on accurately hitting the timing of the ring correctly when you execute them.  Great emphasis on strategy while still bringing some hand-eye coordination into it.  Plus, with status ailments/augmentations affecting the judgement rings, it added to the things to manage in combat.The Sanity Points (SP) were another thing you had to watch in addition to HP and MP.  I actually liked that - it was fitting, given the game's emphasis on themes of souls, torture, mental illness, religion, etc., plus it made combat, particularly boss battles, more complex to manage and win.Game balance was in general good.  I never felt over-levelled or outmatched, although I did get obliterated once when I was trying to level up a couple of my weaker characters and stepped into a boss fight unexpectedly.  This game has RPG elements of finding better armor, weapons, spells, etc., but it doesn't seem to be the main focus like it is in some other games.  It's hard to put into words, but my attention was more on the characters, story, and great combat - the items weren't the main focus.The \"Graveyard\" section, being totally separate from the main gameplay (it takes part in Yuri's \"soul\" at occasional points in the game) was a genius addition.  It adds a lot to the game in terms of depth and playability.Graphics hold up pretty well for a game from over 10 years ago.  Character design looks very good - especially Margarete, Keith, and Alice.  Music is very good - creepy when appropriate, epic, uplifting, light at other times.I think the game is a masterpiece RPG.  I played Koudelka first, and it was neat to see the connections as they unfolded, although the prequel is by no means necessary.  Koudelka was good, but Shadow Hearts was phenomenal.  I'm looking forward to playing the other two Shadow Hearts titles soon.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2012"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J6KU","description":"","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"The bigger, badder version of Dragon's Dogma","reviewText":"Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen is an expanded re-release of the original Dragon's Dogma. Since I've already reviewed the original version of this game, this review will focus solely on the new additions included in the main game, as well as the Dark Arisen expansion. If you want more information on the gameplay and story of the main game, simply check under my profile for my extensive review.Those who already have a saved game file of the original Dragon's Dogma will be able to automatically transfer their saved data to the Dark Arisen expansion and pick up where they left off, although those who want to start from scratch (like me) also have the option of doing so since this expansion includes everything the main game has and more...MUCH more. There has been some new content added to the main game which makes playing it less of a hassle. There is now a permanent Port Crystal just outside of Cassardis and the portable Port Crystals from the original version of the game are now far easier to obtain, as are the Ferrystones needed to transport yourself to them. Looks like Capcom listened to its fans for once with regards to Dragon's Dogma needing an improvement with its fast travel. Rift Crystals are also much easier to come by and are left behind more often by slain enemies, so no more relying solely on your Main Pawn being hired by other players in order to gain Rift Crystals. And of course, more weapons, armor, and accoutrements are available for your characters to use. One improvement worth noting has to do with the rings and earrings you can equip that increase your stats in strength and defenses: you can now wear two different sets of those items at the same time, which really helps in improving the number of different defenses available to you.Now onto the Dark Arisen content. From the very beginning of the main game, the player has the option of accessing the Dark Arisen content by speaking to the character named Olra, who will be standing on the pier of the Arisen's home village of Cassardis when night falls. She will be able to transport you to the expansive dungeon off the coast of Gransys known as Bitterblack Isle, the location in which the story for Dark Arisen takes place. The goal is to go through the dungeon filled with deadly monsters and defeat the malevolent force laying within that is responsible for creating the dark hell-hole in the first place. First and foremost, Bitterblack Isle is not meant to be tackled by low-level players. As anyone who played the original Dragon's Dogma knows, most of the enemies in the original game became considerably easier to beat once the player reached level 50 or so, and since the maximum level a player can reach is level 200, the game offered basically no challenge to players who pumped themselves up to higher levels. Capcom's solution to this is Dark Arisen. The enemies you encounter here are meant for the big boys. I started Dark Arisen at level 75 and while the first few new enemies I encountered like Wargs and Greater Goblins proved easy enough to deal with, the stronger enemies like Elder Ogres, Garm, Prisoner Gorecyclopse, Eliminators, and Living Armors proved to be quite deadly. Even above level 100, these enemies provided stiff challenges. Other new enemies that proved to be tough but less frustrating include Cursed Dragons, Dark Bishops, Gazers, Corrupted Pawns, Poisoned Undead, and more.One enemy type that will keep you on your toes early on are the Maneaters, which are these large, worm-like creatures that randomly pop out of chests when you open them and will attempt to swallow you whole (fortunately, my Pawns were always quick enough to get me out whenever one of these guys grabbed me, but eventually I learned to just let my Pawns open most chests instead). The cheapest enemy by far though is Death. He can kill anything with one swing of his scythe, whether it's you, your Pawns, or even other enemies. He appears randomly to cause you endless headaches and while he eventually disappears after receiving enough damage or after you avoid him long enough, he will come after you again at some point to try to finish what he started. Whatever damage he receives from you in one encounter carries over into the next. The problem is that, aside from the online Ur-Dragon, Death has the highest defense stats of any enemy in the game, so you'll do next to no damage to him unless you're at a very high level. Also, any Pawns he kills are automatically forfeit, so you'll have to find a Riftstone to get them back. Fortunately, Death can be easily avoided for the most part if you don't want to fight him.The dungeon of Bitterblack Isle is quite expansive, although most of it consists of narrow corridors and bridges like the Catacombs and the Everfall in Gransys. As you make your way through the dungeon you will come across another Arisen named Barroch who will let you buy/sell items, manage your inventory, change skills and vocations, and upgrade your weapons and armor. Barroch is the only character in the game who can upgrade your dragonforged gear even further to silverforged and goldforged, further increasing their attributes, which is a must if you hope to survive the later portions of Dark Arisen. Upgrading your dragonforged gear requires materials collected from slain enemies and the environment in conjunction with Rift Crystals. Barroch will be located in safe areas where you and your Pawns can rest and in other areas where you can return to the surface of the island and speak with Olra. She too can manage your inventory and let you change your skills/vocations, but she also provides purification services. Most of the weapons, armor, and accoutrements you find in Bitterblack Isle are cursed and cannot be used until Olra purifies them, which will also cost you in Rift Crystals. This requires a certain amount of backtracking that may turn some players off, but it does make things more interesting from a strategic standpoint (should you keep going or should you play it safe and visit Olra to purify your cursed loot?). On the plus side, if you're far away from one of the exits that lead to the surface or if you're facing overwhelming odds, you can use Liftstones (which are similar to Ferrystones) to transport yourself to the surface in an instant. In my experience, going to Olra to purify cursed items sometimes proved pointless as I found myself acquiring the same things over and over, but occasionally I would get some really useful stuff (the mightier weapons and armor are of course more rare). Sometimes the cursed items turn out to be scrolls that offer secret augments for your characters. Most of them were quite useless, like gaining the ability to mine items more quickly and being able to fire ballistas more quickly, although a couple of others proved more advantageous, such as being able to hold onto large enemies for longer as they try to shake you off or having your stamina drain more slowly while sprinting.After defeating the final boss, the dungeon closes up and you have the option of going back in again and reopening all its access points. Stronger enemies will spawn more often in different locations on your second run through the dungeon, and a few tougher dragon enemies will appear as well. Other reviewers claimed that an unusually large number of tougher enemies are sent at you all at once, and for a while I believed these claims to be greatly exaggerated...that is until I started my second run through the dungeon. There WILL be times where the game goes out of its way to make sure you die, no matter how high a level you are. One area had two huge Prisoner Gorecyclopse, Corrupted Pawns, Strigoi, and Hellhounds all together, and for good measure, Death appeared soon afterwards. The area just outside the final boss's chamber at one point had about 6 Eliminators, 2 Wyverns, and 3 Living Armors standing guard. Simply getting past these enemies is challenging enough, but actually fighting them is nearly impossible (fortunately, you're not required to fight every enemy you encounter). The second encounter with the final boss will also prove to be a worthy challenge. Capcom did a good job at providing a greater challenge for stronger players, but they clearly went overboard to a certain degree. Despite the game's occasional cheapness, it's still a blast to play, thanks in no small part to the still awesome combat. Given the current price of Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen, trading in the old version (if you still have it) and getting this one is worth it and has a hefty amount of new content. If we ever get a Dragon's Dogma 2, here's hoping things end up being a bit more balanced.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00006LEM9","description":"For even the mildest fans, anything related to this beloved book deserves top-notch treatment. Vivendi's officially authorizedThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringfalls disappointingly short of that goal. The game is intriguing enough (credit the source material) to play through entirely--once. For the cost of the game, you are guaranteed a reasonably pleasurable 10 hours of gameplay. After that, it will likely sit on your shelf.There are good things in this game: the RPG mechanics are fine (at various points in the story you play as Frodo, Aragorn, and Gandalf), the visuals are beautiful in parts, and certain aspects of game design are fantastic (Gandalf's magic-casting stands out). Little touches make it appealing to true fans, like when Aragorn receives the repaired Sword of Elendil, and it glows during fighting. It would be a great game for even non-LOTRfans to play, since a good deal of backstory is provided in lengthy cinematics throughout the game.Fellowship's greatest asset, of course, is the story itself, as well as the bevy of villainous creatures that provide great boss-fight material. I'm sure many other gameswishedthey had a Balrog to offer.But the story deviates strangely from the book in order to satisfy the format of an RPG game. The final boss-fight (which we won't spoil here) is completely unrelated to anything devised by J.R.R. Tolkien, and it seems hollow, strange, and unsatisfying. The puzzles sprinkled throughout the game are random and often frustrating, as is your first encounter with the Ringwraiths (inevitably, you die many times--too steep a difficulty curve right out of the gate).

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

First person shooters (FPS) are not my favorite genre but the demo version of Doom3 on the PC gave me such a friggin big scare that I felt compelled to do something about it.Doom3 for the Xbox is a chilling, thrilling, (add your favorite ..ing here) game where the Mature 17+ rating is simply an understatement.Be prepared to watch flying corpses, limbs and bones. Expect guttural sounds and demonic whispers next to you in pitch-black tight corridors. No  need to feel paranoid, there ARE actually monsters all around you.The game is scary at first when you only carry a wuzzy pistol, a flashlight and the shotgun.  Oh, but when you start finding macho weapons such as the plasma gun, rocket launcher, Chaingun, BFG  and the big ass chainsaw, the scared turns to startled, then to upset then to piss*d, and you really want to get even.Too bad for the easily scared is that you can not turn into a cowboy and start running and screaming Jeronimo! If you don't want to come back to a Quicksave every 5 seconds you must explore every nook and cranny for a piece of protective armor, a few shotgun shells or a devilishly hidden PDA with the necessary codes to open the infirmary or an ammo locker.  You really have no choice here but to go slowly, carefully and with your tail between your legs.So you cannot carry a weapon and the flashlight at the same time? Boo-hoo, I'll let you in on a little secret... (whispering) This is a design feature... (/whispering)  Don't you think there were a gazillion beta testers who had complained about it first?  Don't you guys think that fumbling the flashlight with your weapon adds more to the tension? I think you get the picture.  Oh, but don't worry, the flashlight won't help much after finding Hell (if you get there before telling your priest to exorcise the Doom box)The campaign mode takes about 20-25 hours to complete, which is enough time to either make you pee on your pants or convert you into a KISS member.

{"product_name":"B007VFHGZ4","description":"","reviewerName":"Schwe1nehund","summary":"Like reuniting with your high school sweetheart and realizing she's been the one all along.","reviewText":"I've played through all the TR games yet none of them held up to the first two that were released in 1996 and 1998. Every sequel that Core Design put out since then was a steady decline towards irrelevance. There were flashes of brilliance here and there - young Lara lost in an island in TR: Chronicles was one such moment. But nothing really felt right. Crystal Dynamics went down the right path when they launched Legends in 2006 and Underworld was another step in the right direction. I'm glad Crystal realized that they needed to sit back and rethink the whole franchise to make Lara and more importantly, that particular brand of gameplay she became famous for, relevant again. Tomb Raider 2013 is delightfully well made and I haven't been able to stop playing it for a couple of days now.VISUALS: Out of the box the game looks good. The character models are detailed, the texture work is crisp, and there are nice dx11 effects peppered throughout. Its not the best thing out there (having just played through Crysis 3 recently) but it is more modern than Lara has ever been. Not certain when Nvidia is going to fix the whole TressFX thingamajig, but the sooner the better. The detailed physics-based hair looks awesome, but it will murder your framerate at the moment (even on an Nvidia GTX680). The graphics are helped by a terrific art direction. Things are constantly grim on this troublesome island. The color palettes are darker than what we've typically seen in past Croft games or that other game that many adamantly compare this TR reboot to: Uncharted. The PC version benefits from a host of manually controlled bells and whistles. Thanks to the excellent job done by Nixxes, who I believe also handled Deus Ex on PC. Here's to hoping some crafty modders enhance the game even further.STORY: From what I've played so far (about 40% in), the story is great. its not the games strongest suite (that would be the gameplay itself), but its well put together and will make you care for Lara a great deal. What starts out as a terrified yet curious youngling is slowly turning into a more confident and capable adventurer. I'm not even sure when the transition started taking place - and I applaud Crystal Dynamics for making it such a subtle experience so far. The game's core is purely Lara. There is a great grand mystery about the island and its inhabitants but that's best left for you to explore and me to ignore in this review. I'm not even sure how the game is going to end, being where I am right now, but it is intriguing in a Lost-ish/Lord of the Flies way.GAMEPLAY: I love the gameplay. the controls are excellent and responsive to the action on-screen. Every weapon feels right. Every desperate leap feels tense. Every confident landing feels rewarding. The puzzles are a bit watered down compared to older TR games, but that, I fear is a function of this generation's addiction to instant gratification.The open world is well implemented. Obviously, it isn't as wildly open as a Bethesda or Rockstar North production, but it is a well thought-out and frequently rewarding sandbox. There are some light RPG mechanics in that you can unlock new abilities to give Lara an extra edge across three broad traits. The game has a startling bit of violence. I'm not complaining but it is a bit shocking to see Lara get suddenly and brutally impaled. Then there are the optional tombs and the plethora of trophy hunts. Exploring and hunting for trophies makes absolute sense in a Lara Croft game. As much as I loved the Batman Arkham games, the whole trophy hunting was very uncharacteristic of the Caped Crusader. Gotham's burning but \"BRB lol, Riddler Trophies!\"AUDIO: The voice acting is largely good. Kudos to the lead, played by the lovely Camilla Luddington. The other supporting cast members aren't as great, save for maybe 1 or 2. Honestly, I feel the generic bad guys have more exciting and better acted banter. The music, frequently a stand-out component of previous TR games, does its duty. Perhaps not as memorable as some of the older games, but it does a good job in supporting the narrative thread and the action.FINAL THOUGHTS: I truly think this is the first great game of 2013. After the string of disappointments that were Dead Space 3 and Crysis 3, I had pretty much resigned myself to X-Com until this game came out. Good or bad I was going to get my hands on Tomb Raider. Fortunately, this easily surpasses every single Tomb Raider game since 1998 and can confidently take a place among the original games that made Lara so endearing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2013"}

The guys tend to have fully covered bodies. Something's not quite even here.There are a number of modes, between simple arcade mode, one on one combat, training demos, and more. As you play through the game you earn points, which let you unlock more secrets. It encourages you to go through the game as each character, learning their best moves and techniques. Each character has his or her own favorite weapons and combat style.As with all fighting games, you have to get used to the violence. The characters are bashing each other with some rather nasty moves - and it doesn't necessarily stop when one person is defeated. I've seen my character kicked to the ground, the game announce my defeat, and then the enemy throw in a final, gratuitous kick. It's very discouraging.The different levels are fun, with their atmosphere and backgrounds. The music is on the generic side and doesn't go themed with the world you're in, as more modern fighters tend to do. Also it is sometimes fairly easy to simply knock your opponent out of the ring and be done with it.Also, on the sounds angle, there are only a limited number of things that the announcer says. So if you play a given character through an 8 round series of fights, you are going to hear the same thing over and over again.That all being said, this is a true classic of a game and many people have become quite fond of the sequels.

{"product_name":"B007XYBUBE","description":"","reviewerName":"MisterMusicFan","summary":"A celebration of Sony franchises and a solid brawler","reviewText":"As the world not-so-patiently waits for the next installment of Super Smash Bros., we're treated to PlayStation All-Stars, a game that was undeniably inspired by the now-iconic brawler that came before it, yet plays differently enough to make a mark all its own. The premise is very similar to SSB: the most memorable icons of the various Sony-owned franchises are cobbled together in a crossover fighting game in which the goal is to knock the stuffing out of your opponents. Like Smash, All-Stars offers various modes with a predominant focus on multiplayer madness, and does a decent job of highlighting its roster's own respective characters and the worlds they inhabit. Although it's unlikely to become as iconic of a series as Smash, at least as it is now, it introduces some compelling gameplay mechanics and hearty fun to the table that certainly earns it a worthwhile spot in most gamers' catalogues.The key trait that differentiates All-Stars from Smash is that instead of trying to knock your opponent off the screen, your key focus will be building enough meter to initiate super attacks that kill your foes. This meter, or AP, as it is called, is progressively earned throughout each match as you successfully land basic attacks; you can earn more AP by landing long strings of attacks and combos, and will then spend the AP on Super Moves, the only way you can actually defeat opponents. Like Marvel VS. Capcom, there are different levels of Super Moves, with each being more powerful than the last; Level 1 Super Moves are generally quick and must be properly timed in order to achieve many kills, as where Level 3 (the maximum) Supers are highly destructive ultra-attacks that oftentimes allow you to kill just about everyone on screen (sometimes more than once).You'll be able to choose from a roster of 20 characters (not including the DLC to come), all available from the get-go (there are no hidden characters). These include most of PlayStation's most well-known faces, whether it be Ratchet and Clank, Kratos from God of War, Sly Cooper, Nathan Drake of Uncharted, or LittleBigPlanet's adorable mascot Sackboy. There's also some third party love in the form of Devil May Cry's Dante (in his more recent DMC form), Metal Gear Solid's Raiden and even BioShock's Big Daddy. Some may bemoan the absence of Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the dragon, but I'm willing to bet there were simply some licensing issues given that neither of these characters are technically owned by Sony. Overall there's a nice amount of diversity, particularly given that aside from the good and evil forms of Cole McGrath, no two characters play alike. One element the game fails to achieve is aesthetic cohesiveness; as where Smash's design makes it believable that Mario and Samus Aran could inhabit the same universe, there's something very scattered about All-Stars' visual style. There are jarring differences in the way characters like the comical Fat Princess are textured and animated as opposed to the sketchy Toro or highly realistic Nariko. Although they are obviously each from vastly different franchises sporting different designs, it would have been nice if more were done to help everything \"belong,\" since it ends up looking like each of these characters were simply cherry-picked from their respective games and slopped together onscreen (to clarify, I'm not saying Nariko should be cartoonish like Toro, I'm just saying it would be nice if there were any actual cohesiveness to the designs). Although disproportionately overpowered characters exist in most fighting games, All-Stars is actually mostly pretty balanced, as it's quite possible to win or lose with just about any given character. The brashly glaring exception is Kratos, whose soul-crushing Level 3 Super, ridiculously rapid AP gain and obnoxiously auto-aiming grappling attacks are all in desperate need of nerfing. Although he's certainly not impossible to defeat, expect to see him repeatedly-and frustratingly-in online runs.This thankfully doesn't much affect the actual gameplay, which in and of itself is a blast, particularly the multiplayer. All the expected play modes are here: you can start a versus match with friends you're physically with or hop online for some multiplayer madness with players across the nation (I'm unsure how far the servers span exactly or if it's actually worldwide, because I've played hundreds of online matches and have yet to see any noticeably foreign users), or go it alone against CPUs by practicing new moves in Training Mode or running through a single-player campaign. As with most fighting games nowadays, the single-player mode here is pretty basic and lacks imagination. You'll play through a series of random battles against CPU opponents leading up to a brief cutscene which differs depending on the character you're playing (the only actual instance of character-specific individuality) in which they face off against a predetermined opponent, presumably pegged as that character's \"anti.\" Although hosting a battle between Jak & Daxter and Ratchet & Clank makes sense, you'll probably have a harder time deciphering what Sackboy and Big Daddy have against each other. Following this is a boss fight (which is identical regardless of your character), which-without \"spoiling\" anything-I'll say is blatantly \"inspired\" by Super Smash Bros.' Master Hand.The motivation to play through the single-player campaign is a bit sparse, given there are no hidden characters or major unlockables. However, the more you use a specific character, whether it be in multiplayer, online or otherwise, you will progressively increase their rank. As a character's rank increases, you'll earn access to various unlockable goodies for him or her. This includes new costumes and skins, different opening/winning animations, new taunts, user icons themed after their respective games, and more. This is a great feature and offers something of a reward for repeat use of specific characters; it's nice to be able to strut your fanboy pride in online matches through these various aesthetic perks, and also offers appreciable customization options that far too many brawlers lack.The game's online mode is where it really, truly shines and one instance in which Smash should in fact be the one taking notes. You can instantly hop on the PlayStation Network to duke it out against random opponents in either competitive ranked matches or pressure-free quick matches, both of which can be adjusted with customizable settings or rules. Whether you want to fight three random opponents in a free-for-all, go up against a group of friends in different states, or team up with a friend and battle two opponents together, there are easy options to instantly do so. These matches are almost entirely seamless and lag-free, and it's incredibly simple to invite friends, join groups or drop out when you're done. This is where the replay factor lies and what is done here is done extremely well. The only issue is a recent one-the game underwent a recent patch in which some initial issues were resolved and a character was nerfed; following this update, the game now suffers sporadic glitches, some of which are more severe than others. On occasion, Super Moves may randomly fail, you may be routinely disconnected from friends you're trying to play with, and at its worst characters will suddenly glitch and appear at random different spots onscreen. The issue isn't consistent enough to ruin the experience, but I'm sincerely hoping another patch to repair this shoddy one is well on its way.Among the game's most notable setbacks are the deeply bizarre stage designs. Although each one clearly meant well, featuring inventive blends of not one but two separate Sony franchises (\"Invasion,\" for example, borrows aesthetics of both Ape Escape and Killzone), most of them are poorly designed and don't bode well for hosting actual combat. For one, most of the stages are flat out too large and sport about three to four too many stage hazards, some of which are difficult to predict. With scattered clusters of moving platforms and environments that change too many times throughout a match, keeping the focus on the fighting becomes increasingly difficult as you become more concerned about fleeing from hazards (some of which render you immobile for several seconds or drain devastating amounts of hard-earned AP), which can too often make for cheap, random disadvantages. The game's fidgety camera does nothing to help-unlike Smash, the camera isn't predominantly fixed, and instead zooms in and out repeatedly depending on where everyone is. In the chaos of so many hazards and doodads in an enormous environment with multiple opponents, it's not hard to routinely lose track of yourself, particularly if you're playing a small (or, in the case of Sly Cooper, invisible) character. The sheer size of these stages also give projectile-wielding characters disproportionate advantages, or at least far too many opportunities to stand in a corner and troll. Although there are options to turn the hazards off, I'm unsure if this is an option in all modes, and even without the hazards it's difficult to land kills when your opponent is yards away or tucked between hordes of moving platforms or random giant structures. This opinion may not be shared by all players necessarily, but I'm not one for so heavily shifting the focus from the actual fighting and allowing too many opportunities to flee or troll.As nasty as some of these problems sound, none of it can put the sheer fun to a halt. Like the best fighting games, PlayStation All-Stars is all-around addictive, and it's easy to spend hours upon hours duking it out with buddies (or whoever else, of course). The tactical aspect of building your own AP with expertly executed combos while keeping track of your opponent's (and when they're likely to use their Supers) amps the excitement every match, and gives some nice depth to what may have ordinarily been a rehash-y concept. Although it's certainly possible for newbies to pick-up-and-play, All-Stars is a game you must spend time with before truly understanding, but thanks to its diverse cast of characters and array of quirky features and visuals, it will be time well spent. It might not be Smash-and it doesn't have to be-but it certainly gives Smash fans something great to enjoy during the wait. Whether you're a longtime Sony fan or just getting into the action, PlayStation All-Stars is a celebration of some great franchises that offers some truly riveting brawling.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2013"}

The story kept me engrossed and new moves and weapons kept the gameplay fresh.  The sequel is just as great and continues the story, ending with an obvious question mark.  Having them both together on PS3 is definitely a nice luxury, as you have the PS trophies feature with both and the graphics are improved quite a bit.  However, cut scenes are in pretty horrible resolution as well as audio.  Sometimes it's hard to understand what's being said in the cut scenes because the quality is so terrible.But overall, a great double pack.  If you've never played God of War, get this.  Chances are you'll like the first one then want to move on to the next.

So when God of War 2 came out that same year, I said to myself that I'd wait until I played God of War 1, before I started 2. So I bought the  PS2 versions to play at the same time that I purchased my backward compatible 60GB PS3. But the first game I ever tried wasResident Evil 4. ThenResistance: Fall Of Man. Then...well I won't go on, but to make a long story short by the time I was ready to play God of War my 60GB PS3 had died and my new one isn't backward compatible. So what a great thing to see that the God of War Collection was being released for the PS3 in advance ofGod of War 3.After playing so many 'next gen' games released for the PS3 (if you care to see my list go to the link in the first comment on this review), when I put God of War into my PS3 I was expecting to see a game that was not up to the standards of most of the games that I've played to date. I mean, it was made in 2005 for the PS2....How could it live up to today's standards? Well anyone who's played God of War knows the answer to that, and I'm here to say that anyone who has a PS3 and has never played the God of War Collection NEEDS to buy this package.I'm not a big fan of timed button presses and button mashing; I mostly just like shooting, but man am I having fun with God of War 1. I think that my gaming horizons have officially been broadened. God of War 1 is one well put together game. Remember the movieClash of the Titans(with its remake scheduled for 2010)? God of War is that but you're IN the movie. You are Kratos, a former captain in the Spartan army who sets out to kill the God of War Ares. And there will be blood!The story is well told and flows like a well written book (or movie!). There are tons of cool mythological monsters and you get a fair selection of weapons to kill them with. The repetitiveness of battling some of the same monsters throughout the game is limited by some of the ways that you can execute...well...executions. The kills often look a little different depending on which weapon or brutal attacks you make. Ah, yes, nothing like ripping the privates off of an anatomically correct ogre!The graphics are fabulous and have been \"cleaned up\" and presented in 720p for the Collection. There's no Dolby or DTS surround sound for GoW 1, but that doesn't take away as much as I thought that it might, and anyone that doesn't have a 5.1 or better sound system won't notice a thing.And hey!...now there are trophies for the games with the Collection. There's a trophy in the GoW Collection for finishing GoW I in less than 5 hours. I just hit the 5 hour mark and I still have half the game left to complete. If you can finish either of these games in under 5 hours you truly are a God. No, there are hours of entertainment in these games. I'd estimate 20 hours between both games combined for the average gamer. Gamers that have been through the games and know where to go and how to solve some of the puzzles/tasks might have a chance at that 5 hour trophy.With God of War III on the radar for early 2010, God of War vets and recruits should grab this collection. Two classic games, one great price. By the Gods, add it to your cart!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0002SQ0BS","reviewerName":"obryanstars","summary":"A Preview of a great game coming...","reviewText":"Here is a large preview of an amazing game. Getting better everyday, Chaos Theory is shaping up to be the best game of the series yet, and that's saying something (considering the other 2 were jaw dropping).  Here's a preview of Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, for the Microsoft XBOX...1)Tidbits~*The release of this game has been pushed back to March.  But the more time they spend on it, the better it will be...*2 types of multiplayer have been announced.  The first is co-op, where 2 people control 2 spies, going through several missions BUILT exclusively for co-op.  There is also the option to do co-op with a friend over XBOX Live...The other type of multiplayer (and the best hopefully) will be the returning Mercenary vs Spy over XBOX Live.  It will, again, be just 2v2.  But the ranking system will be revamped, all kinds of new maps will be added.  New gadgets, new game modes, etc...  All of you who LOVED Pandora Tommorow's multiplayer will be delighted to hear this.  Coming in March, this game is going on LIVE...*There are 2 divisions of Ubisoft.  The Montreal Ubisoft is developing this one, which is good news in my opinion.  There is a Shainghai division of Ubisoft, which made Pandora Tomorrow's single player.  But the Montreal Team created the multiplayer for Pandora Tommorow (I believe), and also made the single player for the original game (the best single player in my opinion).  The Montreal team is making this ENTIRE game, and I think that is better.*Sam will have many more moves in this one.  He has also been equipped with some new weapons, most notably the knife.  Chaos Theory will also have a lot more freedom, as you can (once grabbing someone) choose to slit their throat, knock them out, or a number of other things.  There are multiple ways to complete levels.  Also, in certain situations (for example hanging off of a ledge as a guard passes, u may have the option to climb up as soon as he passes, grab him, and throw him off the ledge.  Yes, Sam has gotten more violent ;) your options will be endless.  If you are in a hurry and come to a door, you have the option to kick it down (and perhaps to smash the door on a guard in the process, as it is possible).  The possibilities are endless...*There will be a sound meter in Chaos Theory, which will allow you to see how much noise your are making.  This goes with your light meter, giving u even more stealth...*The AI has gotten much smarter.  Unlike the previous 2, if they hear a sound and then hide, you don't just \"disappear\" from their minds.  From that moment on, they will check more carefully, perhaps look up, go around corners, etc...  Of course with the new options, this may be your advantage.  As they turn a corner, pop behind them, and...the choice is yours.2) Graphics~ The graphics have been totally redesigned from scratch, and let me tell you, from the videos, it looks absolutely JAW DROPPING.  This is really pushing the XBOX to it's limits.  Sam looks REAL.  The engine is amazing, the shadows, effects of the environment, etc...  Just amazing....3) Story~ Well, so far, the stories have been amazing, so expect another deep story, as is the Tom Clancy tradition.  Get ready, once again, to be sucked into the Splinter Cell universe...  The only information we know, it's 2008..4) Ubisoft has again hired a musician, this time Armon Tobin, to make yet ANOTHER great soundtrack for the Splinter Cell games.  Chaos Theory will, again, have the music to make it a great game.Well, that's a little preview.  This game (as of now) is set to hit shelves in March.  Cross your fingers, this just may be the game of the year (of 2005).Thx!obryanstars*","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2004"}

THIS IS A GREAT GAME!In the tradition of Star Trek (the original TV series), there's a heavy political undertone throughout the story questioning the propaganda machines that create and support WARS.  Just who REALLY are the \"Good Guys\" and who REALLY are the \"Bad Guys\"?  Once you get into HAZE, you just may be surprised!  This plot twist occurs approximately 20% into the game and it's something that's sadly missing from most of the highly predictable video game storylines of today...I found it to be \"refreshing\".  And while some of the cut scenes were little bit long for my taste, they are an excuse for a bathroom break.As for sub-par graphics, I don't get it.  I saw nothing horribly wrong with the graphics of HAZE, unlike Rainbow Six Vegas where the graphics look like they'd be more at home on a green or orange phosphorus CRT terminal.  Some of the environments got a little repetitive on some levels, but when you're going through a hotel floor by floor or a village hut by hut, it's sort of expected.  Controls were right on...You'll be able to target enemies without tweaking a thing.  Weapons selection was very good and you should never run out of ammo anywhere in this game.There are areas I would improve, but they aren't deal-breakers and they're easy enough to overcome.  First, the Marine Buggy and Rebel 4x4 could've been so much better/easier and the AI isn't very I at times.  To DRIVE one of these vehicles, you must stand in front of it and press \"square\".  If you don't know this, then you can spend a few minutes trying to figure out HOW to get the thing moving.  For a \"shooter game player\", the obvious first choice is to man the gun while someone else drives.  Well, get on the vehicle at the fixed gun position and you'll be waiting A LONG, LONG TIME for someone to hop in and drive.  This makes no sense to me.Another thing about the vehicles is they are awkward to drive.  This isn't particularly unusual in a video game, but don't be surprised when your vehicle lands somewhere or some way weird, especially when boosting through a jump area.  You also have a limited firing range and scope when operating one of the manned guns while the vehicle is stationary...In other words, you walk to the front of the vehicle, press \"square\" to enter and drive it into enemy fire, then press \"square\" again to exit the driver's seat, then walk to the rear of the vehicle and press \"square\" again to take over the mounted gun and fire for a few seconds until the enemies move out of your firing range, then rinse and repeat.  Obviously this is poor design and not fun at all...It could've been MUCH BETTER.Now for a couple of areas where the game SHINES.  The Nectar Grenades are PURE GENIUS!  In fact, they became my weapon of choice.  Lob one into a group of enemies and they freak out and start blasting away at each other until only one remains...Then he frequently raises his hands to the sky, utters a gutteral and triumphant \"HA! HA! HA!\", then he EXPLODES in a most satisfying way...I LOVE IT!The final assault on the Land Carrier is also VISUALLY STUNNING!  Just the concept of a Land-Based Carrier traversing the landscape and mowing down trees and anything else in its path is another stroke of genius.  The way it actually comes to fruition in the high-speed pursuit portion and then post-boarding of the carrier is just amazing...The game is not very long timewise, but it is long on FUN FACTOR...And that's what a video game should supply plenty of and often.  DON'T BELIEVE the horrible reviews of HAZE because they simply aren't justified.  While it's not perfect, I would rate it a solid 4.5/5.0 or 9.0/10.0, particularly for FUN.  In fact, I'll probably play through the campaign again, which is something I rarely do after beating a game.  I'm also ready to put my money where my review is if there's ever a HAZE 2!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2009"}

Now all they do is collect dust, since I popped for the 32 GB.Data transfer is slow (slower than PSP memory stick duos and pretty much every memory device I've ever owned).It is not quick or easy to manage the contents, back things up or restore them.  Even on the smallest of the cards.  Since you lose your home screen app configuration, every time to change cards, then it makes exchanging cards to play different games a nuisance.There isn't a larger case to help keep the tiny from getting lost, hold other cards or even a thumb drive, to expedite data transfer (though I suspect this would require some kind of software and go against Sony's anti-piracy interests).The only pro I give these things:  They're sturdier and harder to break than a micro SDHC card.If you have lots of time to manage the content of your one card and only use it in conjunction with some cartridge games, then 4 GB are fine.  If you're a playstation plus subscriber, want 2 or more digital copies of games, other forms of media on your Vita, then you're going to want a bigger card.I had managed to squeeze one cartidge save, two smaller digital vita games, a PS1 classic and 2 apps onto one 4 GB card.  There's quite a few games that would be all she wrote.I prefer to spend more time gaming and less time managing memory and the larger card has the better $/GB cost, even if it is proprietary highway robbery.  I am entitled to think and share both before and after ownership, as a customer that they are not a good value, compared to other faster, cheaper, stable memory for other devices on the market.  Before, I gave it 3 stars for doing the bare minimum, but my neutrality on a meh product wasn't appreciated. Ok, I fess up - I don't like these.  The 4 GB least of all.  If you like whoever you got the vita for and want them to get the most out of it, then suck it up and get them the 32 GB and be done with it.It discourages people from supporting Vita.  It discourages owners from buying more Vita games.  This in turn means fewer sales and fewer games for Vita owners.  I am a quality, over quantity person and I know quality costs more money, but it is a catch 22.  The fewer Vita owners and fewer of games bought by those owners, the fewer developers will invest in big quality Vita exclusives (which I want).  I'm also far more inclined to just use the 16 & 32 GB memory I already own to play on PSP and watch video on my phone at the current price points.  This is why price is not irrelevant like the minority of consumers for who belittle others for commenting on price, in addition to other failings in their reviews.  I realize the other side of that is this proprietary format is pro publisher, not just pro Sony.  So publishers, this stupid card thing is about piracy, so I'm given the publishers the evil eye for not putting forth more games for Vita.  I paid up for the overpriced cards.

Replaying the original over the years does not change my views on this spectacular game, but instead enhances it.  Other than Metal Gear Solid 2, Devil May Cry is the best game ever created for the PS2.  The main reason for this, as I said before, is the main character Dante.  The son of Sparda and self employed demon slayer is the epitomy of cool.  You see this guy coming at you, you turn the other way, it's really as simple as that.

Your character is fighting through enemies and surmounting obstacles to save his entrapped sister.Be warned when you start playing that you need to overcome a hurdle for the first hour or two. You could easily be turned off from playing by the atrocious cut scenes, wooden voice acting, and incredibly bizarre character animations. Cloaks float around as if they are snakes, even with the character standing still. NPC arm movements while they talk are laugh out loud funny. The women, of course, wear the skimpiest outfits one could imagine. And for much of the time the sky is so blindingly white that it glows.But hang in there. Accept that the dialogue often feels like it was cut-and-paste either from Star Wars, from Lord of the Rings, or both at the same time. Pretend that the hand movements during the cut scenes are some sort of a comedy skit. Look at those as minor side traits of the core adventuring game.Over time you come to immerse yourself in the main gameplay. You ignore the radiation-white sky and enjoy the detail in the various world you visit. Someone put effort into designing the locations in a way that feels organic. Ignore the Keanu Reeves Matrix no-emotion delivery of the lines and instead watch some of the action sequences involving sword swings. I've studied medieval swordfighting for several years and some of these sequences are quite sweet. Of course others are a bit silly, but you can't have everything.The game has some features which other games could really learn from. You can set up three equipment sets and toggle between them with one button click. So you can set up your \"fighter outfit\" and your \"archer outfit\" and pop between them depending on the enemies before you.If you're the patient type who likes to really immerse himself in a game world, there are intriguing books to read that provide background on the characters and storylines.So if you're expecting perfection, this definitely isn't the game to play. Clearly the developers had a number of flaws that they should have fixed before they released this. A NPC will say \"take this bow\" while holding out an empty hand. Bodies will clip into walls.

This is still an incredible game no matter how old it gets. You play as Mario or if you're the second player, you play as his brother Luigi. Together... or one at a time... you take on 8 worlds or areas or lands and each land / area / world has a specific theme like ice, desert, giant, pipe or water and each has several levels. The map of each land will lead you to levels where the real game is. Each level is a sidescrolling platformer where A button is the jump, holding B will make you run, left, right and down will make you move or duck. You will soon jump on enemies to defeat them and get powerups. First the super mushroom that makes you bigger and take a second hit, then you will get the racoon leaf or fire flower. The leaf will let you bat a tail with the B button and allow you to fly if you have enough of a runway. The fireflower belts out bouncing fireballs with the press of the B button. There are other special suits and powerups like the Takooni suit, Frog suit and Hammer brother suit all with special abilities.The levels feel brief when compared to later Mario games, but they're still very fun. The land map will lead you to levels, fortresses, toad houses, special mini games to get more lives and the airship where the boss of each land is hiding. Also in the map you can use items you've collected along the way to make walking into a level easier.When its all said and done, this game has memorable levels, enemies and bosses. Fun powerups, simple yet challenging gameplay. Good graphics for the time and a diverse set of foes. Everything is smooth, there are secrets and elements of exploration that put the cherry on the sundae that is Super Mario 3. Everyone and their kids should still play this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SX00Y","description":"","reviewerName":"evani1997","summary":"Quite Fun!","reviewText":"LittleBigPlanet Karting is a spin-off of the popular LittleBigPlanet games. As the name implies, the game is a departure from the series' typical 2D gameplay. Instead, it is a 3D go-kart racing game. Though it's not as fun or as well polished as the other LittleBigPlanet games, LittleBigPlanet Karting is an entertaining game that allows you to use your imagination in many ways.The game's basic formula is the same as the other LBP games: Play, Create, Share. You can play the story mode (or other people's levels via the community), or create your own race tracks or battle courses and share them online.The story mode, like the first LBP game, is really more of an example of what you can do with the level builder rather than an attempt to come up with a really interesting plot. A gang of evildoers called the Hoard are terrorizing LittleBigPlanet, and it's up to your character, Sackboy (or Sackgirl) to stop them. The Hoard seems to always be riding karts, so catching up to them on foot is impossible. Realizing this, Sackboy takes a kart from a Hoard member (who just happens to fall into a flame pit) and drives off to stop the Hoard. There are a few appearances from the (literally) cardboard characters of LittleBigPlanet, but unfortunately, none of the more entertaining characters from LittleBigPlanet 2 return.  Though technically it's not bad, the story mode feels like a step backwards from the second game.LittleBigPlanet Karting's gameplay has often been compared to ModNation Racers. That would make sense considering it was developed by the same company, United Front Games. Though I have not played ModNation Racers, I've done enough research on it to say that they definitely have their similarities. Since I haven't played it though, I can't say for sure how similar they handle.The basic gameplay plays a lot like Mario Kart. You're put on a track with about seven other kart racers and try to cross the finish line three times first. Some levels are not races, but battles. In these levels, you're put in a small space with other racers and try to hit each other as many times as possible to earn points. The racer with the most points wins. Like the other LBP games, you're able to collect score bubbles and prize bubbles, which unlock content that you can use in create mode. Hitting the R2 and L2 buttons on the ground allows you to slap your opponents in the direction of the button you pressed. This really doesn't give you any real advantage, but gives you a good laugh. You can also spin left and right in midair using the R2 and L2 buttons. If you run over creatinators (gun-like helmets that work like item boxes), you get a weapon that can either hit enemies or give you a boost. What I especially like about the gameplay is that it gives you an option to choose whether you want the X button to drive or the R2 button to drive.The gameplay is fun, but isn't as polished as I would have liked. Though it is for the most part well constructed, there are two things I would have liked to have been improved.  First, respawning takes too long. Most of the weapons you use destroy the driver you hit, as opposed to items in games like Mario Kart where they just have you spin around for a second. If you get hit, respawning takes so long that you're pretty much guaranteed to lose your place. Fortunately, if you have a weapon in your possession, you can hit the square button at the right time to stop the incoming weapon from hitting you.Second, the ability to spin and do tricks in midair is nice, but can lead to serious frustrations. When you land from a trick, you drive in whatever direction you land in. Though it's realistic, it can be very annoying if you land improperly. It would have been much better if it was programmed to automatically have you drive straight when you land, regardless of what direction you're facing. As far as the actual racing part of the game goes, it is fun, but there are better karting games out there.Of course, the basic gameplay isn't why most people buy LittleBigPlanet games. If that were all there were to it, the franchise wouldn't be as well recognized as it is today. The LBP games main attraction has always been the ability to make characters and levels, and LittleBigPlanet Karting is no exception.The character creator is very similar as it is in the other LBP games. You unlock many costume pieces in the story mode such as hats, shirts, and pants, allowing you to make hundreds of combinations of outfits. Unfortunately, the customization is a bit more limited that before. In the other games, you could put stickers on costume pieces if you wanted to change the color. In Karting, you can still put on stickers, but they will likely touch the whole Sackboy, as opposed to the particular costume piece. Because of this, I haven't been able to remake very many of the costumes I made in the previous games.In Karting, you can customize your kart. Like the character customization, you unlock different kart pieces in the story and are able to make several combinations. You can select the body, wheels, chair, steering wheel, and type (such as hovercraft or tank). As with the costumes, sticker placement isn't as good as it should be. Fortunately, almost all of the downloadable content (DLC) from the previous games can be re-downloaded into Karting, allowing you to play as your favorite DLC characters again. Also, Karting has been getting its own DLC which allow you to buy new karts for the game.In regards to customization, Karting's main attraction is the level creator. It works very similar to the other LBP games, but with some differences. The most noticeable difference is that it is in 3D, as opposed to the other games where it was 2D. Some of the controls are different, which takes some time getting used to, and the entire concept has a pretty difficult learning curve. Fortunately, the tutorials it comes with are very helpful, and before you know it, you'll have a fully functional track (or battlefield) to enjoy by yourself or with friends.The multiplayer is pretty good, but has some rather odd flaws. (As I have not tried the online multiplayer, I will only talk about the local.) The first being that if you have more than two friends playing with you, the races you do will not include the other CPUs. Playing two-player is fine, but it still kind of takes the fun out of racing with more than one of my siblings, since we're the only ones on the track. The second is that unlike LBP 1 and 2, other players can't sign in with their PSN account. That means that if they have their own custom karts or characters, then they would have to remake them on the profile they're on.I've had some rather unpleasant experiences in regards to its stability. While building levels, sometimes the game would freeze and I'd have to rebuild everything I hadn't saved. One time I voice acted in a level and a glitch took away the recording. I was never able to make the character I was voicing have sound again. However, these complaints might have been fixed in a patch they uploaded before, because I haven't had these kinds of experiences at all recently. On the plus side, the loading times on the community aren't nearly as long as they were in the other two games.The game's graphics find a near-perfect balance between realistic and cartoony. A lot of detail can be seen within the objects, characters, and scenery; but not so much that it takes away the colorful, cartoony look of the LittleBigPlanet series. Of course, I can't tell if the graphics really got better, or if it seems that way because the closer camera allows more details to be seen.The music is sort of a mixed bag. On one hand, you get most of the songs from LittleBigPlanet 2 and some new catchy ones to use in your levels. On the other hand, a good portion of the new songs are quite annoying and will (to your displeasure) get stuck in your head. I'd say that overall, the soundtrack is better than LBP 1, but worse than LBP 2. Though there is virtually no voice acting aside from some grunts and noises, it should be noted that Stephen Fry returns from the other LBP games to voice the narrator and is once again hilarious to listen to.LittleBigPlanet Karting is a fun racer that gives you multiple ways to create levels, characters, and karts. Though I have my problems regarding the stability, I still recommend this to fans of games like Mario Kart. If you already own the game ModNation Racers, I'm not sure if you should get this one. As far as I can tell, they're very similar games. For those LittleBigPlanet fans and racing fans who don't have ModNation, Karting is a game you should seriously consider playing.Final Score: 8.4/10For more reviews on games such as this one, visit [...]","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2014"}

The effect is like being able to play around inside a Romero horror film, to a certain degree. Graphically, this is an arcade-looking game, but it's focus is more on its difficulty than story, character, graphics, guns, modes or anything else.I am disappointed in the music, the title screen techno is pretty nice, but mostly the music is either unimpressive, repetitive techno or something like Danny Elfman run through a computer. When you're shooting up zombies and aliens, subtlety is not needed. Ideally, the music should have gotten your blood pumping.What I really enjoyed was the level designs, some are far better/worse than others. You can go to Notre Dame and 1930's Chicago (a Perfect Dark reference?) right next to each other. However, I never knew *WHY* I was doing whatever I was doing, or why and how I'm able to move through time or change genders, as it was more left to the imagination, because there's no intro cinema scene. So obviously the characters and story meant nothing to me, I didn't have a reason to want to get further in the game beyond seeing new level graphics. The levels themselves are nice, but seem more like a wide hamster tunnel than detailed, realistic, full areas. There are plenty of areas that lead to nowhere and wasted space. There's just not enough to do in a level like the Dam to want to go back to play it again and again (like Goldeneye 007), moving through the endless repetitive layers of stairs simply on a higher difficulty level w/ more objectives doesn't thrill me.I liked the more bizarre characters but most are military, old-fashioned or zombies - they're all in a tacky cartoon-ish style, baggy pants, gargantuan breasts, PVC suits and so on in lame PS2-quality models. If you like Aliens, Plasma weapons, black leather, guns that take up 25% of your screen, techno music, futurist settings and so on, this should be a hit. I alternated between accepting the game on it's goofy terms and wishing it were either more serious, goofy or just plain better executed. It's fun while it lasts, but the biggest kicks I got was from the absurdity, references to Perfect Dark/007 (when it's hardly anything like either of those games, you won't play it nearly as much - more like Quake), and graphics for levels. I do actually enjoy this somewhat, but if this is the Best FPS of *2002*, Vgame genres could use a cerebral revolutionary bath.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2003"}

In order to do so, the game was designed with certain compromises.  The issue is that, while there is some overlap, these two types of games are fundamentally different.  They attract different sets of players, generally, although, again, there is some overlap.  More fundamentally, both Elder Scrolls fans and MMO fans have pre-existing expectations for what an \"Elder Scrolls game\" should be like (for the first group of players) or what an \"MMO\" should be like (for the second group of players), and when the finished game doesn't contain X or Y features that either group \"expects in an Elder Scrolls game\" or \"expects in an MMO\", disappointment results - and this among BOTH sets of players.A few examples of this may be illustrative of the issue, and the conflicts that the game design creates in terms of these expectations.Elder Scrolls games are known for being immersive, open environment games where the player builds a heroic character in an unforgettable context.  They are very focused on free exploration, and encourage the player to wander around, discover things, and essentially do what the player wishes to do.  Stories and quests are present, but can be played or ignored as the player wishes without adversely impacting the game experience.  The essence of these games has been the sense of freedom, immersion, openness and exploration that they afford - as compared even to other single player role playing games.In designing ESO, attempts were made to give a sense of immersion.  One is the user interface, which is minimalist in Elder Scrolls games, and has remained so in ESO (to the immense consternation of many MMO fans - more on that below).  Attempts were also made to give a sense of exploration.  There are rewards for a player fully exploring any one of the game's zones - hidden treasure chests and skill-generating skyshards, lorebooks, and hidden quest areas.  Readable books are scattered throughout the game, as in the single player games, which provide stories and lore contexts.  However, most of this is less than satisfying for the typical TES fan.  The exploration feels weak for many of these fans, because it is constrained by level-based zones (unlike the more recent titles in the series) and MMO design mechanics such as invisible walls or terrain effects that act as such.  The sense of freedom is attenuated by the presence of levels, and quests matching levels that are done in a sequential order, more or less, following a path through the game ordained by the developer rather than the player - as is the case in most MMOs.  The sense of immersion feels broken because of the throngs of players everywhere, the constant chattering taking place and so on.  So, many of the TES fan element who are in the game are disappointed with many of the compromises made to render an Elder Scrolls game in an MMO setting, because these seem to go too far in breaking the immersive, open, explorative character of the single player games of the series.But, by contrast, for many of the MMO fans who are in the game, many of the things that give some or many of the TES fans pause are considered by the MMO fans as not going nearly far enough.  How is this so?  Consider the following:The immersive UI --- MMO fans, by and large, do not place a very high value on immersion.  The reason is that MMO games are generally not very immersive regardless of their design, due to the presence of huge amounts of players with non-immersive names, acting in non-immersive ways, and saying non-immersive things.  Immersion is more of a backdrop for many MMO fans - a backdrop against which the non-immersive interplay between the human players of the game forms the core of the massively multiplayer experience.  For many of these players, the immersive/minimalist UI is highly irritating, because while MMO fans don't place a high value on immersion, they place a high value on real time information, and want the UI to provide relevant information on a timely basis.  Information like location (i.e., a mini-map), information on buffs and debuffs impacting the player or their foes, information on damage given and received, information on the range of effects and abilities, information on the identity of other players (i.e., nameplates) and so on.  Some of these are available, now, as player-created interface add-ons, but many MMO fans expect much of this in the \"stock\" UI of any serious MMO, and the notion that they have been excluded for immersion purposes is precisely the kind of thing that seems \"off\" from a design perspective for the MMO fan type of player.The account vs. character concept --- ESO is designed in such a way as to tie together all of the characters created on one player's account in ways that are not common in other MMOs.  For example, the bank space - all of it - is shared in totality between all of the characters on a player's account - there is no \"personal\" bank space for any one character.  (This may sound harmless, but it is not - more on that below.)  Similarly, while a player can join up to 5 guilds (the reason explained below), these guilds are joined by every character on the account, and this cannot be changed - essentially the player joins the guilds and not a character.  What this essentially means is that \"alt\" or alternate characters are not really very separate from the rest of a player's characters.  If a player wants a \"downtime alt\" that is guildless, or an alt focused on PvP or PvE and in different guilds, or what have you, all of these characters will be in the same guilds, making this kind of play impossible.  This obviously is fine from a single player perspective, but in the MMO perspective, tying these together is not common, is unexpected by many MMO fan type players, and leads to other issues which I will describe next.The trading system --- MMO fans are accustomed to robust trading systems in their games.  Pretty much every significant MMO released since 2004 has had a clearinghouse type system (either using an auction or a simpler listing system) which allowed players to trade with other players.  Of course, this isn't a feature of single player games, and so the single player TES fan element isn't nearly as concerned about this as the MMO fan element is.  In ESO, trading is limited to trading guilds.  Each player can join up to 5 guilds, and these guilds can have up to 500 members.  This means that the total theoretical market, other than spamming general chat for customers, is 2500 players.  Players, mind you, and not characters, because the guild membership is tied to the players account - all characters belong to the same guilds.  Coming from a single player perspective, this is understandable, because trading is not really an element in a single player game, and the player simply pursues all of the things they want to do independently - including pursuing all crafts and so on, as is the case in the single player TES games.  In an MMO context, however, MMO fans expect to be able to trade easily with the vast world of players in the game - and not be limited to a maximum theoretical of 2500 plus chat spam.  It seems very likely that this design was also driven by the megaserver backbone of the game, which would create a massive market which could have implications on the overall supply of everything in the game, but needless to say this design decision is problematic at best to many of the MMO fans who are involved with the game currently.Bank/Storage system.  Similarly, the bank system in the game is also limited, and based on the player's account (i.e., completely shared by all characters).  This design, which appears intended to limit both the ability of players to craft all crafts at the same time comfortably as well as to place a soft supply cap on materials in the game world, annoys both sets of players for different reasons.  The TES fans, who are used to inventory limits from the single player games in the series, nevertheless are also used to homes and, barring that, modifications which can be used to greatly expand storage capacities fairly quickly in the games.  This cannot be done in ESO, for balance reasons, and this is leading to a great outcry, because many of the TES fans want to do all of the crafts themselves, as they would in a single-player game, and the system seems designed to frustrate that.  On the other hand, the MMO fans are used to limits on what they can do at once on any one character, as well as bank size limits, but are also used to being able to do another set of crafts on an alt character with the same freedom/limits as for the first - this is not the case in ESO, because the entire bank is shared.  So adding alt characters who are also doing crafts simply decreases the overall amount of bank space available - this is because the cap on storage is an account-based cap, not a character-based cap.  This design frustrates many of the MMO fans, because it removes many of the reasons they might want to play an alt character, or even several characters at once, making this much harder to achieve than is customary in MMOs, precisely because the cap is enforced at the account level, rather than the character level.Conclusion --- In all, ESO is a series of compromises that appeal to one or the other type of player more, in some cases coupled together with a few different ways of doing things that appeal to neither type of player very much.  It needs to be said that it was an extremely difficult assignment to take a game world that is associated with quintessentially solo, even lonely, gameplay in an extremely open, immersive world and translate that effectively into a game genre that is characterized by massively multiplayer gameplay and mechanics to ensure balance.  This is very hard to do.  I am not sure it could have been done any better by anyone else.  But, having said that, as we know, in all translations - even the very best - something is lost, both for the original speaker and the eventual hearer.  This is also the case with ESO.  The game plays kind of like an Elder Scrolls game, but not really.  The game is obviously an MMO, but misses elements of MMO design, in many cases in an effort to avoid making it even less like an Elder Scrolls game than it is.  In short, the compromises made in the design of this game undermine its ability to appeal fully to either the TES fan or the MMO fan and increase the likelihood that it will disappoint both types of gamer, albeit for different reasons in each case.  Again, I'm not sure that the game could have been produced any differently than it has been.  However, it does strike me that perhaps trying to render a quintessentially solo/lone, immersive, explorative type of game in a massively multiplayer setting is an extremely difficult thing to do very well, and that this difficulty underlies the issues of ESO at this time.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2014"}

{"product_name":"B000MIXFWA","description":"Sony 98044 Playstation3 Component Av Cable","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"Excellent Quality Cable for your PS2 / PS3 needs...","reviewText":"I use HDMI for my PS3, but due to a lack of S-Video and RCA hookups on my 1080p HDTV, my craving for some of my old PS2 titles was left unfulfilled until I picked up this cable  I do not own a PS2 backwards compatible PS3 ).  The provided component AV cable is an official component cable designed for use on the PS3 and PS2 systems.  The cable has R/L stereo audio and supports Y, Cb/Pb, Cr/Pr.CABLE QUALITYThe included cable is surprisingly good quality.  The main cable itself is heavy duty with plenty of length to it (10 feet).  The connector heads are very high quality, and durable.  The entire cable itself has some good weight to it.  The only real negative I could see about the quality of the cable, is that after the 10ft of heavy duty, thick cable it splits off with the 5 connector heads; each connector using a thinner wire.  Still, in the cable's defense, the thickness and quality of the connector wires are vastly superior to the official PS2 S-video cable Sony was selling back in the day.IMAGE QUALITYPS2 - It has been a while since I used my PS2 via S-Video, but the component cable did seem to have sharpened the color quality of the games nicely.  These cables won't make the games look HD by any means, so don't be shocked when you still see jaggies... but what you will get is much crisper and higher quality image reproduction.  It does help very subtly.  I would say this is a must have if you plan to use your PS2 for PSX or PS2 games.PS3 - There is a big downgrade in Image Quality using these over HDMI, but that is to be expected.  HDMI makes a huge difference for 720p/1080p titles when compared to the 480i/p titles of the PS2.  I would only use these for a PS3 if you do not have HDMI on your TV.  The good thing is; component does a good job at handling the current gen PS3 titles, far better than S-Video and RGB do in my opinion.SET-UP (PS2)Not hard at all really.  If your PS2 is currently using S-Video or RGB, turn the system on and change the display settings to Y Cb/Pb Cr/Pr and save it.  Switch the console off, swap wires and you are good to go.  If your PS2 is set to RGB you will only get an audio output to the TV. The system will not display an Image!  If for some reason you are unable to hook your system up via RGB/S-video here are the steps to follow to enable the proper video settingTURN SYSTEM ON >  DOWN > X (confirm) > DOWN x3 (each down will make a sound) > X (confirm) > LEFT > X(confirm  this should enable component mode  I am using a version 3 PS2 but the system config should be the same as with the new slim models)SET-UP (PS3)If your PS3 is brand new out of the box, nothing to worry about as the system will auto-configure on first boot. However if you have been playing via HDMI or another video option, and switching to the component gives you a black screen; there is an easy fix.  Put your PS3 in standby mode (red light is on  Press and hold the power button for 5-6 seconds (you will hear a BEEP, then a BEEP BEEP); this resets your video options and the system will auto detect your component output.OVERALLI am very impressed with these cables.  The overall quality is very high, and having Official Sony support for both the PS2 and PS3 is a nice plus.  Even though I only got these for my PS2, if I still had a SDTV this would be the perfect 2-in-1 cable.  A worthwhile investment for someone looking to give their PS2 graphics a little extra boost of color, and a great alternative to the standard RGB(composite) cables included with the PS3.  5 stars.NOTE: Many PS2 games do not support \"progressive\" mode.  This means that despite having Component cables, the game will output at 480i.  Games which support progressive mode will output at 480p with component cables. (resident evil 4 I believe supports 480p)NOTE: If you already own PS2 component cables, these will offer virtually no \"visual\" improvement over existing PS2 component cables (just better quality cabling)NOTE: The packaging for this product is incredible overkill.  It is that ultra thick, heat sealed plastic packaging that everyone hates.  So best get your meanest pair of scissors out when this arrives.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"S.

{"product_name":"B0043B5SLI","description":"","reviewerName":"zx2781 \"zx2781\"","summary":"Cheap Charm","reviewText":"I love RPGs. Mainly Bethesda and BioWare offerings but have had some fun with JRPGs also, so when I heard about this title (a week before it came out) it was a no brainer for me.In defense I must say that there is no way this game should get slammed with a one star rating. It did not advertise itself, it did not claim to be anything, it offered itself up at a budget price and it is no where near as bad as some ratings may imply.Completely Fable-esque in its delivery. Simple in story. The RPG elements are all in place. Pick only one guild. The game unfolds differently depending on choices. Slight character customization. Several weapon choices though simplistic combat.Graphically there are some hiccups. But there are also some decent moments where it is worth taking in the scenery. The closest graphical comparison I can give is Fable meets Divinity II Ego Draconis but not as polished as either of those.I had heard the RPG lite term applied to this game and I will agree. Almost feminine in its personality, maybe because your main character is female. The music also adds to the 'lite' atmosphere.It gets 3.5 stars from me but will bump it to 4 considering the game came with no promises and a low price tag.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2011"}
{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"The Best of Us","reviewText":"As I write this review, the ending credits of \"The Last of Us\" are rolling next to me. My whole body feels as if it has been put through an emotional wringer, every single possible reaction that could be provoked from me has been expelled from my mind. Joy, anger, fear, sadness... the gamut of them have all been experienced in the past 24 hours. In my 12+ years of gaming, there have been few games that made me feel as deeply gratified as Naughty Dog's new magnum opus, and even fewer that have done it this well, if any. From jarring opening to ambivalent finale, this is one of the most jaw-dropping experiences in years, and in fact, it may change the way I review games for good.For the sake of not ruining the narrative, the set-up and basic gist will have to suffice. Players take the roles of Joel and Ellie, an odd couple who are forced to travel across the US under a particularly bad pretense. Joel is a grizzled middle-aged man who lost his daughter during the beginning of a parasite outbreak, and Ellie is a 14 year-old girl who has watched everybody she cares about die. Together they must brave the harsh conditions of an Earth ravaged by an apocalypse that has ended ages ago, and people have gotten more and more acclimated to. If they expect to survive and reach their ultimate destination, they'll need to get past hoards of infected humans, the harsh conditions of Mother Nature, and, most terrifyingly, other humans.\"Fallout\", \"Borderlands\" and the dozens of other post-apocalyptic games out there have positively nothing on Naughty Dog's vision. While most (if not all) games dealing with the topic have blatantly aped on aspects of \"The Road Warrior\" for their visions of a ruined Earth, the developer instead goes the \"I Am Legend\" route. Lush flora and fauna have overgrown all of the major cities, and wild animals run amok in some areas, somewhat akin to an vast zoo. Elements of the world we're used to living today are indeed there, but they're buried under a generation's worth of decay. But the world is not all that's decayed. Humanity has collapsed into highly insular sects, the strongest of whom pride themselves on practicing \"survival of the fittest\" by killing off women and children, and raiding other groups. Others try to build self-sustaining farm communities, and still others actively recruit members in an attempt to find a cure. There are no crazy religions, no mutated psychos with odd haircuts... this is the most realistic apocalypse in gaming history, and it's downright frightening.This setting is a backdrop for a jaw-dropping narrative that keeps players guessing until the very end. For the first time in what feels like forever, I was barely able to predict anything that would happen in the plot, and even the most subtle pieces of dialogue and character decisions kept me on my toes throughout my 12-hour journey. Joel and Ellie's relationship is believable and enjoyable to watch unfold, as is their sense of trust and growing weariness to outsiders. Not only that, but Ellie herself is a truly remarkable character. She is treated as a serious player as opposed to a little girl whom you're forced to constantly save; in a year already filled with remarkable female protagonists in games like \"Tomb Raider\", \"Bioshock Infinite\", and \"Remember Me\", Ellie joins their ranks as a brave young woman desperately trying to make the most of the chaos the world has fallen into. The conviction with every word she speaks, and the earnestness of her attempts to match (and even outdo) Joel, make her somebody players will undoubtedly get attached to. In fact, I'm already missing her company now that the game is over and done with.Her trek with Joel is captured perfectly with gameplay that crosses enough genres to make my head spin. Sure, there are third-person shooter elements, and very fine-tuned ones at that; pulling off headshots and cornering enemies with your firearm of choice are visceral and satisfying experiences. But more impressive to me is the amount of times you will forced to think outside of the box. Ammo is scarce, and so planning out your route of attack (or escape) ahead of time becomes absolutely crucial. Sometimes, you'll need to stealthily dispatch a group of bandits in order to raid their base for supplies. In another scenario, you'll find yourself needing to throw debris in order to lure infected people away so you can escape under a blanket of shadows. It's unlikely that any player is going to experience this game in the same way, to the point where it might be worth it to play through the game's \"New Game +\" mode in order just to see how differently things turn out. The variety of approaches to any given area, and how buttery-smooth the controls are that allow you to execute your actions, makes for the most variety I've seen in a console title since \"Metal Gear Solid 4.\"Encounters are made terse and terrifying by some of the most alarmingly intelligent AI in gaming today. Enemies will not blindly rush you, or simply sit and allow you to blast their brains out. Humans and infected alike will flank you, sandwich you, and do any other maneuver possible to put an end to your life. Finding the right balance of distraction and offense is tough at first, but once you learn how to gauge the severity of a given situation, your experience will take a turn for the immensely rewarding. Getting a hang of the mechanics is part of the game, and doing so is one of the most gratifying experiences of my entire life.There's a nice upgrade and crafting system at play here as well, which has a strategy in and of itself. By picking up certain items, you'll be able to craft healing and offensive tech. But a lot of times, you'll have to make some tough decisions. For example, the recipe for a Molotov Cocktail is the same as the recipe for a MedKit. At first, you might initially go for the health, but if you run into a hoard of infected who are attracted to sound, you're going to wish you had that Molotov to smash and lure them into a fire. Deciding what to craft, and when to craft it, is a remarkable experience, as is collecting scrap metal to upgrade your arsenal. Special props are due to this intuitive and strategic system of upgrading items and weapons.As mentioned above, this is a stunning vision of post-apocalypse America, and it's beautiful to look at due to the graphical prowess only the folks at Naughty Dog can cook up. Wild grasses spring up from cracked pavement, and colorful trees grow inside ruined contemporary buildings. The characters are also beautiful to behold, what with their uncannily human movement and facial gestures, coupled with the lag-free fluidity of their natural motion as they run, jump, hide and other movements that typically look very pre-programmed in modern games. For the first time since, well, since the last Naughty Dog game, it looked like I was controlling a human life, and not a video game character. While there are some occasional pop-ins and unfinished textures, that's proven to be standard with any game these days, so it can't really be held in contempt for that in my book, especially considering that this game is pushing the limits of the PS3's soon-to-be outdated tech.No flaws are present in the audio side of the game, though. The soundtrack is rarely ever pumping or exhilarating, instead opting for a more down-to-earth tone comprised of dry guitar licks and acoustic noodling. This unconventional score helps set the mood for the game, and in fact makes the already nerve-wracking firefights and chases more terrifying. Nothing is more shocking than discovering that an enemy has snuck up behind you without a musical indication, forcing players to pay close attention the slightest noise at all times, lest they want to pay with their lives. Realistic soundscapes and sparse music make this experience more gritty and memorable than most games that tackle this type of subject matter.The real winning aspect of the soundtrack is, without a doubt, the fantastic vocal talent at work. Troy Baker (\"Bioshock Infinite\"'s Booker) excels at playing Joel, whose gruff Texan voice hints at a hidden darkness, and a past he'd rather leave bleeding than discuss it. His hurt and internal struggle feels painfully real, and it almost hurts just to watch him struggle with it. Equally as great is Ashley Johnson (\"Ben 10\"'s Gwen Tennyson... no, really) playing Ellie, whose innocence and curiosity is offset by her determined attitude and surprisingly foul mouth. The years of running and losing loved ones has taken a toll on her, losing sight of what it means to be a \"normal\" child, and it's tough to watch as she forces herself into maturing way before her time. These two anchor a great supporting cast, all of prove integral to building the somber, stark atmosphere of the game.Words that would be appropriate to describe this work of art fail me. And make no mistake: Naughty Dog's final PS3 outing IS a work of art, on par with films such as \"Citizen Kane\", and novels such as \"No Country For Old Men.\" If the Coen Brothers made a game about post-apocalyptic America, this would almost certainly be it, as it displays a very similar pacing and tone to their more somber works. So it is deeply ironic, then, that they have been outdone at their craft, as have a great deal of contemporary directors who haven't come close to reaching raw emotional intensity displayed in this moving, cinematic journey.\"The Last of Us\" cannot be described, only experienced. It is a fitting swan song for this generation of gaming, as it may in fact be the finest work to come out of it. Naughty Dog has proven themselves masters of their craft, true auteurs of interactive entertainment, and worthy of being handed the keys to the next generation consoles in order to expand their repertoire in new and exciting ways.And they've done so by making what is possibly the greatest single player campaign I have ever had the delight of playing, and a shoe-in for Game of the Year.Plot: 10Gameplay: 10Graphics: 9.75Sound: 10Overall: 10NOTE: A word of warning to buyers; there are some odd launch glitches going with the game, including one that prevented me from getting a trophy for clearing the game. While it didn't impact my enjoyment, it's definitely a complete bummer, and something Sony should have tested before launch. Oh, well...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2013"}

An unbiased look at MW3.","reviewText":"The last COD game I Bought was CoD 4. I bought it for the single player, and yes I loved it. It was fast frentic and fun. I  didn't have Xbox live, nor do I have it now. MW2 came out, yet again I buy it for the Campaign and the newly added spec ops mode. I had a great time with both modes, they were challenging on harder levels and provided hours of great entertainment by myself playing for a solo experience. I know its fun for people to hate on these games, but I have no reason to because I have never played the multiplayer, so I am not going to bash this game for something that everyone else does it for.I was going to pass on MW3 until i saw the added spec ops survival mode that I could play offline Solo. This was very pleasing to me, especially in an age where everything seems to be online oriented. I, like many other gamers, enjoy a fun experience and a break from reality when I play games. If a game can deliver said experience, then I will come away from it satisfied. Sure over time games come and go, some get traded in and some I keep forever because they are special to me.For what it is to me, MW3 is a fun arcadey twitch shooter with an intense campaign and some great replay value to be had challenging myself in the spec ops game modes. That alone is worth the money and time from me. I know most of you reading this have already made up your minds about this game before playing it, but thats perfectly fine. You are entitled to your opinion and so am I. If you are one of the rare few who buy this game for the campaign and some offline spec ops fun, then I am sure you will have some great fun like I have been doing.At the end of the day, its not graphics or even a solid story that keeps me playing games, its the pure fun I have with them.

I'm not a big fan of the Wii in general, it can be fun but it is not for serious gamers, but I think the Wii Fit Board is a different thing altogether. The software is weak in organizing and tracking workouts but sadly this is the best option for fitness gaming you can find. This \"game\" has plenty of challenging and fun exercises. Oddly enough the best aerobic workout included in the game,running, does not use the Wii Fit board. You put the controller in your pocket and it acts a pedometer as you follow a running partner around an island. Running in place may seem boring, but this game makes it fun and interesting.The balance and other aerobic games are where the fun is at. Doing the hula hoops or blocking soccer balls is a blast. The skiing challenges are frustrating and non-intuitive but given time I may grow to like those games as well. Bottom line there is bound to be some part of this game that you like and if it gets you off the couch or adds some variety to your workout schedule than it is worth the cost.I hope the success of this catches on and a slew of fitness games come out for this system. Better yet, I hope the Xbox 360 will come out with even better games. The Wii is too much of a kid's toy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2009"}

I'm not going to gush about it, the high points are: very durable, high quality make, very roomy.So thats the good news.  Revel in it a moment longer because now I go to the bad news.My main comparison in this review will be the PDP mini backpack for the DS, DSi, and 3DS, which I also own since I have a DSi.  The PDP product (located here:DS Mini Backpack - Light Blueis cheaper, more functional, and is ugly.  But it trumps the mini elite case as far as I'm concerned.Now, I don't want to seem cranky, but I know my way around cases having owned a few.  I've uploaded three pictures to support this review, you'll have to check them out above.The cons are:1) The Mini Elite case is a bit too bulky for my tastes. Its not very \"mini\" at all.  The extra space holds accessories, like earphones, stylus, and even small power cables.  Its true, I like to keep a power cable around, so its not all bad.  There is also an overload of padding which makes it bulkier too.2) options for securing this item are severely lacking.  The PDP case I have has a carabiner, and a strap with a buckle.  This allows me to attach it to the inside of a larger backpack and not worry about the case slipping out unexpectedly.  I've even attached the PDP case to the outside of my backpack too.  In comparison, this case has a little handle that seems like an afterthought, its very insubstantial compared to the rest of the bag.  I guess I can buy a separate carabiner and attach it.  Weak.3) The game cards tend to fall out of the top row, which is made of elastic.  In fact, if you drop the case a few times, the cards just fall out.  I think the elastic squeezes them out.  I've uploaded a picture.4) You can't tell what games are which when they are in the elastic.5) You can't charge your 3DS while it is in the case.  This is because there is only one zipper, and because you are supposed to slide the 3DS into a sleeve.  WIth the PDP case there are two zipper pulls on each zipper, allowing you to zip up the case on both sides of the wire.  I OFTEN charge my handhelds while they are in their protective case, so this is a big negative for me.  I've uploaded a picture.6) I felt the case was too overprotective.  You have to do 3 steps to get the DS out. I'm not sure the velcro flap (in my picture) is useful at all.  I understand that the flap adds some padding in case of a fall.I guess the point is, that this case is best for people who are terrified of their 3DS breaking due to a fall. I've owned a lot of cases and a lot of handhelds and this one is by far the best protected, but I think its more than is needed.As an aside... You get a two year warranty... but you have to register on the manufacturer's website to get the warranty.  To me what this means is that I have to trade my personal information \"today\" for a warranty that I might use \"tomorrow\".  And that \"tomorrow\" might never come.  That's weak sauce for a product that only costs $17 (at this time).  You can't just send their case to them in 6 months and say \"hey, I want a new one...\" as you can with some manufacturers.  So I feel that the warranty is just an \"info grab\" opportunity for them, and a way for them to offer a big warranty claim that most will not take advantage of.Overall I think PowerA did a fair job, the construction and materials are high quality, but the design is simply not clever.  Add some way to attach this bag to a larger one, double zipper pulls on each zipper, and rework the interior a bit and I can give it 5 stars.  The construction is all aces... but the design is not...As a result, 3 stars.  3 stars = \"its ok\" according to Amazon, and I think its OK.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2011"}

Beginning during the end of the second World War and eventually progressing into the early to mid-50's, Vito Scaletta's journey from an honorable young man and soldier to an all-out gangster is beautifully written and realized. The story gets very rough and violent, and there's strong profanity throughout (as it ought to be in any good gangster story). There's an unmatched sense of reality in starting up a car engine before you can drive away (or breaking into it before you can even do that), the tires will lose traction on slicks of ice, regular people inhabit the world and interact with you in completely plausible scenarios, the physics are wonderful and the graphics are great. In the beginning you'll hear some tamer 40's doo-wop on the radio, interspersed with \"buy war bonds\" and \"support the troops\"-commercials, really taking you back to what it might have been like living in a somewhat small American town during the hardships of that era. Later that'll give way to the rocking 50's, and it's like a brand new world and game; new clothing styles, people speak differently, constant sunshine, new car models, and rock and roll classics everywhere. The soundtrack of this game is absolutely fantastic, any and all classic 40's or 50's tunes you can imagine are at your disposal, spread over a few differently themed radio channels. Everything from \"Mr. Sandman\" to \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love?\" is there to keep you cemented in the world. But the beautiful city is a little bit underutilized, and the campaign could've easily been at least 5 to 10 hours longer. Picking up all the collectibles and achievements didn't take that much longer either (a few extra hours and you can snag them all), but there are two mini-campaigns available for download. Of course you'll have to pay good money for those too, which is a bit of a gamble as it doesn't involve our main character. Mafia 2 mostly involves driving (which isn't as bad as it sounds in such a convincing environment) and shooting, but it's like a really great gangster movie that's over too soon. Some sort of bonus mode or multiplayer option would've helped, or at least more incentive to come back to the game for a second or third playthrough. Maybe nostalgia will do it, but I'd think twice before paying full price for this game when something likeRed Dead Redemptionis almost literally an endless game that never grows tiresome.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2011"}

Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A great Paper Mario game out there on its own","reviewText":"I have always been a fan of the \"Paper Mario\" franchise. They all feature a very unique direction for a beloved character, consistently delivering the same miraculous top-tier quality as the rest of Mario's mainstay adventures. In some ways, Super Paper Mario continues in the unique vein of the first two Paper Mario titles (and even ,Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Starson the SNES, which was a clear inspiration for the whole Paper Mario series in general) while injecting some radical new directions of its own, branching off quite a bit in the process.First of all, this is the least RPG game in the whole Paper Mario series. The one thing you must know going into Super Paper Mario is that this is a platformer, first and foremost. Gone are the dynamic, theater turn-based battles ofPaper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, and in are the jump-on-an-enemy-and-watch-him-go-poof of the classic Super Mario Bros. games. Heck, gone are most RPG elements period! The only RPG anything in this game are items, and the fact that after a certain amount of \"XP\" points, your characters level up and gain more health, more damage in attacks, etc. That's it. No, this is more like a classic Mario side-scrolling platformer with the Paper motif and a light dash of RPG concepts. It is mainly 2-D except for one genius addition to the game's formula, and a definite game changer, in that Mario can manipulate the reality around him and go from 2-D perspective into 3-D. What is an impenetrable wall in 2-D becomes a mere pole in 3-D that you can easily side-step. The puzzlelike quality of getting from point A to point B using the 3-D mechanic is brilliant, and the puzzles were quite excellent throughout the entire game. I was impressed. If you don't find joy in it, you have no soul. Really, the only downside to this 3-D \"mode\" that I can think of is that the graphics become downright sparse and ugly in 3-D. In 2-D, however, the graphics are exceptionally stylish and eye catching. The artistic direction in this game is phenomenal. World 3 is done entirely using 8-bit sprites as a throwback to the classic NES system. Places like this are so fun to adventure through.This time around, you get to play as Mario, obviously, but Bowser, Peach, and Luigi also become members of your party that you can switch to on the fly. Each of these characters also comes with their own unique ability you will need to progress through the game. Unfortunately, only Mario can switch to 3-D, and because that is such an essential ability to make it through most areas, you end up using Mario exclusively for most of the time, lest you want to keep switching and therefore chop up the pacing. It's too bad, because the other characters are a blast to play as, but it becomes impractical to constantly keep switching to Mario to get past one part and then switch back. For one who always wanted to play as Bowser as a main character, that is my only complaint  in terms of character set-up (Then again, there's always the excellentMario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story). You also get little fairy creatures that follow you called Pixls who basically give you additional powers that Mario & Co. will need to advance through some puzzles. These range from a bomb to blow away certain blocks, to a cowboy Pixl called \"Slim\" who makes Mario paper thin to squeeze through super skinny pathways in the walls (Seriously, how genius is that?). The Pixls are a nice added wrinkle to the already engaging puzzles. Despite being a good ol' side-scrolling platformer at heart, this game has a very surprising amount of depth in its gameplay.Like the other entries in the Paper series, and unlike any other Mario game outside of that, Super Paper Mario actually attempts to spin a yarn in its narrative. Is it a groundbreaking, incredible story worth buying the game alone for? No, but it is pretty cute, quite heartwarming in places even, and it achieves the goal it is supposed to. I enjoyed it a lot, personally. One aspect that you will either love or hate with the story is that it makes the game extremely wordy. I cannot stress that enough. You will read a novel's worth, and then some, in dialogue from this game. That didn't bother me (as you can see by my review, I too am wordy), and I rather enjoyed the dialogue myself. In fact, the characters and their words can be incredibly hilarious in a tongue-in-cheek way. Heck, one of the main bad guys is modeled after the boss Lumbergh fromOffice Space. Another boss is the hilarious embodiment of all things forum-dwelling, nature photographing, sci-fi watching, video gaming, comic collecting, jaded complaining nerd. Awesome. Even my wife, who initially felt that this was a bit too much of a \"kiddy\" game from the graphics and music, thought the characters were very cute and eventually changed her mind about SPM because of its undeniable charm. Nintendo's localization teams are known as some of the best, and Super Paper Mario is a great testament to that.It's not all perfect though. I really enjoyed Super Paper Mario on its own merit, but in the context of the other Paper Mario games, I have to say I much preferPaper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, as well as the originalPaper Mario, over this title. I miss the dynamic turn-based battles and the audience that got involved in them. I miss the decidedly much more epic storyline and dynamic characters in 1,000 year door. I miss the unique characters like Admiral Bobbery the Bob-omb, Yoshi, and Koops that join you on your quest. I miss the unique RPG system. Heck, I miss the MARIO elements in SPM. For some odd reason, the character design and even some of the \"dimensions\" you visit made me feel like this didn't really belong in Mario \"canon\" as most characters are not in any way related to Mario games. 1,000 door was full of classic Mario elements like koopas, bob-ombs, goombas, heck, even the piantas fromSuper Mario Sunshineare there. In contrast, Super Paper Mario has almost no recognizable Mario elements, and as a result, felt weirdly foreign to me. Sadly, any recognizable characters like Bowser's Koopa army, Goombas, etc, make only the briefest of appearances! I know Mario & the gang are supposed to be in other dimensions, but still... it felt strange. Almost through the whole game, the only characters I was completely comfortable with were Mario, Peach, Luigi, and Bowser. That's it. Mostly gone are the classic characters and baddies, replaced instead by bizarre, abstract enemies that look like weird squiggly lines and oversimplified polygonal shapes. Weird. Part of the Paper Mario series' strength was how well it channeled nostalgia and charmingly rendered familiar things from Mario's universe in that awesome Children's pop-up book motif. When so many of those things are gone, it's sort of off-putting at times. To put it simply, Super Paper Mario suffers a bit from \"Doki Doki Mario\" syndrome (aka the US version of \"Super Mario Bros. 2.\" The *real* No. 2 game, known here now as \"Super Mario Bros: The Lost Levels,\" was deemed too difficult for the US, so Nintendo of America took a totally unrelated Japanese game called \"Doki Doki Panic\" (also made by Mario mastermind Shigeru Miyamoto, so it's not totally unrelated to Mario, sort of) and substituted Mario and the gang for playable characters and voila! \"Doki Doki Mario\" was born. Bizarre, I know).I would summarize Super Paper Mario like this: An excellent game, but very strange compared to all other Mario games. It feels like an awesome black sheep, a totally different take that feels excitedly adventurous and a wee too liberal at the same time. Don't get me wrong, I love SPM. I may have preferred Thousand-Year Door or the original as Paper Mario games, BUT Super Paper Mario makes so many radical steps conceptually that it's hardly fair to consider it in context of the others, as I have pointed out. In its own genre-busting world, it is amazing. Where else does a star-man turn Mario into a hulking 8-bit NES version of himself to stomp and destroy everything in his path? Where else do you get an item that calls a miniature army of NES versions of the character you're playing as to mimic your every move and go kamikaze? Moments like this are too cool. This game oozes its own quirky charm, and it is all the better for it. Would I recommend it? Absolutely! However, I would give you the advice of playing this with the attitude of it being a stand-alone adventure, because taking it in with the other Paper Mario games in mind might skew your expectations of what is to come. Remember that. Really, its only downside is that its \"Paper Mario\" title is misleading. Still, Super Paper Mario is one of thee definitive Wii games and a must-have for your library, just appreciate it for what it truly is! Now that it is at such a reasonable price, this is an even sweeter deal. Buy it, cuddle it, and enjoy its undeniable, enchanting charm.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0023CBY4E","reviewerName":"justice4all72","summary":"Dog Days","reviewText":"Despite the negative reviews, I decided to purchase this game and try it out. As a fan of the flawed Kane and Lynch: Dead Men, I was curious as to why the sequel even came out. The first game was filled with bugs and generally people hated it. However I saw through all of that and enjoyed the crazy story. Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days is a unique game. The graphics are really cool with the appearance of the game being filmed with a handheld camera. Makes you feel like your there with the crazed duo. The story again is totally wacky to say the least and might be the most grittiest game I have ever played. It plays like a film (one that hollywood should look into making) and the controls a solid. The only problem is that the game is a little on the short side. The developers chose to end the game with a cliffhanger, a move that I felt they did to make the series into a trilogy. Which leads to the games biggest flaw, its length. K&L; 2 is slightly shorter than I would have wanted. It did provide great entertainment while it lasted but left me wanting more. I currently am in the process of playing through a second time. The multiplayer however is my personal favorite part of the game.Fragile alliance is simply brilliant. A different type of multiplayer game that video games have not seen in quite some time. I am beginning to get sick of the FPS COD style of multiplayer that every new game seems to copy. It was a great concept in 2007 but now is overdone and only COD can do it right. But K&L; 2 multiplayer is a blast. Working together with a bunch of crooked gangsters meanwhile any of your teammates can go rouge at any moment adds a certain paranoia during gameplay. If that isn't enough, Undercover Cop mode will put players over the edge and not trusting anyone. It is so much fun, while repetitive I enjoy it greatly.I cannot wait to play the next game in the series and I felt that K&L; 2 Dog Days was a step in the right direction. The problems of the first game have been resolved and have made the series stronger. I hope that you give K&L; 2 a chance and decide for yourself how you feel about the game. It is certainly unique and will provide entertainment. Check it out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2010"}

From posters to furniture, you really do get the sense that you are IN the 1960's.On the graphical note, the water, and there is plenty of it, is probably the best looking, flowing and most realistic water to ever grace a video game. I was simply amazed at the water. I hear that the Bioshock developers had a whole team working on the water effects/graphics alone. Well, it has certainly paid off.Bioshock also uses the Unreal 3 engine (think Gears of War), so the graphics are phenomenal and character movements are fluid and realistic.Details are abound. Weapons are detailed down to the most minute detail (ribbed design on the shotgun pump, cracks in the walls/floors). The lighting/shadows are stunning, and the character models are some of the most detailed in the video game world.Bioshock is a First Person Shooter. We all know that the video game shelves of our local stores are chalk full of First Person Shooters (FPS). Stores are literally teeming with them.One of the biggest arguments against the Xbox 360 was the fact that there was a lack of variety in terms of games, with the majority being FPS.I can safely say that Bioshock, though it may be a FPS, is FAR from your typical, standard FPS fare.While you will run into your typical FPS weapons (Shotgun, Handguns, Machine guns, explosives, wrench for a melee weapon and a few more standard weapons), you will also have access to something called Plasmids.Plasmids give you powers (i.e Telekenesis, the ability to shoot flames and electricity out of your hands, and even the ability to shoot wasps from your veins!)These powers really change the FPS dynamic in a very profound way. Will you shock your enemy, then beat the tar out of them while they are stunned?, or will you incinerate them? Or, better yet, will you unleash a horde of wasps at them and watch them freak out? Your Plasmid powers even interact with the environment. You can use the shock ability to jump start faulty door switches, and if you spot an enemy in a pool of water you can shoot them with the electricity and watch them convulse.If you spot an enemy in a pool of oil (yeah you will run into rooms that have oil spills) you can unleash Incinerate and watch them burn and spread the fire around.An enemy throwing explosives at you, or is your way blocked by debris? No problem, with Telekenesis you can grab those pesky explosives in mid air and fling them back at the thrower or at debris blocking your advancement.Also, you will find tonics along the way that will enhance other abilities, such as melee strength, hacking and even a tonic that will emit a shock to any enemy that attacks you with a melee attack, a sort of high voltage retribution.On a side note, there are different types of bullets for each gun ranging from electrified ammo, armor piercing ammo and anti-personnel ammo. And if that's not enough, later on in the game you will be able to create your own ammo!Yes, I did mention hacking earlier. Rapture has its share of vending machines (where you can buy ammo, health kits and plasmid refills), ammo machines, health stations, security bots, gun turrents and security cameras.If you get in close to one of these machines, you will be given the opportunity to hack the machine. In an ingenious design, if you decide to hack a machine you will engage in a small mini game.Does anyone remember an ancient game called Pipe Dream? The hacking mini game requires you to connect the \"entrance\" to the \"exit\" via two different types of pipes. There is a time limit however because fluid flows from the \"entrance\" and you need to get the fluid to the \"exit\". If you fail, the machine will overload and you will take damage, however you can retry as long as you have health left.Later on you will find hacking tools that will give you the option to auto hack, though its not always successful. You can also opt to pay a rather large amount to buy a guaranteed auto hack - but that would be boring!There is quite a bit of collecting involved in Bioshock as well. There are the plasmids, tonics, ammo and even money all scattered about the city of rapture.With all of that in mind, it is easy to see that Bioshock does in fact distinguish itself from all other FPS on the market, fulfilling question 3.Gameplay, well that is another story. 2k games boasts that no two romps through Bioshock will be the same. And I can see why they make this claim. You have options, I mean lots and lots of options on how you want to go about your killing. This basically fulfills the second part of question 4, Bioshock IS a true Next Generation title.With every said so far, it is safe to say that Bioshock is VERY fun to play. First of all, the controls are rather easy and follow the standard FPS controls that Halo popularized.There are three difficulties, allowing you to ease into the game, and easy to use menus and interfaces.The story line is very immerse, original and interesting. I can say that I have NEVER played a game with the same story line.Also, Raptures history is revealed via tape recordings and diaries that you collect along the way, adding even more flavor to an already over flowing flavor pot.Basically Bioshock is equal parts an action game, survival horror game and a stripped down Role Playing Game in the vein of Deus Ex. And its mixed really well. Nothing ever feels over done or boring.Also, following in the vein of \"choose your own adventure\" type games, Bioshock presents you with situations in which you will have to choose, morally, which way to go. This adds even more to an already amazing game. And, unlike other games that offer this, your choices and actions WILL affect the game.Overall, Bioshock lives up to the hype and is a must own for all Xbox 360 owners. I will warn that there is a lot of blood, gore and violence, not to mention a wide array of mature themes involved.If you are into these things, and of age, you MUST pick this game up. Do not pass up on this, even if you are sick of the First Person Shooter genre, I guarantee that Bioshock is a unique and engaging experience that you will not regret paying $60 plus for.Price is one of the biggest factors that can scare away potential consumers, since next generation games cost so much, consumers want to be sure that the game they are spending their hard earned money on is actually worth it. I can honestly say that Bioshock is worth it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2007"}

I am using it on my current, best laptop. I have spent a few hours looking for solutions, as I have had many of the same problems using it from a Windows XP laptop to a new, better Windows 7 laptop. I run it in compatibility mode for XP Service Pack 2 AND as Administrator. I run it in windowed mode, moving it over to my 2nd bigger computer monitor. I have the GOTY edition and I have about 20 mods running on it.This laptop runs 2.4ghz, 8G RAM, AMD Vision. It's been two weeks and no problems running it.However, it has been frustrating for many reasons. Eventually Fallout 3 as considered 'DONE' by Bethesda. The last update 1.7, was a few years ago. From my understanding and research, they haven't had anyone work on it since. I have the non-Steam version (thank goodness). It makes things much easier. I have no clue how to help with other versions. I believe Fallout 3 is one of theBEST games.Important: I would advise to learn all one can about modding. It's easy with Nexus Mod Manager; it installs mods for you, without problem for the most part. Modders have created new quests, towns, and other areas of the game that add to Fallout. After playing through the main quests and even much of the side ones; there is still plenty of new content that makes plenty of good reason to play again. Who says one would have to even follow the main quests. I have a mod that allows you to SKIP the boring, 15 minute intro you're forced to play every time a new character is made.In my opinion, if they took the game and updated with them with current tech and graphics, they could 'add' more to the game.In addition, Fallout New Vegas is equally done and there are mods for that game that add to the playability and enjoyment of the game.UPDATE 6-2-2013I have had this game for a long time. I had it on an HP Entertainment Laptop running Vista. NO problems playing the game.I have the GOTY edition and all DLC's worked fine as well. Sadly, the motherboard got fried and I had to get a new laptop.Wanting to keep up with tech and all, I now have a HP Pavillion dv6 that I've had for almost 3 years.AMD Turion 2 P520 Dual-Core 2.4Ghz8G RAM Max for this model.64 Bit Windows 7I was able to play the game again on this one without problems. However, I found that the game and Windows 7 do not like each other at all.It quite working. Spent hours looking online to fix the issue. Not much luck. Gave up.Started trying again in May 2013.Installed both base game and DLC. Crashed. Won't start.Installed base game. Installed Patch 1.7 from Bethesda website. Crashed. Won't start.Installed base game. Started. Went to Games for Windows Live option. Signed in. Started to update the game, started 1.7 patch AGAIN, had to update that because it wouldn't let me go any further. Stuck on black screen with frozen 'working circle'. Left it alone for hours; just in case. Open task manager: both update and Fallout 3 'Not Responding'. Ended both processes. Tried to start base game again.Crash. Won't start.The only luck I've had to far on a Windows 7 computer that EASILY played the base game only with NO patch. From what I've learned Bethesda will drop any game after their done with it. Maybe get a few more patches or updates. After that they toss it in gaming limbo.They did the same thing for Skyrim. Hearthfire was a scam and only 2 DLC's. They've stated they MIGHT fix future problems.The problem is Bethesda. They are NOT putting in the time and effort into making a quality game. There should have been a patch that made this game easily playable on Windows 7 and 8; including the DLC's.Fallout 3 is a great game. It's open ended so you don't have to follow the quest line. I use MODS for Fallout New Vegas and Skyrim and that makes it almost a new game.Bethesda did a lot right, what they did wrong; they did on a huge scale. Try getting someone on the phone to fix a problem or explain something is almost impossible. Everyone wants to point you to the forums to fix it yourself. Everyone who uses a computer doesn't have the same knowledge of working files and such.FINAL ASSESSMENT:IF you decide to get the game; make sure your computer exceeds the RECOMMENDED requirements. It has to have windows XP or Vista. There are computers for sale, new or used, that have those OS on them.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000MJB0H6","description":"Pokemon Diamondis a traditional Pokemon RPG that takes place in a region called Sinnoh.In the Sinnoh region, there are two Pokemon that symbolize the region. They appear in the Sinnoh reigon's myths and old folklore. One is called Dialga, and is said to have the power to control time. The other is called Palkia, who is said to have the ability to distort space. The sinister organization called Team Galaxy is trying to rule the region by utilizing these two Pokemon's power.

It isn't as strong a return as I was hoping for.Let's start with the Pokemon themselves. Each new generation of Pokemon is less and less likable to me. They just seem to have less personality than the original generation. And there are more legendary Pokemon running around than we know what to do with. Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres, Mewtwo...who were they, again? The status of being a \"legendary Pokemon\" has lost its lustor. What I'm trying to get at is that Dialga and Pakia, like many others in the new generation, are unlikeable and lifeless, whereas the original legendaries (and the original 150, for that matter) were brimming with character and lovability (yes, even Mewtwo).The gameplay has mostly been conserved. There aren't really any innovations that really jump out at you. The Pokemon in battles are still represented with sprites and still growl in 8-bit, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. My problem with the battle sequences is that they seem really slow for some reason, even with text scrolling set on fast and battle scenes set off. It takes forever to execute the attack and show the resulting drain on HP or status effect.The story is also standard Pokemon fare. I was definitely hoping for something new on this front. Ever since the original Red and Blue, the story has consisted of your character battling through the gyms up to the Elite 4, while taking down an iteration of Team Rocket on the way. A different storyline would, I believe, greatly benefit any Pokemon games to come in the future.Overall, is is a decent game that simply pales in comparison to the experiences offered by its predecessors. Players new to Pokemon will probably enjoy the game more than people who have been playing Pokemon since the beginning, simply because they will not have the same hollow feeling that those who grew up playing Pokemon will have. Really, this game just made me want to dust off my Red cartridge and take a heavy dose of nostalgia to cure my disappointment.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2011"}

It is a paradox in that a younger audience would be less likely to get bored of its puzzle simplicity, and yet that very audience may not have patience for the amount of text in the game.The game is mostly fun, although a tiny bit repetitive, and despite the fact that unlocking my favorite character didn't come until almost the very end of the game.I would recommend this to anyone who loves the Mario RPG sense of humor, and especially those who played the old Paper Mario games but wanted something with a little bit better pacing in action.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2007"}

MacMahon","summary":"Everything You Could Hope For in a Sequel to Assassin's Creed","reviewText":"Assassin's Creed was for me a mixture of a perfect game and a lackluster game, offering equal parts of both.  The world, graphics and basic gameplay were all solid and you really felt like you were in the dark ages, during the crusades, adventuring in the middle east.  Unfortunately the game was also repetitive, offered no real mission variety or progression and also lacked some subtle nuances which make games fun to play for longr periods.Assassin's Creed 2 changes ALL of that, thankfully.  The world is just as wonderful to look at and interesting to traverse, but now what you do in the world is also entertaining.  The missions shake things up, there are more of them and the story really carries you through it all.  No more rigid structure, instead there is a greater open world feeling like in a Grand Theft Auto game.  Collecting items for your base and improving it through investment is also rewarding and adds to the gameplay, no more mindless searching for flags in AC2, now you search for improvements to your character and your surroundings.It's hard not to recommend AC2 to a fan of the original, it has everything you liked about that game plus a ton of improvements and additions.  If you disliked the original game entirely, well, the basic fundemental gameplay is identical, so you should probably steer clear.  The important thing to remember is the gameplay is the same, it's what you do with the game that is bigger and better.Note: A lot of the reviews on amazon right now are focused on the DRM (digital rights management) system the game uses, called Uplay.  Uplay basically makes AC2 play like an MMO on PC, but without other players in the game.  A server connection is required and your saves are on a server, so you can log in and play where you left off from any PC.  There are also unlocks and new content delivered through Uplay like an MMO content patch.  A lot of consumers have issues with this because of the constant internet connection requirement, which I understand, but as a person with constant internet I can say the DRM has no real impact on gameplay if you have a similar setup.  The game logs in in less than 5 seconds and during gameplay you never notice it.  I am not rating the DRM, only the game, which is a stellar achievement in game design and a must play for those who can.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2010"}

I put it on my hard drive thinking the game would speed up, but there is sooooo much loading!  I hate to think how long it would take if I didn't put it on my harddrive.  The Tekken force mode was kind of annoying at first, but I've come to enjoy it.  The final boss is ridiculously hard, even though I put it on easy.  The online play is hit or miss.  Sometimes I get great connections, but then others are horrible.  Unlike the first tekken game, if you play the rank mode, you pick you character first then it finds a match for you.  A big welcome in my book.  I always hated when people picked someone just because you picked a certain person.  Overall the game is great.  I just wish they got rid of those stupid juggle moves, and the cheap characters.  But overall the balance is a little better.

Nicholson","summary":"Crysis...a good FPS but distant runner up for Game of the Year","reviewText":"This game is the long awaited follow up to 'Farcry' (one of the best FPSs of 2004). We now finally get a look at this newest offering.Here are some of the things that I've liked in the single player mode...1.)This is a FPS in which your nano armor gives you special 'skills\"; these  'skills' include enhanced speed, strength, armor and invisibility; and you'll need them all to survive.2.)Graphics that are smooth and flowing...plus excellent audio; both add a spooky, creepy ambiance to this jungle based horror game.3.)The ability to use and control vehicles (on land, at sea and in the air), as well as the mounted weapons on these units.4.)Generally good (but not great) enemy AI! Although some will just stand out in the open, there are some that will sneak up on you or hide behind cover; also they must reload empty weapons. Due to their larger numbers and the fact they're usually spread out, will necessitate your using your special 'skills' and the surrounding environment to defeat them. This is the basic, reoccurring challenge for this game.5.)Easy, anytime save/loads with F5/F9 respectively, as well as game generated checkpoint saves.6.)If your taking a beating (or find it too easy), you can change the degree of game difficulty anytime, as you play; you don't have to start a new game. This is a nice feature!Cons:1.)I've had a couple freeze ups, requiring reboot; also some minor video fragmentation (after extended periods of play).2.)I found the controls on flying the VTOL (vertical take-off & landing) craft were difficult to operate (the plane just didn't seem to respond to  commands quickly) with the result of frequent crashes.3.)There was one extended section where you were floating (in either space or water), that I found confusing, tedious and boring. I was lucky it was very linear, or I might never have gotten out of there.4.)A high end system is preferable. Although playable on XP, Vista can use Dx10, and combined with good hardware and a high end video card, it does  make a difference in being able to run a lot of the 'extra' graphic details.Conclusion:All the pre-release hype made it sound as if this game would easily qualify for Game of the Year honors; I don't think so. Graphically it is beautiful and it is a good game, but it's not a great game! If you liked 'Farcry' then you'll probably like 'Crysis'. Was it worth the wait...probably, but somehow I was expecting something more. Over all, I liked 'Farcry' and its gameplay a little more. However, still worth a 4 1/2-5 Star rating.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2007"}

You'll need to be good: the stunts will get harder, and you must accumulate skills to progress from low-budget productions to multimillion-dollar Hollywood blockbusters. Each stunt consists of a series of clearly defined objectives, which can range from 180-degree spins to perfectly timed jumps, dramatic barrel rolls, and T-bone smashes. To succeed, the player must achieve all or some of each scene's set objectives. Stunts take place on movie sets in six different countries around the world; completing each stunt rewards you with bonus items for use in the Stunt Arena, which you create yourself.Stuntmanwas developed with the help of one of the movies' most experienced stuntmen, Vic Armstrong.","reviewerName":"ooocarl06","summary":"patience WILL pay off!","reviewText":"I bought stuntman about a week after its release. I started it up and was immeadiately hooked on the adrenaline pumping scenes. With that said, this game is HARD! I've had it since the release and i am still two levels from completing it because i get so mad at it i can't play it for a month or so! The idea of the game is great, your a hollywood stunt driver, and you work on several fictious films. Although these films are not real, they have very obvious ties to films that are real (such as Indiana Jones and James Bond flicks.) Once you have finished the required stunts, you view a movie trailer, with your stunts spliced in, which is a great idea.As for the controls, they are something to get used to. Your average racing game will have X button to accelerate, Square button to brake and reverse, and the R1 button for handbrake. On stuntman this all the same, but the handbrake is moved to either the O, or Triangle button. Why this is neccasary, i have not the slightest idea, since the R1 button does nothing anyway. i also found it a bit bothersome that you were forced to work with the controls they gave you, there wasn't a certain number of predecided settings, let alone a custom configuration.As for the driving mechanics of the game, they also take some getting used to. Every car will handle a bit differently and since you are in and out of new cars throughout the entire game, it does take awhile to familiarize yourself with the controls. in general the cars glide a bit more often than in most games, which can be both a good and a bad thing. It can be good when trying to make quick U turns, and bad when trying to weave in and out of traffic, and both are equally used throughout the game. This is only a small problem, because after about a 1/2 hour of actually driving, you get the light, or sometimes rough touch that the vehicles require.Another very nice aspect of the game is the stunt builder. Through the stunt builder you can actually set up your own show in a big arena full of fans, complete with roll bars jumps and loops, and then wreak havoc on it, and ultimately destroy your vehicle. Through the career mode, you gain more and more complex toys to insert into your vitual destruction derby, from stacked barrels, to a giant loop.In conclusion, you must understand that this game is EXTREMELY difficult. You will find yourself restarting the scenes of the first movies anywhere from 75, to even 200 times before you have 100% completion. Once you reach the final movie, you may find yourself restarting 100 to 250 times, depending on how good a driver you are. The game wil definately test your patience, but once you finish a movie and see that commercial, there really is no better feeling because you know that you finally did it!P.S.Many people complain about the long load time everytime you have to restart a scene. To remedy this problem, simply open the disc tray once you power on PS2, and switch your system's speed, load times will be much faster!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2004"}

Siddiqui","summary":"Ten years later and still strong","reviewText":"It's been ten years since the Keyblade warrior Sora first took arms into the battle between light, dark, and nothingness. When Kingdom Hearts was first released in 2002 on the Playstation 2 players were able to travel through iconic Disney worlds and encounter the popular characters from not only Disney franchises but Final Fantasy series as well. Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance marks the return of Sora and Riku as they attempt to become Keyblade masters. Although the story is difficult to follow and some plot points remain unanswered Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance is an excellent action-adventure title that utilizes the comedic dialogue, fast pace action, and memorable characters that has made this series so popular.Kingdom Hearts 3D takes place after the events of Kingdom Hearts: Recoded and follows the franchises most significant characters, Sora and his best friend Riku, as they attempt to pass the Mark of Mastery exam. You will take control of both characters and switch between the two in time intervals called drops. Both Sora and Riku must save parallel versions of seven different worlds in only to become true Keyblade Masters in order to defeat Xehanort. Kingdom Hearts 3D remains loyal to the concepts that made this franchise great such as notorious Disney worlds to explore, appearances by Final Fantasy characters, and a strong focus on light and darkness. If you played other games on the franchise you'll be able to put up the story quickly, however if you are new then you will have to read a lot of text and probably look up information pertaining to the various flashbacks. However as a person who has played Kingdom Hearts I still found the story difficult to follow due to pacing issues that was probably used to catapult the story forward into Kingdom Hearts 3.Unfortunately the exam doesn't go as plan and another villain seeks to control the light in Kingdom Hearts. Throughout your journey you'll experience flashbacks, visions of the future, and memorable characters. Each stage you venture into has been tailored from Disney films, such as classic movies like Fantasia and modern ones like Tron: Legacy. Within each stage you will solve problems from the movie's plot while getting one step closer to your own goal. As wonderfully animated as these stages are they offer limited exploration and most of the time you will follow a linear path. Don't expect a lot of side quests, but a card game can be played at certain places. Experiencing each nostalgic event is complemented with fantastic music that suits the environment and the battles that ensue.Each world is populated with a diverse amount of enemies known as dream eaters. These creatures appear randomly throughout each environment and have unique abilities. Although you only control Riku or Sora you can tame dream eaters to fight alongside you by collecting fragments hidden in treasure chest, loot from fallen enemies, or purchasing them from shops. You can create these creatures by either using recipes or just randomly putting things together.  To upgrade these creatures you earn points in battle and each dream eater comes with its own special attack that adds novelty to collecting them. Another option allows the player to personally manage your creature by providing actions of affection by using the touch pad causing different rewards and a lovely animation as they leap with joy.Although your dream eaters are valuable companions Sora and Riku will do most of the fighting. Returning is the command deck system from Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep. Players will be able to collect and equip abilities and magical talents for quick access. Sora and Riku will have access to offensive magical attacks, healing spells, special attacks, and other appealing abilities that are gained through battle. After using these specific powers a cool down period is initiated, forcing players to rely on careful planning before battles instead of spamming the same move.A new ability known as flow motion allows Sora and Riku to quickly navigate the environment. To activate this luminous ability you simply interact with the environment or enemies, allowing with quick movements such as grinding on rails, hopping on walls, swinging on poles, and spinning enemies around. Not only is these great for evading enemy attacks but within this state a specific set of attacks become available, even better is that these attacks or flow motion itself doesn't have a cool down period. Players will easily get addicted to pulling off the visually and destructive appeal of these abilities. However at time these mechanics is unresponsive on certain objects.Another new system known as the drop system forces you to switch between Sora and Riku. After a certain amount of time as passed players will be forced into the drop system to play as Sora or Riku and continue their overlapping story. This system can get vexing as players are forced to stop one objective for another, but you can extend the period before another drop by using Drop-Me-Not. Some may find these vexing but it forces players to play both stories without ignoring one over another.While you will be fighting and talking for most of your venture, minigames are introduced to break up the pace. Visiting a new world for the first time you are put into a dive that allows you to collect stars and defeat enemies similar to an on-rail shooter. Fans of Tron will enjoy the light cycle battles, hacking computers with the touch pad, and unscramble words. The 3D itself may not be the best on the system but it does allow for excellent depth-of-field within battles, minigames, and cutscenes.Kingdom Hearts 3D is a wonderful addition to the franchise. Despite its problems the combat, characters, and music remain the same stellar quality that is expected. It's unfortunate that the story doesn't share the same quality as the characters themselves, but humor and charm overshadow these difficulties for the most part. Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance is a befitting return of Sora and Riku.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2013"}

The detachable numeric pad is a nice feature and allows for righties or lefties to utilize it as they see fit.  The keys are quiet and seem like they will be durable.  I haven't tried any of the macro programming yet, but it seems like a great feature.  The backlight is also a nice feature for those long nights.  It's a pretty good product from Microsoft.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00004SVS6","reviewerName":"jdealy999","summary":"An outstanding Mega Man title.","reviewText":"Although I cannot hope to write as good a review as a certain someone else does (regarding Mega Man games, that is), I will attempt to do just that.I have been a Mega Man lover since the early 90's.  I have enjoyed sequel after sequel that the Capcom designers kept producing.  To some players, though, it might seem that the same tried-and-true formula was starting to wear off.  Now don't get me wrong -- it's STILL a spectacular game from start to finish, but there weren't a lot of new innovations to be had, other than the storyline, cosmetically improved level layouts, or 8 new robots that you have to beat.The premise is this:  8 new robots are destroying the city, and are led by -- PROTOMAN?!  Yep, seems Mega Man's own brother turned against him, but wait -- spoiler alert -- once you beat the 8 robots, you will find out that not everything is at it seems once you face \"Protoman\" -- he's actually a FAKE Protoman, and it was Dr. Wily who was behind the whole plot (what else is new??).My personal favorite stages in particular are Charge Man, Stone Man and Wave Man (the BEST music in the entire game is that particular level).  I don't like the Gyro Man stage -- the level layout is good but the music is sooooo annoying.  Later, once you get to the Dr. Wily levels, it might seem tiring to have to keep defeating his robots, but the awesome music more than makes up for it.  Keeps getting better and better every time I have to defeat Dr. Wily!Having just received the latest issue of Nintendo Power, Mega Man 1 through Mega Man 5 should now be downloadable for the Wii/Nintendo 3DS.  Also, please don't forget about Mega Man 1 through 5 for the Gameboy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2012"}

This is pretty inexpensive, and therefore, it's not too great. But for someone who's just starting with a product like this as opposed to a wired headset, it's not bad.There are some noise issues which tend to be either too quiet or too deafening, but that could also depend upon who you're listening to.PROS:1. It's very inexpensive.2. It's very comfortable.CONS:1. It's VERY inexpensive, so there are going to be sound issues.2. The volume is hard to control.For a starter, this is a good headset. For the more advanced gamer, I would definitely recommend something better.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000KRXAGE","description":"Wii Play collects nine quick and addictive games that are easy to pick up and play and hard to put away. Thanks to the intuitive controls of the Wii Remote, even the most inexperienced gamers will have no trouble mastering the controls.    &lt;p&gt; Wii Play features nine separate mini-games, including the following: &lt;li&gt;Shooting Range, a point-and-fire game of target practice in the Duck Hunt tradition. &lt;li&gt;Billiards, a simplified variation of nine-ball with stunningly realistic physics that uses your Wii Remote as your pool cue. &lt;li&gt;Find Mii, in which you scan the crowds to find the right Mii&#8212;and Miis you and your friends created make an appearance. &lt;li&gt;Tanks!, in which you command a toy tank on a miniature battlefield in a gauntlet of 100 missions. &lt;li&gt;Other games include Pose Mii, Table Tennis, Fishing, Charge!, and Laser Hockey. &lt;p&gt; Every game features a multiplayer mode, so you and your friends can compete for the high score or go head to head to see who&#8217;s the best.  Wii Play comes with a white Wii Remote so that your friends can join in the action. (Nunchuk not included.)","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"It's Basically Another Tech Demo","reviewText":"Wii Sports was a marvelous way to show people what the Wii could do.  Wii Sports is also a fairly addictive game that just about anyone can pick up and play.  Wii Play is somewhat like Wii Sports.  It's basically another game to give you a preview of what the Wii can do.  Unlike Wii Sports, however, the games aren't nearly as good and they aren't as memorable.  Part of what made Wii Sports so great was its simplistic, yet involving, gameplay.  Wii Play doesn't make you feel nearly as involved as Wii Sports does.  To its credit, however, it does come with a Wii Remote packaged inside, but if you really really loved Wii Sports, you're definitely going to be let down Wii Play.There are nine games in Wii Play.  One is very similar to Duck Hunt in that you have to use the Wii Remote as a gun and shoot things.  Fairly simple, but it leaves an empty feeling in you.  Another game involves you having to find certain Mii's (imagine Where's Waldo).  There's Table Tennis, a game where you pop bubbles, billiards, laser hockey, fishing, some game where you ride a cow and Tanks.  With Nine games you're bound to find something good, but Laser Hockey may very well be the best of the lot.None of the games are really that bad, they're just not as involving or as fun as Wii Sports, nor can they hit that level of addiction that Wii Sports gives you.  Which is why I say that if you really do love Wii Sports, then Wii Play is a let down.  You get a Wii Remote packed in with the game, though, so it's almost like buying the game itself for ten dollars.  Sadly, the Wii Remote alone may be the reason to buy this seeing as how as this review is being written, Wii Remotes in your local retail store are still pretty hard to come by.None of the games are horrible, but none of them have any lasting appeal.  You'll grow bored with most of them after a couple of plays.  It's not bad, but we've already been exposed to what the Wii can do, and I don't think most people need a second tutorial.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2007"}

It's not perfect, but when compared to the earlier Treyarch releases it is much better and with luck will keep the series moving in a direction fans love.  I have this game for the PC and the XBox 360 and I've not only enjoyed both, I've been impressed with how well the graphics look on the XBox, given the huge differences in hardware:  gameplay appears to be a stable and smooth 60fps for me.What I love about the single-player campaign is that the story is intricate and contains some surprising twists to it--and what seals the deal is the history behind it.  The story is set during the Vietnam War and also touches on the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Bay of Pigs incident.  There are a couple of things depicted in the game that aren't quite accurate, but it's been enjoyable getting details from Vietnam veterans I know (and from the Internet).  It's still a very plausible campaign and there is enough variety in each level and its goals that you don't feel like you're being handed a map and a paltry excuse to shoot it up from one end to the other.When it comes to multiplayer, I really enjoy the way it feels:  it's not just the fact that the technology is fairly accurate to the times, it's that even without Modern Warfare styled gadgets you can get a lot of tactical fun out of running and gunning across the maps.  We still have airdropped care packages and we still have the occasional ability to light up the map with a radar sweep that tags enemies with red dots.So the only thing really keeping Black Ops from a 5-star rating are some minor cons.  Like with every shooter, you'll have moments where your feet get stuck or you can't move because you can't see the treestump next to your ankle that's blocking you.  I've learned to forgive those moments because they happen in any game.  With Treyarch's \"World at War\" there were times that the enemies seemed to be willing to spawn forever if you didn't move to tag the appropriate hotspot on the map.  This happens a few times in Black Ops and it can lead to some real Groundhog Day style moments.  The other con that I'm hoping goes away is that there will be times a checkpoint triggers at the worst possible moment--and if you die, you respawn into a bad situation that may take you a dozen revives to get past.  I only had this happen a couple of times, but it left me thinking, \"You have GOT to be kidding me!\"  Frustrating, and sometimes it causes you to deliberately have to be foolhardy and rush in on a bad situation knowing you'll take a hit or two.  I'd rather push forward acting as if bullets are a bad thing that I can't just brush off by hiding for 10 seconds.  It can get silly when some of the enemy AI are foolish enough to step out in front of you or stand next to cover, but at higher difficulties this happens less.Overall, if you like the Call of Duty series, this is a great entry into new territory.  It's got an excellent storyline and the multiplayer on the XBox 360 is loads of fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2012"}
