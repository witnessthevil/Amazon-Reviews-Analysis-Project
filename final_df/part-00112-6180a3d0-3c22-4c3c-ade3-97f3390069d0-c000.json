Like Tekken, combat occurs in closed arenas, you have full 3D movement, but mostly along a fixed axis, and there is a focus on combos and juggling using basic and special moves, though thankfully there isn't much of an input barrier between you and the flashier moves, allowing you to focus on when to use them. Like Dragon Age, you have one guy you control, and three that are controlled by the CPU (though I prefer to stay in the protagonist's shoes whenever possible). You can define three strategies for them to use, though it lacks the control of the Gambit-esque system in DA.The story is interesting, and the characters charming, but both are tropish as all hell. It starts off really slowly too, and the combat can initially throw you for a loop if you were expecting a menu based game. Stick with it, and you'll be rewarded with interesting new mechanics as time rolls on, as well as the murderous boss fights. Warning: The boss in &#34;Emhead Hill&#34; is no joke for new players, but I lived through Kingdom Hearts' Re: Chain of Memories' 4th Riku Replica battle.

{"product_name":"B006VB2UNM","description":"","reviewerName":"pastapadre","summary":"Madden achieves success by no longer being afraid of failure","reviewText":"The Madden NFL franchise this generation has ranged from poor to fairly good - and it's clear that the NFL exclusivity license has played a major part in its overall mediocrity. Instead of taking risks and attempting to excel in areas EA Sports has tried to make a product that would appeal to everyone. That meant all areas of the game would be touched upon - resources being spread thin - and meant they'd at best be decent and inoffensive but none would become great. Features directed at the casual crowd and those borrowed from other series were chosen instead of innovation and a desire to produce an authentic core product.With Madden NFL 13 however things have changed. EA made an effort to innovate. They took risks. They targeted their core audience with improvements. That has ultimately resulted in a, still flawed, but enjoyable game that begins to fulfill the potential that consumers have been clammoring for.Where the game really shines is with the new Connected Careers mode which encompasses what used to be Franchise and Superstar modes along with Online Franchise into one. Being a \"Coach\" is akin to what Franchise used to be and \"Player\" to Superstar. A new progression system consisting of XP drives the advancement of players while a news hub brings the events of the league into focus.Taking on the role of \"Coach\" in Madden NFL 13&#8242;s Connected Careers may feel overwhelming or intimidating to some based on how much is at hand (though the weekly task list helps) and the completely new structure that is startlingly different than standard Franchise of the past.The news center is a valuable addition, the progression system is really well handled and adds a new element of strategy, the scouting has become much more useful, and the NFL Draft is a lot of fun. Certain omissions though sting and unfortunately hamper the experience, preseason games are a mess, and the presentation within games throughout the season leaves a lot to be desired. It's still an incredible step forward for Madden and one that displays a huge amount of potential for the future.Several core improvements have been made to gameplay - including the highly anticipated \"Infinity Engine\" physics - which may do enough to change the perception of stagnation built over this generation. Presentation on the other hand still comes up notably short.The obvious thing to go into first is the physics which completely pays off by providing a dynamic and fresh feel to the gameplay.In some sense it feels toned down a bit from the demo - somewhat stiffer - with the experience found in the demo being preferred to an extent. That being said it's really well contained for a first attempt at a dramatic physics engine and ultimately is a hugely beneficial addition to the series.The improvements found in NCAA 13 such as the numerous pass trajectories, QB drop backs, working play action, routes that have been useless in the past no longer being such, and more successful screen plays are all present in Madden 13 and even feel somewhat enhanced just by having the physics alongside them.The running game is especially rewarding with power backs. This is due in part to the physics but also because runs to the outside are often yard-losers. Some combination of the blockers not getting to their assignments to seal the edge and defenders having seemingly accelerated sideline-to-sideline pursuit contributes to the trouble. Tosses and sweeps are rarely effective - but when they do work they are often for big gains - however stretch plays seem to work really well. Offensive line blocking still can use a lot of work but the amount of times they've just inexplicably blown a block or assignment have been reduced compared to the past.Special teams is definitely an area in which improvement has been made. Though it's still the neglected third of football within Madden at least now kick and punt returns are blocked well and there is the potential to break a big play. I returned one kick for a TD during the whole season of play while my punt return average was 9 yards - which was more than double the average I had in Madden 12. The kicking game goes back to the right stick - which I'm not a big fan of - but that has at least caused me to miss a few more field goals than I probably wouldn't have otherwise.Possibly my favorite, which is somewhat of an unheralded addition, to Madden 13 is the \"Ball Hawk\" feature. Essentially holding down Y will get the player in position to attempt an interception and holding down RB will do the same for a deflection. Some may see this as taking out some user-skill, but given how inconsistently the controls would react to those commands in the past, this makes for a really nice enhancement. It's allowed me to play better pass defense and get some user picks that I probably would have flubbed on prior. Playing as a safety in Connected Careers is especially fun because of this feature. In general the battle between defenders and receivers is much better and having the ability to make an intended play on the ball - whether controlling the offensive or defensive player - is a big part of why.The CPU AI is definitely questionable at times. The coach makes predictable and generally conservative decisions. The most glaring one is that the CPU will never go for it on fourth and short in the opponent's territory. They'll either punt or attempt the field goal. Then, when they do punt, they just boot it into the end zone and don't attempt to pooch it or go for the \"coffin corner\". Late second quarter or late game situations have also yielded rough results for the CPU. It's not as bad as found in the demo, but the CPU still needs some work done on play calling and clock management.On default All-Pro the CPU struggles to consistently move the ball. They are generally competent on offense but hardly threatening. The main problem seems to be how often they have negative plays. They take too many sacks - probably to avoid throwing a bunch of interceptions as they're usually coverage sacks - and get stuffed in the backfield on runs frequently. They'll stick with the run even when it hasn't been working. This leaves the CPU in 2nd and long and 3rd and long situations and they just aren't equipped to convert them - nor should they be - but it means one bad play usually stalls their drives. In the Connected Career season my team finished 25th on offense and 1st on defense which will tell you a lot about how effective the CPU is on offense (hardly) and on defense (fairly strong).The CPU also fails to put out the proper personnel on the field both in terms of splitting time and situationally. Taking the Saints as an example, Darren Sproles rushed over 20 times in one game. They had him running the ball at the goal line even rather than putting in Pierre Thomas or Mark Ingram. Thomas did get a few carries during the course of the game but Ingram never saw the field. Ultimately there has to be a better way for both the user and the CPU to bring out situation specific packages and tie players to the their strengths.Games were generally close but more in the sense that I would have to lose a game for the CPU to win it rather than ever flat out getting beat. The CPU will hit the occasional big play but often would stall when in opponent's territory and especially struggle in the red zone or on the goal line. Because of their inability to convert turnovers into points even a poor performance on my part would find me in position to win the game late.Penalties are still relatively rare but when they are called it'll either be holding or false start. There was one time when defensive pass interference was called - ironically it was within five yards of the line of scrimmage and shouldn't have been.The CBS feel to presentation is a welcome one - particularly the music and commentary booth lead-in - and the team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms add serious gravity to the games. The commentary flows significantly better than it has in previous years. At times their statements can be fairly generic, particularly within Connected Careers, but it's easy to see the potential for the commentary going forward. They do occasionally make mistakes in their calls but that can be overlooked rather easily - that they call out every adjustment made quickly becomes irritating however. Still it's a much brighter area than it has been this entire generation and it's just the first year with them on the job.The game intros won't stay interesting for very long, but when understanding they're essentially covering up for some loading time they aren't a bad thing to have. It would have been better if the players used in them were consistently more relevant or changed up and if the poses weren't always the same. The team entrances which debuted in Madden 12 are gone during the regular season but the Nantz and Simms lead-in works well enough - there just isn't that sense of initial excitement that came with the entrances. The halftime show is probably something best skipped through. It doesn't even have actual highlights from the game.Like the NCAA Football series replays are a mishmash of shots that come from cameras that don't exist and are shown in ultra-slow fashion. In this area Madden 13 regressed from Madden 12 which had some really nice, timely, camera cuts and an overall broadcast feel. There was room for a lot of improvement still but instead of building on that they once again changed the vision and that makes it one of the more disappointing aspects of the game.Crowd noise is improved - though ultimately it just seems like the crowd has been made louder and that they stay at too constant of a level. Their reactions are not always on point and they don't ramp up the noise in all situations that are warranted. There have been times where they've seemed quieter on third down or when in the red zone. The crowd also doesn't react to the results of challenged plays.One area that is severely lacking and oftentimes frustrating is the challenges. The NFL instituted a new rule this year in which every turnover - just like every touchdown - will be automatically reviewed. This doesn't happen in Madden 13 and in many cases on turnovers there isn't even the option presented to manually challenge them.Graphically the game still excels, with player models looking better than ever, but the lighting can be problematic. During day games dark jerseys can look black depending on the direction of the sun and shadows and in some cases the two team's uniforms can be difficult to distinguish under those conditions. Most of the coaches look so exaggerated in stature that it's questionable how they got approved. It's still a shame that Madden doesn't have a screenshot feature. The game looks fantastic in pre and post-play scenes, replays, and images.The Game Face feature has gotten strikingly accurate. Faces can be built through the website EA offers. Unfortunately everything tested using the Game Face within Madden NFL 13 seemed to be broken. As a created Game Face coach in Connected Careers the game continually froze up - with there even being the problem of the league settings never being presented at setup. In Connected Careers as a player my guy came out ghost white. Ultimately I just had to restart both and go with either a created coach/player not utilizing Game Face or just to take over a current coach/player or a legend.Kinect for Xbox 360 voice commands are still hit and miss like in the demo. What has been discovered is that the game noise seems to adversely affect how Kinect picks up the commands. In Practice mode, where there is no crowd or commentary, it recognizes the voice commands much more consistently. Within games though shouting for \"no huddle\" is about the only thing I've found myself using it for. There simply isn't enough time to make multiple worthwhile adjustments through Kinect particularly when it isn't reliably interpreting the requests.The legends have been implemented in a clever way. Sadly only a portion of the full roster of legends is actually available to use in Connected Careers. However having the option to take those guys into the mode is great - and they even wear their old gear. It's a shame that 16 of the 25 players and 6 of the 7 coaches eligible for CC are currently locked away. Those held back as pre-order incentives will be unlocked for all in September while the others can be unlocked by obtaining them in Ultimate Team mode. The full roster of legends is presumably available to collect immediately within Ultimate Team mode.Content wise Madden NFL 13 is rich with the impressive Connected Careers in play - and hopefully a carry-over of the excellent online play from last year - in addition to more niche features like Ultimate Team and integration of legendary players and coaches. Madden NFL 13 may not represent a revolution but it does achieve a sense of revival that could generate the momentum needed to really take the series to the next level.Connected Careers could be the real legacy birthed from Madden NFL 13. However the \"Infinity Engine\" physics system has breathed life into gameplay - and other improvements have enhanced the experience to a significant degree. Presentation still has a ways to go and there are AI issues and features omitted but it's a lot easier overlooking shortcomings when there is true innovation and worthwhile advancements to fall back on.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2012"}

I played the old (original) xcom both on pc and original playstation (I believe) but always found it a bit tedious.  This game has some issues but nothing that really detracts from the core gameplay.  The graphics aren't so hot both with the gameplay and cg movies but that's okay, the gameplay is so good it doesn't matter.Basically, you control an international joint task force that has to repel an alien invasion force.  The gameplay is similar to tactical rpgs but with a bit more options action-wise when you go on missions.  The difficulty is balanced and ramps up as you progress.  It gets fairly hectic in the harder missions and it creates tension with using the units you chose for the mission.  The enemy a.i. is intelligent and the smarter enemy units seem to base their attacks on the class of units and work together like your own units.  You have to build your facility, do research to get new weapons and gear, manage/recruit your soldiers, and defend allied countries on a limited budget.  Even doing that (managing the base) is somewhat difficult and you have to make a lot of tough decisions regarding defense.Awesome game.  Definitely top 10 of the past console generation, I'd put it top 5.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2014"}

So what must you expect from Mario Kart DS that you hadn't already seen in the other Mario Karts? A lot of things, actually.For the first time ever, Mario goes Wi-Fi in this cool kart racer! That's right! You can play online with 3 other people! Sure, that's not a lot, and the track selection is somewhat limited here, but just being able to actually play with people from across the world in the comfort of your home is incredibly appealing.Internet aside, there's still much more to enjoy here. The tracks here are as robust and colorful as ever! I mean, seriously. You can't possibly go wrong when it comes to racing through the likes of a giant pinball machine, or Luigi's very spooky mansion. Plus, Nintendo has also managed to revive a whole lot of tracks from previous Mario Kart games, including favorites like Double Dash's Baby Park, Super Circuit's Sky Garden, and MK64's Moo Moo Farm.The Battle mode is VERY lively here compared to other games! Here, you can actually play alone and battle 7 computer players, teams or not! Multiplayer is also a very nice option here, as well (Too bad only Local, though). Whether you're popping each other's balloons with items or stealing each other's Shine Sprites, there's surely some fun to be had.Here's a thought: Ever wanted to more than just race and battle with these karts? Well, Mario Kart DS introduces a new mode in which you complete MISSIONS to progress through (Sadly, this isn't in Mario Kart Wii or 3DS)! The missions give off even more variety, as if the regular tracks didn't offer that much, by giving you challenging tasks to do. There's also Boss Battling, as you must defeat bosses that try to literally attack you, popping the balloons you have.

{"product_name":"B003RS8HG6","description":"","reviewerName":"MikeB \"Metalhead\"","summary":"Rock on, and on, and on...","reviewText":"Note:  I have not played Pro Drums or Pro Guitar in RB3.Rock Band 3 feels very much the same as previous installments in the franchise, but with some welcome new additions that keep it fresh.  If you enjoy or are interested in music rhythm party games, Rock Band is the reigning king of music games.  You can play guitar, drums, sing, and now even play keyboard.  The game allows for up to 7 players at once (guitar, bass, drums, keyboard, and 3 harmony vocals) to play locally on one console.  No other game does that.  The instruments play like they have since RB1, with colored notes scrolling toward you on-screen, and you have to \"play\" the notes in time with the music to score points.  Even the new keyboard follows the same five button formula and feels familiar.  Since the core gameplay was already great, this isn't a bad thing, but don't expect the experience to feel different or revolutionary.The biggest addition to RB3 is the new PRO mode.  You can play Pro Drums with a resonably priced cymbal addition to the existing four pad drum set, allowing for a total of 8 triggers (four pads, three cymbals, and a kick pedal) to keep track of.  Also offered is the Pro Guitar, which can only be played with an expensive new controller that has six strings and 17 frets for a total of 102 buttons (Fender Mustang by Mad Catz).  Or you can go all out and buy the real guitar that doubles as both a game controller and a real electric guitar (Squier Stratocaster by Fender).  Both are very expensive (relative to video games) but are the only way to enjoy Pro Guitar. Finally there is Pro Keys, which used the same keyboard as standard mode, only instead of using just five of the keys, you use the whole keyboard.  The cool thing about Pro Mode is that if you learn to play a song in the game in Pro Mode on Expert difficulty, you're actaully playing the real song note for note, meaning you've leared to play real music.  That's pretty incredible for a video game.  Pro Mode is by far the biggest new addition to RB3, it's just a shame that it requires a serious monetary investment as well as time investment to fully enjoy.  Still, it's nice that the option is there.The career progression is completely revamped this time.  Instead of touring the world using managers and playing clubs to potentially earn or lose fans, now you have set challenges that are unlocked as you play songs and meet the requirements.  Many challenges overlap and completing one usually means progressing on several more.  It's a weird set up that takes some getting used to, but does allow for more freedom in how you want to play than the previous games.  Completing challenges unlocks clothes and gear as well as fans, although I don't really see what the point of fans are anymore.  There is no money to be earned, instead unlocking items makes them available instantly, and not just for the character you're playing, but for all the characters tied to your profile.  This makes unlocking costumes much easier and less tedious than in the previous games.  Character creation is also a little deeper, actually allowing you to customize the character's face and body with more variety.  Another plus is the jump in and out feature.  It allows players to jump in and out and switch instruments on the fly, chance difficulty mid-song, and even turn on no-fail mode or join a song in progress.  It makes party play much easier and less confusing.The most important aspect of any music game is the songs.  Fortunately, RB has the best music in any rhythm game and RB3 is no exception.  There were a couple of songs I didn't care for, but of the 83 songs on disc, I liked 80 of them.  You can also import songs from RB1, RB2, Green Day RB, and Lego RB, as well as all the DLC songs you may have downloaded from the RB Store.  I currently have 300+ songs in my game as a result.  Of course, pre-RB3 songs don't have Pro Mode, but also dissapointing is that post-RB3 songs don't support Pro Mode unless you purchase an upgrade for $1 on top of the $2 per song price tag.  Obviously Pro Mode is for people who have money to burn.  This one complaint aside, RB3 is a great game, and the game is compatable with just about every instrument controller known to man, so chances are you'll find a way to play even if you can't afford all the new instruments.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003RS8HG6","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"Rock Band Gets A Face-Lift -- And A New Personality!","reviewText":"Things have changed, it's a fact. And I know some people are not going to like it. Back when I first played Guitar Hero 2, all the way up through playing Rock Band 3 most of tonight with my brother, what I have always loved about all of these games is shredding on a tasty solo. Something entirely self-indulgent, and an obscene amount of fun. That being said, that is not what Rock Band 3 aimed for this time. The emphasis has shifted and is now on the entire band. One could argue as Rock Band was the first to come out with the drums / bass / vocal parts to create the band performance, the emphasis has always been on the band. But for me it always seemed like for the most part the vocals, drums and bass parts were all secondary to most of the songs that really have stand-out guitar parts. The selection of songs is indicative of a change in focus, from being the \"guitar\" game, to being the \"band game.\" No where is this more obvious than in Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody.' I was looking forward to playing the two awesome guitar solos in it, but when playing the song, a lot of it has me either sitting through vocal / drum / keyboard sections, or playing very easy note sequences. The songs are more mellowed-out, more easily accessible to those people looking to play as a group. Some people will not like that, but I don't mind so much.As far as songs go, I was disappointed to a certain extent. While we do get 'Free Bird,' 'The Beast and the Harlot,' and 'No One Knows,' as the other reviewer pointed out, those songs have been in previous Guitar Hero games. There are so many songs that would be so cool on Rock Band, but some of these are just recycled, and I'm not sure why. But since all of my downloaded songs carried over it really wasn't too big a deal. What we are really paying for in this game is the new ways in which songs play out, and the upgraded features the new software offers.You know that feeling in a sequel where you're having fun, but it's a tentative kind of fun, where you're waiting to see or experience something that they changed from the previous game that you are really not going to like? That's how I felt for the first couple of hours while I was playing tonight. But I have to give Harmonix credit once again. It seems that they left everything that worked in Rock Band 2, and then added features that were lacking from that game. For instance, when playing a set I was always disappointed that the only song you could see your note streak on was the last of them. It's been changed now. Rock Band has taken a page out of Guitar Hero's book here, and made your song stats viewable between songs. They even offer breakdowns of every section of the song, as well as a breakdown of how many points you earned in what ways (ie keeping a streak, overdrive, sustained, etc.). On top of that, when you are playing a song with more than just yourself, it shows you how many points each player got individually, minus the combined overdrive effect, which is neat. And you can rate songs right after you play them, which is a nice feature when you have ~500 songs so sift through.Solos are slightly different looking, not so much in your face anymore. Instead of the note track glowing glue, the edges of the track glow blue. Most of the time you won't even realize you're playing a solo until you notice it counting your percentage. Same thing with a new addition to overdrive. There are still the white-note sequences that earn you 25% of overdrive, but now there is also a new kind, where the edges of the note track will glow yellow, and for getting those parts perfectly you earn 50% overdrive automatically. I'm ambivalent on that point though. I didn't see as the overdrive needed changing, but it's definitely not something I'm complaining about.Setlists can now be saved to be played whenever you want, and the filters for organizing or displaying songs has been greatly expanded (Artist, Album, Genre, Decade, Instrument, Pro Mode Difficulty, Keyboard Part, Rating, Alphabetical by song, etc). Some things have been altered a bit, but it takes a learning curve or just a few minutes. As with recent Guitar Hero games, you can now drop in or out of a song or set at any time, as well as change profiles during any menu screen, which is a really nice new addition to the Rock Band repertoire. Another little thing that I noticed was pausing during a song. We've all done it, and it seems to happen unavoidably when we have a streak going, we've all been there. Rock Band 3 has solved the issue, and it's incredibly simple. Guitar Hero: World Tour made it so when you unpause it gives you a few seconds to see what notes are coming, which was cool...but it was a frozen screen, and you had no clear idea of how fast the notes might come at you. With this game, when you unpause the song rewinds a few seconds, and while it doesn't let you replay notes, it scrolls a blank note chart for a few seconds so you can get the feel of the speed, and then you pick up right back where you left off. Awesome new addition to the game.I think the only negative thing I can say about the game is that I miss the fun facts about bands that would display while the songs were loading. But again Harmonix won't even let me complain about that, because the reason they're gone is because loading times are insanely faster than they used to be. You pick your set, and within a few seconds the song is starting. I don't know how they pulled that off, but it's impressive. In fact, I think the only loading screen I've had so far was the first time I loaded the game, and the game was updating my downloadable songs. A+ for efficiency.The only REAL complaint I can make is that the Pro Mode guitar controller isn't coming out for a couple more weeks (what's up with that, Madcatz?). But I can say this, I browsed the training tutorials for both Pro Guitar and Keyboard, and they are extensive. It really is an impressive accomplishment, and I'm really looking forward to trying it out when the guitar gets here.The bottom line really is this: Even if you don't like any of the songs that come with Rock Band 3, you should still buy it to play your old songs with the news features, because it's so worth it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2010"}

I was looking for a change of pace from Call of Duty and decided to give this a shot. So my review will come as a first time player who only has had experience with CoD.First thing I noticed was how massive everything was. The maps are huge. The building are huge. The teams are huge. I spent the first hour that I was playing just running around and taking in how magnificent everything looked between getting killed by the other team.It took me a little bit to understand what was going on because I was only familiar with Team Deathmatch. The typical BF4 match is Conquest, which is about 75% Capture the Flag and 25% Team Deathmatch. I have much more fun working with a team to capture objectives than just running around and killing people. I've recruited a group of friends to play and it's so much fun partying up and working together to capture objectives, spot enemies, flanking them, etc.One thing I really like is that there isn't a dominate gun in each weapon class. So the battlefield is pretty even whether you're level 1 or level 100. The guns you unlock don't differ much but it's fun finding one that fits your style. One gun might have more power, but lesser stability (recoil), while the other has lesser power but better stability.The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because, like everyone else has said, the game will lock on you on occasion. Dice has pretty much fixed it on every map except for Dawnbreaker. I can play Dawnbreaker 10 times and it will probably lock up my Xbox 8 or 9 times. I have no issues on any other map.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2014"}

Gord.\"","summary":"Worth trying, but definitely not for everyone","reviewText":"Morrowind overall is a decent game, but it has a LOT of things going against it. At times it feels more like a solo MMORPG, and it's not for everyone.Pros:*Plot - This is the only part of the game that I don't find flaw in. The main story is great and there is plenty of amazing lore. This is the part of the game that is worth playing.*Music - Composed by Jeremy Soule, the music is fantastic.*Environment - The island is fantastic and mysterious, with an endless number of neat places to explore.*Graphics - The graphics are great for the time the game was released.*Character Class Customization - Provides you with endless ways to customize your character, though the physical customization is severely lacking.Cons:*Music - Okay, the music itself is amazing. However, it is implemented VERY poorly. Instead of songs tailored to specific aspects of the game, such as a main theme, battle themes and zone themes, there is just a handful of songs that loop throughout the entire game. This greatly cripples the environment and overall feel of the game. For example, in Icewind Dale you have beautiful wind instruments for the peaceful town and bellowing horns for the ruins of a dwarven city. In Morrowind, you have a few themes (including main theme) that loop all the time, and a few battle themes. You can be in a dark, evil Sixth-house cave and hear the gorgeous wind instruments and strings of the main theme playing, which pretty much ruins any sort of immersion. It almost feels like you're listening to a small playlist on iTunes while playing the game.*Environment - While there may be some really well designed areas in this game, it's very repetitive. Once you've seen one cave, shipwreck, grotto, Dwemer ruin, Sixth-house shrine, etc. you've seen them all...and there are a LOT of them. It gets old exploring areas that all look the same. The cities are very similar; with the exception of a few such as Vivec, they are all just a few buildings overloaded with lifeless NPCs.*Battle - The battle is utterly terrible. Magic is generally worthless. You can have a very high destruction skill and your sword will still do triple the damage of one of your destruction spells. Swords aren't much fun, either. Melee consists of constantly spamming the mouse over and over again until it finally hits that huge creature that is practically on top of you. It is just frustrating, not fun. Unlocking doors and disarming traps is the same - you must spam your lock over and over again until it succeeds. Very tedious and very boring.*NPCs/dialogue/quests - They lack personality. Very few of them are memorable. They all feel like clones and most of them say the same thing. The dialogue is a drag and consists of pushing random words/topics on the side and seeing if the response from NPC #135435 is different that the response from NPC #135436. The quests the NPCs give you are generally errand boy quests and are very boring. There is also little reward for doing them, aside from some reputation and gold. Some of them are frustrating and make no sense; for example the empire sends you to assassinate a group of people, but if you kill them first, when you come out the empire arrests you.*Vendors/trainers - Vendors and trainers are a complete drag. There are so many of them and it takes forever to sell anything (they have gold limits and you have to sell to specific vendors, e.g. sell swords to weapons vendor). Returning from a dungeon, it is an absolute pain to try to sell all of the loot you found. This may be fine for some players, but most gamers would be really frustrated with this.*Equipment - Honestly, there is not very much cool armor in this game. Glass armor is neat, and there are some nice weapons, but that's about it. Combined with the fact that most of the \"dungeons\" (which are mostly small and insignificant) are repeats of one another, the lack of equipment takes away from the desire to explore. You can find the coolest armor very early in the main story, and after that there isn't much motivation to go digging in the clone caves scattered throughout the island.*Enchanting/spell making - Adds a nasty shine to armor that makes it uglier than before. It's also a very tedious profession; you can either pay exorbitant amounts of money to an enchanter or do it yourself with a low success rate. It's overly complex and is more of a pain than it's worth. Spell making is not as fun as it sounds, it mainly consists of combining spells you already know into another worthless spell.*Physical character customization - Lacking, not many ways to change your characters appearance.*Bugs - While a lot of this has been fixed through patches and expansions, the game still has a lot of issues, including frequently getting stuck (in many ways), crashing, lag, etc.Overall, I think that the main story is worth doing and the game is worth buying just for that. It takes a long time to get into and definitely isn't for everyone, though.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2011"}

Luckily, balloons (lives) are much more plentiful in this game than in the past.  Same goes for the coinage.  I do have a few complaints, starting with using the inventory items.  If you're having trouble getting through a level and want to resort to using an inventory item, you have to exit the entire level--which requires you to wait through a loading screen--then relaunching the level after you've chosen your inventory item(s)...which of course makes you sit though ANOTHER loading screen.  This really breaks up the fun.  Why can't we just access our inventory at some point within the levels themselves (like at the continue points with Mr. Pig?)  Or maybe after you die X number of times, a helper can pop up asking if you'd like to use an inventory item.  But noooo, instead you have to decide BEFORE entering a level if you want to use an inventory item--which makes zero sense your initial play-through, since you have no idea yet if you'll need help since you've never played the level before!  I also don't get why Nintendo didn't give us the option to 'restart level' in the pause menu??  It only allows you to exit (which again, forces you to sit through two loading screens if all you want to do is go back and redo the level from the beginning).  LAME!  And speaking of the loading screens, they are choppy.  What's up with that?My other gripe: The swimming controls.  Awful.  It's a shame, too, because the water levels were absolutely gorgeous.  They were a pain to get through though solely because of the frustrating controls (I was using the Wii motion plus controller).I beat the game without even realizing I was on the last level or was fighting the final boss :\\  There was no sense of, \"This is it...this is the end.\"  I just beat the dude & the next thing I knew I was watching a cut scene & the credits.  Surprise!  So from start to finish, this game took me approximately a week to beat, playing through one world each day.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house.

However, the GameCube is the console most underated in the market. In terms of graphics, GC can provide stunning graphics that both PS2 and XBox cannot offer. People were so mislead by all the specs publication wars which actually Nintendo was not interested in at all. Look at games like Metroid Prime, Wave Racer, Red Squaldron etc. you will know what GC can offer. However, the whole world is just to distracted by graphics of games, which in way thought that as long as the game as good graphics, it is a good game, which is SO SO NOT TRUE. A game is about game play, and this is what makes a game re-visitable or not. Among all the game libraries provided by different consoles, there is no doubt that PS2 has the biggest library but at the same has the most junk games available. For XBox, most stuff are port from PS2 and at the same time has pathetic games like DOA Beach Volley which encourage players to be obssessed with the virtual body and manipulation of CG girls. For Nintendo, you can find the most innovative games in store: Eternal Darkness redefine the way survival thriller should be played, Metroid Prime redefine the game play of the series per se, Animal Crossing provides the most interesting interactive expereinces, Zelda Wind Waker provides you the most environmental related RPG format, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles provides innovative Multiplayer RPG experience. People should give GC a go before criticising GC as a kid console. Just imagine games like PN03, Killer 7, Eternal Darkness and Viewtiful Joe are not kid games at all. So wake up gamers and try before you criticise, and play before you make your judgement of this console of all time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2003"}

Well I put the game in and away I went. I played for like not even an hour and kinda got bored. I got really bored in the free run mode. My 4 year old nephew doesn't even like this game. The thing I do like is the controls are very easy all you use is your analog stick and your A button, can't get any easier than that. Also it is alot better if you have more than 1 player playing. I do like the part of the game is when Kirby sucks up enemies and can use different things so he doesn't slow down and he can defend himself. (Only in the racing mode). The thing I don't like is the tracks you race on are way to short. I like it but..... not the greatest game out there.

It worked great, but i just purchased a new 46\" 2011 Samsung 3D smart TV, and the shape of the back, more curved, did not allow my cheat to be used.  So I grabbed this, and it works absolutely perfectly.The base here has the male pieces to fit into the bottom of the Kinect base and snap it into place, so it won't move.  This is completely adjustable so you can get a good angle for just about any TV out there.  It's a very solid ratcheting movement (at first I was hesitant to pull it apart since it took enough force that I felt there had to be a release I was not finding to unlock it).  And once you set it to a size, it will not move on its own.On my 2011 TV, with the very thin, almost non-existent bezel around the TV screen ,this fits fine and left a little room to spare, so even on those thin edged screens, the clamp won't hang into the actual picture area of the screen.Solidly built, adjustable, and fits the Kinect just fine - could't ask for a better product.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Don't listen to the bad reviews. This game is a worthy sequel.","reviewText":"The Good: Gorgeous art style, some of the best pre-rendered cut scenes I have ever seen, more loot than you can shake a stick at, varied environments, awesome enemy designs, some tough bosses, lots of replay value, Auction House can be a second incomeThe Bad: Level layout can get boring and tedious, some poor difficulty balancing, game needs to be constantly connected online, requires dedication to get the best loot, loot isn't all that great until higher levelsDiablo III is one of the most long-awaited games in history. StarCraft II and Duke Nukem Forever are in the same boat, but Diablo III is something else. Everyone who played the last two games were either in high school or college at the time and are now in their 30&#8242;s and 40&#8242;s. 12 years in the making with so much turmoil and history to write a novel about. Now that the game is finally out is it any good? Blizzard surprised us with StarCraft II and how good that game is, but can they do it twice in a row? The answer is yes. The game has its fair share of problems, but they were mainly during launch with a plethora of glitches, balancing, and server issues. Most of the major problems have been patched now so I won't spend time complaining about that because I didn't experience any issues apart from the occasional server error.The story in Diablo III is fairly good, but only people who played the last two will truly appreciate it. I found the middle of the game to be pretty uneventful, but the ending was great with a few plot twists. You play as one of many hero classes who is trying to stop the Prime Evils from taking over the world. Not just Diablo, but Azmodan, Mephisto, Belial and many others. One of the best things in the game are the many different locales from indoors to outdoors. The art style is absolutely beautiful leaving you with plenty of great scenery to look at.Of course a dungeon crawler isn't one without a lot of loot and Diablo III has an endless amount. The best loot is at higher levels (60 is the cap) and on Nightmare difficulty. This is really a game for people who want loot. You can blow through the story and reach around level 30, but it will take another play through to get the best loot. Why do you want this loot so bad? To sell in the auction house for in-game gold or real world cash. That's right. Cash. People can bid on it or buy it outright, but don't expect anyone to bid on the crappy stuff. Only level 60 loot is really being fought for. I tried selling dozens of rare items throughout my play through and only sold one for $1.25. Really sad.The best loot comes from bosses which are highlighted in gold. Main bosses give you the best stuff, but they can be tough as nails. Some bosses were pretty easy, such as mid-level bosses or blue sub-bosses. There were a few that just kept killing me, but I didn't die all that often. The penalty isn't very severe with just 10% durability of all your equipped items taken away, but you can always repair it at a town center. One thing I didn't do hardly at all was buy items. I always found the best ones as drops rather than at shops. I didn't even craft any items really which is a shame. I found this to be sorely wasted. I did like the new gem ability which will raise stats of items significantly. Weaker gems can be crafted into more powerful ones as well.Of course you can take a buddy with you, but you really don't have to. This is only recommended on Nightmare difficulty, but most people will probably want to take a long break from the game and come back a few months later where the game feels a little more fresh. After I finished the game I felt I needed a long break because you are just clicking around madly while using 1-4 keys for your attacks. I sure wasn't disappointed here because there are plenty of abilities to learn; I just wish you could hotkey more of them instead of just four. I even wish there were some better AoE attacks because the last two acts throw a ton of tough enemies at you and you are constantly boxed in. I managed, but it would have been nice.At the end of the day you are just clicking around furiously at everything that moves and trying to find the best loot in the game to sell in the auction house. This is a game for people who are dedicated. Sure you can enjoy the single player, but if you really want to experience the way Diablo was built to be played you must continue on in a second play through on a harder difficulty. Sure the game has good voice acting, some of the most beautiful pre-rendered cut scenes I have ever seen, lots of abilities, tons of loot, but in the end this is all this game is about. Looting, clicking, selling. If you don't like that then you will hate this game.My biggest complaint would have to be the layout of each level is nearly the same. There is a fog of war for the map and you have to discover where everything is. There may be some side quests, hidden chests, and sub-bosses, but I found this tiring and kind of boring. What's here is great, I just wish there was a little more variety. Another thing I will complain about is the game's DRM. You need to be online at all times or it will boot you and you will lose your progress. I hated this more than anything, but Blizzard has successfully side-stepped pirates and I applaud them for that. Probably the only video game ever made that isn't pirateable. Other than this the game is great and well worth a purchase.Side Note: Due to the flak I am getting on the comments I have to add this note. For people saying the game is boring and you just click around looting, welcome to dungeon crawlers, they are ALL like that. Secondly, people claiming this is a paid/fake review, it isn't! I wish I could get paid for reviews. It is sickening how when you write a review that people don't agree with they assume you're paid for it. I do this as a hobby because I love games, I don't get a cent. I am just being honest with the game and I am not a foaming at the mouth fan boy throwing a tantrum. People's expectations were too high for this game. It is a dungeon crawler, there is only so much you can do. The game isn't perfect and isn't what it could have been, but it isn't nearly as bad as these bratty fan boys are claiming. I for one am not a fan boy of Diablo I just think it is a fun game. I played through most of D2, never played D1, so that clears that one up. If you don't like the game don't play it! There's such a huge stigma with this game that people will start believing things that aren't even true about the game before even playing it. The game is good on its own. I'm not saying it is the best game ever made or anything like that.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00004SVS5","reviewerName":"John. N","summary":"Could have been great; instead it's merely decent","reviewText":"When it comes to the NES Mega Man titles, there seems to be no greater rivalry than Mega Man 2 vs. Mega Man 3. Even if a fan prefers one of the later installments, it's unlikely that these two games, instrumental in forging Mega Man's identity, end up on equal ground. So which camp am I in? Despite my best effort not to add to the seemingly endless love for Mega Man 2, I have to go with it, not Mega Man 3. But why? While I can't exactly say Mega Man 3 is \"busted,\" there are some design choices at work here that really throw a wench in the experience for me, things that were fine last time out and should have been left alone.A lot of Mega Man 3's problems center around boss fights. First of all, the amount of crash damage one receives from making contact with a robot master is flat out wrong. I can understand this kind of damage being higher from a fortress boss, but I shouldn't lose one-fourth of my health for what is essentially a silly hit. The problems continue as the built in invincibility period after a successful hit on a boss has essentially been eliminated. This means you can score hit upon hit in quick succession without waiting between blows. While one could see pumping ammunition down an enemy's throat as a good thing, there are times were it absolutely destroys any semblance of challenge this title has to offer.The game's other main flaw revolves around the addition of everyone's favorite canine sidekick Rush. Mega Man 2's Item 1, 2 and 3 have been replaced by the Rush Coil, Jet and Submarine. Giving such items more of an identity is appreciated as is their necessity in navigating the levels. What's not welcome is setting up the stages and power-ups in such a manner where the player can get stuck with no recourse (other than to exhaust their lives and continue) because power ups don't respawn after death. This becomes a real issue in the somewhat pointless Doc Robot levels as do continue points.As much as I love Mega Man, I can't give Mega Man 3 the same kind of love I give Mega Man 2. Again, there is no reason to put that game on a pedestal but it is free of the problems found here, as are solid outings like Mega Man 4, 5 and 6. That said, I have to agree with Keiji Inafune that there are many things here that could have benefited from being redone and the change in leadership from the teams that crafted the first two games definately shows at the end of the day.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2011"}

It's not that good. I bought this in Dec 2011, brand new, with the sticker still on the top \"Do not put on shelves until 5/10/2011\".  Within that short amount of time this game dropped to the under-10-buck range.I can quickly sum up the game for you: Every level, every time you play, is like playing a very fast paced and confusing version of king of the hill (you know - like in Halo when you play against another team and you have to hold your ground or hold off the enemy base).  There is so much going on and everyone is moving so damn fast that it's very hard to kill anyone off accurately, and all the while your team is constantly saying they've got a base or a base was taken or they're giving a med pack or they're going this way or that way.  It's too much.  It's too fast and too confusing and no fun.It LOOKS cool - I like the cut scenes and the character customization and the graphics are nice.  But the gameplay is just terrible.  You being a level with your other teammates who rush off in all directions because they know where to go whereas you have no clue. You fight bad guys who kill you and you respawn and just keep at it ad-infinitum until you finally make some headway and take the enemy base / disarm the bomb / blow up the door, etc.  It's repetitive, it's confusing, it's no challenge (just frustrating) and it's easy to see why there are so many negative reviews on here.  Well, here's one more.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2012"}

The storyline, voice talent, graphics and mechanics of the game are still top notch.  The game seems a little shorter but that could quite possibly be due to the fact that I didn't have to outswim a speeding underwater barrier like in the first one...or maybe it was the absence of those cursed spinning knife totems that I repeatedly fell off of inches from the top.  I cringe just thinking about it.The game remains challenging although not nearly as frustrating as the first. The story is completely engrossing and the cut scenes are nothing short of fabulous.  If you're concerned that this time around you'll have a kinder, gentler Kratos...think again.  This guy has issues and works them out by slaughtering everything in his path. Definitely not for kids but the rest of us can delight in the sheer chaos.Some of the unlockables are downright silly though...like replaying the game dressed in a fish costume...yeah, it's funny for about 5 minutes. You do get a few nice unlockables though, like character development, scene creations, and the ability to replay with your unlocked weapons (on the same difficulty rating).

{"product_name":"B000TI836G","description":"","reviewerName":"W. freeman","summary":"Not bad, not great","reviewText":"Well here we are with another season of games, and competition. In seeing the advertisement for this game all over the internet I thought to myself well it looks like they are trying to really make this franchise work, again. So does it? Well yes and no. Medal of Honor actually came out before Call Of Duty but could never seem to keep up with it in terms of sales, fans,and gameplay. For some reason it was always a step behind. That being said i don't think any medal of honor has really been absolutely horrible, although i do think there have been far to many games made of this series. Well with the new game you really get nothing new under the sun, graphically the game is just as good as Battlefield BC, or Call Of Duty, but it just seems that this has already been done by those games and this one is just left hanging in limbo. Gameplay wise its also the same, aiming down your sites(looks just like COD, to a T), also movement and the overall control feel is spot on the same as both of the for mentioned games.With MOH you also get destructible environments which just can't help itself from clone Battlefield BC, mainly the second game. The story is just basic and boring, also the AI is really stupid and you find guys running around into trees, jumping off rocks, getting stuck between tanks so on and so forth. So i think the time was put into developing the game in some areas(mainly scenery) yet lacking in other areas(being story and creative gameplay). Jumping also feels sloppy and reminds you of Doom 3 or something similar that feels like a slight hop instead of an actual jump, of course its that way with a lot of FPS games. So if someone has never played COD, of BBC, which i would find impossible to believe, they may be a fan of this game, otherwise it just falls short, or flat in most aspects. So i've never kept up on the fan base for this franchise but i truly believe unless you just want to be different and not play what every one else is playing your really missing out, because Medal Of Honor just doesnt deliver. As i mentioned, there are much better FPS games out there that are way more interesting and fun. Also i must say that the online play is pretty sloppy and doesnt seem like a lot of great level design time was spent on the maps, even though the graphics do look great. Other than that MOH doesn't have much going for it. So in summing this up, MOH isn't horrible, its just the love child of COD, and BBC, and has way to many similar traits of both. Just no where near as good.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2010"}

If you are looking for any sort of story obviously DO NOT buy this game! CoD has been lacking in writing more and more as the years go by, and this game is no exception. Ghosts is a very poor story behind the single player, and graphics are not as they should have been for their next release. True most people buy this for the online experience but that too comes up extremely short. The game play is obviously the same as the past 3 releases and they hardly gave any (if any at all) new weapons or modes. If you are looking for a FPS that is EXACTLY the same as the past CoD then yes Ghosts would be a good match for you, but if you want something with any sort of replay value or anything new stray from this title! I for one have had enough with all the teenagers and college drop outs that act as if they are in the military (from their parents house) barking commands and screaming online.

Same great style and fun to play but after I gotinto it I realized that it was just the same game in some new levels.  Now the levels were more creative than 2's but they were not as compelling to play.  In fact I downright hated many of the levels you got to.  There were few improvements over 2, just the revert eveyone talks about and the create-a-park was pretty much the same.

The chance to play Mickey, my Mickey, as the lovable mouse, or as a mischievous rat? The thought alone is liquid joy. But what arrived when I bit and clawed my way to the wrapper was so dull and simplistic, so unpolished as to make me think that I was the victim of some cosmic joke.Graphics are boring and uninspired. Its sounds cliche to say there's no magic, but that's the only descriptive I can think of. Kingdom Hearts had more feeling than some of the stages, though he black and whites are a nice touch.Audio was a joke. They pretty much setup the standard for frustration by making Mickey the main character, and then giving him exactly zero spoken lines. Everyone in the game, save the initial narration, speaks in grunts. That's really all worth mentioning.Gameplay was also bland, boring action platformer du jour. If you've played singularity or any platformer that deals with environment manipulation, you won't notice any difference. Levels don't flow well at times, meaning that you can get lost easily. Also, there's no longer the morality system that was initially put forth. All that changes is the development of the primary brush powers. To say the game gradually becomes challenging is true, in that it goes from ludicrously easy to very easy.Overall, this is just... ordinary. There's nothing to set it apart from any other bland platformer except for the fact that Mickey is the main character, and he's so uninvolved in his own story that he could easily be replaced with anyone else.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2010"}

The graphics are great, the music fits in well, and we really enjoy the gameplay.Anyone familiar with classic stories about the Pirates of the Caribbean will quickly understand the gameplay. You are the captain of a pirate ship, and sail around the various islands in the Caribbean, attacking whoever you choose. You get plunder from the conquered ships, build up your fame and manpower, and trade goods from island to island.You get to do ship-sailing tasks such as making sure you circle your ship to aim its side (i.e. the bank of cannons) at the enemy. You can send landing parties to explore islands, and land in the various towns. You can hang out in the tavern, gathering rumors and new crew. You can chat with the governor and maybe his attractive daughter. You can refit your ship and trade with the merchant.As you go, you can build up to better and better ships, and even be captain of an entire fleet. The politics come and go, and you might be friends with some countries that later become your enemies. There are mini-games galore. You can board a ship and get into a hand-to-hand duel. You can dance with the women at the ball. If you're tossed into prison, you can sneak your way out again.The graphics are really rather nice, with the bright blues, greens and sandy shores of the tropical caribbean area. The rolling of the waves, the sailing of the ships, and the bright sunshine really help you get a feel of this beautiful part of the world.The music is great, too. If your crew is happy, they sing traditional sea tunes as they sail along. The combat music, sailing music, tavern music, all of it helps you feel like you're back in the days of swords and tight pants.Some say that the backgrounds are repetitive, but I really didn't find this to be the case. How different is the deck of a ship going to look, if you're having a swordfight in it? The decks they show are incredibly detailed, with wooden barrels, gridded windows and carved woodwork. With the main focus of a fight being the fight, I have no need for 8 thousand backgrounds to fight against.You get promotions from the various countries, which upgrade your look. You really get a sense of progress as you build your fame and become a power to be reckoned with.I enjoy this game a great deal, and highly recommend it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2005"}

The story is completely forgettable.  When you have your standoff at the end I could only think: who is this guy again? The characters are terrible and the character models in cut scenes are atrocious.  Also there is level where you walk up 15 flights of stairs and do nothing other than listen to the AI complain about walking up the stairs -- brilliant game design!COOP: Guerilla could be fun but they decided to not include matchmaking which is standard by this point.

This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Inspector Gadget \"Go Go Gadget Reviews\"","summary":"Sets the bar very high for car chase video games","reviewText":"Burnout Paradise is not your average racing game. Having never played a Burnout before this one I was expecting something along the lines of Need for Speed, or Blur, or Dirt. Burnout Paradise features an open world filled with insane opportunities for stunts and outrageous chases, there's no linear progression through the races and challenges. Open-world gameplay is not really as groundbreaking as it was 10 years ago, but when applied to Burnout it enhances the feeling of adventure.There are loads of different cars to choose from and different challenges such as 'Marked Man', 'Stunt Run', 'Cops and Robbers', 'Showtime' and many others. They are all very exciting, and the handing of most of the vehicles is near flawless. The world of Paradise City is scenic and idyllic, it's the perfect setting for mayhem. But I have to be honest, there are negative aspects to the game.The fact that there is no driver to your car is kinda creepy. It would be so much better to see someone thrown from the windshield every time you crash. The customization of every vehicle is limited. And the mini map really, really could use more detail. But the worst complaint of all is the trophy which require 8 online players to meet in Wildcat Stadium. It is required in order to get the Platinum. I have tried many, many times to get this trophy but finding 7 others to cooperate is impossible. Up until this point the game seemingly gives away trophies for free (there are 98 of them) but sticking this one in there was pure evil on behalf of the programmers.However, the most appealing aspect of the game is the custom soundtrack option, in which you can play your own tunes from your PS3 over the gameplay without losing sound effects.

Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"Your Health Is Low, Part II","reviewText":"There are no spoilers in this review.I will try to keep this as short as possible. We all have better things to do than read 5,000 words on how a video game is \"just okay.\"In a game with a higher level of customization than most (and for good reason, since it can be classified as an RPG), story matters, and in the grips of finishing a good story, it would be very easy to give Fable 3 a 5-star rating based solely on the fact that its story is sterling. However, rather simple annoyance hold it back from earning 5 stars.I have played through the game twice now, and feel like I have absorbed most of what the game has to offer, and so feel comfortable in this review, that I consider fair. I will break down what the game did right by me, and what it did wrong.>What Fable 3 Did Right&lt;1. As I mentioned already, thee story is superb. Helped along by2. The voice acting, and3. Very well-written secondary characters. Ones that actually have depth. Praise be to whoever wrote the game, and to those who didn't cut the dialog out of fear the player would be bored.4.Gorgeous vistas and nice graphics. Fable 2 also had some very beautiful visuals, but they pale in comparison to ones contained in this game. It is very obviously the Fable look from previous games, but some of the scenery is beautiful. Watch out for high winds on snowy mountains; the snow-covered trees are mesmerizing.5. Real estate is present again, and once you own enough property can make quite a bit of gold. You are paid once every five minutes of gameplay.6. The new menu system. Instead of wading through tedious sub-screens in your inventory, you now have the Sanctuary, a place you go automatically (and instantaneously, no loading screens = awesome) when you push START. Your Sanctuary is divided into different rooms, a la Armory, Clothing, Trophy room, a LIVE room for Co-Op play, and the World Map in the main room. This allows you to quickly change your weapon or spell gauntlets, change or dye your clothes, and fast travel to different locations.7. The maps are much bigger, and so is the explorable world. Finally we get a little more actual exploration. Many times I found myself thinking \"Wow, this is all contained in one map?\" If you're familiar with the previous two iterations of this game you'll be kind of blown away. Some of the map areas are huge. And in general you can actually leave paths altogether now and do some exploring, since there is now a lot of room to move around in.8. Living weapons. The game tracks every aspect of your behavior, and modifies your weapons accordingly. Are you generous? You weapon's handle will mutate. Amass a lot of gold? Your weapon will glow with a golden aura. I thought it was pretty cool.>What Fable 3 Did Wrong&lt;1. Most obviously, the magic system has been greatly simplified. Instead of purchasing more powerful iterations of spells you unlock with experience points, you now simply have Spell Gauntlets, or, magical gloves you wear to cast certain spells. What this means is, if you have unlocked say, Fireball (your first spell), Ice Storm, Force Push, Blades, etcetera, you can only equip one set of gauntlets at a time (until you unlock the Spell Weaving ability, which allows you to combine gauntlets to use a two-spell combo). It's frustrating because especially the original Fable had awesome spells that you could level up with experience points you gained. I really felt stifled and turned off by how limited your magical abilities were (even with Spell Weaving, and there are some cool spells).2. Combat is a bit of a button-masher. Which is nothing new to this franchise, but it's still very repetitive. It's still interesting though. And there are now finishing moves, but I haven't found that these are anything more than random occurrences. X to use your melee weapon, Y to use your ranged weapon, B to use spell gauntlets. Holding each will result in a charged attack, but there is very little variation, and since holding a button to charge an attack will leave you wide open for attack, you probably won't use either ranged or melee charge attacks often. Magical charged attacks are more worth it since you can knock enemies down or back with an area-effect spell.3. The glowing trail can be stupid, and the map is fairly useless. The world map, in my opinion, is much more useful for fast-travel or purchasing real estate more quickly, and much less useful as a tool to find a specific location. You cannot set your own waypoints either. Sometimes the glowing trail will disappear and you will have to wait fifteen or twenty seconds for it to reappear, and sometimes it will give you conflicting directions. For instance, I did a quest earlier tonight where I had to deliver a package to someone in Bowerstone Industrial. To get there I had to go through Bowerstone Market. So the glowing trail led me into Bowerstone Industrial, but once I got there the trail told me I should be going backwards back into Bowerstone Marketplace. The trail works most of the time, but when it doesn't it can be annoying.4. To go along with bigger maps, there are frequent shading and view-distance issues. For instance, you'll be running through a town and see no one ahead of you, and then ten feet in front of you three npc's will suddenly appear out of nowhere. Floor and scenic models also take some time to load. The game definitely could use more polish. However, I will say the game has not crashed on me, so that is a positive.5. Weapon augmentation is absent, and so are bows and crossbows, as well as any other melee weapon types except swords and hammers. Fine with me on the latter, but lack of augments kinda sucks. With legendary weapons, it is possible to unlock specific effects such as lightning and the like, but you can no longer choose what type of effect they have.6. The expression wheel is gone. The expressions are always kind of silly anyways, I didn't miss it, but I've heard people complain about it. You can still do expressions, but only one TYPE of expression, such as EITHER a friendly expression OR an evil one.7. Experience orbs are gone, instead you earn guild seals. An odd choice to me, since they are essentially the exact same thing, only with a different name.8. Guild seal experience is arbitrary. I just finished a mission where I had to kill about 15 balverines, and I gained one and a half guild seals. That took me about a half hour. But if I walk through Bowerstone and give the needy gold, I can earn about five guild seals in about five minutes. What is this I don't even9. Skills can only be upgraded as you progress in the story. You track your progress towards revolution on a symbolic map that shows how close you are to your goal. You are separated by approximately ten gates that are unlocked after you have completed certain parts of the story. This means that regardless of how many guild seals you have, you must wait until the gate is unlocked before you can level a skill up. I much preferred the original Fable's skill and experience system.10. Your dog is slightly annoying. Useful for knowing where to have you dig, but most of the time he'll bark to show he's found something and then retrace his tracks at least once before finally slowing down and starting to paw the ground.11. you must now maintain your real estate, but only if it's a house you're renting out. Shops and stalls you buy will not wear down. This really isn't that big a deal until you own a lot of property. I probably own pretty much everything you can own, which is over a hundreds houses (roughly), and so I have to INDIVIDUALLY choose each house, scroll down twice to the repair option, and then click A twice to say yes I am sure I want to repair this. >>>This is probably my biggest annoyance of all, and the dumbest. It now takes me about a half hour of gameplay just to go through all of my properties and fix them back up to 100% condition. If they reach 0% they are considered broken and will bring you no income. To go along with this, it is also quite costly to maintain them all collectively. Some just require a few hundred gold, but a few of the more expensive properties take like 45,000 gold or so to fix back up. Granted, by the time you own them you're probably raking in the money, but the point is when I go back and fix all the properties up, it costs me about 250,000 gold.&lt;&lt;&lt; And one last thing about this, and that is...you don't have to fix things up but maybe once every 4 or so gameplay hours, but that you have to do it at all is dumb. I would rather they deducted the cost of maintenance out of the profits you're making and remove the repair thing altogether.12.You can now only carry one type of healing device. Either health potions OR carrots OR meat OR beer, etc. So if you have 10 health potions and you buy one carrot, that carrot replaces all of your potions. I didn't quite understand why this was. It makes for simpler healing, but I didn't see the need to make it this way. My first time through I didn't know this, ran out of health potions thinking I had this great store of food to fall back on, and was surprised and irritated to see what you can only do one at a time.13. Lastly, the game is far too easy. I played through it on my first try and only died (got knocked out) once. I would have liked it at least 50% more challenging. I felt nearly invincible practically from the start.>Conclusion&lt;You will notice the list of things I think the game did wrong is about twice as long as what I think it did right. But I think what the game did wrong were much smaller issues, and much more heavily outweighed by the good things. In a game like this, it should be immersive first and foremost. And in that regard the game gets an A+. Everything else comes second. In this iteration of the Fable franchise, the strong story, voice acting, and characters really hold it all together. And yes, obviously there is a lot of room for improvement, but if you're on the fence about this game, take a chance, because it's rare these days to find a game that actually puts story first. Maybe in that regard my review is biased, but so many games (and especially sequels) are churned out these days with incredibly shallow plot and characterization that this was like a breath of fresh air.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2010"}

The Yakuza series brings back familiar faces along with new ones.. A Loan Shark,a crooked cop and a ex-con.. Everything almost looks the same but that does not mean it's a bad thing..New areas such as rooftops and underground malls have been added along with new store fronts and hostess bars..Pachenko Slots have been added with a mix of a couple of new games..The arcade shooter is back from part 3 in the sega arcade..The battle system is fun,granted I only been using the loan shark as that is who you start off with.. His dashing kicks and move sets are really refreshing for the series.. As you progress through the amazing storyline you will cross paths with other characters you will play later which I always found an awesome concept..The soundtrack is great barnone.. The city to me now feels more live then it ever was before. If you are in to beat em ups like streets of rage with that element of shenmue with a mix of fantastic film making I say buy this now..Other reviewers really scarred this game for no GOOD reason other then lacking time to do a review to show up for PAX..what a joke..will update when I use other charactersQuick Update: There are multiple Hostess bars. Leaderboards for various mini games including the arcade shooter. Nothing big just forgot to point out.UPDATE: I'm taking my time with this game but really upset at the lackluster hype for this underrated gem..Reminds me of part 2..Anyway I wanted to mention a few more things but also want to mention I'm still on the loan shark(doing more adventures then missions) The beat them up and flap them back up from the floor to continue combos is great and gives you a a$$ kicking feel. Singing duets and voices for each character really makes karaoke more fun then 3 hands down..Areas hidden at first for certain characters..This is a new element for the series but works well since there are tons of new areas in general..(also once you beat the game everything is unlocked) The key radar really helps when looking for all the keys in the game. Will update again when I get more in depth with the characters..the loan shark I must say is suave just like Kazuma so I can see why they brought him back in Yakuza of the End..FINAL UPDATE: I am near the end of the road with the main missions and plan on beating it on EX hard when I'm done.. This game will make you Laugh,Cry and anger you at times(not the game itself the bad guys) There are a few characters from the past game that are in the storyline that add to the mix..So many twists and turns people will think you are possessed with your head spinning on wth really went on in this story..I always said Part 2 was my favorite of the bunch but part 4 is creeping up behind it..I am amazed on how well a story on a video game is played out..The sub stories are fun and engaging..The music I'm pretty sure I mentioned it before outstanding,from selection screens to battles the music keeps you motivated.. I will be sad when the series finally hits the end of it's life line..Part 5 is in development and won't release until mid-late next year and for us if we do get it will be maybe 3 years from now.. A solid game,a Masterpiece really..I bought 2 copies in support..Go buy it,don't have second doubts...If you own a PS3 this game should be in your collection..","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0053BCMAC","description":"","reviewerName":"Tommy Sixx Morais","summary":"Not bad but...","reviewText":"At first glance Paper Mario Sticker Star looks like your average Paper Mario RPG game, but appearances can be misleading. They kept the cartoonesque feel and clever jokes of the franchise but it's noticeable early on that Nintendo tried a different approach this time around. There is significantly less of an RPG feeling in Sticker Star. You still battle and the idea remains the same, but it's not an open world anymore. Instead you have worlds with levels like Super Mario Bros and you beat one to get to the next. It's done rather well in that sense and for the most part they have the Paper Mario feeling. However, what made Paper Mario games so great to me was how you roamed freely with no levels which was different for a Mario. Now we're back to levels which is a step backward if you ask me. The levels work and they are fun but l can't help but think they messed with a successful formula.The presentation aspect is fantastic, Paper Mario on the 3DS looks amazing and it looks right at home. The 3D works very well mixed the 2D graphics for a unique presentation. The way the characters talk, move and interact is just charming and perfect. The paper, pop-up look definitely translates nicely on the 3DS.The story goes like follow.Bowser steals a royal sticker and gives pieces of it to his people which gives them superpowers. A shiny crown follows Mario who has to go find the stickers and save princess Peach, of course. The crown helps you along the way with it's powers and serves Mario like Link's Navi does. I found the story to be lacking but wasn't overly preoccupied by it. So now you go around with a binder that stores stickers you find and use these stickers to battle. Pretty simple, different and it works well. Sometimes you'll collect real life items like scissors that you can turn into a sticker. Those special items stickers are much bigger and powerful than the average sticker (and take up more places).The battles are a crucial point when it comes to discussing this game. Now you use stickers you collect to fight enemies. You'll use a jump sticker if you want to stomp a goomba for instance. Some of them have very clever and fun cut scenes and l thought there were some good ideas like the Fireball sticker turns you into Fireball Mario for an attack. The fight system may seem odd or unappealing on paper but translates well on the screen. Personally l thought there is nothing wrong with the new fight system. The problem l do have is that the battles are essentially useless to the point that if you can avoid them you should. That's the main downside to an otherwise good game. The EX points and stats are completely gone so there's no reason to fight unless its a cute scene or a boss or to get rid of some of the less useful stickers you possess. At least stats would have been useful to indicate how strong the stickers are but you have to remember them on your own.The game is clever in that its tricky and not necessarily easy to figure things out. It demands more from the gamer than the average Mario game which Paper Mario has always been known for. The boss battles are that way as well, seeing as you have to have an idea what stickers to use and when to use the special item stickers you collect.I miss going around freely, you wanted to talk to characters in previous games, the EX points and stats plus the side quests were always fun adventures. All of that is gone. Basically they took a game that was in a free roaming RPG style based and put a bunch of restrictions that didn't enhance or improve the product in any way whatsoever. Having a sidekick was nice as well, now that's gone and you have the shiny crown to talk to.Overall, Paper Mario Sticker Star is not a bad game at all. It retains the uniqueness of Paper Mario, looks and feels very nice on the 3DS but due to the lack of more traditional RPG elements the hardcore Paper Mario fan will be left with a bad taste in their mouth. My Mario RPG cravings weren't totally satisfied as a fan of the three previous entries. I feel with this game Nintendo tried to appeal more to the younger and casual audiences. There's a lot of fun to be had and it's enjoyable but l expected a little more and it didn't totally deliver. I still think this shows that a true RPG Paper Mario game like Thousand Year Door could be portable and work on the 3DS 3.5 stars","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2014"}

Very simple. Gameplay is straight forward and so are the things that you can do in the game. However, Nintendo managed to craft this into one of the best and most addictive RPG on the Cube or even the current generation consoles.You play as a new guy / gal to town and try to learn your ways through your \"service\" to the shop keeper who virtually own your house. You need to pay off your mortgage by earning money in whatever way possible in the game. It could be picking up junk from the junk area, perform favours to other residents for gifts, selling fish, bugs, fruits and sea shells etc. The kind of bugs and fish you can catch changes with the season. Also you can help build up your museum collection by donnating various \"collecting\" items for the Owl at the museum. You can dig up money or fossils. If you check the town notice board regularly you can find someone buried cool items that you can dig up yourself.The concept is very simple but it is just plain addictive because your town folks not just interact with you but they know each other too. So at times they might be complaining about another person or showing you the pressie that they got from other people. They will also write letters to you while you can write back. If you give them gifts, they can reply with surprising gifts in return.Animal Crossing achieves synergy with other Nintendo products. You can visit an Island where you can have your own holiday house and found things that you can't find in regular towns e.g. Coconut trees are common thing on the island but not in the town.  Further you can connect the game with the eReader and by reading the eCards you can get new patterns (you can also design your own too!) new gifts and new letters from people from other towns. If you have two town data on two different memory cards, you can ride the train to visit your friend's town. Though that would risk your town folks moving to another town. Also the whole family of yours can move into the same town as there are 4 vacancies in one town that all of you can move in and share the magic moment with each other. So mum, dad and siblings can all share the same experience with each other.It's is amazing how Nintendo churns out so much magic from a simple concept like this. It doesn't have super realistic graphic nor does it require you to shed any blood. But it just keeps you on the game for hours and hours. With Animal Crossing Wild World coming out, Nintendo sure would be able to make the Animal Crossing one of its classical franchises.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2006"}

While it is true that Defiance sports better scenery and more exciting combat than it's predecessors, there are still some aspects that need refining. The sound effects seem muffled and too quiet for an action game, and some of the animations of the characters are awkward (when Kain/Raziel take a hit, they just quietly slide across the floor). Some of the backrounds are beautifully detailed (such as the mansion area later in the game), but others are drab, cookie cutter rehashes of previous areas. Other problems such as slow-down and jittery camera movements put a damper on what would have otherwise been an excellent experience. Ultimately, the overall quality of Defiance is inconsistent.

Just make sure you have at least 6 feet or more space","reviewText":"Kinect with Kinect Adventures BundleIn this bundle, you get the Kinect sensor, a wiring adapter for older Xbox 360 consoles which also includes the wire you need for the newer Xbox 360 S(Slim) console, and a sealed Kinect Adventures game.Installing the Kinect sensor on my Xbox 360S 250GB took a few moments, as the cable fits into the console directly without any fuss. Although I purchased my Xbox 360S over 2 years ago, it still had to download an update to the software to work with the Kinect sensor.I decided to buy the Kinect after seeing all the TV advertisements for Nike Kinect, Fitness Evolved, and Zumba Fitness. I took measurements all around the house to figure out a way to have the Kinect work properly. I had to reorganize my office to fit the Kinect sensor. The minimum space requirement of 6 feet is not a joke, although it is able to see most of my movements about 4-5 feet away. However, make no mistake 6 feet is a solid minimum for single player mode. I have not attempted multiplayer, but I hear 8 feet is required along with ample lateral space.Luckily the cord length of the Kinect is more than enough even for more remote Xbox locations. I have my console located farther from the display due to my office layout and the Kinect cable length is more than long enough.The tracking of the Kinect seems ok. I find it unintuitive to navigate the \"Metro\" menu interface, and it often confuses itself as to which of my hands is going up to command it. For instance, in Zumba Fitness Core, if I want to change my speed or step lesson, it will take a moment to see which hand I am raising and it isn't always accurate.I definitely recommend a larger room for the Kinect, you will need at a minimum of 6 feet of space between yourself and the Kinect, and preferably 6-8 feet of width as well. Make no mistake though, it is still a very fun way to play active games and burn some calories in the process. Just learning a few steps in Zumba Fitness Core, I was breaking a sweat! I normally run and cycle outdoors to burn an average of 3000-4000 calories a week, and I wanted to play the Kinect games to work other muscles and have some fun indoors. I have yet to be disappointed.Overall: 5/5 stars, a lot of fun! The drawbacks are that you need a decent size room to play in. Also note that with the next-generation Xbox coming out in late 2013, the Kinect may be obsolete and replaced by new accessories.

Rhodes","summary":"Snake Eater slowly eats away at your time.","reviewText":"Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is a wonder to behold.  It improves among its predecessor greatly but unfortunately, due to the essence of time, doesn't make as big of an impact on the gaming world.  An innovative storyline, and great systems but as with MGS2 it puts far too much emphasis on storyline.Metal Gear Solid 3 is a different sort of game.  It takes place in the 1960's rather than in the millenium like the previous games.  Snake is sent into the harsh depths of a Cuban jungle to rescue a Russian weapons specialists who has created a weapon so powerful it could disrupt the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.  He has to stop this weapon before it falls in the hands of Colonial Volgin, Snake's nemesis in this title.  Anyone who has played previous games in the series knows that there's so much more to it than this. The game is once again full of plot twists that will ultimately blow your mind unlike any other.As with the previous games, the story is told in cutscenes that ultimately deterierate from the gameplay itself.  Most of the cutscenes are fascinating and well thought out but others seem to be there just to be there.  There will be plenty of times when you'll wish some cutscenes would get to the point, especially since the game takes a while to jump into the story and the cutscenes really stack up in the beginning.Gameplay is more influenced and open ended in MGS3.  This is mostly because you're in a more open setting than the corriders of the previous two games.  Rather than being on a base you're in a jungle.  This installment also doesn't have a radar to guide you.However, the game does have new innovations.  For example, even though you don't have a radar, remaining undetected is no harder than it was in the previous game.  There's a percentile to tell you how close you are to be detected and how exposed you are.  In addition, the game also presents different camoflouge outfits that Snake can outfit himself in when in different enviroments.  These outfits can make it so that blending in with the terrain makes the difference between being discovered and not.Another new addition is the \"stamina\" guage and the ability to eat food.  Unlike the past two games in the series, there are no rations scattered around.  You actually have to eat animals in order to survive.  But food doesn't recover your health.  The stamina gauge does.  Whenever your low on health the stamina guage slowly depletes to refill your life guage.  The only way to refill your stamina gauge is to eat animals.  When your stamina gets too low Snake starts to feel the effects such as he can't aim his gun very well (he'll be too shaky) and some animals even give Snake a stomachache.  This is really fun to experiment with (and some of Snake's reactions to the food are funny) but the food system isn't anything to jump about.  It isn't all that innovative.The game's boss battles are perhaps the most fun in the game. The MGS series is famous for having some pretty innovative and epic boss battles.  This one is no exception.  Most boss battles encourage you to experiment with what Snake can do.  This in itself is a fun experience. If you're ever stuck in a boss battle and don't know what to do you can just as easily call your supporters on the codec, mainly Major Zero, who'll give you some handy advice.There's one mini-game extra that MGS3 presents.  The monkey capturing game, which is similar to VR training in helping you get used to the game.  In each level of this mini-game Snake is to go around and catch monkeys.  He's either supposed to knock them out with a stun grenade or shoot them with a special gun.  Once the monkey is knocked out you capture him.  As you get further and further in this mini-game the levels get harder and harder and you have to capture more and more monkeys.The game also repeats many of the gameplay elements found in MGS2.  You can still hold up guards and shoot in first person.  You can also still use the cardboard box to sneak around.  So when you actually get to play the game it's rather fun. There's a bit more things to do as well.  You can use the enviroment to your advantage.  You could shoot a bees nest and have the bees pester your enemies.  You can also pick up poisonous snakes and throw them at your enemies.  The possiblities of torturing your enemies are endless.Replay wise the game is great.  After you beat the game once you get items to start with.  There's also the fact that the game presents many difficulty levels which add to the replay value.  It's also great to play through the game again and fill in plotholes you might've missed.  Also, it's remarkable how much gameplay there really is once you start skipping the cutscenes.However, the game has drawbacks.  As I mentioned, the game becomes tedious in its cutscenes.  The story is intriguing and much better than MGS2 but sometimes you'll wish it would pace faster.  The radio talks (better known as codec conversations) are also tedious at times.  Most cutscenes aren't boring and being able to zoom in on them isn't so bad either.  They're lavish and look incredible and are filled with incredible emotion.  The cutscenes are too close together and take a lot from the gameplay.  Some are just downright meaningless and drag on for far too long.The game also presents too little of a challenge.  Enemy AI is improved but not much better than MGS2.  Most enemies don't do much damage to you, even on the hard mode setting you won't take so much damage.Graphically, MGS3 is great. The jungle is really vibrant and colorful and character models are excellent.  It's visually stunning but doesn't make as big of an impact as earlier games did since there's nothing visually new about these graphics.  Many character models have even been repeated from MGS2.  The frame rate also has a tendency to slow down due to the vibrant colors of the jungle.  Overall though, the graphics are almost no different than they were in MGS2.The sound in this game is to die for! The Snake Eater theme is perhaps the best soundtrack in the entire game.  The music was done by Harry Gregson-Williams, who also did the soundtrack for MGS2 and many Hollywood films.  Voice acting is done great but sometimes feels a bit overdone. I'm happy David Hayter has reprised his role.  He makes a great voice for Snake.  Other voices sometimes don't fit with the character.  Major Zero feels a bit overdone and his voice doesn't even match up with who his character really is. But the voice acting is splendid and among the best in the video-gaming industry.It should take you at least 15 hours to beat the game the first time, assuming you don't skip the cutscenes. It'll keep you busy for the better half of the day.  This is one incredible game that won't soon be forgotten.The Good:+Impressive graphics+Innovative gameplay+A bit more realistic+Good replay value+Incredible storyline+Amusing characters+Good voice acting and musicThe Bad-There are tons of cutscenes that take away from the gameplay.-Many cutscenes are useless-The game doesn't present a major challenge-There's way too much emphasis on plot and not on gameplay","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2004"}

Best gift ever, maybe even the best console ever, but time will tell. I have not been this excited to play a console since the N64 and I am nearly 30 years old and a casual gamer at best. The whole package makes me giddy. Be it playing an arcade game like Resogun, an epic FPS like Killzone or COD Ghosts, or poking around in the PSN Store.I actually get a big smile on my face every time I pick up my PS4 controller. Sure some of this emotion may be in shock and disbelief that I have a system, but this controller fits like a glove. It's like this controller chose me! AND it is rechargeable (suck it Xbox One!).Major props to Sony for launching a great Day-One Console Package. You get one month of Gold, $10 for music, and $10 for their PSN Store. I'm sure I can find a use for all three (and these probably come in standard consoles, but don't ruin it for me). The best part is some of the free games that you can download on the Gold Membership. Resogun is the standout for me and I have already put as much time into playing it as any of the launch titles put together, but you can also get DC Online, and a few others I have not played with yet (by comparison the Xbox One has...2 free games and one is a fitness app, hide your shame!).In terms of Graphics, I can tell a huge difference from the PS3. I play on a 1080P projector or large TV and playing previous systems was too blurry to be fun on the projector, but the crisp images from the PS4 play like any good bluray disc should.I wish the launch games better exemplified the power of the system and stood out from current gen games, but better graphics may be the only noticeable perk. As I'm sure you've heard, PS4's network is subject to crashes, downloaded items seem to come and go or not be playable, and some install/download times can quickly turn into hours. All in a day's work for a new console!In terms of performance, the PS4 is turning in aces. I love that I can go from a game to my homepage with a click of a button and no load time. The system has an idle mode for when you have hours of downloading to go. I wish that I could personalize my homepage, but I'm sure that will come in time. At least they haven't promised something like avatars and not had them available at launch (cough cough Xbox One cough).Unfortunately, I was not nearly as intrigued by the exclusive launch titles or upcoming titles of the PS4 like I was with the Xbox One, but Killzone was a worthy surprise and the other games available on multiple platforms are still fun. Plus, I can play the PS4 on a Vita (if only I had one) and that is a winning combo.The PS4 does a great job of keeping my gameplay simple and for that I say THANK YOU!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2013"}

The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

{"product_name":"B000AB603U","description":"It's the dawn of a new age in real-time strategy (RTS) games. A brave New World is rising--a hostile yet beautiful world, filled with innovative gameplay, new strategic scenarios, eye-searing graphics and much more. Welcome to a world calledAge of Empires III.CampaignIn this action adventure tale of historical fiction, players take on the role of Morgan Black and his family, struggling against the hostile wilderness and a mysterious cult that's crept in from Europe.In a series of 24 scenarios divided into three acts, Morgan Black and his descendants help the Aztecs resist conquest by Spanish conquistadors, pit the French against the British in the French and Indian War and help Simon Bolivar lead revolutions in South America.MultiplayerWhether you're searching for a quick game or hoping to talk strategy with friends online,Age of Empires III's Multiplayer site is your community destination.Here, you can play with persistent Home Cities that gain power and strategic options the more games you play, compete for a spot on dozens of ladders, help organize your clan or chat after a game -- all without leaving the multiplayer portal.Fans ofAge of Mythology's Quick Search can still look for games swiftly, while players looking for something specific can browse game lists to find the set of options that matches their tastes.New Feature--Home CitiesThis revolutionary new feature to the RTS landscape is incorporated into all aspects ofAge of Empires III-- from Campaign to Multiplayer -- and is unlike anything you've experienced before.Much like the persistent character from a role-playing game that encourages you to keep playing, your Home City is an important support system to your efforts in the New World. During a game, your Home City can regularly send you supplies or military reinforcements.You are the leader of your colony, but your success brings glory back to Mother Europe. The more games you play, and the better you do, the more powerful your Home City will become. Every few games, you gain the ability to both upgrade and customize your Home City:Upgrade your city by unlocking new types of soldiers or buildings, or improving those you already have.Broaden your tech tree in whatever direction most fits your play style--invest in warships, native alliances, cavalry, artillery or economy.Customize your Home City by changing the appearance of buildings, the weather or even the types of people who walk, work and perform in its streets.Throughout a game, as well as in between games, you can visit your Home City to watch its citizens go about their lives, get an opinion on how you're doing, plot your next move or just marvel at the beautiful sunset.Full 3-D Graphics, Destructible Environments and MoreWe first set out to reproduce the rich detail ofAge of Empires II: Age of Kings. As we strove to make the fascinatingAge of Empires IIItime period come alive, that goal quickly evolved: We at Ensemble Studios wanted to create the best-looking game ever. From the stunning water effects to the hundreds of units battling on-screen, you'll feel like you're a part of the action in the New World.Tone mapping--This photo imaging technique balances the colors in a scene on the fly. The end result is a rich, warm game where bright colors are vibrantly rendered alongside darker counterparts, such as shadows.Lighting and shadows--The sun is always shining inAge of Empires, so it's important that lighting and shadows be an awe-inspiring experience. Units and buildings cast shadows according to a real sun position, and even cast shadows on each other. High Dynamic Range rendering allows us to represent the shiny glints of sunlight that bounce off highly reflective surfaces.Bump and specular mapping--Water glistens like water. Metal shines like metal. These advanced techniques serve to provide an extra level of rendering detail heretofore unseen in real-time strategy (RTS) gaming.Water--We felt that portraying stunning, realistic water effects in the game was so important that we devoted a programmer to it full-time. You'll find the water rich with details like foam near the shore, accurately modeled water motion, flotsam in rivers and realistic water colors. Plus, reflections change with the viewing angle, the angle of sunlight and the motion of the water. The overall effect is breathtaking.Cliffs and Riverbeds--Instead of just stretching terrain, we built a system to attach geometry to the terrain map to allow for realistic overhangs and steep cliffs, from areas like the American Southwest. This effect is supported on random maps too.CivilizationsBritishQuick access to Settlers gives the British one of the strongest economies in the game. The ability to upgrade two key units -- the Musketeer and Hussar -- make the British military formidable in the late game. The British Home City emphasizes improvements to technology and naval warfare.DutchAlthough Dutch Settlers are limited and costly, their civilization makes up for this economic disadvantage by building Banks and generating coin automatically. The Dutch Home City emphasizes upgrades to defense and economy.FrenchAlthough the French economy starts slowly, the Coureur unit, a Villager with strong fighting skills, makes the French difficult to attack early. The French also have the strongest cavalry unit in the game -- the Cuirassier. Plus, the French are experts at allying with the Native Americans.GermanThe Germans have fewer Settlers and therefore a slower economy. Fortunately, both the Settler Wagon and Uhlan cavalry spawn for free from the German Town Center. Plus, the Germans start with the ability to send Mercenaries from their Home City (long before other civilizations can).Native AmericanEuropean civilizations can learn new technologies and gain troops by forging alliances with the Native Americans. A British player who allies with the Iroquois is essentially playing as two civilizations: the British and the Iroquois.OttomanFor the Ottomans, Settlers spawn automatically from the Town Center. Building a Mosque and conducting research help keep that Settler production steady. Befitting their position straddling Europe and Asia, the Ottomans have more unique units than any other civilization.PortugueseStarting the game with two Town Centers, the Portuguese can quickly produce Settlers, control territory or support their allies. The Spyglass ability allows the Portuguese to easily spy on the enemy. The Portuguese also have a strong navy, strong light infantry and the best Dragoons in the game.RussianStarting the game with extra resources but fewer Settlers gives the Russians the flexibility of focusing on economy or an early raid. Russian infantry, individually weak, are trained in blocks at a faster rate, providing the Russians with the opportunity to overwhelm their enemy with greater numbers.SpanishThe Spanish have a strong military, with both hand infantry and cavalry. Flexibility in early shipments from the Home City give the Spanish the option to attack early or set up for a strong, late economy. Spanish Home City improvements benefit soldiers, buildings and naval units.&nbsp;CombatAge of Empires IIIgives players an amazing amount of control over their side of the battlefield.More to command -- Not only are you in command of large and diverse armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery, but also Native American warriors, mercenaries and tall ships.Multiple formations -- You can assign different formations to your army for different strengths and weaknesses, or have the game automatically choose the most appropriate formation. Examples include:Volley -- ranged infantry, like musketeers, take turns firing at enemies ahead of them.Charge -- your soldiers walk, then run into combat. Cavalry wield sabers, and musketeers fix bayonets. This formation does tremendous damage but makes your soldiers more prone to injury.Bombard -- your soldiers protect the cannons, while the cannons shell enemy ranks. Available only when you have artillery in your army.Battles are easier to follow -- You can still command individual units. But when the units fight in formation, you'll be able to tell exactly who is winning the fight.Real-time physics -- Infantry struck by cannon fire will be thrown like rag dolls, perhaps even over a cliff and into the water. Cannonballs bounce and ricochet.Detailed destructions -- Shingles, shutters and whole towers may fly off a building and interact with the terrain, such as crashing into nearby water. This next generation effect is done on the fly so that each building always has a unique destruction, no matter how many times you see it.Unique animations -- With hundreds of unique combat animations, you'll never see the same battle twice.","reviewerName":"T. Romano \"Avid Gamer\"","summary":"\"Age of Empires III\" Should Have Been Like \"Rise Of Nations\" In Gameplay","reviewText":"First of all, this Age of Empires III game has a lot of potential and promise because it belong in the Age of Empires series.  The other Age of Empires games were great.  This game could of been a great strategy game.  It's not even close.  What a shame.Two good strategy games for the same time period is \"Rise of Nations\" and \"Empire Earth 2\".  Visually, Age of Empires III has better graphics than the other two games.  Gameplay wise, the other two games are whole lot better.  The developer, Ensemble Studios, really screwed up on this game. Ensemble Studios concentrated way too much on the graphics for Age of Empires III and forgot about gameplay.Here are some examples of what I mean.  First, when you play in Skirmish Mode in Age of Empires III, you can't just stay in one Age like you can in Rise of Nations.  Your force to play through different Ages whether you like it or not.  Second, you can't upgrade units like you can in Rise of Nations. Your units always stay the same and look the same.  Third, your explorer in the game can't just explore on his own on any map like in Rise of Nations.  Fourth, there is no World map so there is no countries or territories to conquer like in Rise of Nations.  There is no strategy at all.  Fifth, you can't make any of your units or enemy units be in agressive or defensive stances like you can in Rise of Nations.  Sixth, you can't put units on top of walls to defend forts which is really disappointing.  In fact, your units on the ground can shoot through walls at the enemy and actually hit and kill enemy units on the other side of the wall. I don't understand how they can do that.  Seventh, can somebody explain to me how does a train in the game that appears out of thin air starts out on one end of railroad tracks and moves along the railroad tracks and the train goes to the other end of the railroad tracks and just disappears into thin air? What happen to the train?How this game ever made it through the Beta Stage, before it was put up for sale to the public, with all these bugs in it I'll never know.  This game is way overrated and way overpriced. Don't buy into all the hype about this game.

First off, you get to play as batman and you can do all the awesome stuff batman does right off the bat (haha).  You can glide as much as you want, do awesome attacks, throw as many batarangs as you want, and grapple all over creation... though your arsenal improves as you move through the game, they are natural and you don't not really impeded too much by the game design. On top of that, the controls are nice and tight and the camera is -as far as 3D brawler cameras go- great.The story is very good too, not too cluttered, not overlong, it all feels like a decent story arc from the actual comic (thanks to writer, Paul Dini).  In addition the principle voice actors are from the animated series, so you get some quality voice work, especially from the Joker (voiced by Mark Hamill).In fact, the game plays so smoothly that I didn't realize just how fundamentally sound the game was until I realized I wasn't cursing the design or getting stuck by poor level design or controls.  And more importantly, I was never bored.  Sure there are plenty of items to try and collect (a gaming device I find incredibly dull, regardless of game) but the main plot keeps driving forward and while you may wind up going over the same terrain a few times, the environment changes (due to certain plot elements) so things are still interesting.My one concern is its replayability.  I beat the game in three days of solid play, on normal difficulty (maybe three or more hours at a time).  I probably could have spent a full session or more collecting the random trophies and trinkets and wasted countless hours in the \"challenge\" mode (essentially a race to see how quickly you can clear an area of enemies or get the highest score in a brawl).  but aside from that, it doesn't seem like there is much else going on in the world of Batman.  Since there's no multiplayer, once you've gotten all the achievements, I don't see what the point is to having this game for more than one or two rental periods.is it a well made game?  absolutely.  One of the better single player games out this year.

Play it soon because everyone is going to be raving about it. The SUMMER BLASTER for 2006 is HERE! Basically it is Turok meets Doom 3 on steroids. If you like first person shooters (fps), then getting Prey is probably the next best move you will make next to owning Half-Life 2: Episode 1 and F.E.A.R. The future of fps in space has not outlived its lifespan. If you liked Doom 3, which was the last good adrenaline pumping monster mash on Mars, then you will love Prey. Prey is back to basics again, whopping up the graphics considerably, brilliant lighting effects and a frightening story to boot that isn't afraid to have lots of gore and shocks around the corner. It has a certain feel of HALO about it too with its alien-type weapons. You play an Indian who has been beamed up off his reserve into a spaceship where the aliens are eating up the humans. Prey has awesome in-game action sequences and is quite shocking for the sum of its fiendish parts. You have an old Indian trick out-of-body-experience (OBE) which helps you to reach areas in the rooms you can't normally get to. The rooms also rotate when you shoot switches which offers various level puzzles to get through. Most of the time you totally loose your orientation which makes the play even more fun, especially when portals start opening after room rotations. Duke Nukem lovers will also enjoy the fun on display. An alien's severed hand to open doors is a nice touch. Art Bell's radio talk-show of the aliens invasion is broadcast at various junctions in the game. You don't die either. Well you do, but you are given unlimited chances to regenerate your blue or red health by shooting at blue or red birds in the land of your ancestors. It is a great idea and works. The Boss fights are massive. You even get to fly some aircraft with fire power. Running along anti-gravity tracks around rooms upside down and across walls while unloading your gun into the screaming aliens that have driven people insane who are crying banging on doors is probably reason enough to own the thing if it wasn't for the photorealistic gfx. Slime on the wall has never looked so real. The end boss battles are amazing. The graphics are simply outstanding. This is a high quality fps that deserves your time and CPU power.

Aliens invade the US and it's your job to stop them. It includes some intrigue and surprises, but again, nothing that will make you say \"wow, I'm surprised no one really bought this game; what a great story!\" In fact, the game is horribly short and quite forgettable.I made a mistake when I purchased this. I paid (don't laugh, please!) full MSRP for it ($60 at the time). Boy do I still feel ripped off, years later.The graphics are OK. Bland and nothing that will drop jaws. Character models aren't all that detailed and every enemy, and good guy for that matter, are utterly and completely forgettable.The music is just as forgettable. Sound effects are all mostly canned sounds that really doesn't add anything to the depth. Voice acting is passable at best.Why did I give this game 3 stars? Well, looking back at it now and seeing the current selling price ($12), it's probably worth about that much. It was a mediocre game with little enough to pull it from above the 2 star mark originally. Had I reviewed this when I first purchased it, it would have definitely been a single star, no doubt.If all you're looking for is mindless, forgettable filler between the release of games you really want, your $12 could be spent in a worse way (how many times have you purchased a CD or album and found only one song worthwhile and spent more than $12 for it?). Of course, you may be better served using the $12 as a down payment on a preorder of a great game instead...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000UW21A0","description":"Sony Uncharted: Drake's Fortune 98103 PC Games","reviewerName":"The Rev \"one chill guy\"","summary":"I can't believe this many ppl enjoy this game...","reviewText":"I can't believe this many people like this game. I really enjoyed this game as an adventure game in the first few levels, but then got steadily more frustrating as the game went on. One of the top reviews mentions that it's an action adventure disguised as a 3rd-person shooter, this is pretty much exactly right. The game starts off as fun as an adventure game, running through a beautiful landscape, coming out to a gorgeous beach scene, only to see an even more epic moment, but as the game progresses on it just turns into a frustrating third-person shooter.Some of the biggest issues I had with the game, the weak weapons, you feel like you're doing absolutely no damage, the horrible and frustrating cover controls, whenever I tried to quickly switch cover because I was shot or it had been destroyed, in order to quickly get out of cover you have to roll out, well the roll automatically takes you to cover, whether you want to or not or even if it's the right cover, I constantly had frustrating issues w/ this, another frustrating game mechanic annoyance was with the jet ski levels, frustrating to control while having to dodge objects and kill enemies, now for the level design, oh, my, god, I have played many AAA games but yet to find one that has such terrible level design, I kept getting lost in levels in where to go, I understand it's a puzzle game where you have to figure it out, but it's another to make just where you're supposed to go really hard to find. These are all big issues I had w/ this game but nothing compared to my biggest issue w/ this game, so I would just like to put this in a question, and then ask yourself whether you thought this was actually a good game, so how are there people in caves that are only accessible through a puzzle/secret hidden door that hasn't been opened yet? By opening it you say? So if I'm solving the puzzle to gain entrance, that means the door hasn't been opened, so why am I fighting living people (that btw, you are never really sure of who they work for, *story related*) in 1,000 yr plus old unsolved puzzle caves?? I mean, C'MON!!! Now one of the lesser issues I had w/ the game was the story, I guess I can spoil it since the top useful review already did, it starts as a fun treasure hunting story following the heels of Nathan Drake's father, once you get later into the story you meet these monsters, at this point I couldn't help to say, \"really, you had no where to take the story, so you added in monsters? THIS is the twist in the story?! Lame.\". People also have mentioned how great the graphics are, yes I realize this was made in 2007, but I've seen 360 games with better graphics, ones w/ no graphical pop-ins and jaggies.Overall, w/ ALL these problems w/ the game, this game is definitely not deserving of the high score everyone gives it and I do not recommend it, quick overview, story overall was not that great, pretty good story at first but tends to decline and get worse especially toward the end, gameplay mechanics are awful and annoying, the game's worth a rent but not buy, I will be renting UC2 though.Edit: I also forgot to mention cutscene problems, had this issue a few times, where you would walk into a room and you were supposed to walk up to an object which wasn't always clear which one to go to, so you had to wander around the room just to trigger the cutscene, while the cutscene could have just been triggered more easily by just walking into the room. My last problem w/ this game is more of an annoyance, the ps3 whenever it read my disc it made this loud buzzing sound, so it was a bit of an immersion killer. Another annoying game mechanic I forgot was how you throw grenades, I know Sony wants to take advantage of their 6-axis controller to sell their products, but in order to throw grenades you have to use the motion controls in the controllers to change the distance in the arc of the grenade throw. It could be an interesting feature if in the right game w/ slower enemies, but since it takes you out of cover and they shoot at you while you're adjusting the controller to the exact spot which takes a few seconds, it's an annoyance, it would've been Much better if you could just use the thumbstick to change the arc like in any average cover shooter or at least just let you stay behind cover.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2012"}

Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You'll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that's just the beginning.UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary ConflictThe story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above.Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy FactionThat's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, butHalo Warshas been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle. And the UI is just as intuitive, so whether you're managing a unit of marines or a deadly machine, you can focus on creating a battle strategy instead of worrying about how to overcome a clumsy controller.No matter which faction you choose to play as, you can test your skills against those of other players in online skirmishes that allow up to six players with the New Xbox Experience through Xbox LIVE.","reviewerName":"Malcolm J.

{"product_name":"B00D3RBZHY","description":"Welcome to Redview County, where a street-racing rivalry between cops and racers never stops as both sides compete in an all-out war to take over the social, local and national media and earn the best cars, mods and technology. Risk Everything. Trust No One.","reviewerName":"Sreenadh","summary":"Fun and AMAZING Graphics!","reviewText":"Before Reading this review, just be aware Need For Speed Games fluctuate a lot price wise and will go down in price very quickly in less than 2-3 months. So right now it is $50 on Amazon and I bought mine for $60 when it came out,if you dont need this game asap or for a gift, I would suggest holding off until it comes down to $40 or lessNow on to the game:It&#8217;s hard to hate Need For Speed Rivals.But it&#8217;s also hard to love it.The game brings a solid, core competency in every aspect of its arcade racing base, while introducing interesting new online features.Unfortunately, these features never quite gel to their full potential.Rivals is the latest game in the annualized Need For Speed franchise, and is yet another game that attempts to match the open world-arcade style racing introduced (and some would argue perfected) in 2008&#8242;s Burnout Paradise. This entry also borrows from the more linear Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit from 2010, focusing on the &#8220;rivalry&#8221; between the a group of ultra-elite street racers and their hyper vigilant supercop counterparts.*What this means is that you cruise around an open-ish world as either a cop or a racer playing through a series of challenges either to win races or time trials (as a racer) or to pursue and bust illegal street racers (as a cop). The open world here is fairly limited. The entire thing feels less crafted for exploration and cool stunts, and more as a series of roads that offer scenic backdrops to intense races.On the one hand, this offers a more even experience than many open-world racers. You&#8217;ll never accidentally slam into five sharp turns in a row like you might in Burnout Paradise. On the other hand, the world feels like you&#8217;ve figured it out pretty early on: you know exactly the kind of driving you&#8217;re going to do from one end of the map to the other.And that driving is good! Every car offers an intense feeling of speed, especially when you employ different gadgets and upgrades to make the car go faster. Tropes from early Burnout games such as driving in oncoming traffic to power up your boost meter seem to have simply slipped into the arcade racer language now, and happily work perfectly in the world of Rivals.If you notice I&#8217;m mentioning Burnout a lot, its because it really feels as if the Burnout DNA has been firmly transplanted into the Need For Speed franchise. This is partially because Burnout always had a much stronger sense of identity than Need For Speed ever did, and partially because EA seems to have basically put the Burnout team in charge of the franchise.The process started in 2010 with Hot Pursuit, which was developed by Burnout creators Criterion, and has continued through at least half of the NfS releases since then. The creation of Ghost Games, made up of the bulk of the Criterion studio, for the development of Rivals seems to solidify this.To a certain extent this is a good move. Burnout was always more interesting than the blah-nothing of Need For Speed, and the only notable thing that NfS does that doesn&#8217;t really mesh with the Burnout style is the use of real car models in the game, something which isn&#8217;t that obtrusive.The other somewhat essential part of the Need For Speed formula (in that it appears in about half the games) is the interplay between cops and racers. That trope, fits with Burnout&#8217;s smash and blast style quite well.It&#8217;s in this base level interplay between racers and cops, and racers and other racers that the game shines best.* There are lots of options to interact with other people on the road, and inching your way through the pack, or away from the cops by using a series of different gadgets gives an excellent sense of victory.That said, it&#8217;s a sense of victory which plays out far better against other people than against the numerous computer opponents that dot the virtual world. To fill your game with real-life opponents, Rivals uses a system called &#8220;All Drive&#8221; that loads a session full of online racers into you game. In theory, this is a prime way to juice up the world. In practice the results are more mixed.When you are interacting with other people in All Drive, the experience is great. You are clashing with each other in unpredictable ways and the racing experience is almost always enhanced by it. Yet the world is slightly too big and the number of All Drive players (six) is slightly too small, and for the most part everyone seems to be doing their own thing in their own little corner of the world.What this means is you&#8217;ll often see a human racer screaming down the road the other direction with four cops on his tail, but far less often will you actually race them or chase them. People stick to their own thing mostly, despite the fact that the game rewards you for being near other players and you don&#8217;t have the option of turning the PlayStation camera&#8217;s mic off while racing.( If you have the PlayStation Camera and don&#8217;t want other people in the All Drive hearing you, a quick way to &#8220;mute&#8221; yourself is to create a &#8220;party&#8221; with only you in it. You won&#8217;t be able to hear anyone else and no one else will be able to hear you)And, unfortunately, because All Drive doesn&#8217;t use dedicated servers on PS4, whenever the host player quits, the rest of the racers in the session have to go through a 20-40 second &#8220;host migration process.&#8221; This means that every 10- to 15-minutes or so, the game will just stop for 20-40 seconds, even if you are in the middle of a race or chase.***Which is to say that despite the fact that the core driving is enjoyable in Rivals, you really kind of have to work for your fun in the game. Which is a shame, because when everything is working all together, you&#8217;re streaking through a pack of racers with two cops on your tail and then just barely dodge through another player&#8217;s high speed chase at an intersection, the whole thing feels transcendent.This is a good base. If Ghost continues on this path, Need For Speed might actually have an identity to build on in this brave new console generation.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2013"}

The choice is yours ininfamous.caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Everyman turned superhero Cole.View larger.Devastating electricity-based powers.View larger.Go anywhere open-world design.View larger.An organic urban environment.View larger.StoryEmpire City was a run of the mill metropolis, until one day a massive explosion rips through six square blocks of its bustling downtown real-estate, seemingly leveling everything and everyone in its path. Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

Events will unfold based on the role players take in them, creating broader reactions in the city&rsquo;s people and environment.","reviewerName":"smullins","summary":"Must have on ps3","reviewText":"Sure the sandbox genre has been polluted the past couple years, but inFamous is a title that stands out above the rest. With an amazing story, gorgeous graphics, excellent pacing, and tons of content and things to do, this is one title you won't want to put down till you beat it. And you'll probably want to replay it again in the future.What this game gets right:By far, this is one of the best stories in a video game that I have experienced. Its believable, its engrossing, it could have been a movie (but not in the way that MGS4 could have been a movie, what garbage that game was...). You will get sucked in and believe everything that happens to the characters. Except for the main character's batman like voice, the voice acting is top notch. The story cut scenes are done comic book style that really has amazingly striking visuals, proving you don't have to spend months on realistic computer animation to make something visually stunning.The pace of the game play is great. You start out with a power or two on one \"island.\" As you restore power to parts of the island and defeat enemies, you are rewarded with new powers and points to purchase new powers or upgrades. There are three islands total so you know how quickly you are making it through the game. This is great because you are not overwhelmed with a set of powers that you'll forget to use. And with the point system, you decide what powers you want to acquire/upgrade. Do you want to make it easier to recharge your juice to perform more powers? or upgrade your lightening bolt to make it more offensively powerful? or beef up your crowd control powers (such as the grenade)? or increase your damage reduction received or size of your shield? Its all there, you decide what kind of style you want to play and what powers you require.The visuals are well amazing. This is a gorgeous game that really draws you in.The game actually made it fun to climb things, unlike other games that make climbing a chore. You'll be surprised how quickly you can scale building and hop from ledge to ledge.Trophies are like crack for me, and inFamous is one giant crack rock. I collected all 300 battery cores just for the trophy, it was fun.The entire city is crawling with baddies. If you complete a side quest, it will \"clean up\" that portion of the city, removing re-occurring bad guys from that part of town. This not only makes it easier to traverse the city but really makes you want to complete all the quests to see that 100% clean city.Overall difficulty was good, not too easy, not too frustrating. The game definitely requires you to use your abilities effectively. I had to replay the prison sequence over and over till I finally beat it, only to realize I had just gotten my shield power and if I had only remembered to use it the fight would have been much easier.What this game could improve on:I experienced a glitch with one quest where I guess I didn't walk exactly where I was supposed to. I followed this ghost all the way through this huge section then got to the end and it just disappeared. There was supposed to be a boss battle but I had to go all the way back to the beginning of the sequence for it reload. Cost me over an hour trying to figure wtf was going on before I finally googled the problem. Stupid glitch.The morality system in this game should go crawl into a hole and die. Do you want to burn kittens alive or discover the cure for cancer? The options are so black and white, so polarized that its no question of morality unless you're clinically insane. I wish games would actually present real morality dilemmas instead of boiled down ridiculous scenarios that take you out of the amazing game play.As you can see, there's quite a lot this game offers, and very little it doesn't get right. I think I spent over 30 hours on this game, doing all the side quests and some good ole trophy hunting. Honestly, there is nothing quite like the first time you unleash electric chaos in this game - makes me want to put this game back in just thinking about it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2010"}

Johnson","summary":"Updated review: No longer completely boring and damaged","reviewText":"I admit I wanted this game for Xmas because I mistakenly believed it was an online RPG game. It had all the elements of a potentially great online experience but sadly it is single player. What's the point in going through the trouble of picking a race, detail looks, skills, et al if you can't even see your character because it's in 1st person view with some fighting cut scenes? Anyway, I came here to see the reviews and I can't believe how many one stars this game has. Actually, it makes me glad they did not go the online route because they can't even seem to release a single player game right.I also own this game for the PS3 and the game lagged horribly at the VERY BEGINNING while my character was standing in line before I even got the chance to select the race, details, et al. The lag lasted almost a full minute before correcting itself and I didn't have to restart. I played the first part and honestly I wasn't that into it any way. I thought I would play through it before returning it to Gamestop for credit thinking that even though it did not turn out the way I wanted I may find things about it I love, but yeah right. Like I would mess up my console just to suffer through this game in hopes of liking it. Hopefully I'll find another game with my credit that's worth it.Update notes 4/16/2013: I have decided to give the game another chance as I was told that the issues I've had were now fixed. I don't regret my initial decision to trade this game in as I got a few good games I've really enjoyed. However, now that I can actually play this game I have to say that my opinion has changed lot and for the better. I was abe to take the time to learn the mechanics of the game, such as switching from first to third person point of view. I admit I was misinformed about the online play but I don't mind at all. Lately I've been playing plenty of rpgs on the PS3 that are done well and I love them the way they are and the same can be said for this one. So far I'm having a lot of fun and even bought the Hearthfire DLC. There are a ton of missions, I have no idea what is the main story mission from the side missions but I don't mind as it's easy to skip over what I don't want to do. I wish I can cancel some quests in my log as I like to keep it to a bare minimal but after I do one quest another one just freaking pops up so when I do get a reprieve from getting an automatic mission I jump on it and refuse to talk to any of the npcs out of fear that I would get another mission piled on top.I love buying homes in this game but making money is a a little tough as not every store buys everything I have which sucks because I have stuff sitting in my chests that could make me a ton of money if someone would just buy it all.Romances: Shallow and boring. At least they have an explanation as to why they suck but that is no excuse. I get that the world they are living in is dangerous and therefore they don't have time for a long courtship but no hugs or kisses from my spouse suck, he never even sleeps in the bed either. Maybe I am spoiled by other rpg romances that are full of depth but I wonder why I even bothered getting married in this game besides the 100 gold a day perk.NPC Followers: This is my biggest issue with the game right now. You only get one at a time unless it is story related and they just plain suck! They keep stopping randomly which means they stay far behind and can get lost, they die easily, I'm not even sure if they can wear the armor pieced given to them, I think my housecarl did equip a new weapon I gave her and possibly some gauntlets but not a chest piece I gave her. It doesn't matter anyway cause she's so useless. I don't see much of a reason to even bring a follower unless you hope they can do some damage in a fight. I admit Farkas does quite a bit of damage when he actually decides to participate.Overall I'm still enjoying myself, The game only froze twice on me but it was nothing major like before.Update note 4/18/2013: Okay, I have put several more hours into the game and I have built my house in Hearthfire. I love adopting. So far it is sadly the only thing I enjoy doing right now. I am reluctant to do any more quests because about 98% of them take place inside of some sort of tunnel, ruins, cavern, or cave. It gets so annoying having to travel through a winding cave for nearly every single quest in this game. It gets annoying and tedious. For once I would like an entire story that doesn't require me to travel all the way to the other side of the map and into a damn cave. I did a quest recently where I poisoned the honey mead and I couldn't believe that anyone would keep their vats about a mile deep under their shop with spiders and a crazy man hiding in the tunnels. Seriously! I want to try buying the house in Solitude just to have a large city home but the moment I went to the blue palace they started talking about trouble inside of some cave and I turned around and walked out. I want to complete this story but seriously all of these tunnels, ruins, and caves are ticking me off and I have to drop a star cause this isn't fun at all. Maybe if I had a team of good followers with me who are actually useful and didn't die at the drop of a hat I would endure all these freaking tunnel quests but this is ridiculous. I won't be buying another dlc if all I have to look forward to is another set of quests in the same location types. Heck no.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2011"}

Rhodes","summary":"4.5 Stars: A Fantastic Enhanced Update of a Fantastic RPG","reviewText":"Pros:+Updated visuals+Fantastic soundtrack+Plenty of things to do off the beaten path+Fun gameplayCons:-It's nice to have updated graphics, but there are some gameplay elements that might've benefited as well.For many RPGers, Dragon Quest has a special place in their heart. Unfortunately, two Dragon Quest games never made it to the states. Those games are finally getting that chance to shine, with Dragon Quest V landing down now, and Dragon Quest VI landing down sometime in the near future. This is the first time many gamers have gotten to experience Dragon Quest V, and it turns out to be one of the better DS RPGs out there. Unfortunately, there's still a matter of how long it'll take for Square-Enix to update the Dragon Quest series.As usual, there's not too much to expect from a story in Dragon Quest. It's a run of the mill story. Dragon Quest has primarily been about gameplay. Even after so many years, Dragon Quest is still an incredibly fun game to play, despite being dated. The series basic crux for battling hasn't changed since the first game. It's incredibly simplistic, looks incredibly dated, but still plays incredibly well.You'll go exploring dungeons and getting into random battles. When in battle it takes place from a first person perspective where you select commands and watch them get acted out. While your enemies have more movements, which is a far better upgrade from the still life shots of the Super Famicom original, you won't actually see your character run up and physically strike the enemy. After so long, it would be nice if Dragon Quest really made it's battles come alive. This isn't in 16 bits, this is now on the Nintendo DS and has gotten a few notable upgrades. Unfortunately there are some upgrades that it didn't receive.As much fun as battling is, the random encounter rate within the dungeons is through the roof. Dragon Quest has always been a series that has forced you to battle, but it can be annoying to be getting into a battle every few seconds. This is fun for many RPGers, but it's not quite as fun when you tire of battles. The dungeons aren't too big, at least, but they feel much longer. Along those lines, the game is not exactly easy. You'll have to do quite a bit of level grinding throughout the game. This can be a drag for those who began playing RPGs later on in the Playstation era where you could slog through just about anything at almost any level. Dragon Quest V doesn't let you get away with that. If you're having trouble in a dungeon... it's because your level isn't high enough. Level grinding can be fun, but it's also hard to deny that for some this will be a repetitive task.More old school appeal that Dragon Quest V appeals to is the idea that the game rarely (if ever) tells you where to go next. In order to figure some things out, you'll have to talk to various NPCs in various towns. While this might annoy some gamers, it really opens things up to exploring. If you have a chance to jump a little further ahead, there's no real penalty for doing it. It's a little easy to get lost, but if you're willing to talk to a few NPCs, it becomes very easy to find your way.  There are also several things to do off the beaten path, and even more to do after the game is completed.  Dragon Quest V can easily keep you busy for several hours.An update that the series could probably benefit from is making a much simpler menu to navigate. Dragon Quest has yet to make it's menu system simpler to navigate and manage. It's a little better on the DS, but interface in RPG menu systems have been more user friendly since the early 90's. It can take more time than it needs to equip and unequip a character.  Dragon Quest V's menu system isn't that different from the first game in the series, and it would've been easier to navigate had it adopted some of the mechanics of Dragon Quest VIII's.  It won't bother you that much, but with giving the visuals and sound such a huge update, it would've been nice had other dated areas gotten that same update.In terms of the updates it did receive, however, they're overall very nice. There's some well written dialog in special dialects. It might annoy some gamers, but it really makes the world come alive. The music, as usual, sounds fantastic. It's been remastered and it sounds better than most other DS games out there. Among the most obvious of the updates are the visuals. It's very similar to how Dragon Quest VII looked on the original Playstation. You might see some denizens or objects that look a little pixelated, but it still looks good. The backgrounds in many of the dungeons or in the battles look divine.Aside from a couple of things that didn't get updated, Dragon Quest V is still a solid RPG. It's got plenty of gameplay, and it has plenty of extra things to do off the beaten path. Not to mention that there are a few new goodies thrown in for good measure. If you're a Dragon Quest fan, Dragon Quest V is a fantastic experience. You'll quickly overcome some of the issues and settle in for a long and rewarding gameplay experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B003P9C6QY","description":"","reviewerName":"dgdbear \"David\"","summary":"Red Faction takes a 180","reviewText":"THQ took a much different approach with Armageddon by creating a well made over-the-shoulder shooter with some intense action. They traded in the open-world RPG experience I loved in Guerrilla for a tighter level-based shooting experience. Because of that, replay value is low. The other online modes like surviving waves of enemies are all played out, and you'll get sick of that real fast. The other 'Ruin' mode has 5 maps that you can beat in 30 mins. I missed Guerrilla's multiplayer format.Armageddon is a shooting game, not an RPG. It feels like Dead Space in how you view the shooter, but you are much more well rounded instead of having just some sticky bombs and a maul. I found myself using the new Magnet Gun the most. Point it first at a large metal object like a car, then aim the 2nd shot let's say 100ft away at a group of enemies in the building, and watch the car fly 100mph into the building destroying the foes and everything in its path. This created some very unique ways to dispose of foes and pretty much everything in the level. It doesn't use ammo, so I had this nasty thing equipped all the time.You also have a repair gun, used by holding LB. Anything destroyed can be repaired by this, simply to be destroyed again of course. So if you blew up the bridge to your area, just rebuild it like brand new. You can rebuild broken stuff and upgrade stations. Collect salvage to upgrade and equip/apply some sweet perks and upgrades.You also have Jedi-like abilities and can manipulate energy by creating \"force waves\" to destroy anything in a path, launch foes in the air to pick off like Bulletstorm, or create a shield to stop incoming fire, etc. SO combine your Jedi powers with a boatload of new guns and explosives to create an unbelievable amount of destruction and explosions. And even with 1000 things all blowing up, I never had one freeze, blip, or lag from trying to keep up. Nice job THQ.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2011"}

Wertz \"Imautobot\"","summary":"OMG, Custom Soundtrack Fail!","reviewText":"As far as being an evolutionary jump from Grand Turismo 5, this is anything but.  The graphics don't seem to have improved much if at all.  The load times are a little better.  The menus are slightly less confusing.But....And this is a BIG but...  Just as in Gran Turismo 5, if you set the game up to play your own custom playlist, it's a total crapshoot as to whether it actually plays your music.  This is HUGELY frustrating because a decent soundtrack can make or break a game.  More frustrating is the random nature of when it actually loads your music.  I have (at times) had to stop a race, then restart it as many as 3 times before my tunes start.  When they don't load, the game defaults to it's own (awful) soundtrack, which if you could tell by my anger, is a sad attempt as racing music.  When I eventually did get my tunes to work during a Championship, they only played for the first 2 races, then it went back to GT music for the 3rd race.  WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?  GT5 suffered the exact same flaw, I expected it to have been addressed in this version.  This really kills the experience that I want to have.  How hard can it be to make a game on PS3 do something that works so perfectly on the Xbox 360?Also, this game as only been out for about 2 months, and when you first put it in it has to download a 1.2GB update.  What The Heck!  Why should it need to download such a massive update?  Once you download that, and you think you can play it, the game then says it needs to download another update.  Thankfully that one is less than 100MB.  But geeze.  Then the game keeps popping up all this &#34;how to play&#34; crap, which if I were a noob, would be helpful, but it's annoying like the tutorial level on FarCry Blood Dragon.  The game should ask the player if they want this direction, because you'll be trying to navigate the menu and it pop up with &#34;.... I already know&#34; kind of stuff.If the price is $40 or less, and you don't already own GT5, then go ahead and get this.  But don't pay more than that.  Either wait for the price to drop, or buy GT5, It's less than $20, and feels much like the same game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2013"}

Ive played alot form command and conquer 1, through dawn of war(all of them). Im running Vista now with a new PC and was happy to see that there were no compatibility issues; i didnt even have to install the first patch. It ran right after installing perfectly fine. One thing I do suggest that you have a decently powerful pc, at least a 256MB graphics card, 2ghz processor, and 1gb of ram 2 is better.Not only are the graphics unreal and the fighting fast and intense, the possibilities are endless via that everything is destructible. EX. Wall in your way no problem, take your 82nd airborne troops and have them throw a satchel charge at it, problem solved. One of my favorite things to do is to zoom in over the shoulder of one of my snipers as he takes down unfriendlies. The explosions are realistic, and the sound is also stunning, from gunfire to hearing one of your squads cursing at eachother as they run through a hail of gunfire,(dammit johnson i thought i f'in told you to tie your laces!) Plenty of cursing at the enemy too.One of the great things about the game is in multiplayer; be it skirmish or online, the two sides are very different. For example the german pioneers are lb for lb stringer than the american combat engineers, although the amrican engineers can set demo on bridges and buildings to destroy them while the pioneers cant. Also the system of building while the americans can generally build all their buildings from the start, the germans have to research escalation at their hq to build some more advanced buildings. Also in veterancy the americans gain it by causing casulties to the enemy or by setting traps and etc., where as the germans have to research veterancy at their base.One gripe is the realism on the tanks, the most powerful tank of ww2 was the tiger. Another powerful tank is the panther, and youll see american shermans going toe to toe with a panther, in realism definately wouldnt happen, alot of sherman tanks couldnt even penetrate the armour of a tiger and some panthers. Also sometimes when you order more than one vehicle unit to move sometimes they run into eachother, but other than that' great game.Arguably one of the greatest PC games of All Time!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2007"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Mitch","summary":"Not Better Than The First, But Still Good","reviewText":"This game definitely doesn't beat the predecessor, F.E.A.R.

It will get you hooked from the first time you get your hands on your computer. You can;t stop playing. When I played on easy, I beat the game in one day. Now, hard was different. Anyway, the graphics on the highest settings are great. You can see details on every building and just like what one of the reviewer said, you can see the shinying in the water. The sound is just as great. The background sound makes it feel more realistic than other WWII games but not realistic as in real life. It still comes close. You're allies are interacting with you as you play through out the missions and the nervousness when you are advancing by yourself after your teammates are all dead. In advertisements and stuff, it says that &quot;In War, No One Fights Alone&quot; ,but They do make you fight alone in the Damp, Ship and few other missions. But I like that feeling of nervous. When you are in it, you want to get out of it quickly but after you finsh it, you are eager to play that same type of mission again and you feel good for finishing the mission. In the mission that I wanted to play so bad since I saw the PCgamers preview, Stalingrad was the only mission that was a little dissapointing but special. Only reason why I was a little dissapointed was because I couldn't shoot because I never got a gun. At the same time that mission seemed most realistic and good. In the boat, you see sequences and it's great. Some guy jumps off the boat because he's scared and he gets shot for jumping off the boat. I also like the fact that the missions were based on the facts. I recently read one of these WWII books and it said that Russians fought with no arms (guns) in Stalingrad because they lost most of their arms in previous battles. Back to the game, this game was just super amazing. The system requirments are important because if you want to feel that realism, you need at least Pentium 3 1.6GH, 512mb ram, and at least Geforce 3 or radeon 8500 and above to play it on highest settings. Only con was multiplayer which could have been better but wasn't as good as Day of Defeat or Battlefield. In one sentence, this game has the best WWII single player missions ever and this game is the game that got the closest to the real life WWII action. This game is must be owned by WWII gamers and possibly, any and all gamers. (I also recommend Medal of Honor series)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2003"}

For the most part I agree but I think it needs to be quantified.  Is there any part of TOB that's going to blow you away? No.  Everyone's played HL2 before so it's nothing too new.  Mind you, it was cool on the PC when it came out a few years ago but it's the still the same on the 360.  The other games are fun too but by themselves they aren't anything tremendous.  The graphics aren't exactly knocking the walls down either.  But don't that that turn you off.  What it does have is a hugh amount of good solid content all rolled together.  You just can beat the value TOB offers of the serios or casual gamer.  There really something for everyone.

The critics didn't care for it but if you know me I hate the critics. I remember renting this game a long time ago at 1st it was frustrating & I will admit that I have had to skip a few levels cause of the difficulty so yes I cheated. So once I learned how to do a lot of the stuff more & more I really started to like this game I even got into the show cause of this game. Even the cast from the show provided voice work Kiefer Sutherland of course Reiko Aylesworth Carlos Bernard, James Dale & Dennis Haysbert. So this story is you start off at these docks responding to a call that there is a bomb on 1 of the ships that you have to defuse so that leads into a mini game where you have to defuse it. ThenC  T  U Agent Chase Edmends from The DC branch comes into the picture he alerts The LA branch that a group of people are plotting to assassinate The VP of The US. He decides to go to LA. Meanwhile you get to play as Jack Bauer you get to have driving levels where you chase down this guy named Robert Daniels to this hideout. So you have to shoot through these henchies there a some mini games where you have to unlock doors & Michelle Dessler keeps in contact with you through out some of the levels. You have to take out the people protecting Daniels then you get to interrogate him & these interrogations are fun. You find out about these snipers on the roof & you have to pick them off. Then you get to play as Tony Almeida & I have never completed the level where you chase the guy in the alley. You go to these run down apartments & you take this guy in for questioning. Then you get repots of a bomb on The Subway Station. You find a body as it turns out the guy Almeida took into custody is just there to wreck C  T  U an EMP blast then a guy named Peter Madsen shows up he is a former agent that turned on C  T  U & he has a history with Jack Bauer. So you play as Michelle Dessler & you have to get Kim Jack's Daughter to a room called M3. Kim makes it but Michelle is caught. So Kim contacts her dad Agent Almeida needs Kim to get hard drive that has a lot of information onC  T  U there operatives. So you have to play as Kim & when I 1st played this level like 5 years ago the part where you have to get the key card in Almeida's office I would get caught again & again. Anyway after that Kim gives herself up & the hard drive cause she saw Madsen shoot a Tech Worker. So you get to play as Jack Bauer you have to get to the roof & shoot down a Helicopter. So then you play as Chase Edmunds where your undercover & you have to get Madsen to a get away car this level can be hard really hard cause you are presued by the police so if you ever play this game this level you will probably have to restart it a few times. Then Madsen starts messing with Jack Madsen has his daughter so he makes Jack go to The N  S  A Building & give him classified information. Which gets Jack in trouble with his Superior Ryan Chappelle. Meanwhile you have this group attack Madsen's hideout during the shoot out a dycriptor is damaged Madsen sends Chase to this lab to get a duplicate. This dycriptor will set off bombs at all the major focal points in LA where it will cause an Earthquake. Unrealistic yes but it's a video game. You find Madsen's ex wife she tells you about this man named Del Toro so you have to go shoot up his drug house & kill him. You find your way to Madsen's base where Kim is being held if you make it out you're chased by Madsen's henchies & you have to get back to C  T  U. Then Jack & Tony lead a some teams you play as Almeida 1st then Jack Dessler tells you that there is still 1 bomb left there isn't enough time to defuse it then a big Earthquake hits LA. Madsen kidnaps Kte Warner Jack's Girlfriend. Then you have this crazy guy take The Governor hostage cause he cut his health benfits & his son is sick so you play as Almeida & have to talk this guy out of doing it. You find out that The Governor isn't so innocent he is involved with terrorist activities. Chase helps you get the hardrive with all the vital C  T  U info on it. The Governor is killed later on where you are introduced to Max basically he's the main bad guy he was working with these terrorists a few years ago Kate's Father stopped these weapons from being taken out of the country. Max had to see his family killed 1 by 1 so he's trying to get revenge on The US. It leads up to the final 4 missions on the docks to stop Max & Peter Madsen. So I know I skipped some stuff my only complaints are I have to skip some levels & the combat system could've been better if you have the patience to learn how to play it give it a shot & you can buy this game new for a cheap price.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00083G5BW","description":"For the first time in 10 years, the Madden NFL Football franchise has revolutionized its passing game-giving Madden NFL 06 the most groundbreaking and innovative offensive arsenal ever created. The new QB Vision Control lets you scan the field, look off defenders, and make perfect throws within your quarterback's unique field of vision. QB Precision Placement allows you to put the ball exactly where you want it. Lead the receiver to an open area, throw it behind him so he can come back to it or throw a jump ball and let him go get it.","reviewerName":"Rex","summary":"Why?","reviewText":"When I got Madden 06, I was expecting something new now that EA has destroyed the competition. But now they take Madden 2005 and patch it on to this game, add some new features and update the rosters and attributes. First, you know this is a patch of Madden 05 when you see the same bugs. When someone is traded or signed as a free agent, there career stats are erased, and most defensive players have no career stats. Also in the instant replays, there are wierd noises just like last years game.The 2 new features is the QB Vision and superstar mode. First is QB vision. The few times I tried this feature, I was sacked. It takes too much button mashing and waiting when the blitz is coming to master. Good thing it can be turned off. The other new feature is Superstar Mode. You choose your parents using DNA, then you lead the life of a star player, from movies appearences to interviews about Madden 06. People are knocking it, but I think it is a fun new mode to a boring engine. Also,  the commentators will put you to sleep.As for rosters and ratings, they are pretty accurate. Ricky Williams isn't in the game, but you can just create him and make his stats from last years game. Mysteriously, Ty Law cant get on the Jets, and since I love the Jets, this represents a huge problem.To sum it all up, Madden is Madden and the gameplay is great, but one more year and it will be played out. Also, we see a trend used by EA. Take the year befores game and patch it to the current game, update the rosters and attributes and add a new mode. They did it to NCAA 06, MVP 05 and will do it to NBA and the NHL game. Lets hope in next years lineup they will take a risk and mix up the gameplay and features a little bit, because everyone and their mothers are tired of paying $50 dollars for last years game.UPDATE: After playing the X-Box version, I am selling or throwing this out. The loading times are slow as you know what and the game freezes alot. Also, why does every quarterback fumble like crazy? I was playing as the Falcons in an exhibition and Vick fumbled 5 times. If I can, I would change this to 3 stars from 4.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2005"}

It has a storyline that's about shadow governments and alien invasions. I remember seeing the commercial when the game came out, and thinking, \"Wow, that sounds so awesome.\" But I'm not an enormous FPS fan, so I waited for a good price drop on picking it up.The Campaign of The Conduit is pretty solid. The voice-acting is very good, even on par with Goldeneye (the Wii game, not the movie). The gameplay is standard first person shooter stuff, but a large part of the campaign is spent destroying enemy spawn points. It's fun, particularly when those aliens are well entrenched. There's no real comparison to be made, but I'd say the bulk of The Conduit reminds me of Gauntlet, if only because of spawn destruction.The storyline is pretty good, and I was surprised by a plot twist or two. If you've watched a season of The X-Files or a few conspiracy theory documentaries on The History Channel, though, don't expect to hear any new ideas. The Conduit tries to deliver that shadow government/alien invasion story you've heard before, but in an enjoyable video game format. It largely succeeds.The graphics look pretty good. Everything is pretty well detailed, by Wii standards. A lot of games don't have good resolution or whatever when you get close to an object, but The Conduit does. What's really impressive (especially if you've played Goldeneye, recently) is how good the online mode's graphics look.Music: I don't recall being annoyed by it. The main theme of The Conduit sounds like it could be the intro to a sci-fi investigation show.Online: Occasionally, it's hard to get a match going (at this point in The Conduit's life. Wii online, at large, is probably on the way out.), but once you do, The Conduit shows off again. It hasn't reinvented the wheel or anything, but the online mode is good. My only criticism lies not with the game, but with its players. (heh) Almost every single time I'm playing, we end up voting for Explosive weaponry set. Seems to be a favorite, but anyway, it allows for 12 player combat, two more than Black Ops. Very nice.The only flaw with The Conduit is that it's only pretty great and not amazingly awesome. I whole-heartedly recommend it to sci-fi/conspiracy theory fans, if only for the campaign mode.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2012"}

The good about New Vegas?  The game is like riding a bike, it comes back instantly.  The game interface, the style of play, the types of missions, combat, and weapons all feel like Fallout 3.  Some complain about the depth of the story line.  I have not played the whole way through but remember similar feelings at the end of Fallout 3 -- where it ended and the game was pretty much over, not even allowing you (at the time) to come back and play more.  Instead you had to back up to prior save without the ending in place.  Of course that was fixed with subsequent releases.  New Vegas brings familiarity with some new characters.  If you liked Fallout 3, you will like New Vegas.Now the bad.  All the Steam discussion aside, upon first start and immediate updating, New Vegas had frame rate problems in almost any resolution and quality.  It was virtually unplayable.  NPC's had time lags.  Just moving around was painful.  Typing the words, Fallout New Vegas slow, into a google search quickly revealed why. A graphic problem related to DX10 implementation. The fix? Drop a easily found and downloaded dll file into the New Vegas file folder.  The file forces New Vegas to detect a different video card than the one you may be playing, one that forces DX9 implementation. Once done, everything plays properly at the highest settings with no lags at all.  Graphically, I cannot see any significant differences, after (or before) this change in New Vegas.  There are no obvious differences in graphic quality from Fallout 3.  But seriously, why do we have to fix such things?  Bethesda or Obsidian did not drop the install disk into any number of XP, Vista, or Windows 7 computers to see what would happen?  Me, I am playing on Vista (x64) and a Nvidia GS9800.... a combination that seems to run pretty well on just about anything I choose to play.  To have to fix the program right off the bat just seems like poor product management. On the good part of bad, despite many complaints about buggy behavior, I have not seen anything significant, and certainly no BSD or other recoverable shutdown errors.  Fix the game yourself, then enjoy smooth sailing (?).Highly recommended if you liked Fallout 3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2010"}

When I finally found and picked up a copy I found it had hooked its claws into me even more. So when Drakengard 2 came out I of course picked up a copy. Unfortunately it wasn't as good as the first Drakengard, but it was nonetheless still a good entry to the series. Many many years later I picked up Nier, which was associated with Square Enix, but received extremely harsh reviews.Around the same time I found that Cavia, a name I remembered well from the Drakengard series, had worked on Nier, which got me wondering what other games they had had a hand in. I had played Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex for the PlayStation 2 years before, and ended up trading it in due to what I found were clunky controls (if I remember correctly). But as I was looking through the list I saw one game I had seen before and skimmed over due to the price and cover.Once I released Cavia had had a hand in Bullet Witch I decided to pick up a copy once I found it at a good price (and with the manual and original box). Having found a copy for under $5, I figured it was definitely worth a try.Bullet Witch is a rather interesting game. The controls are annoying but as I played I couldn't help but think of Bayonetta. Both characters have a certain sex appeal, but both are extremely deadly. One might be ashamed to admit that they not only played, but owned their games, but both contain fairly good games, even if it's significantly easier to tell that Bayonetta is one.In Bullet Witch you control a woman who carries with her a gun larger than herself. As you progress you can switch between 4 guns total, each with their own uses. You also gain certain magic spells, and can increase your own abilities, although its limited to increasing your health and magic regeneration.There are a total of six stages with each lasting between 10 minutes to an hour, depending upon how lost you get and how many times you've played a level. There are five or six different difficulty settings, with only the lower three available at the start. Achievements are available for beating the game under each difficulty, but since they do not stack you can look forward to playing multiple times (if you care about the points). However, each time you start a game your previously unlocked skills and remaining points carry over, so you could even play the first level over and over again (10-15 minutes a shot) to build up your skills early.As noted above the controls are fairly clunky, which is unfortunate since it's a third-person shooter with some fairly fast enemies. The lighting can also be tricky at times, and there's no good indication of the fact that you're near death, so expect that surprise.The general suggestion is that you play your first time on easy, since achievements don't stack and the game is a little ... clunky, so that's exactly what I did. I played the first level a number of times as well, on both easy and normal, but I finished my first game on easy. All told I probably put 6 or 7 hours into the game (thus far).The story isn't horrible, and is actually about what I expected after playing Cavia's other games. Since you're introduced to it within the first few minutes of the game, I'll go ahead and say that I didn't quite catch why she hears a voice, but I think that's the only oddity (although it could be left unstated for a reason).Finally, I really enjoyed the graphics in the game. It certainly shows its age, and is probably on par with PlayStation 2 graphics, but because of the nature of the story I have no issues with that.While it's certainly not the greatest game ever, it's generally not that bad. I'll play it again and beat it at least on normal, and could easily see myself playing it even after that. The game also received a good deal of DLC, all of which is extremely cheap, as in free to 25 cents. The latter is actual maps, which adds a pretty good deal of content for a fairly low price.For these reasons I'm going to give Bullet Witch 4 of 5 stars. One could perhaps argue that it only deserves 3 stars, but I think the game tells a good story and once you release the shortcomings (using maps removes the pain of wandering around in the larger maps), it's not that bad at all, and offers a good deal of content for the current price.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2011"}

The graphics are much improved over Morrowind, as well as they added more landscaping features such as tuffs of grasses. Water acts more realistically, such as when your swimming you actually leave a V in the water behind you. HOWEVER, they didnt do anything to fix the two problems that plague most all 3D games: the textures are 2D, and there is no collission detection for the textures. Stuff like the grasses and tree leaves are in 2D, which makes the game appear cheap. With no collission detection, things like grasses and banners and the like go right though other \"solid\" textures like trees, which also makes me believe that the game was quicky put together with no attention given to fine details. Also, they never fixed the main problem that plagued all TES games: weapons go though solid objects. If you have a long bladed weapon, or any weapon really but is more noticable with long blades like Dai-Katinas or Claymores, you can swing them through solid objects, so can the AI, which can lead you to get killed with no visible enemy. Also, when you jump, there is no bending the knees then jumping, so it looks like you are just levitating.Sound/Music: 9/10. Both are much improved, and the sounds are more correctly timed to the events. Music is much better quality and sounds more like an orchestra and not like a synth. However, the music is quite limited in the choices, so it gets repetitive quickly.Gameplay: 8/10. Like Morrowind, it is large and open ended. There are alot of side quests, however the people that give them to you do not walk around with a sign over their heads that say SIDE QUEST, you have to look for them. They REALLY simplified things from TES 3, to much to even be funny. One of the most noticeable things is the change in the way you pick a lock. Previously, it all depended on your security level, quality of the lockpick, level of the lock, and a formula that determined if you got it open or not. They changed that to be like it was in the old DnD games from the late 80s and early 90s. ALl you have to do now to pick a lock is to be able to lock from 1 to 5 tumblers into place, which can be done with any security level, the only thing security is used for is to determine how many tumblers can fall back out of place if you fail and break a pick. They removed all Traps, which makes the game even more simple. They also eliminated all Medium range armor, like addamantium, so only Light and Heavy remain. They also changed the weapon classification, so instead of Axe, Long Blade Short Blade, etc... all thats left is Blade, Blunt, and Marksman. The most noticable change is the combat system, which now makes it depend more on skill than formulae. In TES 3 blocking was done automatically, dodging a blow depended exclusively on how high you Adgility stat was, and damage depended on which ay you were moving, weapon type/make, and how long you held the atack button down. Now, however, the blocking is done manually with either a weapon or shield and you can always block with the ammount of damage prevented being determined by if you blocked with a shield or weapon and your block level. Damage has changed to if you are doing a regular attack, just clicking the button, or a power attack, holding down the button. Also each weapon always does a ertian ammount of damage, no ranges, that raise as your skill of that weapon type increase and the condition of the weapon. If your rank in acrobatis is high enough, you an also roll away from an enemy t dodge. They made it so that beast races Argonian and Kajiit can now wear boots/shoes and full helmets. Also, you cannot wear clothing over your armor like you could in Morrowind. the gold issue has been fixed so you cant legally get a ton of gold in just a few minutes.  few other things were also changed for the better. Also, for the official plugins, you have to BUY them! Whatthefuxup with that?Interface: 6/10. Looks like a simple console level interface and not a advanced PC level interface that was in the previous TES games, simply a discrase to the game, looks like a child designed it.Other thoughts: The game is an improvement over most RPGs of the day, but it also has all the flaws of current 3D RPGs. It is not what i would call \"Next Generation\" RPG considering it has FAILED to resolve the problems that are in \"First Generation\" RPGs, i would say that this is a \"Transition Generation\" RPG, ahead of most but definetly not anything that would be considered next generation. Oblivion looks like it was going great and then either ran out of time or money and was cheaply and sloppily put together, could have been much better. DO NOT spend hundreds of dollars to upgrade your PC hardware to buy this game, it is not worth it, mabye TES 5 will be.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2006"}

I used System Mechanic to perform some \"before and after\" system scans to ensure nothing sinister was happening with the install. All I could find was the usual license and CD / DVD entries in the Registry. There were no activations or installation hiccups. The installation does take quite some time though, so I advise people to de-clutter and defrag before they install.I don't want to issue any spoilers, but what I will say is that the graphics are revolutionary! The world feels very immersing and the character interactions are very realistic. The controls are very similar to Oblivion too, so it wasn't hard to dive in. The game is very, very polished and when you exit Vault 101 for the first time, the scenery that greets you is astounding! You can see objects in full clarity right out to the horizon and the environment looks very much like a post-apocalyptic wasteland, albeit under a very gray palette.

This game does indeed use the \"evil\" SecuROM, but it's just the usual SecuROM disc-checking that we have in tonnes of games prior to this. There are NO LIMITED ACTIVATIONS.

Well having played every installment since III, this isn't really a case of I don't like hardcore games but rather I just didn't like Grand Theft Auto IV. I felt what Rockstar did was move the series from outlandish, over-the-top and Fun with a capital F to something more realistic, detailed and immersive at the expense of the fun. You could spend so much time doing whatever you wanted in the old games whereas in IV I felt like \"yeah I could but do I feel the need to?\" So why did I check out \"Episodes from Liberty City\"? I guess partly because part of me at least wants to give the series another shot; after all I did spend so much time in the previous cities that maybe I just need to change how I approach the games. Combining the Lost and Damned as well as brand new Ballad of Gay Tony episodes, I find some improvement but it still falls into pitfalls Rockstar should've fixed long ago.Story: The Lost and Damned has you control Johnny \"the Jew\" Klebitz, Vice President of the biker gang The Lost, which is just having its President, Billy Grey, released from doing time. But seems that there's some tension brewing as Johnny has differing views on how to handle business while Billy is getting more progressively outspoken and maybe even a bit out of control. Eventually this'll tie into the botched diamond deal seen in IV, Johnny's drugged up ex Ashley and Johnny having to potentially save the gang from itself. The Ballad of Gay Tony, meanwhile, has you control Luis Lopez, right-hand man for Tony Prince, who's starting to feel pressure in terms of money, the diamond deal that goes south, potential buyers for his nightclubs not to mention his own drug issues.The problem with Lost and Damned is that there's really no characters to actually like and main guy Johnny is such an ***hole but not a likable anti-hero type either. For all the bad things Tommy did, he at least came across as an awesome dude but Johnny barely has any redeeming features despite his pleas for less bloodshed and mayhem. And love interest Ashley doesn't even hold much interest for him or Johnny which is a shame since the want-to-be-do'gooder Johnny still being around messed up and drug-using Ashley could've made for some good character development but nope, he just treats her like ****. Ballad of Gay Tony on the other hand is a bit better, mainly thanks to a bit more outrageous cast such as Yusuf, a completely nutso helicopter-owning dude. I still prefer the story in Vice City but nice to see Rockstar lighten up with this episode.Graphics: The Rage engine is starting to show its age, really. The graphics here do look colorful, especially in Tony's nightclubs, character animation during cutscenes is well-done and the draw distance is pretty incredible especially since there's barely any load times other than mission loads. However, graphical textures will still show themselves appearing later than they should and strangely I find certain facial animations to look bizarre, especially smiles and laughs. But Liberty City is certainly a very detailed and elaborate place but hopefully next game, Rockstar will do some upgrades. Oh and I'd suggest turning off the filter in the Lost and Damned because it just makes the game look ugly.Sound/Music: The GTA series has always had impeccable voice acting and here it's no different. While I find Luis to be a bit flat-toned, the rest of the cast is really well-done and there's even some funny lines to be seen though the swear words to get thrown around very frequently, maybe a bit more than necessary. Other benefit in GTA is the radio stations which range from jazz to hip-hop to dance and even yoga-esque new age music and of course frequent visitor Lazlow. One problem I had is that I would've love to be able to see exactly what song is playing because there was this one song on a station I started to fall in love with only there was no actual way to say what it was so it prompts a visit through the OST or google lyrics to figure out what it was.Gameplay: What made the old GTA series fun is just the insane amount of stuff to do. Fire truck missions, police missions, taxi missions, learning how to ride bikes better, cars, pedal bikes, planes, jets even, hidden packages, jumps, races etc. Even Vice City had the whole property buying but GTA IV got rid of most of it so now hidden packages are those damn pigeons, police missions are most wanted hunting and there is jumps, races and base jumps (in Gay Tony) but I guess it was my problem with GTA IV, a big expansive and elaborate universe that wasn't much fun to play in. The DLC expansions some of it but it still feels like there's not as much stuff to do, it's just a bigger world to move in. The mission variety is also starting to wear a bit thin since it really comes down to get ambushed, shoot everyone and outrun cops or chase someone and kill them. Also there's some missions that were clear missteps, namely the use of the helicopters which are some of the more frustrating-to-control vehicles I've seen in awhile and they make you ride these things more than 3 times for missions. Controls are also spotty for combat in that gunplay is still roughly the same like taking cover and it's supremely easy to get headshots but cycling through targets still doesn't want to target the guy right to your left but rather some guy on the street below and it's very easy to stay locked on to a target you already killed. I would've liked separate controls for helicopter and on-foot as well since one camera type didn't work for me in another type.As far as extra stuff to do, both episodes include the idea of gang wars (TLAD) and drug wars (TBoGT) and these work somewhat similar to territory control in San Andreas where you fight off some enemies in a given area. Gay Tony also introduces the idea of base jumping where you parachute down through rings or get an achievement by freefalling without pulling the parachute for the longest time (hint: try to do it before you hit the ground). One thing I will criticize Rockstar for is that there's secondary mission objectives in the Gay Tony missions where there's almost certain things you need to do in the mission to get a better score such as little to no damage, accuracy and time. Wouldn't be bad if the achievements weren't directly related to it nor mention what exactly needs to be done for each one but at least you can replay after the story's over.Strange as it sounds but a lot of people preferred Saints Row 2 for just how zany and outlandish it was yet I didn't much care for it, seeing a lack of refinement that Rockstar does with their games yet I didn't like GTA IV. Not sure what it is and the Episodes from Liberty City reminds me of other games in that this wasn't awesome enough to fully invest in (like Fallout 3 or Call of Duty 4) yet they weren't bad enough to outright quit. But I'm sure this'll be a very unpopular review so bring it on (or not would be preferred).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2009"}

This is both its strength and weakness. Dumbing down and simplifying a game like Morrowind would probably cure its glitchy ails, but this is a double-edged sword.PROS- Amazing top-notch score (as with Morrowind's Jeremy Soule) by Russell Shaw and Danny Elfman (does mainly stylish fantasy and horror soundtracks such as Tim Burton films, Simpsons stuff, etc). This is infinitely more important than you think.- excellent variety of enemies and bosses with their own unique abilities and challenges.- excellent variety of items, weapons, armor, etc but simple enough that you can remember everything.- experience and level-up system works fine.- good story narrative (and thankfully you can bypass any cut-scene at any time)- game length is fine, despite what critics have said. The game should not be compared to Morrowind (the longest game ever next to Oblivion) or GTA. There are tons of missions (quests). People that say you can complete this thing in 12 hours are either lying or have no life.- hair, tattoo, etc customization (as in GTA San Andreas).- fun to kick chickens- good voice-acting, various british isles accents, english, irish, cockney, etc...the style and feel are a bit british (developed by Lionhead UK, now owned by MS). It's good to have an actual british game developer in the mix with US and Japanese dominated game design.CONS- main melee attack is mapped permanently to a button not the trigger (like every other game in the world). Can't map it to what you want. Counter-intuitive.- uber-hype marketing nonsense; I think this is what everyone got upset about.- some (not all) combat is button mashing- while the graphics are nice, they are just a tingle cartoonish.- ebony weapons. Uh, did they just rip this off from Elder Scrolls?- save system is weird (world save and hero save) - just save the damn thing where the hell I want it to!- a couple of IMPOSSIBLE MISSIONS. 1 for example has you trying to save a couple of hostages. You are able to save 1 only, the other is IMMEDIATELY executed upon your arrival. NO WAY to save her whatsoever. No way near the glitchiness of Morrowind, but still annoying.- CANNOT complete side quests if you finish main quest. Why the hell did they do this? It's moronic.- Last quest is impossible unless you were lucky like me and happened to have 10 thousand items to save your health. They do NOT let you prepare for it - it occurs without warning immediately following the quest preceeding it. If you didn't save somewhere before the preceeding quest and don't have tons upon tons of magic or health, you'll be totally SCREWED.Morrowind is absolutely better, but due to its massive amount of glitches, it's also more annoying. If you want a lighter, more contained, briefer version of Morrowind with simpler gameplay, Fable is an excellent choice for xbox, also playable on 360.NOTE: if i were reviewing FABLE LOST CHAPTERS, i'd give it 0 stars if possible. it's a marketing gimmick. Just a couple of added items and quests, THAT'S IT! The \"LOST CHAPTERS\" part makes is sound as if it's a sequel -- it's not even an expansion! Wikipedia calls it a \"remake\". I call it a \"rip-off\"!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2007"}

First of all, my anticipation was that this would be an extreme free-form game like nothing else introduced. You get to be good or bad, handsome or ugly, and there's tons more interactivity. Something that upset me though(mainly because I had anticipated it so much) was the fact that it wasn't as free form as I thought. There are /still/ systems in this game. Skills and traits are bought and gradually begin to affect your character's model. But what I thought was that you have this character who only goes around talking to people and fighting, creating the ultimate cinematic feel by limiting or restricting number-crunching, exp division, and things like waiting for gauges to fill up. Well, no...You talk to people, with the ability to sometimes gear the conversation toward an alignment, and then you run around and collect things, usually stuff people leave behind that correspond to other things(like 20 keys to open a chest...), and then you fight. Now, when you fight, you usually use one button with melee, different scopes in aiming with ranged(about 2 buttons simultaneously), or you can use magic, in which you hold down the button as you change targets, or as you choose to use your mana. After an enemy falls, you run over and collect their exp gem things, and rush off to the next enemy, all done in real time. You then run to a place to spend experience, in which you can choose to heighten different skills pertaining to different archetypes(strength-based, magic-based, stealth-based) in different categories for different skills. So it's all very complex, and gets even moreso as you level up. Yes, there are even levels.So, basically, there are systems, numbers, and experience. But what you do with it supposedly changes your overall experience. None of this I find revolutionary, however. The only two outstanding features I could find were the environmental graphics(though some of the character models are a bit off in proportion) and the ability to alter the character model as you play. However, all of the other features aren't the most common either. You can find them in other great games like Knights of the Old Republic and Black and White. Aside from the model rendering ability, the only difference that seems obvious is the genre.One last thing before I wrap up on a last paragraph, the story. Now, I'm only a few hours into the game, but I know a rushed storyline when I see one. First of all, I can't make any sense out of the FMV before the Start Screen, other than \"This could be YOU!!\". And as you go along, watching the cutscenes, things are pieced together in somehting of a jumble. No character really seems to get any attention at all. Everyone is just a flat character, even if there is conflict thrown in. The cutscenes go by so fast that within 5 minutes you'll be a little kid watching his hometown burn, you meet a new person who takes you to a guild to raise you as a Hero, you meet another man who wants to teach you how to be a Hero, then your roommate who tells you to wake up, then later seems to head for the evil alignment. And that's all you ever find out about them, seriously. They don't even really stick around. They have short dialogue about what you need to do, and you do it. No side quests, no shortcuts, nothing.So yeah. Wrapping up, I think it's a rare concept that's still getting its ground in the RPG gaming world. Great replay value, no doubt about it. But everything seems rushed and nothing is /truly/ free form like everyone anticipated. If you buy this game at all, buy it for the fantasy aspect or the new model rendering feature(which only changes by going through exp allocation and division, nothing new). Also, XBox Live is supposed to be the best way to experience the game, because who really wants all that rushed storyline when you can make your own or just play with friends?4/5 overall for being one of the top gaming experiments that actually play well. Personally I was a little disappointed, though. *runs back to KOTOR*","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2004"}

They try to re-create the cinematic moments, but that only works once.  When you're falling out of a helicopter and barely get saved in the nick of time in the beginning of COD4, it was cool.  Now, every time I see another moment like that, I yawn.  So what I'm saying is you've seen this all before.  And I'm not a Treyarch hater either, I thought COD WAW was pretty fun and had a good story with Nazi zombies.

It's good for those really hard areas, except for the dungeon run, where the left side of the screen is a fire chasing all the players through in a mad dash.That cooperative element, combined with the general silliness of the game, makes it a great choice for kids.Adult fans of platformer games will find it compelling and entertaining.  It is a solid addition to the Rayman series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2013"}

Graphics were subpar last-gen at best. I was seriously disappointed by this lackluster title. I played through 'till the end because, well there's nothing else out for the PS4 that interests me right now.Clunky--at times downright frustrating controls. Bland graphics (don't let the images online fool you like it did me). Uninspired gameplay that is for the most part boring. Ugh, I was so bored through most of this title--seriously. Point. Shoot. Die endlessly. Do these characters have eagle eye vision or what? How can they see me across the map when behind cover? Challenge or lazy coding.On another note, the game may look huge, but that's all it does/is--looks huge. Playable areas are surprisingly small and exploring is virtually non existent.Speaking of small, did I mention this was ridiculously short? Talk about taking a page from CoD GHOSTS, wow. All the power and space the PS4 offers and this is the best Killzone can do? Perhaps I'm just jaded given how fantastic the PS3 exclusive THE LAST OF US is. I know I keep saying this, but for next-gen SHADOW FALL falls short.Kill zone is pretty much cashing in on being one of four or five launch titles and that is the only reason it'll do well sales-wise. This otherwise forgettable title does nothing to showcase what the PS4 can do.If you're an XBox owner concerned that you may be missing something with the PS4 exclusive, rest assured, you're up $60 right now. You win.UPDATE:My TV was in 720 mode. Since switching to 1080 the difference in graphic quality is outstanding. This doesn't make up for the short game-play, or virtual on-rail levels, but I've adjusted my review +1 star as a result.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2013"}

{"product_name":"B004NRN5EO","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"geertmatthys","summary":"The Hate/Love Game","reviewText":"I finished Souls 3 times now and wanted to decompress by writing a fair review.Dark Souls is an action-RPG. You are an Undead in Lordran, a once blessed realm created by ascended Lords who defeated the Dragons and started the Age of Fire, basically volition at it's finest. Unfortunately for the Lords, they overlooked a furtive pigmy creature, man, who over time undermined all they had wrought. You are that blighted thing that can either rekindle all the Lords designs, or annihilate them and forge your own world.At least, that's my interpretation, the story isn't fixed you see, you kinda have to make it yourself. A first indication of a masterpiece, as ambiguty, if done right, works in a game's favour. It does in Souls.You already heard of the 'insurmountable' difficulty in Souls, but let's start at the base, gameplay mechanics. Your character will need to master several motions, blocking, parrying, rolling (important one), switching gear mid-combat, drinking health potion mid-combat, but most importantly, you need to learn your path around the map! That's really the main objective gameplay wise; learning where stuff, enemies, bonfires, vendors and blacksmith's are. When you play this game, you need to think ahead and look up stuff on Dark Souls Wikidot and Youtube. It really is part of the gaming experience to do so and will prevent many deaths (Of which there will still be plenty). Enemies will always do the same things, always the same moves. The developers gave you the tools to overcome them. In that regard Souls seems a fair game....BUT....I find that all the rolling, parrying, and blocking in the world doesn't prevent hundreds, nay, thousands of cheap \"the enemy positioned itself bad\" deaths. Dying is definitely something FromSoft wanted you to do over and over again regardless of level and efforts. There are parts in this game that boggle comprehension: The Catacombs, the Londo Archers, Ornstein and Smough, Kalameet. The aggravation of course is amplified by the fact that you respawn at some bonfire and you have to chug all the way back to the sc&egrave;ne of death. It also doesn't help that you lose your hard-earned souls and have 1 chance at retrieval (which you often don't get, getting molested on the way or rage-falling off a cliff). It begs the question:WHY NO DECREASED DAMAGE TAKEN SETTINGS? At least the player would have some more time to analyze foe and environs but no. The difficulty of course means seniors, children and handicapped people can't play this game, I don't know if that's cool, FromSoft says so.Another major problem is the Soul requirements to level, purchase consumables, spells, and upgrade weapons. It is insane. Millions upon millions of souls are needed, souls that you can lose at any moment. The amount of grinding is unacceptable, the game does install certain 'farm' zones but we are talking insanity here. If the game lasts long, this is the reason. Now there is a solution to level problems using the dragon head stone glitch, you can look it up on youtube, it requires you NOT install patch or Artorias DLC. I highly recommend doing this to save ridonculous amount of time. Though the game doesn't emphesize level, a lv 500 character will give you more leeway thus more fun. After leveling you can install patches and DLC.The game offers PvP and co-op options but you must play offline. Remember the game is old now and being online risks you getting invaded by what has now become a group of hardcore adepts. PvP is usually found in Covenants. Be sure to look that up, the order of joining matters, once again, pre-planning is everything.How must I rate this game? It's great but not fun. It's intense but frustrating. It's addictive and pointless. If you made it to the Gargoyles you'll finish it over time. It's Dark Souls and unique. Thank God","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2013"}
{"product_name":"B007BJNR6C","description":"Introducing Assassin's Creed III Liberation, the stunning new chapter in the Assassin's Creed saga, designed exclusively for PlayStation Vita handheld entertainment system.  The year is 1765. As the events leading up to the American Revolution heat up in the north, Spanish forces plan to take control of Louisiana in the south - but they have yet to reckon with Aveline, a deadly Assassin who will use every weapon and ability in her arsenal to win freedom for her land and her people. Whether silently eliminating her enemies with slow-motion chain kills or luring them into deadly traps, Aveline strikes mortal fear into the hearts of those who stand in her way.  As an Assassin, Aveline soon finds herself on an unforgettable journey that will take her from the crowded streets of New Orleans to voodoo-haunted swamps and ancient Mayan ruins. She will play a pivotal role in the turbulent birth of a new nation as she fights for freedom, not only for herself, but for her fellow citizens.","reviewerName":"Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"","summary":"Best mobile experience since the PSP","reviewText":"After reading some of the critic's review of Liberation, I am having a feeling so far that the Vita version of this franchise hasn't been given a fair shake.First off, it's one of the few games that really gets to show off what the Vita can (and shouldn't) do and rather than being a shrunken down version of its console brother, it's a separate game in the same era.The story so far:As anyone who has read knows, this is the first game of the franchise to have a female lead by the name of Aveline and the story takes place in New Orleans. Not much is known about her except that she lives in a rich household and is an assassin.  I am hoping along the lines as I play, we learn how she got involved.  We have learned about the others before her including Conner so it would be nice for some back story.ControlsLet's get right to it. The touch controls are gimmicky and while it's not a game breaker, it's not helping the game play either. I have had to do weird things like hold my Vita to lights and slide my fingers across the screen just so to open a letter.  Thank goodness this doesn't happen too often but thankfully some of these moments don't always require complex touchscreen meaneuvers and that is a plus. Touch screen chain kills are hit or miss but some are just downright cool as you pull them off.  Otherwise, the controls are very responsive and give me a mobile experience I have been looking for.SoundAfter fiddling around with the settings, I managed to find a good blend of music in the background and atmosphere in the foreground and while it may not be much immersive sound, it's still enough to give you a feel of being in the Big Easy in the 1700s.  A lot of French speaking citizens, building noises and some of the usual sounds to give a nice ambiance for a game like this; it works for what it is.GraphicsWhile it is one of the best looking games to appear on the Vita since Uncharted, it also suffers from some of the same glitches of the consoles where there are weird clipping errors and NPC bugs which can cause a flower to attack when he shouldn't be attacking and people who blink in and out of scenery.  It's not game breaking however, but on the other hand the game is indeed gorgeous and one can see the contrast between this and Boston.Other cool things one may likeOne of the things I really like is that Aveline can change costumes near the appropriate buidlings and each costume has its own set of strengths and weaknesses.  Also for each costume, there are different alerts.  She can even charm or bribe officers to help her get to places that she needs to go and that within itself is why I like what they did with this character.  They let her act like a female and use her `feminine whiles' to distract as she gets her missions done and that is just one of the many weapons at her disposal.ConclusionThis is pretty much the experience one can hope to imagine for the PS Vita.  While so far it may not have the best story, graphically speaking and control wise, it's a good mobile Assassin's Creed experience one can get while on the go.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2012"}

Finally, a revisit to the world that ultimately kept me going on RPGs through the PlayStation era.To save time, and not rehash what's already been said, allow me to just bullet out things for you.  Then you can make up your own mind.** What Crisis Core Does Right **- The graphics.  Easily, the most beautiful on the system.  The cutscenes are up to the caliber of Final Fantasy XII and I'm not kidding here.  It really pushes the power of the system to its limits just based on pure aesthetic beauty.- The story.  Final Fantasy VII had such a deep storyline, even though the cutscenes didn't have spoken text, that to revisit it WITH spoken text just gets you in an emotional spot if you played VII.  I can say with certainty that this game will bring nostalgia if you let it.  Not all questions are answered though.- The challenge (some of it anyway).  There are bosses and enemies that will give you a run for your money.- The side missions.  There are so many I actually got tired of doing them, which hasn't happened in a long time on any system, much less a handheld one.** What Crisis Core Does Wrong **- The DMW or whatever it's called.  Basically, this is a glorified double slot machine, numbers and pictures.  As the numbers match up, your materia does as well - or possibly, you do.  Yes, you read that right...you don't control when you level up, it's all a gamble.  This is problematic, because as you approach certain bosses, you can't really do anything about them if you happen to be underleveled, except try to do some missions and cross your fingers hoping you get a level up.The other problem with the DMW: it controls your limit breaks, summons, and special attacks.  That means you can't control what gets done when.  When you're fighting that boss and he levels you, nearly killing you, you  can't just use Aerith's Healing Wave to get you right back into the action; instead, you see that it used Sephiroth's Octaslash (great damage mind you, but healing is a priority here!).  What's more, the enemy can use theirs over and over again without fault, putting you at a distinct disadvantage whether you care to have it or not.  You feel out of control most of the time; you can use items, regular spells, and the attack button whenever you please, but that's it.  Against a boss, that's just not sufficient.2 - The story.  \"But you just praised the story!!\" True.  It is a good story - it's just not told the way I think it should have been.  See, the way the story is told in CC, it's like Final Fantasy VII never existed.  Which I suppose is the point but, it DID exist.  We played it, some of us remember it quite vividly even to this day.  I remember Aerith's surprise when Cloud dropped in on her unannounced.  I remember other details where, in CC, these seem to have never happened - for example, the aforementioned Aerith detail...if CC is to be believed, it means Aerith must have lost her memory in Final Fantasy VII.  It's hard to explain without spoiling it, but trust me - it's trying too hard to be a prequel, instead of a prequel with tribute qualities.3 - No parties/teams.  This is a personal pet peeve of mine. If Final Fantasy VII allowed you to have a 3 man team, I expect to have a 3 man team here.  Sadly this is not the case.  You're using Zack the whole time through, and while Zack is a proficient fighter, I can't help but wonder just how much more fun this game would be if I had some others assisting me during certain fights.4 - Somewhat false expectations of the game.  I mean, the cover of the game alone is false advertisement of the first half of the game.Ultimately, the game has its moments, but it's definitely a let down for fans of Final Fantasy VII who actually enjoyed the battle engine and system.  The materia system is there and everything is in place, but it just doesn't \"feel\" like Final Fantasy.  It's like a completely different game.  If at least the DMW weren't here, I could tolerate it, but as is...Just don't go in with ANY expectations.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2008"}

It is silly, it is childlike, but it is VERY enjoyable.A lot of reviewers in magazines made fun of it relentlessly, and while it isn't as good as most of the other launchday titles, it was still fairly fun! The game gives off kind of an old skool vibe, and seems very much like something Nintendo would release if they had a system that was capable of handling a game this intense without melting into a puddle of plastic.The controls took me awhile to get used to. the whole hitting O and then one of the other buttons to unleash a super power? Seems kind of awkward! It would be better suited as a PC game in my opinion, but while it is awkward, it's not impossible. It just takes awhile to get used to.The graphics are great! The amount of action that can be happening on screen, without showing any signs of slowing is just amazing! True, the graphics lack any realism, but it was never intended to look realistic. It has a cartoon look that reminds me quite a bit of World of Warcraft. It's cute, but familiar.Also, the &#34;Goblins&#34;, seem more like Orcs to me...but whatever.Now, I wouldn't recommend this game to everyone!

Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience.

The first 3 were pretty good and Reach and ODST made me fall asleep. With Bungie out of the picture and 343 Industries into the captain&#8217;s chair I figured Halo may have some great new changes. I was half right. The single player campaign is pretty fun and is as tough as nails. The new weapons are awesome to shoot and there&#8217;s new enemies for once that are different. The story is convoluted and confusing, but hardcore fans may be able to follow it okay.The mechanics are pretty much the same as previous Halo games. There&#8217;s no iron sights, the game is fast paced with high jumping and fast sprinting. There&#8217;s still no cover system which is a shame and the game is damn hard. I felt the story was a bit random and the environments felt the same way. One minute I&#8217;m shooting the same tired Covenant then these machine type aliens, then mutated Covenant, then regular Covenant. There was some vehicle sections and I was riding a giant vehicle. The game just felt all over the place, but it was fun at least.The story is really confusing and never makes much sense. Something about Cortana being infected and a giant being called the Didact trying to destroy everything. It&#8217;s nothing fancy or sophisticated but you can&#8217;t expect much from an FPS. At least the game just feels tighter and a bit more heavy feeling and less floaty than other Halos. I felt the weapons had weight to them and the sheer variety had me switching them up all the time for different situations. I did find that there were repetitive scenarios through the whole game like jump into stations to hit a button at the top and running back down to get to the next one. This scenario repeated often through the whole game and felt archaic and overly simple.While the structured campaign felt old and tired the multiplayer is still the best part of Halo. The constantly updated match types makes you come back for more all the time. The game feels faster paced and just more fluid and balanced than any previous Halo game. Customization is deep for your avatar, there are many levels to climb, and the unlocks are sweet and rewarding. After you beat the Halo campaign just once I doubt you will ever go back because of how forgettable and repetitive it feels. I honestly think at this point Halo should just continue as a multiplayer only game and maybe jump on board with PC.The few little tweaks here and there help the game just become more balanced overall. The lack of duel wielding makes the game feel more raw and &#8220;hardcore&#8221;, various adjustments in damage from each weapon and the increased damage for melee attacks is nice. I also love how great the game looks. This is the best looking Xbox 360 game out and the voice acting and animations are so life like. However, the Xbox 360 doesn&#8217;t have the processing power as the PS3 so you won&#8217;t see The Last of Us quality textures and lighting effects. There are some ugly textures in Halo 4 and it really showed some times. Surprisingly there wasn&#8217;t any slow down or glitches that plagued other Halo games.Overall, Halo 4 is a great final opus for the 360 but isn&#8217;t the revolutionary new Halo like everyone thought. The campaign is repetitive, extremely difficult, and confusing, the story is so-so, but the multiplayer is where the meat of the game is at.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2014"}

I'd always found the series to be misleading, disguising itself as a straightforward action title before slowing the gameplay down to a crawl and relying on endless puzzles and feats of memory to lengthen completion times. Time after time, I'd sit down with the goal of finally tackling these games, and time after time I'd get bored, stuck or distracted, leaving the game behind. I grabbed Resident Evil 3 when it was relatively new, and the title has sat, unplayed, on my shelf for years. That was, as I said, until this past week, when I sat down with renewed vigor and vowed to complete the first title in the series, even if it drove me to madness.I'll make it really blunt; the story is absolutely terrible. The uninspiring characters meander their way through the events without a care in the world, occasionally encountering plot holes large enough to drive an oversized bus through. Nagging issues, such as why somebody would lock their home's single shotgun away in a room that's only accessible through a string of unrelated tricks and puzzles, aren't even touched upon. What if somebody breaks in, in the middle of the night? Is the owner of the mansion really going to have time to roll out of bed, run downstairs, jog to one side of the house, move around a couple statues, grab a key, run to another corner of the house, open a door, grab a fake shotgun, return to the original side of the house, unlock the doors and replace the \"real\" shotgun with the fake? I suppose the story does the right thing by failing to even mention these things, but they'll still tug away at the back of your mind as you play.The graphics of the first Resident Evil really haven't aged well. Humans and zombies alike wander around stiffly and unrealistically, each one looking almost identical to the others. Polygon models are simple and blocky. Textures are pixelated and undetailed, looking more like a game assembled on the Super Nintendo's SuperFX chip than a PlayStation title. The series' characteristic pre-rendered backgrounds are poorly compressed and difficult to navigate in places, forcing players to turn out all the lights and squint their eyes just to make their way through the room. Merging still images with live polygons, Resident Evil plays like a strange amalgamation of the PC classics \"Myst\" and \"Alone in the Dark.\"The bread and butter of any console title, its gameplay, is the one area where you'll really learn to love or hate this series. Rather than bothering with camera angles and awkward environments, Capcom has instead sent players through a series of screens, occasionally containing interactive elements of their own. You'll control Jill or Chris from a series of dramatic angles, never in control of the camera itself. They'll enter a screen on the left side, mosey around a little bit, kill a couple zombies and leave the screen on the right side, immediately entering the next screen from another direction. Though it was a somewhat novel concept at the time of its release, this scheme brought with it numerous problems, the most notable of which was your interaction with enemies on the next screen. It's not uncommon to run full throttle off the edge of one screen, only to find a zombie waiting for you right at the edge of the next. It's a really cheap way to take a hit, and can mean a speedy, frustrating death in later stages.Looking back, the control scheme employed here is notably revolutionary. Rather than applying a more traditional platformer's control layout, Resident Evil introduced gamers to a stationary rotation-based configuration. Left and right don't serve to strafe, they stop the character's movement altogether and rotate them left or right in place. Up moves you forward, and down moves backwards. Pressing R1 draws your weapon, and pressing X at the same time fires. It's a scheme that's more appropriate for the kind of stationary gunfighting and marksmanship that's defined the action portions of this series since day one.Many of the tricks and puzzles buried within the mansion aren't so much brain teasers as they are time wasters. You'll realize what needs to be done within moments, but chances are good you won't have the piece needed to do so on your person. It took me about six and a half hours to beat the game for the first time as Chris, cautiously walking around, learning the position of the zombies, figuring out the puzzles, groaning as I realized the piece I needed was sitting in a chest, fifteen minutes away, and repeating that process. The second time through, playing as Jill and remembering which random item I would need where, I finished in three hours and twenty minutes. That's one heck of a variation.The soundtrack to the first Resident Evil is really something that's difficult to categorize. Imagine, if you can, a blend of symphonic suspense, the song that plays when you push \"demo\" on a keyboard, and elevator music. That's Resident Evil's melody. The composer tried to capitalize on the few \"jump out of your seat\" moments the storyline provided, but surrounded by cheesy samples, monotonously repeating tunes and quality that sounds more like something on the N64 than the PSX, there was only so much that could be done.On the large, this was a different kind of game than what we were getting at the time, something fresh. It wasn't a blockbuster, oh-my-god-get-me-the-sequel-now, mind numbing experience. I can understand why a game like this would deserve a sequel, but even today I couldn't have predicted the amount of games it would spawn.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2003"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

Kind of like if your Mother was human but your Dad was Optimus Prime.However, many of the available character classes involve wearing a helmet, and also since the bulk of the game plays from the standard third-party action perspective, this is no issue - you're not faced with your own ugly mug for most of the proceedings. Besides this, everything in  \"Demon's Souls\"  is beautifully modeled, textured and realized - this game is a real stunner, which is no mean feat, given the size of the effects-heavy game world. Kudos to all at Atlus -  \"Demon's Souls\"  might be ridiculously frustrating, but none of that frustration comes from any visual issues.SOUND: 4/5The voice acting's pretty reasonable, the music (especially the soundtrack CD bundled with some versions of the game) is excellent, and the ambient sound effects really help the atmosphere. Thanks to really convincing audio-visuals, the world of Boletaria is lifted from generic-ye-old-fake-englishe Fantasy dreck, and sets a new standard of style for this type of RPG.PLAYABILITY: 1/5Now, here's where opinions get polarized, and I am very definitely a member of the Naysayer's camp on  \"Demon's Souls\". It's not that the game is too hard, or that the individual enemies are too tough, too soon - they're not. The gameplay is fluid, the controls are responsive, and the camera is well-designed and executed.However.The control system, tight as it is, doesn't do anything new or memorable, and the insanely repetitive nature of the gameplay, wrought by the game's biggest flaw - a complete lack of checkpoints - sadly turns this otherwise excellent action RPG into a mediocre exercise in rinse-repeat swordplay.A challenge is good! A challenge is, in fact, a necessary component of so, so many of today's prestige releases - personally, I found \"Red Dead Redemption\" and \"Yakuza 3\" just TOO easy - so the fact that instant death is meted out to lazy gaming is, in my opinion, a welcome change from the norm.But when so many talented people spend so much time on such a promising game, you have to question the intelligence behind the decision to force players through the same level ad nauseam, until simple monkey-see-monkey-do repetition gets you through.Checkpoints would have been nice.LASTIBILITY: 2/5If you can stomach learning each level and each creature's attack patterns by rote, if you can handle the almost-endless hours hacking through the same areas fighting the same respawned baddies to reach the same goal, then sure, go for it.  \"Demon's Souls\"  is a beautiful, well-made action RPG with a lot of good points.But for me, my skill as a player or my engagement as a consumer were neither tested nor thrilled by the classroom-like repetitive nature of the ridiculously limiting gameplay structure.OVERALL: 2/5Rent it first. Seriously. If you like it, buy it - there are a lot of rewards. If you're a fly-by-night gamer or if you prefer your RPG heroes to have a little more personality, then avoid this one. But if you liked \"Oblivion\" or any of the \"Fallout\" series, this could be right up your alley - just be sure you can handle the repetition before committing your cash.If you do decide to buy, then buy the Deluxe Edition - the soundtrack CD, guidebook and art book are worth the extra spend.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"Poorly executed enjoyment","reviewText":"This game won't stun you with graphics. It does, however, change the way you think of an action RPG. You wouldn't think that was really possible with gun weaponry, but the game handles it pretty well.Unfortunately, they hadn't quite figured out the difficulty settings. \"Insanity\" feels like an insult to my intelligence, and I can't help but say the word mockingly now whenever it comes up in conversation. Also, the general names of the difficulties baffle me: Easy - Normal - Hard - Veteran - Insanity, where \"Hard\" is really the default setting. Why not drop the insult to my intelligence and just use this: Casual - Easy - Normal - Hard - Veteran? I guess because \"Insanity\" lives up to its name. Organic enemies all get a skill called \"Imunity\" that does pretty much what it sounds like: they ignore 80% of incoming damage, despite the source. There are scenes in the game when you will literally be shooting a human soldier in the face with a tank cannon more than 30 times. In the face. With a tank cannon. More than 30 time. I wish I was joking.The AI is pretty smart, which gives the game a good challenge on any difficulty. They take cover and will unload combat skills and ammo on you if you don't also take cover. You have to play from behind crates and walls, but the aiming system takes this into account so it's not quite as frustrating as completely blind-around-the-corner games like Halo. Unfortunately, your squad members don't seem to understand the concept.Your weakest character will completely pull a Leeroy Jenkins and run into a room full of super-powered baddies only to get nailed in about 2 seconds flat while managing to draw the enemies' attention to you and your remaining squad member who stayed in the room with you. The system for issuing squad members commands is slick, but thwarted by their inability to actually do what you tell them in a timely fashion. If your squad member is getting slaughtered and you try to tell them to take cover, it's a coin toss as to whether they'll actually stop firing and get out of sight. A coin toss with a 5-sided coin. A 5-sided coin with 4 faces that apparently say \"ignore.\" OK, so it's more of a dice roll where only one pip gets you what you want. Whatever. Even if they do end up doing what you \"asked\", it's not likely they'll respond within a second of the command being issued, and that singular second is far too often the difference betweeen survival and defeat. Time is never really your friend in the game, but that's war.There's a setting that's supposed to instruct your squad members how often to use \"powers\". It doesn't matter if you set it to \"Always\", because your squad powers' will almost always be in \"cooldown\" mode. Most powers start with a 2 minute cooldown on a split second effect, and the powerups for them reduce this to no less than 45 seconds. So if you're wondering where that wonderful power is that would be really neat if it happened right now, don't. The pizzeria's hot-and-fresh guarantee doesn't apply here. It's on the baker's rack, cooling down and will be delivered not a second before it reaches room temperature.Your squad members will also refuse to take multiple shots. For some reason, they just won't keep firing. But they'll come out of cover as if they WOULD be firing... if they felt like it. Which they don't. There's no concept of ammo limitations in the first game, so it would have been a really frickin' nice feature if you could have gotten them to actually lay down suppressive cover fire by NOT unnecessarily stopping with the shooting.No, they apparently prefer dying, because they'll jump out of cover for the purpose of doing absolutely nothing even though they have little health left and didn't stay hidden long enough to let their shields recharge. They never, ever stay hidden long enough to recharge shields or health. The exact moment they should stay hidden is the moment they choose to be out in the open, which results in you spending most of your time babysitting your supposedly elite squad of gallactic-quality heroes rather than aiming your gun at the enemy, who ironically is the only force that actually acts like they know what they're doing. I wouldn't mind the babysitting so much if it was actually necessary: that is, your team was hopelessly outmatched and surrounded and it was difficult to stay tactically deployed while maintaining cover. But that's just not really the case in this game. Battles are typically across good distances with plenty of cover, and you rarely get flanked, so there's no reason that your squad shouldn't be able to properly cover you while you move around the battlefield and pick off enemies.This is also another game that forces you to do multiple playthroughs to get all the achievements, but you can't even rush the second two. I mean, it takes 40~60 hours for the first playthrough and about ~17 for each subsequent one (adding ovehead for the number of hours you lose when dying that isn't reported in the save). But those ~17 hours COULD have been &lt;10 if some of the achievements didn't require you to perform X number of side quests with specific members of your squad. These side quests are often meaningless, but you have to play a \"significant\" (read: however many hurdles we feel like making you jump through) amount of the game to get them. This is roughly 80% of the game. You can't really do this any faster because you can't really skip through the dialog fast enough. The same button that skips dialog will also make a choice if you just go pushing buttons too quickly, so in your frustration to just git 'r done, you might end up accidentally making a decision that changes the way the rest of the game will play out. Also, by the time you get to the 3rd playthrough, there's no real reason for you not to have experienced every choice the game has to offer. So that final playthrough is really just an Eff-U from the developers, because it. Is. Boring. Not to mention frustrating, because this is the earliest playthrough where you have access to the Inthanipththtb difficulty (see... there I go).But, in spite of my bitterness for the various shortcomings, the game still made some great innovations. Combat has a bit too much overhead, but even so it's still pretty fun to pop around corners and tag enemies as they switch up cover. At least, it's fun so long as you're not playing on Inthanipttthhhb. The story (for me at least) was unexpectedly fantastic, and the voice acting carries it really well. I mean... Seth Green? Keith David? Marina Sirtis? Really? Reeeaaaally?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2012"}

But it doesn't do anything special or new. It's a by-the-book extreme sports racing game (this time on ATVs) with all the genre staples. Pick a racer. Build a ride. Race and do tricks. Move on to the next race.Everything about it is decent. The graphics are very nice, and the sound is good. The music leaves a little to be desired, but then I'm not in that extreme sports crowd who likes that sort of music. Luckily, I can play my custom soundtrack instead. The characters are a little annoying, and I wish they'd gone the extra step and made a Tony Hawk-style Create-a-character mode, because the stock characters are all archetypes that don't match me or my style at all. Really, they're such broad generalizations that it's hard to like them. There's the standard White extreme sports guy, the Black character, the Asian character, the Latino character, and the girl-power girl. It's like a bad \"United Colors of Benneton\" ad, and really, feels a little insulting. The voice work is a bit obnoxious, but I suppose I'd find it cool if I were a teenager.I did like the create-a-ride mode. It's always fun to customize from the bottom up, and the ATV I made looks pretty cool.I'd call this a good game. If you're an extreme sports, press-button-and-move-stick-to-make-a-trick kind of player, it's probably pretty cool. If you're just looking to kill some time, it does the job. I give it four stars because it really does nothing wrong when you get down to it, and it delivers a solid racing experience with some thrills.

Online DRM and servers make it unplayable.","reviewText":"I did manage to play this for 4 hours last night but tonight - second night after launch - all the servers are massively overloaded. Because the game requires an always-on connection to the EA Origin servers to play, when the servers go down, you don't play. And the servers have been down all day.Plus : and this is a hidden \"feature\" (according to their PR) - your saved games are saved only on the server you're playing on - they don't sync between servers. So if you manage to play one night and that server is dead the next, all your work has gone.The game itself is a huge 5 stars when it works. EA's Origin system for DRM and their appalling server infrastructure are why this got 1 star and why it's rating on Amazon has tanked.Update : day 3 : still no servers. They're all down, and still refusing connections.Update : day 4 : still no servers. Still all down / busy / refusing connections. EA claim they're working \"24/7\" to fix this issue but they're clearly not. They've taken everyone's money and delivered a piece of software that nobody can use. The server list is no different from what it was 2 days ago so the whole notion that they're \"adding more\" is a blatant lie. Fortunately Amazon are doing the right thing and refunding customers now - something EA refused to do. EA can burn in Hell for this disaster.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}

Having to be connected to the internet never bothered me but would have preferred that it wasn't that way.  The DRM didn't bother me either.  So I waited a few months and started to notice that the game was starting to get some good reviews and people were not complaining about the server issues anymore.  So when the price dropped to $40 a few months ago I decided to buy the game.  I wish that I had kept waiting.I'm betting that some of the people that gave the game good reviews have already changed their mind and it has nothing to do with the server issues or DRM or having to be connected to the internet.  EA keeps ruining the game by constant balance changes.I know what they were thinking, \"we constantly make balance changes in Sims 3 so it is ok to do the same with SimCity\".  It is not.  Sims 3 is more of a casual game and the line is broad when it comes to the effect the constant balance changes have.  In SimCity there is a very fine line between success and failure and any balance change has a tremendous effect on the game.  So every time you start a city and build it based on the way the game is balanced you have to start all over again when they make a new balance change or try to adapt your city to the new balance changes, which you will eventually discover is futile.So now I know what you are thinking \"you are being to critical and eventually they will get the game balanced and any changes will be very minor\".  You are forgetting one thing, the expansions.  It became obvious to me that with every new expansion there will be new balance issues, just like in Sims 3 with each new expansion there are balance issues.My recommendation is wait for a few years until they come out with a complete edition or at least a semi-complete edition.  If you can't wait then buy the base game but be prepared for the balance updates because even when they make balance changes based on an expansion it will probably have some effect on the base game.The shame is I like the way the game looks and it is relatively PC friendly, even low end machines shouldn't have much trouble. As it is right now I make one city, enjoy it while I can and then start a new city every time there is a balance update.  I did this for a while but now I hardly play the game anymore because of my frustration.  Recommended for only the most die hard SimCity fans but be prepared to be frustrated every couple of months.Oh, and by the way if you are playing sandbox mode and decide you want to keep going with your city or region despite the balance change one thing you will need to know, Alt-W.  Alt-W is the cheat code that adds $100,000 to your funds.  There is often a slight delay when you use it so don't panic initially and think it doesn't work, keep trying, it is also unlimited so you can keep using it, you will need it.  I'm a purist and hate using cheat codes but even I use this one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2013"}

Nevertheless, sometimes a video version of those games can be just as exciting as the actual version against a regular person. hat has shown several times with games for the Nintendo DS as well. The games that have been developed for the system have definitely amazed me within the past few years, since the system debuted in 2004. For those who do wan that variety of life of many games for the Nintendo DS, they might have it here.Clubhouse Games for the Nintendo DS is a variety compilation of over 40 different games on one video game that are as fun and entertaining at times, as the original thing. The games here are mainly and only controlled by the stylus on this game, which at times can be very frustrating on some games which require complete accuracy from bowling, darts and 9 ball pool. There are also other games which have fewer problems but can aso be as fun on with card games like 5 card draw poker, blackjack, and lesser-known ones like president where you have to withdraw cards in consecutive order from 3's low, to deuces high. The board games also handle well from classic variations of ludo, which influenced Sorry!, chinese checkers, dominoes and chess. The graphics handle well, but the music at times can be cutesy but a bit annoying.All in all, despite some problems on certain games, Clubhouse Games for the Nintendo DS is a great compilation for young and old gamers alike, and it is fun to play, and challenging at times. If you haven't played card games or traditional board games before, it is a great introduction to a lot of challenging fun.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8LY","description":"As stranded, miniature spaceperson Olimar, you must find the missing 30  parts your spaceship needs to get you back home. The parts are scattered across  a forested area crowded with giant (when compared to our hero's size) animals  and other hazards. Our hero stumbles across a race of part-animal, part-plant,  all-bizarre creatures he names Pikmin. Olimar has to learn how to lead the  Pikmin around the forest as he uses the abilities of the different-colored  Pikmin to overcome the many obstacles in his path.Learning when and how to make the best use of your Pikmins' skills and traits is  the essence of the game. You can control up to 100 Pikmin at a time while  figuring out which Pikmin are best suited for a particular task. Some are better  fighters, while others can survive in water or handle explosive bomb rocks.  However, even the best Pikmin herder will have to sacrifice a few of the  plant-headed beasts for the greater good. It's the making of new strategies to  minimize losses that makesPikminchallenging and fun.For a first-generation GameCube title, the graphics, sound, and music are  fantastic and show an awesome amount of detail. Though it's noPok&eacute;mon, this game should appeal to wide-eyed younger gamers as  well as seasoned vets. The controls are intuitive and feel perfect for the  standard GameCube controller. However, learning to position the camera can be a  tad frustrating during some of the more tense moments, as it has only a few  magnification levels and needs constant adjustment.The biggest obstacle Olimar faces is time. He has only 30 days (each day is  about 15 minutes in real time) in which to find the necessary parts. While this  keeps the pace of the game up, some may find such limits somewhat frustrating,  as it means there will be a lot of repetition and rethinking of strategy. It  also means that diligent gamers may findPikmina rather short game.At the end of your gaming day,Pikminis one of the best games on the  GameCube.--Mark BrooksPros:Very innovative and originalGorgeous graphicsGreat sound and musicAmazing blend of action and strategyCons:Time limit causes players to repeat tasksExperienced strategy gamers may findPikminends too quicklyDifficult to control camera during tense moments","reviewerName":"Doom","summary":"A bit of bizarre fun...","reviewText":"Well, this game was a lot better than I expected.  It is (thankfully) not related to Pokemon in anyway.  The Pikmin actually perform useful tasks, such as carrying the missing rocket parts, building bridges, bombing or tearing down gates and walls, and killing enemies who would rather eat Captain Olimar and the Pikmin.  Despite it's kiddie sort of charm (the Pikmin are kind of cute little buggers) little kids would probably be upset playing this.  It's not pleasant watching dozens of your Pikmin getting eaten, or blown up, or drowning.  Anyway, this is really a lot of fun.  For most of the rocket parts you need to find, you have to solve some kind of puzzle, like what color Pikmin to use, while others are lying out in the open, or in the bellies of particularly tough enemies (the Emperor Bulblax is one of the biggest and weirdest boss on the gamecube so far)  The game seems to be over too quick, but it's a lot of fun while it lasts.

{"product_name":"B004FYKWZU","description":"","reviewerName":"Shanghaied","summary":"\"We all lie to ourselves to deal with the horror.\"","reviewText":"Agent Bailey summed up what might be the subtext for Mass Effect 3.The best and shortest analogy I could make regarding Mass Effect 3 would be that it is a beautiful story told by one of the most interesting human beings you will ever meet.  It remains this way until said narrator reaches the conclusion, at which point they stop speaking mid sentence as your intrigue peaks and proceed to stand up and walk away.I couldn't believe the outcry about Mass Effect 3's ending until I actually beat it.  No game that's as brilliant, as engrossing, and as well-produced could have an ending this terrible. I later found out after completing the game that I was correct, but completely in the dark about an even greater problem.  A problem that would turn the naysayers I was originally against into my allies; a unified voice to which I hope to add my own.You see, Mass Effect 3 doesn't have a bad ending; Mass Effect 3 has no ending.I will try to keep this as spoiler free as possible from here on out.  I apologize in advance if I give anything away, but if you don't want the game spoiled, I will haplessly encourage you to play ME3 if you can.  By now, if you haven't picked up spoilers, then you've been careful and I'll try not to disrespect that.  Despite its flaws, it's certainly worth playing.GAMEPLAYME3 from a gameplay perspective is damn near flawless.  I don't know what else to say; it has what I would consider the correct balance of shooting mechanics and RPG skill building.  It's not as in depth as ME1 was, but more fleshed out than ME2.  During my insanity playthrough I changed my skill loadout drastically 2 times and found each revision successful.  Weapon upgrades are either found or purchased this time around which removes some of the tedium.  If you miss a pickup during a level, you can grab it from the Normandy's on-board store for credits, so you don't have to worry about missing any gear.One thing that really impressed me was how much more useful your squadmates can be.  Playing on insanity, my squad rarely got knocked down, resulting in much less use of the \"unity\" ability.  In ME2 and ME1, your squadmates usually fell like a house of cards in the face of any sort of resistance.  In ME3, they stay up, and more importantly, they do indeed help kick some reaper ass.  Their skillset also provide useful abilities and passive bonuses to your squad in general, so there's no more need to pick certain squad members to optimize things like this.  You can very easily play with the squad you want, and they'll fight hard by your side.Multiplayer is actually quite fun.  I should note that one drawback is that it does have very, very minor implications for your single player campaign.  But generally speaking, I was pleasantly surprised by how well done it was.There is some room for criticism.In many ways, levels are just shooting galleries on rails.  Level design remains quite similar to what it was in ME2, which can be a good or bad thing depending on perspective.  It does help the gameplay stand out, but it removes exploration.There is no Mako, Hammerhead, or resource scanning.  Really there are no min-games, like hacking or bypassing, at all now. Personally, I hated all of that.  Some I've talked to miss it a lot, and I guess it does hurt a bit of the identity and immersion factor.Enemy AI is... well, predictable.  I hate criticizing AI in games because you can't really expect it to ever completely outsmart you, but it's a situation where sometimes the AI will do a great job flanking you and sometimes it will just sit there and let you blast away at it.  It's nothing special and it won't really pose much of a challenge in of itself.Some of the harder difficulties can be quite intense, and severely limit your options in terms of weapon loadout.  You'll need something that hits hard and keeps you in cover (sniper rifles and pistols).  The game's focus on melee combat, in which they add a heavy melee attack and several moves that allow you to grab out of cover, go under-utilized because on hard and up, the enemy has incredible aim, will focus you down, and will never miss.  I'm not complaining personally: I love a challenge.  But be advised that you will be limited in strategy and loadout because of this.PROS:+More skills to choose from+Skills are generally more useful, and you can adapt them to your playstyle+Weapons are varied and fun to use+Squadmates more than hold their ownCONS:-Most fights feel very \"samey\"-On harder difficulties, certain weapons/abilities become far more viable.-Melee combat is not as useful as you'd be led to believe.STORYFirst, Jennifer Hale and Mark Meer's voice-acting in this game, along with Ali Hillis, Brandon Keener, Martin Sheen and Keith David is probably the best collection of voice-acting ever created for a video game.  I feel good about making this statement.  Their contribution is nothing short of incredible.As a character study, in my 25+ years of playing video games I can't think of an IP where I've cared about the characters more than I do in Mass Effect.  Your squad, every member, other NPCs, they have personalities, opinions, perspectives.  Bioware has created a standard for video game characterization that will be almost insurmountable.  The world they've created is intelligent and inviting, and you simply don't want to leave.  And for the most part, it seems... oddly plausible.Until the end...  I don't want to talk to much about it, but I will say... prepare yourself.I just finished the game yesterday, and I am intentionally avoiding discussing the ending.  It's just... inexplicable.  It really is.  You cannot grasp how much of an impact it will have on your perception of this game, possibly the entire series, until you experience it.  It's true you'll never be the same after; for me this was so in the most horribly negative way possible.  It completely changed my attitude towards the game.  And I really, really don't want to explain any more than that.PROS:+Some of the best voice acting ever recorded for a video game.+If you have a pulse, you will care deeply about your entire squad.+Revisits a lot of old friends+Not the recruitment quest collection ME2 was; there is a progression of events.CONS:-ENDING IS UNACCEPTABLE.-Shorter than the first two by a slight degree.-Multiplayer has an impact, however slight, on some parts of single player.DLC, THE \"EA EFFECT,\" AND OTHER CONCERNSBioware games used to include a day 1 DLC that was free with the purchase of a new copy of the game.  That's in my opinion a fair way to encourage people to buy new while rewarding them appropriately.Charging for day 1 DLC is usually a bad idea, unless it's cosmetic, non-essential material (costumes, character appearances, etc.).  Having experienced the \"From Ashes\" DLC in my playthrough, let me hastily confirm that you will be missing something significant and important by not experiencing the DLC.  EA/Bioware attempted to assuage criticism by saying \"it was optional.\"  To enjoy Mass Effect truly and honestly is to immerse yourself and experience all the world has to offer.  If this is your goal, then the content in \"From Ashes\" is 100% not optional.  It does in fact feel like content that was stripped and resold; this is one of the few times I will really get behind this perspective.  This is not an instance of missing out on Shale from Dragon Age, or Zaeed Messani from ME2; characters who made almost no impact for those who chose not to experience them.  This is missing out on relatively complex and important content that effects and interacts with several of the series most important characters.In a word, it is unacceptable that \"From Ashes\" was not included content and it is obvious to most that it should have been.Most people who have been following the game realize that Bioware/EA has taken a large amount of flak for the game's ending.  If you haven't experienced the ending, then trust me when I say they deserve it.  Saying that, I didn't believe it until I experienced it myself, so I encourage you to see it with your own eyes.  The game is otherwise so perfect you never suspect what the ending will have in store; and what it can ultimately do to the entire experience.This part of the game is the biggest disenfranchisement to customers that I've ever experienced.  The ending, to me, feels completely absent.  And just today, EA/Bioware has confirmed that DLC regarding the ending is forthcoming, although free.  This should have been in the game, period.  It reeks of being a staged event; that they were withholding content that is again, invaluable to getting the full experience.  That is a subjective observation, but it is a popular one.  That may sound entitled, but trust me... just play through to the ending.  I feel strongly that you will understand.CONCLUSIONDespite everything, despite the mishandling of DLC and an unsatisfying conclusion, I truly feel Mass Effect 3 was an amazing, if not wholly unsatisfying game.  If I'd never played through to the end, it would easily be one of the best games I've ever played.But as it is now, it is a very horrible reminder of the influence publishers like EA can have on the industry; how callously they can mar something that would otherwise be completely beautiful and perfect.  How easily they can create something that could be so beautiful, only to leave their audience with the stark realization of how fleeting and impersonal it actually can be.I recommend you play the game for this reason; so you can see for yourself why you should never buy another EA game without extreme caution again.Thanks for reading.3/5 Stars","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2012"}

Where young Billy Candle stands wrongly accused of murder, and his very own Uncle Ray swears a holy oath to hunt him down and deliver justice at the point of a gun.","reviewerName":"-- \"--\"","summary":"A \"Call\" That Should Be Answered...","reviewText":"\"Call of Juarez\" joins recent games like \"Gun,\" \"Red Dead Revolver,\" and \"Darkwatch\" as yet another Western-themed shooter. Once a genre that scarcely seemed to exist, it is now quickly filling the Western-themed void that seems to exist in Hollywood. Like the aforementioned titles, \"Call of Juarez\" is very good at what it does, and ends up just shy of greatness -- but if you've a mind for more gunslinging', you can't do much better.The plot behind \"Call\" sees half-Mexican troublemaker Billy Candle framed for the murder of his parents and seeking the lost treasure of Juarez that he might finally carve a name for himself in the world. Meanwhile, his vengeful uncle, Reverend Ray, a gunslinger turned man of God, is on his trail spewing fire and brimstone -- er, mostly just fire.The storyline and characters are the best thing \"Call\" has going for it. You will alternate between playing as Billy and his self-righteous Uncle Ray. Billy excels at stealth, platforming, and archery, while Ray is Clint Eastwood incarnate with guns blazin'. The shifts in perspective provide a compelling method of building suspense and filling in the plot gaps, and both characters are so different from one another that each of their respective segments seems to represent a mini-game all its own.Unfortunately, Ray is the by far the standout character. Billy has a decent arch and is fairly likable in his own right, but Ray is worthy of any \"Top Ten Best Video Game Character\" list -- and that's some tough competition. Clad in a leather duster and cruciform breastplate, he strikes an imposing image and is voiced to perfection. There's something inherently fascinating about a character that speaks to God and quotes the Bible between shooting people in the face. He's obviously crazy, and playing crazy is just plain fun.Not only is Ray the best character, his sequences are generally more gratifying due to their action-packed content. He is considerably stronger and more durable than his nephew, and can use weapons that Billy can't even touch. He also has a concentration mode that helps him get the drop on his foes and is pretty useful in a pinch.Billy, on the other hand, is more apt to avoid combat. His bow and arrow sequences are pretty satisfying, but few and far between. More often than not Billy finds himself trapped inside a first-person platformer mixed liberally with a first-person sneaker. The stealth segments are okay, and less reliant on trial and error than some games who make stealth their primary objective -- but it's been done much better in the past, to put it mildly. As far as the platforming sections go, they work as well as they possibly could given the first-person point of view, but it can be hard to properly line up jumps, and dying from an unplanned fall can be quite frustrating. He can use a bullwhip Indiana Jones-style, lashing on to objects and swinging across some chasms -- and though it works fairly well, there's still an awkward quality to it all.That is not to say that some of Billy's missions aren't enjoyable -- they are. But Uncle Ray's blastapalooza trumps it in spades. The only downside to the gunplay is the wonky decision made by the developers to have certain firearms overheat and break in the midst of a battle. You get used to it and learn to plan accordingly, so it's not a dealbreaker -- but simply collecting bullets and swapping weapons like most FPS games would have worked better.Complete with horseback chases, treasure hunts, duels, fistfights, and plenty of shootouts, \"Call\" is a good game for action junkies to invest in -- particularly those who love Westerns with good characters and a solid story. The gameplay is varied, for what its worth (even if it's not always successful), and when it all works it works splendidly well. Complete with top notch production values (some of the game's vistas are breathtaking and evoke the West quite well), this is darn near a can't-miss on a console that could always use one more actioner.Answer the \"Call.\" It's worth it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2007"}

I wont go into whats wrong with this game the other reiview are right on. I just wanted to say saddly that if you are really looking for a sniper game and if you havent played it look for and buy sniper elite. its made for the xbox but it will play in the 360 I know because I have it. graphics are not like the 360 because its made for the xbox, but the game play and long distance head shots makes this game far supperior to sniper ghost warrior. I do wish the the game creators and manufacteror out their stop trying to make a quick buck and sending these sorry nockoff out. the same will happen for the games due out in dec trying to get games out by xmas if its not ready they dont care just send it out anyway. one day maybe they will realize that if they wait and send out a good game it will make more money in the long run than the quick bucks they make send falty games out and before we read the review on them and choose not to buy them right off and wait till the price goes down. but this has been going on for some yrs now and I dont think it will change. the game devlopers working for companys like EAG or other have to do what the boss saids even though it not don yet but it hurts them in the long run, like a actor thats hot now doing a sucky movie if they cant make the studios money they will go from A listers to C. if these game delvopers want to go out and free lance some day then they need to stand up for their games and only send them out when they are sure it worth it. or they will have to keep on staying with the gameing companys and just collet a pay check like any other job. and be consider no talent company workers.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2010"}

I typically enjoy lower budget RPG games, and seeing how I needed another PS4 game, I had to pick up Bound by Flame. Now, while I enjoy this style of game, I didn't love this developer's previous games, so I was a bit skeptical about how this one would turn out. Well, I'm glad to say that I love it. With that said, Bound by Flame isn't perfect, but none of the flaws hamper my enjoyment of it.Firstly, I'll cover the graphics. Due to it being developed on a lower budget and not a \"AAA\" game release, my expectations for the graphics were rather low, but I find this game to be beautiful. The characters don't necessarily look real or animate as if they were real, however many of the textures are actually pretty detailed on PS4. It also runs in 1080p on PS4 with a framerate that was said to fluctuate between 30 and 60, but I've definitely had it drop lower than that. But I really like the art direction, lighting, shadows, etc. For a game that wasn't created on a huge budget, Bound by Flame exceeded my expectations.Secondly, the gameplay is very fun. While not complex or that deep, what's here is quite enjoyable. I especially like a lot of the combat animations; combat maneuvers look more fluid than I was expecting. Even though the gameplay isn't complex, this is an incredibly challenging game that'll challenge most players even on lower difficulty settings.Thirdly, I'll mention exploration since it's a role-playing game. I feel like I must mention that this isn't a massive open world like Skyrim, it's a far more structured RPG like The Witcher II. If I could compare Bound by Flame to any other RPG, it'd actually be The Witcher II. There's a lot to see and do, but it's not a game where you'll get lost because of how enormous it is.Lastly, I'll talk story and characters. The story isn't super original and thus won't blow you away, but I did enjoy my time with it. If you're expecting something on par with some other role-playing games, this may disappoint you, but I found the story to be better than Skyrim which didn't have a memorable narrative, in my opinion. As for characters, some are good and some are not. There's a weird mishmash of solid voice acting and then some that's hilariously bad. It's not Two Worlds bad even at its absolute worst, but it's by no means great at times. But even when the voice acting isn't great, it's pretty entertaining. FYI, the male character is voiced by Travis Touchdown himself, and that makes some of the cheesy lines absolutely amazing.As I end this review, I'll just say that Bound by Flame is Spiders best game to date and my favorite PS4 game, but that shouldn't be a surprise since I love the genre. Seeing how it's slim pickens on these new consoles for the grand adventures that only RPGs offer, beggars can't be choosers. And even then, Bound by Flame is a really good game. That's my two cents.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2014"}

That first one was brilliant, but the sequels only reached varying degrees of \"good\" and \"OK.\"  This Tomb Raider, however, reminds me why I fell in love with the game in the first place.First, the entire game -- and not just Lara -- is beautiful on the X360.  The level of detail in the locations is astounding.  Second, Lara has a decent selection of gadgets and guns to play with.  Everytime someone drops a weapon, she can swap out for it.  Unfortunately, she can only carry two kinds of weapons at a time, one of which is always her pistols with the unlimited ammo.Beyond the graphics and gadgets, though, is the game itself.  They finally went back to the heart of Tomb Raider -- the tombs!  Instead of blasting bad guys through Venice or dodging mummies in Egypt, this Tomb Raider lets you explore tombs and solve puzzles just like the original.  There are plenty of bad guys, sure, but they don't get in the way of just wandering around empty tombs trying to figure out the proper series of switches or levers to activate the centuries-old mechanism protecting the god's idol.  This is finally the sequel that should have been made years ago -- just good, fun tomb raiding.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2006"}

Half the people you come up against will automatically drop and shoot and it gets really old.  I don't know why it's so prevalent in Black Ops 2, because it was only a minor problem in the first Black Ops and even less of a problem in the other CODs.  This needs fixed, and it needs fixed YESTERDAY.I really, really want to like this game.  The Pick 10 is brilliant and a ton of fun to tinker with.  The weapons are fun to use, have a lot of \"pop\", and the graphics overall are fantastic.  But this dropshotting nonsense has got to stop immediately.-- Update 11/15/2012 --After giving this game a lot more time, I've come to the conclusion that Black Ops 2 suffers from many of the same problems that Modern Warfare 2 did.  Let me explain:Modern Warfare 2 put an overemphasis on killstreaks and they also sped up the gameplay.  This was a substantial departure from COD4, against which I measure all CODs.For these two reasons, MW2 was one of my least favorite CODs.  Along came Black Ops, which slowed the game back down.  Call of Duty was strategic again, instead of a killstreak/explosion/camping fest.  It was great.Treyarch obviously did not understand why Black Ops was such a hit, because the things that separated it from MW2 now return:  grenade spam, rocket spam, blah blah blah.  Constant scorestreaks in the air and on the ground.  Objective-based games are absolute cluster****s.  Allowing points from scorestreaks to contribute to the next scorestreak was an utter failure.The game isn't strategic; it's just about who can direct the most explosions and scorestreaks at the objectives.It just isn't fun, which is a crying shame because the game is gorgeous to look at, and Treyarch has always done a phenomenal job with sound.Anyway, back to Black Ops for me!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2012"}

Wii is mainly for the wife and kid, and the Xbox 360 and PS2 for me. This is one of the few games that has gotten me to play the Wii a bit more often than before. I can't think of a better 2D fighter for the Wii; the graphics and onscreen presentation are close to something you'd find on the 360 or PS3... I'm impressed! Character animations are silky smooth and the artwork and character design are fantastic (and I'm not even a Tatsunoko anime fan). Combos are easily executed and special moves get blasted out one after another. I also like the tag team concept. There's not too much story, but a game like this has little time for a story. The action is fast and furious. The more you play and the more times you finish the arcade mode, the more credits you get to unlock new features such as artwork, music, outfit colors, etc. I gave it 4/5 stars only because, for me, it's still not on the same level as fighters such as SSF4.One thing that bothers me about this game is the button-attack set-up. I'm not a big fan of having a 3 button set-up where the same buttons are used for both punches and kicks. It takes away precision and brings the game that much closer to being a simple button-masher. As it is, there is a light, medium, and strong attack, each one producing either a punch or a kick depending on which way you press the directional pad. They should've had an option for a six-button system for seperate punches and kicks to appease Street Fighter vets like me. It's the only thing that prevented me from giving this game five stars.Graphics 8.5/10Sound/ Music 7.5/10Gameplay 9/10Control 8/10Replay 9/10***Update 6/4/10**I recently purchased a PS2 -> GC/ Wii controller adapter and it has made a big difference on this game's control, gameplay, and ultimate playability.

{"product_name":"B00309XHD0","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Fun and scary","reviewText":"This is a slick, action packed and atmospheric game. Having played the first one a year or so ago, I was looking forward to snapping this one up and I wasn't disappointed. You do really need to play the first one before you go for this sequel though, as it follows directly on. This time Isaac has awoken in hosptital after the trauma of Dead Space 1 and finds that the monsters have followed him...your mission is to escape the hospital, get yourself through a whole space colony and back to the dreaded Ishimura ship to settle the whole business.The game looks and feels the same as the first edition, although it does seem more polished and sharp now. The graphics are amazing, everything looks real. Character faces looks like they are actually having emotions. The monsters are hideous and very dangerous. There isn't a lot of let up in the fear of attack...very few places feel 100% safe, and you can be pounced on at any time. Luckily there are some tasty weapons available and these can be upgraded to your liking with items and money that you find scattered about. There are new weapons and monsters this time around, and the location is new too.Some highlights for me are: the residential area where people are seen fleeing in panic, or screaming behind closed doors as monsters attack all around, then the outside sections floating in space, plus the final chapter of the game where you return to the dreaded Ishimura which takes on the atmosphere of some kind of haunted house, as you prowl around the now deserted corridors and chambers - works very well if you remember how you were dashing around these same locations in a panic in the first game. The suspense factor is high - sometimes I was creeping so slowly around corners and through doors, because the game throws a LOT of jump-scares at you. Some of the new monsters are very bothersome, in particular some weird chicken like things that peer at you from behind cover before stampeding at you at lightning speed.It's an 18 certificate for a good reason, there are many gory scenes, lots of nasty looking corpses and body parts, and some wince-making eyeball violence (hint: get the \"eye-injection\" scene wrong just once to see a truly hideous death sequence!).I have nothing but praise for this game, it's so professionally put together and at no point did I think it was unfair or too difficult - in some ways it can be quite easy, but that doesn't mean you won't die a lot!Fully recommended, grab it with the free \"Extraction\" game while the limited edition is out - this is a full game in itself (It's not a 2nd disc, but you download the file onto your PS3 hard-drive from the main game disc). This is a side game played in 1st person using the Move control. I thought this was going to be just a shooter on rails, but there is a lot of variety and its not just about shooting. It's not as good as the main event (I would have been surprised if it had been as it's free!), because you have to use a lot of buttons on the Move controller which is fiddly, but it's still made to the same high standards.Both excellent releases for the PS3, and worth a purchase","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2011"}

The Dpad does transform, but it is still exactly the same overall size. It is still a small size pad which is a bit uncomfortable to use. When I play Wolverine in Marvel vs. Capcom, I still have trouble performing his tornado claw move. The tornado claw is his spinning uppercut move.With a Playstation 3, you can use a special Sega Saturn controller which has a usb cord. The usb cord plugs directly into the Playstation 3. The Sega Saturn controller is the VERY BEST controller for 2D fighting games. It's Dpad is larger than this 360 Dpad, and so it is much more comfortable to use. The Sega Saturn controller is the controller that I use all of the time when I play 2D fighters such as Marvel vs Capcom.Beware that you purchase one that has an official Sega logo on the controller. There is a faulty bootleg version which is missing the Sega logo. The bootleg version has a start button which does not work properly. So make sure that that you purchase a genuine model WITH the official Sega logo on it.If you do not own a Playstation 3, there is a way that you can use a PS2 controller on your Xbox 360. The name of an adaptor that is sold on amazon = \"Max Shooter for Xbox 360\". It is a little expensive, but it does work. I have used it myself. I have the Xbox 360 version of Virtual Fighter, and the Xbox 360 version of Tekken, and I play both of those games with a PS2 controller. The PS2 controller is excellent for 3D fighters.So if you have a PS3, you should really consider a Sega Saturn usb controller.

It's better than its predecessor in  every way, and arguably the best 2-D fighting game to grace the Dreamcast.The amount of playable characters is enough to put any fighting fan's salivary  glands in overdrive. Beginning with favorites such as Spider Man, Wolverine,  Ryu, and Chun Li, players can eventually unlock 56 characters. We had our hands  full just mastering a few of these fighters, and getting familiar with all 56  would take months of intense practice. There are almost too many moves, all  depicted with superb animation and augmented by several tag-team combos. When  the match begins, you can pick three characters. Once things heat up, you can  call in your pals to unleash a massive move on your opponent. This adds  immensely to the game's depth, and button mashers will be in for a shock when  they find that their mistimed tag-team moves backfire.Visually, this game is intense. The large characters are slightly jagged around  the edges, but that's more than compensated for by the massive amount of  animation frames, colorful special effects, and stunning 3-D backgrounds that  are loaded with detail.Marvel vs. Capcom 2also delivers a sonic  performance that is nearly arcade-perfect.

(single-player-only)","reviewText":"I'll admit Killzone 2 took me completely by surprise. I love FPS games but have been consistantly put-off by them being marketed to the multiplayer-only crowd. While Killzone 2 is being marketed and praised for it's online-gaming experience a lot of people are missing one of the best paced and designed single player FPS games in years!The story for Killzone 2 is NOT one of it's highlights but it's not bad. You play as Sev, a soldier who's part of an invasion fleet attacking the 'Helghast' homeworld. You and your crew infultrate strongholds and take part in ground invasions and some vehicle combat while trying to capture the Helghast leader. While the dialogue is pretty bad and not especially well-acted the way events play out in levels really add to the excitment and atmosphere of the gameworld. While you see your characters Sev in some cutscenes, the developers cleverly switch between 1st and 3rd person perspectives depending on the events in the game and it works very well as a story-telling device in getting to know your character (Call of Duty take note!). Again the story's not that unique but the way it's presented is head and shoulders above other FPS fare!The gameplay is what really makes Killzone 2 shine. From the moment you take control of Sev you will notice that the controls behave somewhat sluggishly and take a little getting used to. This may seem like a flaw when you realise every weapon has weight, and every action you do feels like effort but it I felt it actually adds to the excitment in making you feel like a person in the midst of battle. Not even Call of Duty 4 (my favorite all-time FPS so far) has this kind of immersion. You'll do some turret and vehicle combat to break-up the ground sections and these are fun but can't quite compare to the running and gunning. My only problem with Killzone 2's gameplay comes from the cover system: you hold R2 and you crouch behind cover or attatch to walls. This usually works but I hate using the R2 button for anything and the way the PS3 controller's designed my finger kept slipping off the button. Again it's not a bad idea but I would have just preferred a crouch button.The way the game levels play out are also top-notch! When gunning through urban environments you never feel like you're just killing enemy after wave of enemy. You get pinned down a lot and planning is always the best way to win a battle. Like Call of Duty 4 and Gears of War 2, Killzone 2 makes you think about situations and how fight your way out. There's even some clever moments where your character is separated from your squad and you really feel their loss when slowly sneaking your way alone through heavily populated enemy zones.While Killzone 2 isn't perfect it IS one of the best paced and presented FPS games in recent memory. In fact I can list all of it's flaws: shallow story (needs a good hero) , touchy covering (needs a crouch button), a switchable knife weapon (needs a one-button quick melee attack----NO PISTOL-WHIPPING OR RIFLE-BUTTING!), and some slow-down/loading (opt for installation). These may sound like big deals in a game but believe me: they're not. Killzone 2's single-player campaign succeeds in just about EVERYTHING else even more so than it's Resistance counterparts. Those looking for a good single player FPS experience with all the excitement of Call of Duty and Gears of War should look no further. Killzone 2 is one the best games I've ever played!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2010"}

I'm telling you, this game will not disappoint.  Blood, over-the-top action, puzzles, and a great story.  - One of the few games I've played where the software team and the writers have managed to produce a story that is worth unfolding.  Most of the time in action games like this, the story seems to be an afterthought.  Just something to slap together with the game's main focus of fighting and killing. - Not the case with God of war.  GREAT story and great voice acting.STORY:  You're Kratos... ancient Spartan warrior wronged by Ares, the God of War.  You begin a quest to recover Pandora's box, a device that can be used to murder Ares.  Other gods help you along the way and the story of Kratos' past slowly unfolds.  Good stuff.GAMEPLAY:  Lots of good, and lots of aggravating here.. but no bad whatsoever.  The good crosses over into great from time to time; this is an extremely FUN game.  Kratos has two sets of melee weapons along with additional 'god' powers (medusa's gaze, zeus' lightning bolt etc) that he acquires throughout his quest. You'll have lots of fun hosing down amazingly detailed enemies for hours.  There are combo moves and manna fueled magic attacks going on here and its all fun stuff.  You end up needing them both and it all feels very well balanced.- I mentioned aggravating. This is due to the fact that between sharper AI in multiple foes and some flat out ridiculously obnoxious level designs, you will get a little annoyed by this game from time to time.  Some parts just baffled me.. not in that they were too difficult to figure out.. but in the fact that I couldn't figure out why the game's designers put retarded parts as such in the game to begin with. - Almost as if they thought we might have too much fun so they should throw in some B*ll $hitt annoyances just to get under our skin.  It's nothing too detrimental though.  Nothing that takes away from the game's overall enjoyment too too much._ Being a fan of the Greek mythos, I found this game to be particularly enjoyable as the subject matter has been brought to life beautifully.  This game already has some sequels lined up, and personally I can't wait.  This game is an amazing experience that you need to get in on.  Buy it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2005"}

While the PC version offers extras, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare for the PS3 no longer gives you the bonus map pack (or anything else) for paying extra and purchasing the Game of the Year Edition.  Any additional map packs (I found one, the \"Variety Map Pack\") have to be downloaded from the PlayStation store for an extra fee. If you're looking at the GotY edition for the purpose of multiplayer, keep this in mind as nothing extra comes in the GotY and the \"Variety\" map pack costs extra to purchase. The \"bonus map pack\" referred to on Activision's site was a limited-time-only promotion.Now that I've played this game on the PC, XBox 360, and PS3, I have to say that the XBox 360 feels just a bit better--but the PS3's translation is still very good. As a PC Gamer coming to consoles, I have a hard time finding a first-person shooter that I'm even barely competent in. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare for the PS3 has been one of the best translations for me (my other favorite is the Orange Box). It has a very \"playable\" feel, making my WASD-familiar brain feel very comfortable switching over to the PS3's controller.  While I've seen more than one title using very obvious auto-aim, making your reticle snap-to and stick or making anyone in the neighborhood of your shots magically sprout magnets and pull fire to them, CoD: Modern Warfare doesn't do this. Instead it just makes it easier for me to center on my target while I'm running and/or crouching, jumping, etc.--it's like the right stick moves consistently smoother. That makes it just plain easier to multi-task. Given that I typically have some pretty hefty hardware on the PC, I wasn't certain if the PS3 version would match the quality of my high-end gaming machine.  I was pleasantly surprised when things looked just as sharp on the console as they do on the PC:  the programmers definitely took advantage of the PS3's unique hardware.I've now played this game's Single-Player Campaign through more than once, and loved it. Like other titles in the Call of Duty series, it uses team-based play, and simulates your team using the computer to \"drive\" your teammates. Continuing in the tradition of the other titles, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare adds more structure to the missions, more life to the characters, and more depth to the story. You spend most of the game as new recruit 'Soap' MacTavish, but you also get to flash back to an earlier point in the story, play as your commanding officer, and learn more about him.One odd departure from other games is that there are storyline sequences that are not exactly \"playable\", but neither are they cutscenes. You live a segment of the storyline through the eyes of the person going through it. These are short, so they don't frustrate, and what they do is heighten the drama. It's an interesting technique, and because it isn't overused, it works well here to keep the storyline going.Another great pacing trick is that the storyline spans countries. It crosses continents and it puts you in more than one spot: one of my favorites was manning three guns using night-vision cameras aboard a large plane as it provides air support to your team on the ground. Overall, the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare graphics are very detailed, the environments feel authentic, and the sounds impressed me. I liked the dialogue and I really enjoyed the fact that my teammates seemed to be somewhat intelligent. There were some really neat goals in each mission, and I have fond memories of the adrenaline rush. I'm delighted that they made a Modern Warfare 2.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002I08RR8","description":"","reviewerName":"Ammy_Evaluator","summary":"Gorgeous visuals, excellent gameplay, absorbing story","reviewText":"Visuals, Gameplay, and Story - what more can you ask of a game?After I sat out the previous Assassin's Creed games, I was not so sure if it would be a good idea to start playing from the middle of the series. Well - after about 9 straight game playing hours, I can safely say that tomorrow is shot, and I have had a blast with this game!What works well?1. The visuals are gorgeous -Whether it is Ezio's motion-cap as he climbs up and down walls; or the smooth cinematic swordplay; or the sights and sounds of medieval Constantinople; or the haunting melodic soundtrack; this feels so much more than just a game. The reflection from the pool of water in the Yerebatan Cistern is to be experienced. The graphics are beyond awesome!2. Gameplay is excellentThis is a fast paced action game, with deep elements of strategy. This definitely isn't a button masher, as it is important to maintain stealth through many missions.Voice acting is wonderful - with authentic-sounding Italian accents (at least to my ears). The characters are also well fleshed out - and you certainly meet some intriguing ones in your travels, including Yusuf Tazim who teaches Ezio bomb crafting and the use of the hook blade.In addition, the gameplay is extremely varied - with many mini-games such as a Benhur style chariot race and a tower defense sequence where you must protect your den from waves of incoming enemy troops.There's also an eagle vision mode which works much like Detective mode in Arkham Asylum, and helps identify your foes and discover clues in the environment (mostly treasure).3. Absorbing storyOnce I started, I literally could not stop. Being new to this series, I probably should have begun by playing the first few games. Not being familiar with Desmond, Altair, and Ezio, it was much harder to get invested in their problems. Likewise, not knowing what the Animus is, can really put a crimp in your enjoyment. Despite that I still managed to enjoy the game.What doesn't work well?The climbing mechanics are nowhere as forgiving as you would encounter in games like Infamous or Uncharted. Every wrong move you make is penalized with a long slow drop, often to your death.In addition, the crowds keep getting in your way - and while it is realistic, crowd behavior can be annoying when they constantly complain as you try to get through them.Finally, for those new to the franchise, I would note that the combat system is quite complex. In addition to the standard Primary and Secondary Attack buttons, there are moves to disarm your opponent (R1+square); to perform a hook and throw combination (R1 + tap O); to throw a heavy weapon (Hold Square and release); etc. There's even a X to kick the opponent to throw off his defense. All in all - this was a bit too complex for me, personally - so I tended to stay within a smaller subset of the combos.Did I enjoy this game? Without a doubt yes. This is motion-cap based gaming at its best - you can almost swear that it is a human rather than a CG generated image at times.Definitely a winner from Ubisoft!Happy Playing!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2011"}

You see, I have been using my credit cards online for many years.  So far, I have not had any difficulty because I have chosen the online merchants wisely.  I always purchase from the likes of Amazon, J&R;, Best Buy, and JCrew.  Unfortunately, our friends over at Microsoft are probably not as efficient in their handling of your account.  And they do not have the same level of commitment to the purchaser as say, Amazon has.  I expect for that to improve, as the Marketplace continues to evolve and develop.  Once MS realizes that they do not yet have a tight hold on the video game market as they do the software market, they will give more focus to customer service.In short, what I am saying is to use a card like this for your dealings with XBox Live.  Please don't get me wrong.  I enjoy visiting the Marketplace.  I regularly download movies and other content from that place.  And I have always found the selection to be more than adequate.  A little caution never hurts though, especially with MS.This card is also a perfect gift for anyone who owns an XBox and shops at the Marketplace.  However, make sure that your purchase meets the requirement for free shipping.  The overall objective is not only to protect your credit card, but to also save as much money on those points as you can.  They are expensive enough as it is.Sure, once you do the math, the prices are a bit high.  For example, it will cost you close to $7, including tax, to purchase 500 points.  One high definition movie will cost you 480 points!  Now, understand that you are \"renting\" the movie.  Once you start to play the movie, you have one day to finish it.  If you do not immediatley play the movie, you will have fourteen days to do so.  Once the movie license has expired, you will no longer be able to play it.  And, you do not get the \"special features\" that come with the DVD.  However, I find this more than acceptable because this is one way to enjoy high definition movies without having to purchase the external HD-DVD player.  My hope is that the rental prices will decrease very soon.Ok, Citan knows it's inconvenient to purchase a card just to add points to your XBox Live account.  That's sort of like making three right turns just to go left.  But given the nature of the situation, this might be an instance where the hassle is worth it.  And the price of those points are the same, whichever way you go.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2007"}

Don't know why the other reviews are so positive.","reviewText":"The Good: Otherworld areas are fun, fun end boss, free roaming area is a good ideaThe Bad: Broken frustrating combat, side quests are nigh impossible to solve, everything is too cryptic, dated horrid graphics, glitches and framerate isues abound, nonsense endings, disappointing storySilent Hill has been one of my favorite series of all time. I remember renting this as a kid and being so scared that I couldn't finish it. The last great game was Origins which truly brought the game back to its roots on PSP and PS2. Homecoming was a surprisingly good entry into the next generation, but Downpour is an utter disaster. The team claimed they were going to bring the series back to its roots and redeem the series. They only made the series worse with so many things gone wrong that I can't believe this game made it onto store shelves. Is there anything good about it? Sure, if you are a hardcore fan you will probably play it anyway, but it will leave a nasty taste in your mouth. If you have never played the series before, stay far away from this and pick up any other game in the series.You play as a prisoner named Murphy Pendleton who gets into a shady deal to kill the supposed killer of his son. Murphy has been charged for the murder, but for some reason he is being transferred. Upon this transfer the bus crashes and only you and one female officer survive. So far the game seems fine. You wander around a bit until you start finding clues on how to progress. Once you get out of the first area and into the \"free roaming world\" that's when things really fall apart.Silent Hill is meant to be a linear story where you search a building and figure out what to do. The team tried putting in \"side quests\" here that are just absurdly cryptic and nearly impossible to solve without some sort of walkthrough. Even with a walkthrough I gave up on a few because the world you wander around in is no fun to navigate! They put a convenient subway system in to fast travel, but you need to do one of these hair brained side quests to unlock the routes! Who's brilliant idea was that? One side quest called \"Shadow Play\" has Murphy trying to find several different trinkets in cardboard boxes throughout town. In this huge confusing mess how am I supposed to find tiny little trinkets in cardboard boxes? Then you have to figure out where to put them, then you have to use your UV light to get the shadow they cast just right. Then you use those clues to find a place to get stupid loot like pistol bullets or an axe. Not worth it.The game is littered with these pointless and meaningless side quests that are nigh impossible to figure out. Even the main parts of the story are hard because these areas are huge and vast and confusing to navigate, even the traditional Silent Hill map system doesn't work. In fact, the puzzles are even confusing and are broken. Some times they won't activate, or are so cryptic and confusing that you just give up on it. The only fun parts are the Otherworld sections, but even these have their problems.In the Otherworld you engage in chase sequences running from some sort of void that is never explained. Usually are you running in labyrinthine paths that are confusing and will make you die often. Solving puzzles in the Otherworld is fun because they are like other Silent Hill games, and the only puzzles that are. There's some interesting art being used here, but in the rest of the game it is not Silent Hill-ish at all. In fact, I'm ashamed to call this a Silent Hill game.To make things even worse the combat is absolutely horrible. It makes exploring Silent Hill harder, and makes you want to just quit the game. No matter how much you swing your weapon you will always have a hard time hitting these boring, non-scary monsters. All four of them. That's right. Just four monster types in the whole game. The monsters always move faster than you and they can block. Their attacks are frustrating and blocking doesn't do any good. Once you start swinging after a block they dodge and just hit you over and over again. The combat is clunky, frustrating, and there are way too many enemies thrown at you at once. It doesn't help that when it rains enemy count is higher and they are harder to kill and do more damage. Firearms are scarce as it is, but even an axe breaks after a few swings.It doesn't help that the game just isn't scary. There are a few moments that made me jump, but just a few. The enemy designs are stupid and lame (all of them are humanoid), and the atmosphere doesn't hit home. The legendary music is even missing here with repeated sound effects. The graphics are ugly and outdated; this really looked like a good Xbox 1 game. The story isn't even that great with some plot holes and stupid endings. There's framerate issues abound, and the auto-save is unfair and will drop you off back to a spot where you have to do entire levels over again.Overall, Downpour is a complete disaster, and any Silent Hill fan will act like this game never existed. This is the worst Silent Hill game ever made, and it just chock full of problems with very few redeeming qualities. The Otherworld parts are fun, but there are only four of them and they aren't that long. There's a cool end boss, but other than that this is nothing like a Silent Hill game should be.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0009SQF0C","reviewerName":"Charles B Valentino","summary":"An awesome world, a decent game","reviewText":"You are Jimmy Hopkins, a neglected teen who has been expelled from every boarding school his mom has shoved him in. You've been sent as a result to one of the world's worst. Bullworth Academy, a place where parents send mean kids so they can forget about them. As a result you resolve to come out on top of all the other bullies, sociopaths, and corrupt staff members. The story is told with a wicked sense of humor that parodies school life the way we all remember and hate it. You'll have a blast playing it and laugh out loud more than a few times.Bully is definitely a worthy game to own for all you GTA fans out there. Think of it as GTA Light. You are able to free roam a gorgeous town as a troublesome teenager, solving problems, or just being a nuisance. The level of violence is limited though. Probably the most violent thing you can do to someone is hit them with a baseball bat, and you cannot \"kill\" anyone. You can just hurt them really bad. To the game's credit, it punishes those who would use their abilities to abuse women or children by spawning policemen or prefects close by to bust you almost immediately.The world you play in is beautiful. Whereas GTA games sacrifice detail for size a lot of the time, Bully doesn't need to. As a teen, your transportation choices aren't as swift but the town is also not as large. So the developers packed more points of interest into an area the size of a town instead of a big city. The result is a town with a LOT of personality and atmosphere.Gameplay:  The fighting design is decent, though not perfect. It's a pain to be running and shuffling through weapons when suddenly you whip out the skateboard accidentally and completely screw yourself. Also, why can't the  skateboard be a weapon itself? The minigames are fun and the rewards are significant for completing classes.  Frankly, this game makes you want to avoid skipping class if you can. Interactions with characters are also fun. You can insult, complement, give gifts, give wedgies, pinch girls, make-out, and you can also do humiliating finishing moves on opponents. As I stated before, transportation is limited. You can ride a skateboard and as the game progresses, graduate to a bike, then better bikes. You can also find access to mopeds and go-karts eventually. Riding around is a lot of fun in this town, especially with the best bike or the go-kart. You will have the opportunity to race often.The town offers such attractions as: a carnival (rides,games,freak show,souvenirs), barber shops/salons (change your hair style), clothing stores (your wardrobe), bike shops (rent a sweet ride), grocery stores (stock up on eggs, spraypaint, soda pop), and various hangouts to crash in or vandalize. I love the fact that you can win new hang-outs throughout town that act as your home away from school. The town is complete with cushy suburbs, docks, a dam, slums, an industrial district, a trailer park, a train depot with a network of track, and also an undeveloped area with bike trails. You also experience seasonal changes as the school year progresses and even get to be a nuisance on Halloween and Christmas. They even simulate riding a bike/skateboard in the snow. The attention to detail is superb.Sound: AWESOME!!! I say this because the town's/school's personality really emerges with the audio. I laughed my butt off passing by random conversations people were having in the boys dorm/the cafeteria/the comic book store/etc. They spent a lot of time on this and you could spend hours just walking by people listening to them gab. Once again, superb voice over work for a Rockstar title. The music is also mood enhancing without being distracting or grating. It makes for good atmosphere.Graphics/Animation: The style was somewhere between a cartoon and a Norman Rockwell painting. I liked it and it was realistic enough to be relateable without seeming cartoony. In fact, the expression in the animation was better than most games and also added to the game's personality.Replay value: I will play again soon as there are easter eggs I missed finding, but the biggest problem with this game was that it wasn't particularly difficult. I didn't feel very challenged by a lot of the missions, particularly the ones that didn't involve fist fights. Later in the game, my arsenal of weapons was so diverse that fights were even easy. Whereas a room full of bad guys used to be a challenge, after getting a spud gun, they became a 10 second obstacle.Ultimately, I loved exploring this game. You will undoubtedly love it too despite the lack of intense violence, the combat can be challenging and fun. If you've ever been through high school you will appreciate this game's sense of humor. In fact, even if you're not a teen right now, it will likely help you fulfill your fantasy of what you would have liked teenhood to be like. Frankly, who didn't want to be the biggest bad_ss in school?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2006"}

E Jackson","summary":"Mario's first jump into the land of 3D platforming stinks","reviewText":"I'm pretty sick and tired of people calling Super Mario 64 a classic.  It's not.  Just because it's significant and influential in helping pave the way for future Mario titles doesn't mean Super Mario 64 is deserving of its classic status, or that it's any fun to actually play.  Super Mario Galaxy came along and pretty much improved every single aspect of Super Mario 64 so you basically no longer have to play this game other than to get a dated taste of mid 90's gaming history.  The only other possible reason someone would play Super Mario 64 is because they desperately seek open world exploration, and this is basically the only Mario platformer that can at least attempt to satisfy gamers with that particular appetite.  Not that I personally believe the game succeeds at the exploring aspect either.The biggest problem is that so much of the land you explore consists of emptiness.  Oh sure you'll see trees, ramps, castles, buildings, enemies such as goombas, chain chomps, badly and laughably animated thwomps lifting up and slamming down, pokeys, rolling boulders, and other things that have become a trademark of the Mario series, but the amount of items to find and collect is *extremely* limited to coins (both yellow and red ones) and the occasional power-up that enables Mario to either fly (which admittedly is pretty fun) or obtain the incredibly boring metal cap that makes Mario invincible.  An alternative to the starman perhaps, with lousy side effects (Mario can't jump as high or far while wearing the metal cap).When you're not experiencing the endless disappointment that is running across empty and boring lands and basically doing nothing but wasting time, you're jumping across a series of unspectacular and very ordinary-presented platforms over and *over* again.  This stuff seriously resembles a beginners course for developing platforms.  It's extremely basic game design.  The platforms are generic square-shaped tiles for you to jump across that quite often are all the same exact size.  It gets monotonous almost immediately.  Only unreasonable Nintendo fans would eat this stuff up, seriously.  Anybody else would obviously be able to detect flawed, repetitive gameplay.  The 2D Mario games move at such a swift pace that you don't even have time to stop and notice the platforms (unless you're an extremely slow gamer).  This is mainly because you don't have to stop and situate Mario a certain way for the purpose of making the perfect jump which is what severely ruins Super Mario 64's gameplay.  And don't EVEN say my skills are horrible when it's obvious through countless youtube videos that several gamers have the same exact issue.While I'm by no means someone who cares about the best graphics available, you gotta admit the ones here have dated horrendously with embarrassing blocky shapes pretty much occupying most areas of the game.  The buildings, water and trees in particular are just awful for the eyes.  Nothing appealing whatsoever about any of the graphics- even the bright inviting colors don't lure me in but rather rub me the wrong way and force some of us older gamers to recall the unpleasant days of Mario Paint.You have to collect 120 stars in order to complete the game 100% but guess what?  Many of the stars are flat out boring to collect due to being pathetically easy and basically being handed to you within minutes.  What kind of challenge is that?  The one where you have to swim around and open treasure chests in a certain order is baby-ish, and the one where you swim around collecting 8 predictably located red coins inside a basic building near the beginning of the game is offensive.  Or how about simply stomping a post into a ground to release a gate and thus, release the star?  Don't even *think* about mentioning the ones where you walk up to Toad and he simply hands you the star.  Granted, the game seems to always alternate easy star-collecting challenges with longer and more drawn out ones as a way to balance things out but that's the problem- the stars are either too easy or too long.  There is one star mission so awful it makes your inevitable death seem like something to anticipate- the one where you have to jump across a series of moving poles.  You have to jump at *just* the right moment while making sure you're positioned in the right spot.  This takes forever and is dreadfully annoying.Also, what's up with all the little baby games?  Grab a baby penguin and slide down a snowy hill?  Chase the bunny so he doesn't hop away?  These are not suitable for anyone who recalls the challenging portions of previous 2D gaming such as Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Mario World (and yes, these bunny grabbing missions are flaws in Super Mario Galaxy too, in case you think I'm intentionally favoring Super Mario Galaxy for no reason).  At least the cannon-shooting parts are cool.  It's fun figuring out where to launch Mario so he can land safely on upper grounds.I can't help but feel the red star collecting is overrated.  When you collect red stars in Yoshi's Island, you feel like you're given a really elaborate and perfectly executed assignment since you also have to collect flowers and stars to 100% complete a stage.  It's a lot to do not to mention really darn exciting and satisfying once you've acquired all these items, and constantly keeps your attention span in check while searching for them.  Super Mario 64 basically takes that one red coin-collecting element of Yoshi's Island and makes it a main priority here.  You often have to collect 8 red coins per stage (opposed to 20 in Yoshi's Island) to obtain one of the 120 stars.  Ugh.But nothing NOTHING is worse than the fact you have to re-enter stages over and over again just to grab all the stars that are located throughout.  To me this is unquestionably lazy game design.  How can it be anything else?  Who in their right mind would actually *want* to keep going back to the same exact stage ad nauseam?  Super Mario World was guilty of this too granted but not NEARLY to this exaggerated extent.  A terrible idea that gives a false impression a game has replay value but it's exactly the opposite- once you go through the same stage a bunch of times and finally accomplish everything there is to offer, you won't want to repeat these same objectives ever again.  So... you probably won't want to play Super Mario 64 ever again.  Even worse- when you often have to search for 100 coins to obtain a star.  This can take up to 20 minutes and bore you the entire time.  Being forced to collect 100 coins is a lazy way of assuring gamers don't leave any stone unturned because you basically have to thoroughly search every nook and cranny of a stage to even *find* 100 of them.I also dislike how many of the classic enemies aren't included here such as the hammer brothers, buzzy beetles, bloopers, and cheep cheeps.  Even the koopa troopa is nowhere to be seen (well, other than that one race in the beginning).  You can ride a koopa shell like a skateboard but that doesn't count as an enemy appearance.  He's not a true enemy here.  Why is that?  Why not include all the familiar and well-loved enemies that have become a trademark to the Mario series?  They ruin the pirahna plants by the way.  Why is he sleeping?  Granted he comes alive when you get near, but it's a really weird concept.  At least Nintendo got the boos and haunted house right- a surprising and exciting maze-like high point of the game.  It's a lot of fun sorting through each room of the haunted house stages.  *That's* how you design a memorable stage.  Obviously if you weren't busy running around through several vast and average-designed empty fields of grass, there could have EASILY been room for the inclusion of more enemies.  Hey I'm all for open world exploration, but you have to actually fill in those areas with exciting, creative items that are both fun and rewarding to collect for the player, and enemies that present threatening encounters and a rush of excitement.  Simply throwing Mario into a big 3D world because it's his first grand 3D adventure truthfully isn't going to get the job done I'm afraid.  More needs to be done.Constantly having to rearrange the camera so you can see where you're actually going is a nuisance.  Nobody likes dealing with a camera while jumping around trying to play a video game, but granted, several games back in the mid to late 90's were guilty of the same camera problems since developers were still getting their feet wet so to speak, and figuring out the best way to help players accurately and conveniently see what's ahead.  Still, you'll lose more than a few lives due to bad camera angles in Super Mario 64.  I guarantee it.  One thing I *do* like about this game is how fast Mario runs.  It's a fast-moving game, which helps going from point A to point B more convenient. Also some of the wall jumps and triple jumps are fun to execute.  Reminds me of Super Metroid in that respect.  Yoshi is teased in this game (I won't spoil how) but he's not actually playable which doesn't make sense.  Why make an appearance if he's not going to be playable?The music is either extremely good (the brilliant peaceful moodiness of the water theme and the intimidating and exciting heavy metal-like Bowser fights) or downright horrendous (everything else, which consists of annoying nursery rhyme children's themes inappropriate and painfully skull-smashing for the rest of us).  I can't STAND the theme songs that play in Whomp's Fortress and Rainbow Ride- two unforgivable themes that make me want to smash my brains in whenever I play Super Mario Galaxy 2 where they return in all their overbearingly annoying glory.  Rainbow Ride in particular reminds me of a county hayride where kids ride around on tractors (not to mention the stage itself is extremely tedious and overlong).  The snowy mountain stage with the Italian accordion music is sickening and out of place.  Just mute the volume on your TV to make life easier for yourself.  The boss fights are incredibly simplistic- grab Bowser's tail, spin him around and toss him, or pick up/stomp other bosses.  Basic, boring stuff.A few stages that are actually fun include Lethal Lava Land where the platforms convincingly feel like an upgrade into the 3D world from the original Super Mario Bros. castle levels (not to mention better/more interesting use of platform jumping compared to the rest of the levels in SM64), Shifting Sand Land since it's packed with obstacles and enemies (and reasonably challenging overall), and Tall Tall Mountain's tricky climb to the top (involving a vine climbing portion).  In fact, to be fair, Tall Tall Mountain is one of the best levels ever in a 3D Mario game.  It's *that* good.  Bowser's castle levels are pretty solid as well, mostly due to the fast-paced nature of them.Several things feel tacky- the 1-ups and coins are small, dark, ugly looking, and clumsily made due to less than spectacular graphics and game design, and overall Super Mario 64 is just a really lackluster and highly overrated game.  If not for influence, this game would have been forgotten and the superior Super Mario Galaxy series would have prevailed even more dominantly than they already do.  Oh and don't even mention the cake-eating storyline.  It's atrocious.  The fact they brought it back for the Galaxy series makes me want to vomit.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2006"}

However, a friend of mine got me hooked on Tony Hawk 2 for the Playstation and I was surprised at how much I thoroughly enjoyed it.  So, once I got my GameCube, Tony Hawk 3 was the second game I bought (after Rogue Leader, obviously!!).  I can say, unequivocally, that THPS 3 far surpasses its predecessors.  Not only are levels and gameplay more appealing rewardingly challening, this game also benefits tremendously from being on the GameCube platform.  I have played this game on PS2, as well, and it is a great deal more frustrating.  The key to what makes the GameCube version of THPS 3 so much better is how it takes advantage of the asymmetrical control pad.  Unlike the Playstation systems, GameCube's control buttons are set up in a manner where you do not need to be nearly as conscious of the buttons you are pressing, thereby freeing the player to focus more on what is happening on the screen (thus being more effective).  The buttons on the GameCube control have different sizes, shapes and placements on the pad which allows the player to know which button does which simply by feel, as opposed to the Playstation buttons which are all the same except for the design on each of them (forcing the player to be conscious of what buttons he or she is pressing).  Control issues aside, though, this game is fabulous.  It's just challenging enough without being frustrating.  I was personally able to accomplish 49 out of the 54 goals and got silver medals on the three competition levels before I had to resort to the cheats.  Games like this (along with Rogue Leader), in my estimation, give GameCube the early leg up in the Next Generation system wars with X-Box and PS2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2002"}

The game I played immediately before HL2 was the latest Splinter Cell. The difference in the two games is stark as Chaos Theory operates with a completely static environment. Chairs, tables, boxes are all completely immovable as if the entire world were cast from a single block of steel. Half Life 2, on the other hand has an incredibly malleable environment. Cinder blocks can be picked up and placed down with actually physical weight. Plastic barrels bob around in water. Wooden platforms collapse when supports are taken out. If the bottom box of a stacking is removed the rest of the boxes collapse realistically. Manipulating the environment is nothing new but Half Life's physics are probably as close to reality as has ever been done in a game.One of the biggest problems since the advent of 3D environments has been the clipping problem. How many times has a guy collapsed to the ground only to have his head pass right through a nearby wall or his gun float eerily in the air? HL2 seems to have somewhat solved the clipping problem and that alone makes it groundbreaking. Rather than phase into a wall people collapse and lean against them. The only other game I ever saw with this good of a treatment of physical barriers was Eternal Darkness on the GameCube. It's still not perfect as bodies can still merge with boxes but it's a definite improvement on most 3D games.The other physical effect I loved was the treatment of water. If you have a system that can handle full water reflection it... looks... AMAZING. The water really does look like water. In some games water tends to look more like it has the consistency of silver Mercury but HL2 nails it. Looking up from within water has an amazing distorting effect that I haven't seen since Mario Sunshine.As good as it is there is still room for improvement. You don't really pick up items so much as have them hover before you. Also, you can't seem to turn or tilt items. If you pick up a barrel that's lying on its side you don't seem to be able to tilt it and lay it on its end. You can kind of smack it around until it might randomly pop onto its end but it's not quite the way things work in reality. There was one time in the game when a door seemed to get caught on a collapsed body. There seemed to be no way to close the door and it was blocking my path so I ended up having to go back to a previous save. Still, these are complaints aimed at a game with the best physical effects I've ever seen. NL2 will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the all time great games and a definite advancement in the field of physical simulations.Half Life 2 requires a hefty system. I got an excellent frame rate and maxed out all visual stats except for a few effects like anti-aliasing.

Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game.

WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player.

{"product_name":"B002I0J82G","description":"","reviewerName":"Adron Gardner","summary":"It's still Battlefield, mostly","reviewText":"Ok, I gunned half through a few hours of single player simply for the trophies and then dropped it for a few hours into the MP end of stuff.  This is an early rummage of thoughts to give some people on the fence an idea of what they are getting into. Even most of the PC reviews out there have been pretty vague.  I haven't cleared this 100% for the Platinum or put in 100 hours of ranking.  But I have been playing Battlefield games for awhile so some early thoughts after a few hours.First off -- 200+ meg update before you can play then you're off to the races.  Battlefield:  Bad Company 2 was similar to Crysis, in that you could navigate the landscape the way you wanted, within an admittedly small area.  Wooden huts and hideouts were for the destroying if you were so inclined.  In Battlefield 3, you are literally led by the nose with little blue and red boxes on EXACTLY what to do.  It's pretty insulting.  Walk one foot too far this way or that way, and you are immediately told to \"RETURN TO THE BATTLEFIELD.\"  The levels are much more confined than the last game, but I think they went way too far on the scripted confrontations. On the realism end, there is a a few instances where a Marine will drop dead right in front of you and the other soldiers will just walk right by.  Pretty lame, Marines don't tend to do that sort of thing.  So the story sucks, but nobody reads Playboy for the articles right?  Character models are not the strong point here.  Where in CoD, everything looks like shiny plaster, here they look like clay .  The environment textures look good most of the time, but occasionally do load slowly.  Also, first thing I would do, is jack up the controller sensitivity, the default setting is way too slow.  So far, I see a real missed opportunity in the single player end.  I don't know why they just don't take the large maps from multiplayer and come up with a story based task for the single player.  Corridor shooting needs to finally die.  Anyway, the campaign doesn't do much new thus far, but there are good points.  The audio is absolutely stunning.  On my surround sound, the bullet hits and muzzle sounds are really awesome.But playing Battlefield by yourself is like buying a banana just to eat the peels.There is the new seemingly obligatory online pass to jump through and then you are greeted with a \"free\" M1911 pistol reward.  Yay.Online, there are still some occaisional collision problems from the beta.  I have been sapped by a LMG more than once half stuck in the floor geometry of a building, but other than that the game does play pretty good.  This is Battlefield - so when you can spawn on a boat and grab some airpower - you'll probably crash right away.  haha.  It happens every time.  In 1943 it took me awhile to get the plane over Suribachi too.  But there is a new feeling of dominance gunning around with the Apache's instead of just having tanks or jeeps with machine gun mounts.  I haven't had too much time with the jets in Conquest yet, but I'm getting there.  Tanks are still the main fun for me.  There's nothing more satisfying than blasting down an entire roof where a sniper is camped out stopping your troops from getting the Gas Station capture point.  Bullet drop with snipers from BC2 seems less pronounced or it may be a placebo.Maps range from  HUGE to more conventional \"CoD\" style boxes for deathmatch.  For me, TDM really is pointless in this type of game but it is a game mode that never seems to die no matter what game they put it in.  Whatever, I prefer the larger skirmishes with objectives, but I think the larger maps do bring up the obvious.  This game is probably better played on the PC for one real reason and it has nothing to do with graphics.  The PC will hold 64 players - and that is where the real meat of the series has always been.  Eventually, I'll probably up for the PC sku when I can afford an upgraded rig, but this does well for now.Battlefield 3 is not for everybody.  Black Ops this is not.  MW2, this is not.  You cannot hide in a tin roof building like in Favela during an Apache onslaught and expect to ride out the bulletstorm.  You can't run around and knife from 10 meters away.  If you played Battlefield BC2, MoH, or even the PSN/XBL 1943, then you'll know what you're getting into here. Weapons sway, reloading takes time and there's no MW2 pinball score counters.  If you are curious and big on CoD quick turn maps where you can noob tube to a nuke with OMA - this is probably not your game.  Battlefield matches can be long drawn out affairs and inching your way on foot to objectives or blasting your way through buildings to a flag is a better way to success.  Not to say the knifing isn't useful.  If you don't play as a team - you will have a very bad day.  FYI you can't jump off the top of a three-story building doing a 360 turn and pop a guy in the head with an Intervention and run off into the sunset with a 73-7 k/d in Scrapyard with the chopper gunner singing in the background.  Battlefield isn't about killstreaks, it is about a 'battlefield.'  Ironic I know.  Battlefield 3 pretty much holds to the history of the franchise thus far.  There are some mistakes here and there - all of them in the single player end - mostly because I feel it is a mistake to try to compete with Call of Duty.  Call of Duty is a slowed down Quake 3 - fun but aging, fake and in no way a war game.  Battlefield 3, on the other hand, is pretty much the game it was 10 years ago, but now with much better graphics, more lethal vehicles and stunning sound design.  Don't buy into the hype one way or the other.  But if you're tired of endless 'nade spamming, chopper gunner spamming, host lag, knife spamming, and want something objective based - give Battlefield 3 a look.*****UPDATE:  I'm going to just drop a few last pieces in and leave it at that.  Right now I'm rocking the ever popular M416, suppressor, bi-pod and Holo with the M26.  There was a point around level 7 or 8 where you really start making a weapon your own with the sights, rail attachments and the game really starts to come into it's own.  It no longer feels like the early \"grind\" and you start to know the maps.  Even TDM starts to make sense at least on Metr&oacute;. Though CQB is still clumsy.  I haven't touched the single player again - and I doubt I will.  Frame rates could be a tad better, but this was built for a PC with SLI cards, so what can you do?  Oh and the Battlelog stats site is ripped almost completely from the Killzone stats site.  Go figure.  Not sure if Xbox live lobbies are back up yet, but 3/4 time I get dropped immediately into a game from PSN.  Once in awhile I get kicked during search.  Server list is helpful and would be welcome in any other console FPS.  I'm in for the long haul.  If you got the stomach for the climb to level 45, it's worth it.  There are few things more rewarding in online gamedom than making a push with a good team in conquest, hopping over a rail to heal a fallen teammate and throwing up cover fire with a well tuned weapon with an Abrahms tank on your back blasting the wall of an apartment building with laser sights bouncing around on your position to take the win.  Hard to find this type of experience anywhere else.*****I've got my MW3 preorder in on the 360 but I absolutely have to post this.  It's so funny because I think it's true.Look up -- 14 Ways to Spot a CoD player in Battlefield 3 on the OXM UK website.*****Well I caved. Finished a new PC build with a Core i5 2500 and 2 GTX 560 ti's.  Battlefield 3 runs like glass.  EA's Origin is awful, but the game is just stunning.  Maps are much bigger and even single player earns a few points back.  I'll still be playing on PSN, but the PC version has to be seen in motion to be believed. If anybody has any questions on the differences, let me know.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2011"}

Sanford","summary":"Desperate for an RPG?","reviewText":"I haven't played the first Two Worlds, so I can't vouch for whatever improvements.I'll assume you've read other reviews, and have the basics of this game down. The game/story is divided into 4 chapters. I found Chapter 2 most fun; you've gained a few levels, so you don't die so much, and there's lots to do. Chapter 1 has a great ending, but Chapter 3 feels real short, and Chapter 4 is basically just the final boss battle.Overall, it's a decent game, but not great. It's not as good as Dragon Age, but still fun (Four Star Fun, Three Star Overall). As far as RPG's go, Fallout 3 is a better game.Supposedly, there's a completely different campaign for on-line multiplayer, but no on-couch co-op.Pro's:It's pretty fun to run around and kill baddies. You can do a lot of sprinting to and from enemies during combat, unless you get swarmed.The magic system is very customizable, though you need to level up quite a bit to make is usable. You can make crazy spells by combining the components in the form of cards. There's a similar mechanic with making potions (which, thankfully, is optional if you don't want to deal with it).Lots of customizing with leveling up. You can choose which stats and skills to upgrade, and there are lots of them, so you can favor your playing style. Even better, you can do \"regressions\", which allow you to redistribute your points. This is only limited by how much money you have. (speaking of which, I ended the game with @ 130K in coins, so money is not an issue from the middle of the game on.)You can save your progress at *almost* any point in the game. There didn't seem to be any limit to number of game saves.You can have three completely different armor/weapon sets, which you can switch on the fly. So, you can find some baddies, shoot a couple arrows, cast a couple spells, and then close to melee with a pole arm or sword.There are lots of ways to kill baddies, including being sneaky and setting traps, running in with upgraded weapons/armor, and setting off tons of spells, or any combination.Con's:You start VERY weak, and I could only make any headway by using a bow A LOT in the early phases.Glitchy, at times. I became trapped on the landscape at times, and couldn't teleport or jump out, so had to restart.The final boss battle is TERRIBLE. It's one of those battles you have to complete in one shot, or else redo the entire battle, which is pretty tedious. The real bummer is this: You spend all your time perfecting your weapons, and don't get to use it against the boss, but instead have to use a clumsy ballista mechanic (Hello, Dragon Age!).Some of the baddies are tedious to kill.Some of the graphics are just silly looking. Related, your character has very few phrases he says when encountering enemies, and they're all dumb. This makes the game feel unfinished, or rushed.Enemy AI is easy to exploit. Sometimes enemies with get stuck and run in place while you pound them with arrows. Sure, you don't die, but it ain't fun or challenging.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0002BJQDY","description":"Guild Warstakes the best elements of today's massively multiplayer online games and combines them with a new mission-based design that eliminates the tedium of those games. You can meet new friends in towns or outposts, form a party, and then go tackle a quest together. Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder.You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.Built for CompetitionAfter learning the game and building up your first character, you may choose to test your skills in head-to-head competition or guild warfare. The game is designed to reward player skill and teamwork, not time spent playing, so you won't need to spend hundreds of hours leveling up your character to compete.The game includes integrated support for guilds, with guild banners and halls, chat rooms and forums. Guilds can challenge other guilds to battle, compete for control of key parts of the world, and be ranked on a worldwide ladder.Unique Streaming TechnologyArenaNet's unique streaming technology forever eliminates the concept of patching a game. You don't have to wait a month for the next big patch to experience new content. Instead, the game constantly and intelligently streams new content to your computer in the background while you play. The world can change continually. This allows us to build a much more dynamic game world than any that has existed before.","reviewerName":"Merryjuice \"Bukkake Boy\"","summary":"My Comparison to Guild Wars vs. World of Warcraft","reviewText":"I have played World of Warcraft (WoW) for quite some time.  Guild Wars and WoW are probably two of the most popular online RPGs right now, I felt there should be a review that compares the two side by side.  These are my own personal opinions on the advantages and disadvantages of playing Guild Wars and is mostly geared toward those who understand WoW mechanics.Disadvantages of Guild Wars:- Cumbersome UI, very difficult to send /tells or /whispers in-game.  Vent Servers are a must if you're PvPing with guildmates.  WoW is streamlined in this case.- No Jump button. You can't jump down to other areas, despite being two feet away from it.  This was so annoying when I didn't know where to go.- Click attacking.  I hate it.  You can tab-target mobs and enemies, but in order to take a swing at them you need to use your mouse button and aim/click their icon.  WoW lets you have an attack button if you wish, or you can click.- Below Average Community.  Good luck finding help with quests in the game, or help with finding an NPC.  You can't tell who is where in your guild, and sending random tells for help rarely get answered.Advantages:- Caters to casual.  This is a game for people who enjoy RPGs, but aren't into actually \"becoming\" their characters.  The game actually tells you in your chat bar when to take a break (Usually two hours logged in).- No Increased time commitment.  WoW sucks you in initially with the easy interface, but requires more and more time if you want to progress in content after the level cap.  You can essentially play the same amount in Guild Wars from the beginning to end, and still be able to see everything in the game.- Enjoyable PvP.  I was very suprised how incredibly hard it was to take someone down.  You don't get \"one-shotted\" by a warlock like in WoW or lose half your health to a critical strike form a rogue.  90% of the pvp has nothing to do with your gear, but what skills you bring into the fight.  Yes there are classes better suited to kill others, but it isn't as easy as you might believe.  Fights last minutes, not seconds.  You need real strategy to take someone down, not superior gear.- Balanced.  WoW has progressively gotten worse with balancing classes (ask any Paladin or end-game Rogue).  Guild Wars has the best balance of each class, and the ability to redo your character for free at any time.  No time commitment necessary.- Progressive PvE.  Despite the stigma that end-game Guild Wars is all PvP, there is actually a 40+ hour PvE based storyline for each campaign (120 hours total, not including other modes).  There is even a hard mode after you finish the normal one.  Similar to the \"heroic\" dungeons of WoW.- Easy quest / crafting system.  You don't need a guide to follow the quests or to craft in the game.  Read the instructions in-game and you can figure it out on your own.  Quests are marked on your map, no need for sites to tell you the location.- Free Max Level PvP character.  You don't need to be level 70 or 80 to enjoy PvP content anymore.  Just make one in 5 minutes.- No loot wars!  I've seen plenty of guilds disband over loot systems and DKP crap.  Loot is essentially eliminated in Guild Wars, so all that is looked at is progression.Synopsis:Guild Wars essentially \"woke me up\" to the fact that I don't have to spend more time playing a game to enjoy the benefits.  I simply don't enjoy WoW end-game as much as I do Guild Wars and made the switch based on that.I recommend Guild Wars to any WoW veteran that doesn't have a lot of time to invest in online RPGs anymore, but still enjoys playing one.  WoW is a great game, but the developers tend to push you a certain way and require a greater time commitment for \"the good stuff\".  I believe Guild Wars was developed for people who want to enjoy the good stuff but still want to enjoy real life.  With the game being 30 dollars since I wrote this review and free to play, picking up a copy wouldn't hurt if you're interested in trying something different.  Guild Wars may not be considered the best or most played MMO out there, but it certainly changed my perspective.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2007"}

{"product_name":"B001G8M738","reviewerName":"Kyle Slayzar","summary":"Darn You Bejeweled!!  I'm Addicted Now!!","reviewText":"I've always been a fan of Tetris and other puzzle games that serve nothing more than a mental workout for your brain.  Even Brain Age II for the Nintendo DS continues to hold my attention whenever I'm waiting.  Bejewled Twist (\"BT\") is another one of those games that ranks among my other brain teasers.BT has a very simple concept.  You have several jewels on a screen and the goal is to match at least three in a row to get points.  When you score a \"match\" they disappear and the ones above it come down accordingly.  To make the concept a little more interesting, you get elemental varibles such as explosives and lightning blocks when you get four or five jewel matches respectively.  You create the matches by using a 2x2 circular twister that turns the jewels clockwise only (hence the name Bejeweled Twist).There are a few modes but the one most of us will be playing is Zen mode, where you have unlimited time to come up with your next move.  I believe most players will use this since many of us are in \"solitaire\" mode, where we carefully weigh our options before we move.  I have tried the blitz mode, where you have explosive rounds that have a time limit, but I ultimately went back to zen mode.The game is very addicting.  I started playing after my shift at midnight and the next thing I knew it was three in the morning and I wasn't even tired.  It's enough to rack my brain for hours and not get boring.  In fact, I'm only limited in my time by how sore my butt is and not bored I am with the game.The music is... well, addicting yet weird.  It's like techno meets elevator music meets coffee shop hippy music.  I guess the word for the music would be \"techno zen.\"  One song in particularly makes me laugh and that is the one that has some girl saying \"sissy-ta!\" every few minutes.  It's weird, but addicting as if they had more \"sissy-ta!\" I would be singing along.  They also could use more cowbell.Another amusing point is the voice.  If God's dog could talk, it would sound like this guy.  It sounds omnipotent, but very dumb at the same time especially when it says, \"goodbye.\"All in all, BT is a pretty good investment if you want a simple game that holds up its entertainment value over time.  Too often do we spend up to $60 on a game and they only last a week.  It's been over one week and I'm still playing BT and I anticipate I will continue to do so for a while.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2008"}
{"product_name":"B003O6EB70","description":"","reviewerName":"Evildead11","summary":"A Decent Game, But Completely Over-Hyped","reviewText":"I know that reviews of video games are very subjective and everyone will have their own opinion.  However, I'm a little astonished at the amount of high praise this game is getting.  I mean, don't get me wrong, it's not a bad game at all.  It's a decent shooter with a decent story, decent voice acting and decent graphics.  That's it - it's a decent game.  This game is not, however, \"excellent\" or \"outstanding\".  The visuals are not \"breathtaking\" or \"jaw dropping\". Actually, the chick that you're tasked with rescuing looks very cartoon-like in my opinion.  Really, most of the visuals look a little cartoony.  The gameplay is fairly solid - it operates like any decent FPS.  Your access to weaponry is pretty broad, yet you are only able to carry two weapons at a time, which is sort of a drag.  And you'll be spending a lot of time looting trashcans and such for coin with which to buy ammo and upgrades for them.  It has a unique skyrail system that is sort of cool, but it doesn't really have much substance to it.  Melee is smooth for a FPS and has some pretty brutal moments, which is nice.  There is no real inventory management to be had - everything you pick up in terms of health or \"salts\" (magic juice?) is consumed immediately.  Enemies are predictable and easy to dispatch, especially once you have an established shield.  Moreover, the enemies lack variety (droves of soldiers, crow dudes, eagle robots, etc.) and I found myself getting bored dipatching of them over time.  It's really all unremarkable.Now, the game certainly has some racist tones.  This doesn't bother me at all - I mean, the game is set in a time when racist thinking was rampant in the country.  However, if the game is going to stay true to American history (depictions of the forefathers are everywhere, for example), how in the hell did someone come up with the technology to float an entire city?  An underwater city is at least fathomable.  It's really kind of silly.  Then again, I know it's just a game and not meant to be completely in touch with reality, so I digress.I'm a fan of the Bioshock franchise - I really liked the frist two games.  For my money, the original Bioshock was the best.  I guess I prefer the dark, creepy atmosphere and the insanity that surrounded the first two games.  Maybe Infinite is just too bright and colorful for me.  I just can't seem to love this game like I'd hoped I would.  I don't want to bash BI, because it is a pretty good game...but I think my expectations were a little too high or something, because I just don't think it's great.  I'm giving this a high rating (4/5) just based it being an above average game as a whole...but it really is just above average.  Under water Bioshock beats in the sky Bioshock hands down.PROS- Good FPS control scheme- Good voice acting- Decent story (although you will spend a few hours on this game before you have any clue why you're doing what you're doing)- Decent graphicsCONS- Game saves when it wants to and too far apart- No inventory management- Choices you make throughout the game really mean nothing- Decent graphics (BUT a little too cartoon-like)- Can get tedious and dare I say it, boringOVERALL: (A very generous 4/5)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2013"}

The turn based squad strategy is simple to get the hang of but as the game develops you are constantly adopting new strategies. It boils down into a balance of keeping characters safe while completing the objective. The former became more important to me as I progressed. You start each mission with X amount of points tanks, troops, and  special abilities all cost points. Once you select a unit there is a movement bar you can also have your unit fire their weapon or throw a grenade separate from the movement bar. When your points expire you end your turn, you can also save points that will be added to the total next round.As I played the game I built a squad of characters I really enjoyed and it mattered if they went down in the line of battle. There are two types of characters main and side. The main characters are used throughout the story and all have there own personalities, the side characters are used only in combat but also have personality with there own design and catch phrases. There is a barracks where you can pick your squad, upgrade units, equipment, and battle commands which act as spells.  Being an RPG it has a grind area where you can go and battle over maps again and again. More often than not you'll learn a tactic that works for the map but every now and again the enemy will change things up. The hardest part of the game sadly is the beginning not the end.In the beginning you learn the limitations of what you can and cannot do as well as what works and what doesn't work. Most missions have the same objective to capture the enemy held area while loosing is having your main battle tank die. The graphics are beautiful having a water color look. The story is childish but enough not to hinder the game. The DLC was ok worth the ten dollars but if not played won't be missed. This and XCOM are examples of how great this genre of game can be.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SY77E","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Tactical Combat in a Sci-fi World","reviewText":"Crisis is a great Sci-Fi adventure where you're armed with a nano-suit and an arsenal of weapons.  You must use brute force, stealth, and your wits, to save the Earth from enemies, both extra-terrestrial and domestic.Story: 8/10This is more than a basic, \"There are the bad guys, now go kill them\" story.  Crysis 3 also takes a look into humanity and self-sacrifice.  You play as Prophet and your mission is to exterminate enemy forces who have set up a militarized zone as well as any alien stragglers left behind from the last game.  Unfortunately, the story is small in scope and there are only a handful of characters.  The story is told mostly in cutscenes and unfortunately, many of the scenes are over-acted.Gameplay: 9/10The gameplay is very tactical and it allows the Player to take on the missions (and optional side missions) any way they choose.  You find generic upgrades in the world and apply those to your nano-suit.  Less powerful upgrades cost 1 to unlock, while the more powerful ones cost 3.  You can have 4 upgrades equipped at any time.  You can also store 3 Sets of 4 Upgrades from your Pause menu and access them with the push of a button.  The upgrades range from Increased Armor, Powerful Melee, Faster Shooting, Faster Running, Longer Stealth, etc...  So, you can use these to customize your play style.  The perks that you use will also evolve and give you additional stat bonuses.  So, if you have an armor perk and you take lots of damage, the armor will evolve to provide increased protection.  If you want to sneak in and ambush enemies, you can use 4 stealth / speed perks.  If you want to charge into battle, you can use health and armor perks.  Complete your missions the way that you want to complete them!Prophet also has an arsenal of weapons: Grenades, Charges, Rockets, Sniper Rifles, Assault Rifles, Short Range Weapons, and a Bow that you can use while in Stealth mode.  You can also hack automated enemy defenses like gun turrets and mine fields and turn them on your enemies.Levels: 8/10The levels are large and offer multiple ways to complete them.  So, you may need to sneak into an enemy base and sabotage 3 power sources.  Start with Stealth and turn the enemy automated guns and mines on your enemies.  Then hide in the shadows... or out in the open with your stealth camouflage and pick off some guards with your bow.  When the enemy forces have been weakened, swap in your Assault Perks and charge them head on to finish them off.  How you accomplish the missions is up to you.Graphics: 10/10There are city levels, alien levels, jungle levels, and enemy base levels.  The lighting, the cloth effects, the special effects, enemies, animations, all look awesome!Sound: 9/10The sound effects are OK.  The SFX punctuate the action and the background music is atmospheric.  But the acting could be better.Maturity: TeenI know the game says M, but this is just a sci-fi war game.  There is some swearing and some blood, but no gore or anything gruesome.  It's no worse than any war movie or cop drama.Replay Value: 9/10The main campaign is only 7 missions long and you can finish it in 6 or 7 hours in the default setting.  You can probably finish it much faster if you don't use stealth.  There are 4 difficulty levels.  In addition to the Single Player Campaign is Vs Multiplayer.  There a many modes to choose from: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Defend / Assault areas, Capture the Flag.  As you play multiplayer, you can gain XP and level up / customize your character.Overall: 8.5/10Crysis 3 is a great looking, fun FPS, that rewards strategic thinking.  Every mission gives you multiple ways to complete it and you can customize your character to suit your style of play.  Crysis 3 is also really cheap right now at $15.  It's a great deal!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2014"}

Sure, Wolfenstein 3D was the first big hit, but Doom...that was THE FPS game. Now after a decade, we have the third chapter in the Doom saga...though it probably isn't appropriate to call this game &quot;Doom 3&quot;.More of a &quot;Doom: Redux&quot;, this game basically takes the first Doom, modernizes it, and adds strong plot. The character designs are outstanding, and the demons have never looked better. Being surprised by the zombies shambling out of the darkness is a terrifying experience...more than once I found myself almost jumping out of my seat in shock. I didn't find it particularly funny when an 'Imp' pulled a metal staircase in half and crawled out of it as I was trying to ascend it. Speaking of which, I had never been afraid of the Imps in the previous Doom games, but Doom 3 is a whole different story. All of the classic monsters have returned with horrifying new designs and upgrades...it takes skill and cunning just to mow down one imp in the early stages of the game.The production values are outanding...the initial invasion is undoubtedly one of the most memorable game experiences I've ever had. Watching the horror over security monitors and hearing the terror of your fellow marines over radio chatter (think the first major battle scene from the movie Aliens) adds a whole new level of horror to the game. That, combined with the claustrophobic, pitch black environments make this game one of the most terrifying game experiences around. Half the time I didn't even want to turn on my flashlight to look at what is lurking in the darkness.Those who whine about the levels being claustrophobic are probably too young to remember Doom, or simply don't understand what the game is trying to do. The claustrophobia is an intentional and necessary part of the Doom gameplay experience, and always has been. Now, it has been increased tenfold and is scarier than ever. The game is mostly about senseless carnage like the previous games, true...but its not completely about random violence. The plot keeps the game moving quite nicely.You've probably heard the rumors, and the rumors are true: you need a MONSTER rig to run this game. I'm running the game at medium detail and there are still points where it gets almost too choppy to play. However, even on medium detail, the game runs smoothly, and the detail is amazing. I haven't played a game that has looked this good on the computer in a while, if ever. It is the high demands of the game that sort of take it down a notch for me, but I can deal with running the game at medium detail...it still looks and plays fantastic. Another point that fans were angry about is the disappearing bodies...only zombie bodies stay on the ground, whereas the demon bodies burn up and fade. Many fans expressed negativity about this, considering the original Doom experience was mostly about admiring the body count and carnage.Overall this is a quality FPS. It is terrifying, gory, and well scripted. The in-game events with demons crashing through cielings and walls and ripping down doors is intense and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. As the pamphlet that comes with the game suggests: close your door, turns off the lights, and crank your sound...and immerse yourself in the Doom 3 experience. I couldn't agree more. The long wait has paid off...Doom 3 has hit hard and fast, and is an outstanding game experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Jack M.

This is the Playstation 3's premier title, surpassing even the excellent Uncharted and Infamous games. It's rare that gamers are treated to a game of this caliber, but Naughty Dog has delivered a genre-defining experience that will make you demand more from game developers in the future. Consider The Last of Us to be the new standard.The Last of Us hits a homerun on presentation. Bringing excellent voice acting, animations, soundtrack, environmental detail, and a whole lot of care into every other facet of the game's presentation, Naughty Dog has shown that they're one of the finest developers in the gaming industry.The gameplay is mostly a mix of stealth and action, which is a nice change of pace from Uncharted. The Last of Us is all about survival, and you'll have to try your damnedest to stay alive in some of the intense scenarios this game throws at you.The Last of Us is a journey that ends in a satisfying way. You don't get some poorly done cliffhanger ending here, but a quality narrative from beginning to end, constantly getting even better with the more time you put into it.

A spy novel. You're there, reading, all immersed, suddenly you get to chapter 6 and the book turns into \"Dungeons and Dragons.\" You're like \"What the hell\" so you read thru, and in chapter 7 it turns back to a spy novel. As you keep reading the book, every 6 or so chapters, it's back to \"Dungeons and Dragons\", before going back to being an awesome spy novel.That's what this game is like.I'm talking about the BOSS FIGHTS, which are lame, stupid and ridiculous, and don't belong in a game like this.I sat there from the beginning pumping every point into STEALTH.Suddenly I'm there facing a russian mobster boss mob, every time he snorts coke, he becomes invincible, rushes you with a knife, you put clip after clip of ammo into him and it barely does any damage. I use my stealth to set up mines. Then draw him in. He runs thru the mines, loses like %1 health.Are you goddamn kidding me.Are we still playing a spy game?After every region in the game, is a boss fight exactly like this. Where basically stealth doesn't work, flashbangs don't affect him, grenades and mines do no damage, if you sneak up and melee him, he will shred you in under 5 seconds.There is a very specific way to beat bosses in this game, it requires alot of running around (to avoid melee) and using \"chain shot\" from the pistol tree to defeat.Basically when the boss runs at you, run away. When he stops, shoot him with a rifle/smg/shotty. Every time chain shot rechages, hit him in the head with it. Just keep running and do this for 2-3 minutes, and that's how you defeat the boss.It's stupid.The developers must have been doing drugs when they thought this up.OTHER than the boss fights, I loved every minute of this game. The storyline is rich and deep. You feel like you're in a spy movie. The graphics are nice, the artwork is great. The voice acting is ridiculously good. The dialogue is wonderful. The music is spot on.But then you get to the boss fights and spy game turns into goddamn super mario brothers.I don't care about the bugs. I've gotten stuck on a wall exactly one time. The game has crashed about 3 times (usually after 3-4 hours of playing.)I love sneaking around, choking enemies, using the assault rifle when I get detected, it's perfect.

It had a very big premise it seemed to convey back before it was being released. You could customize your character so thoroughly and such. It is a FPS and has a team fortress 2 feel to it while your playing. There are different groups you can choose such as a gunner, a mechanic, a medic, etc.The plot is one of a FPS, if your into FPS games you wont really care probably. If your not the story wont really get you interested all that much.I spent the first half an hour trying to design a character I wanted (unfortunately most of the stuff you want to use are locked until you unlock them during game so kinda loses the point at first, maybe a good way to reward players for playing but its such a mundane thing I feel its a waste to lock it at the beginning or have to unlock it during game play but whatever). Then got right into the story, which lasted about 2 minutes then it was time to start playing.You basically have to capture or guard points in the maps (just like team fortress in a way) and thats pretty much as far as I could see happening. Each time you die (which seems to happen quite often) you just respawn after so many seconds and go back to fighting. The other thing is if you don't die you start to run out of ammo pretty easily and it seems easier to just get yourself killed then try to get more ammo.The shooting aspects were kinda bad. I guess it was for PS3 so joystick controls do kinda stink for being very accurate. After a while I just got bored of the game though. Sorry I didn't finish it so my review can't be that accurate but when your bored playing a FPS game you know something is wrong. If I wanted to play team fortress 2 I would go play (for free I might add) team fortress 2 for PC (steam).Pros:1. Customization for characters and stuff2. ... ah....3...... um.. Kinda looks cool I guess?4... I got nothin.Cons:1. Having to play a bit just to unlock a few things that are meaningless other then making your character look different.2. The game kinda encourages you to get yourself killed (in that you run low on ammo and its easier to kill yourself and spawn with more ammo then to run around wasting time trying to get ammo from dead bodies or team mates)3. Story is kinda blah. Didn't really pull me in all that much.4. A team fortress 2 clone in a way.5. Confusing at times on what/how your suppose to do something.6. On PS3 the shooting aren't that accurate as they would be for a PC version and a mouseI guess I should have tried to finish the game but it was just so boring that I lost interest in trying to keep playing. Some people who want a change in pace or a different type of FPS game might enjoy this game at least for a little while. Maybe someday ill get back into it and finish it but you never know. Anyways hope my review helped. That's all for now.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0086V5V8G","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian Hawkinson","summary":"A decent stealth game...","reviewText":"I've played a lot of video games in the past, and a couple of them have been from the Splinter Cell family from the original Xbox.  Wanting to move in to the next generation I decided to give this one a go.  Personally I think the storyline was pretty decent.  I felt engaged in the story and liked the missions.  Graphically I was pretty impressed.  I mean some scenes felt like I was watching a move the way they wrote it and developed the two together, and not all of those were CGI, which is even more impressive.  I love this feel, as though I'm a character in a movie.  This was well done on Ubisoft's part.  Game play mechanics take a little getting use to.  I don't play stealth games too often, so I died a lot early on.  Early on I just couldn't find the stealth approach even though I was doing what I was supposed to be doing.  No matter the path I went I was always spotted.  Eventually I gave up, parked in a corner, and just picked them off.  Sometimes I'd stand next to a fence where they could clearly see me and pick them off one by one, all the while their looking around wondering where the shooting is coming from.  This only happened a few times and was a little annoying, but the AI usually was pretty damn good.There seemed to be a lot of pathways blocked.  An early mission, you are supposed to infiltrate a police station from a side entrance.  I went to the left successfully not being seen, when all of a sudden I'm bumping up against an invisible wall and can't go anywhere else.  Turn around and see the other side of the street has a whole in the wall.  I wish these invisible walls would be dealt with better as there were many times I'd be sneaking along and suddenly stopped for no reason.  Finally, the command ship, although it seems a bit too large, is a nice addition.  It reminds me of Mass Effect and had the same feel when walking around.  I can't really comment on multiplayer because for some reason I could never find a match.  I'd sit there searching for a server only to give up and return to the single player.  All in all a pretty good game.4 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2013"}

I mean the resolution and texture detail is noticeably lower on X360, but the XB1 has 6-8x the resources and yet it doesn't look that much better.  It is basically the same game.  Blueprint (the team that ported it to X360) did a very good job.Performance wise, it's even more similar.  If you watch Digital Foundry's performance analysis at eurogamer, the X360 version's framerate is a bit lower overall, but I'd say it's actually more consistent.  XB1 runs at 60fps when nothing is going on, but dips to the 40s and sometimes the 30s when titans are on screen.  The X360 version runs 40-50fps for the most part, always staying above 30fps.  And for those who prefer a more consistent framerate, there's an option to lock it to 30fps, which also pretty much eliminates the screen tearing.  This option is not available on XB1.Anyone looking to buy Titanfall probably already know what it's about, so I won't talk about the game itself.  I'll just say that it's a fun game.  Revolutionary?  Not in my opinion, but it's definitely good.While Titanfall looks noticeably better on XB1, it is not a looker on any platform, and it is basically the same game.  So if you already own an X360 and are still considering buying an XB1 for Titanfall, I would take a good look at both versions before you decide.  You could possibly save $450-$500.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2014"}

You can customize your game and not use your focus ability which is like telling you some helpful hints and collectable locations.  Other settings that you can adjust are the ability to be detected, take damage and not be able to knock anybody out or kill anyone.  If you are spotted or knock someone out, you have to restart the last checkpoint.  Also with these settings, you won&#8217;t be able to equip lethal arrows so they can be sold off for money.  All of these setting can be adjusted by turning them on or off but it&#8217;s all up to you.  My first playthrough was 25 hours with custom settings and it was very challenging.My second playthrough was 16 hours which was collectables and challenges which are other achievements.  Each mission you are given secondary objectives such as getting headshots with arrows, don&#8217;t be detected, collect all the loot, don&#8217;t take damage, and don&#8217;t kill anybody, pickpocket enemies and so forth.  If you complete these, you will be given extra money at the end of the mission.What to do with all of the money that you earn? You buy upgrades for you armor, Blackjack damage (club to knock people out), your Bow, Arrows, carrying capacities, more arrows, health and such.This game is just like Deus Ex but without the options to pick the conversation responses and all the side missions are given by three people.  Unlike Deus Ex, you have to find the right person at the right time to get the side mission, in Deus Ex, you can talk to these three people and have all the side missions opened up.

Bethesda did a great job of translating one of the classic RPGs of the 90's into the age of realistic graphics. The story is good and simple, the mood music is great, one notch below KOTOR and Mass Effect. Liam Neeson was great.

The short story info is that Sonic is trying to help a Gennie keep some powerful rings from falling into the hands of an evil Djinn so he can't take over the Arabian nights world.  The levels are pretty much from all past Sonic games basically racing through collecting gold rings, bopping enemies along your path, and trying to get the highest score and fastest time on the level.  There is one thing that made it a little more entertaining is that Sonic has two magic rings and with enough points can upgrade them to speed up time or slow it down(Ala Prince of Persia.).  The one annoying hassle I had with this game was the idiotic camera angles they used,  there's one level where there are dinosaurs and you have a couple of triceratops chasing you, as you're trying to outrun them you have to dodge certain obstacles in your path,  not a problem if you have a front view but this area only gave you the backwards view as such you didn't have enough time to dodge the obstacles in your path since you don't see them until it was to late.  Now you do have the ring and can slow down time but here's a little drawback on that as well, you have to power up the rings with white power globes in the levels if you don't have enough power the rings won't work and you have to gather a great deal of these power globes to make the rings work.  For me at the end it was to boring and to annoying to bother with this game while there  might be some cute cut-scenes with Sonic at the end it just turned out to be a three dimensional running game,  and as I said it just seemed to reminiscent of past Sonic games and while you first play it it seems fun after ten minutes the enjoyment wears thin.  So for the price and for any hardcore Sonic fans than sure buy it today,  but if you're getting this and expecting more than just the running through levels than pass this over and try something else....","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2008"}

Leonard","summary":"The Guitar Hero franchise is redeemed","reviewText":"The flow of the game is much like it was in GH3, where you started off with easy songs and you unlocked new venues while you completed them.  The difference is that it adds the, in my opinion, the best parts of Guitar Hero World Tour.  I cannot say that I'm the number one Metallica fan, since I haven't heard all of their songs.  But this game showcases some of the best compositions from this band, and adds much more with the songs performed by the other bands in the song list.  Not all of them are songs that I would listen to, but there's bound to be songs in this game that you'll like; if you're a Metal Head.Pros:  Solos are challenging, and they combine the classic strum solos as well as utilize the newer slide bar riffs.  The game has several great songs that are challenging.  Customizable characters, guitars, and you can purchase instruments that are used by Metallica.Cons:  I'm not trying to knock down Robert Trujilo; but having Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted in the game, playing the songs they helped create, would have made it better.  Lyrics are censored for content in a game rated T, and it's a bit blashpemous to edit Metallica and System of a Down.There are a few bands that I would like to have a GH game dedicated to, and Metallica is one of them.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2009"}

However, the gameplay puzzles are really very similar to one another. I did have some big trouble getting through some puzzles and I'm not quite finished yet.

I would wait until price is reduced by at least $20 then i say its worth it.7/27/2011 Add-on after further play: I feel i need to give more perspective to potential buyers now that I have played a few more hours. I am trying to be objective but the big fans I'm sure will make negative comments in regards to my opinion. Anyway, the more I played this I have to say everything in this game looks like PS2. Graphics are okay, but the cutscenes really are not that hot. The game stays really repetitive, puzzles really change very little. I am tired of hearing the word edge. The cell phone calls are juvenile at best. Watching the clock move for the entire 10 seconds is ridiculous, we get the point that time is moving, do we actually have to sit and watch the clock move for that long (play demo you'll know what I'm talking about.  this game is simply not a full game, the puzzles are fun for a while, but that's about it.

Where else can you beat your enemies simply by jumping on them in order to get past them to complete each level? It is so addictive to try and get through the levels.With Duck Hunt, I may not have played it as much as Super Mario Bros., but whenever I did, it was pretty fun to shoot at ducks and have your hunting dog to go retrieve them, or at clay pigeons, probably because I always cheated and sat really close to the television screen and take a whack at game.It may have been a while since I played this game, but I still have fond memories of it.

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists.

Basically you play as one of four character types on the planet of Pandora.  Your goal is to find and open the \"Vault\" which remains a topic of local lore.  Your character choice determines what extra bonus skill.  Once the bus doors open in town and you exit the bus, you're on your own.  It's time to make your way through the barren wasteland.  And the world is just that; a barren wasteland where better days have been gone for a long time.The graphics are great.  They're not designed to be 100% realistic.  They've got a cartoonish edge to them that really works.  There are tons of monsters available and they have various skills and levels.  So as you level up, the monsters will level up too.  The game can be tough but now we have to talk about the guns.  Basically, a good gun can make an entire section of the game simple.  The game has a random gun generator so that you won't know just what guns you'll find in the game.  Some of them set enemies on fire!  Some make them explode.  And some electrocute your enemies.  So when you find a good gun with a good rate of fire, it makes that part of the game that much easier.  Plus the guns are all different.  Some  have scopes so you can play from afar and blast away.  Others are close range like some of the pistols and the shotguns.  There's so much freedom in how you want to play.The story won't reveal itself until you start undertaking more of the missions. Basically everyone on the planet wants to find the vault and survive.  Mostly survive.  And everything seems to want to eat you.  So if you want more of the story, you'll have to do some of the side missions of which there are a ton.  The side missions will have you moving from area to area to kill/locate stuff.  They have enough variety that I haven't gotten bored.  Plus you'll find new guns and stronger enemies the further you go.  And basically, you'll have fun looking for the guns.  This is a really fun game that I would highly encourage you not to miss!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0047TLIBU","description":"","reviewerName":"T. H. Johnson","summary":"This is not better than the first","reviewText":"I'm new to Dragon Age. I purchased origins for the PS3 last month. I loved it so much I bought awakening and Dragon Age 2. I've finished awakening with one of my characters not too long ago and decided I couldn't wait and popped in DA2. After only two hours of game play I don't even know if I want to finish it. The graphics are good, I like the look of the characters (namely the elves), and I love that the main character can speak. What I don't like about it so far is everything else. The radical menu sucks; I barely see what I'm doing. I just see a bunch of neon colors and in tiny print, the title of each menu. I've only used it once or twice and now avoid it. Setting up attributes and abilities suck. I don't know why they call it console friendly when the attributes and abilities menu in origins was easier to navigate. The fighting is just hack and slash with no reason behind it. I just push buttons and do moves, big deal. I don't even care about setting up tactics in this game. I also don't even care about the inventory. Seriously, why did they change the entire inventory screen?? Was that really necessary? I hate clicking on bodies to loot, what is up with that ugly eye sore neon orange? Just let it sparkle like before. Checking quests and maps are a pain in the a$$! I can't even understand what the heck I am doing or even going. i just click on the map see there's a quest there and go, then run around the limited map until I reach the mission then hack slash cut scene.  I also don't see how I can build relationships with these companions when you can't even stop and talk to them. In origins I was able to just stop and talk to Alistair or Zevran et al to ask them whatever I wanted or sometimes they would stop me to tell me something. In this game you click on them and get random dialogue and nothing. I noticed this in awakening and did not like it but I figured that it was an expansion so it wasn't a big deal. Now I see that some bonehead at Bioware thought this was a good idea. Right now I care nothing for these characters and nothing for this city they are stuck in. I thought that once I get the money raised for the deep roads it would lead me to the rest of Fereldan for the story. But it seems like (from reading some spoilers) is that this one city is all there is to the game.Anyway, I agree with the reviewer that said they fixed what was never broken. I believe that. The combat was fine the way it was, the menus were fine, the attribute and abilities section was fine, the inventory sections, and the character interactions were all fine in origins. Instead they focused on changing all  of that while adding neon coloring everywhere and a story that seems to be going nowhere. I have no reason to care about Hawke right now.Update: I've played the game for a while and given it much thought. I admit that I like the new combat system as it is much faster and more engaging than the original. Although I still wish that I could see my tactics play out much better.  The companions seem to have problems getting to the enemies when obstacles are in the way. Which can get annoying, especially at the end. I am still tired of looking at Kirkwall and wish the game had more locale. I do like the friendship-Rivalry system and how you can still form a romance with characters no matter which path you choose. I do however, still wish that I can talk to them more like in origins. There are some characters that I love, like Varric, Fenris, and Isabella but I wonder if it is more of a case of me having to play the game more than once to get to know them. I do like Hawke now after playing the story completely. Anyway, I hope that DA3 gives us more companion interaction as I've felt like an outsider not really getting how Hawke formed such close bonds with these characters when I barely knew them. I was just left assuming that he did instead of watching it truly play out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2013"}

Great alternative to treadmills and step classes.","reviewText":"The first thing to know about Walk It Out is that it's not a \"video game\" in the traditional sense of the word. There are no puzzles to solve, no targets to shoot at, no time limits, and no levels to conquer.What it is is a stunningly rich and deep virtual environment where you walk, and walk, and walk. The virtual world is a beautifully drawn cartoon world, with parks, beaches, ocean views, buildings, bridges, and trees. The time in the virtual world matches real world time: during the day you can admire the vast blue skies with beautiful cloud formations; at night, you can walk under a stunningly beautiful starry sky.The way the game works, a soundtrack will play catchy music continuously in the background, and you simply have to step precisely to the beat. Each time you hit the beat perfectly, you get a \"chip\". Miss the beat, and you get \"chips\" deducted.You can choose one of two options for a controller: a Wii Balance Board or a Dance Dance Revolution Pad. I found both to be very responsive as far as detecting my foot movements, although I preferred the DDR dance pad because it gave me more options of where to put my feet (unlike DDR, it doesn't matter where on the dance pad you put your feet, as long as you step to the rhythm). If you don't have either, you can always use a Wii remote and a nunchuk, although you'll be giving your arms a workout instead of walking. In any case, you can also use the Wii remote to look around as you're walking.After you earn enough chips, you can use them to unlock different things in the game. You can unlock up to 120 new songs (some from well-known artists like Demi Lovato and The Black Eyed Peas), 69 route branches (to open up new roads), 3346 town elements (items ranging from trees and street signs to suspension bridges, 24 magical clocks (to allow you to change the in-game time), 12 zodiac signs (to build constellations in the night sky), and 7 rainbow spheres (to build a rainbow in the daylight).If you've played games like Super Mario Bros or Lego Indiana Jones, you know that it's addictive to collect coins in a game. And I admit, it is really addictive to collect as many chips as possible to unlock as much of your world as you can. It was a brilliant move on the part of Konami to take such addictive concepts in video games and combine them with walking--you have so much fun exploring and unlocking your picturesque virtual world, you don't really care that you spent an hour stepping just to get enough points to do so.You can save your progress any time, and a status screen will tell you how much of the map and how many things you unlocked, how many calories you burned, and how many actual miles you walked.In many ways, Konami was brilliant to focus just on walking as exercise. While it seems there are dozens of Wii exercise titles that all do the same old calisthenics, boxing and running exercises, Konami decided to focus on a popular area of exercise that's untapped. Studies that show that sustained walking is one of the very best forms of exercise there is, and 67 million Americans walk regularly for exercise, whether as step exercises, walking on a treadmill, or just strolling outdoors.If you've ever tried walking for exercise, you know it can get a bit boring. But Konami has done a great job in making it fun. If you, like me, have ever been bored to tears walking on a treadmill and staring into space, this is the game for you. While it's not the end all and be all of exercise games, it'll certainly provide you some good aerobic exercise and will make a great addition to any Wii fitness routine.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2010"}

I only got into this game recently, due to the fact that I honestly am not a fan of any of the previous titles. I bought the first one forever ago when it was still new, and then I bought the PS2 Triple Pack of the last 3 in the series, but I didn't like any of them. I felt as if they were ultra scripted in every detail of what you did, and I just could't get into that style of gameplay.

The greatest part of this game is piecing things together, something I really enjoy in video games. I like being able look into all the different possible ways I can kill these guys. Like for example, you may be able to kill a guy behind the alley when no ones looking with your piano wire, or you could wait for the target to put himself into a situation where you can set up a trap that appears as though it was a simple accident. Like putting poison in someones drugs and other cool things. I have read that hardcore fans of the series didn't like this game, which suggests to me that it was a niche series to date. But from someone who hated the previous titles, I can honestly say that should they make another Hitman game, I will definitely be pre-ordering it after playing Absolution.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2014"}

Seeing Pokemon finally in a 3D world is just truly amazing. I do not play with the 3D tab on, but the world is still so crisp, has stunning animation, and vivid colors. The story-line is decent for a Pokemon game and the original Pokemon lineup is great in this game. They did a great job at incorporating all the new and old/older Pokemon in the game.My lineup consist of,Blaziken, Blastoise, Chesnaught, Alakazam, Sableye, and Pikachu. I have 6 badges so far, just cleared the Pokeball Factory and on my way to the Chill Town.5/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2013"}
