{"product_name":"B0000664JE","reviewerName":"Axel","summary":"Good soild gameplay, but lacks","reviewText":"First off let me say this, this game was good for the first hour, but after I really got deeper into the levels, it became more of a frustating ripping out my hair thing other than me actually enjoying this game.  I had thought about buying it before rental, boy am I glad I chose rental.  Secondly, controls can make or break the purchase of this title, too bad we couldn't go into options and switch it around but hey, after the training level you should have it down no prob.  If you've played Max Payne and loved it more than anything, then maybe you might like this, I adored Max Payne, but this game done nothing for me to make me actually buy this one.  The most annoying thing about the whole game has to be the mini games, it just doesn't make sense to have some of them in there, it looks like to me they tried to stray away from Max Payne as much as possible so it wouldn't be called a Max Payne clone, but that's all it ammounts to if you were to ask me.  I know Namco is popular for their fighting gneres, but honestly, I think they could have done much better in this one, it actually gets to the point where I turned off the game, this hardly ever happens to me on games, and I'm an extreme gamer.  Don't get me wrong, the game's good the bullet time is great, five stars there, they actually done better with the auto aiming arcade style, great feature, loved it.  Also, the disarms are one of the best features of this game, they're all random and the more you progress through levels, the more brutal and more fun they become to watch over and over again, you can even slow down the camera by pressing Y, I also loved that.  Last but not least, Shadow, your faithful dog in this game, you can set him to attack one enemy and bring back a gun for you if are low and have no weaponry, all in all I give this game 3 stars good but not great.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2002"}

I studied the culture and was at a time really into anime, so I understand a lot of the pitfalls that typical Americans don't really get when it comes to entertainment from Japan. I played the demo and while it was pretty short, it seemed fun and light-hearted. I didn't want to try to play the game in Japanese because I'm a bit rusty, so I bought the English version. And I want to be real clear: this game just sucks. I'm about to get mean.There's a lot of the prototypical childishness that's present in almost all anime. However, this isn't Studio Gibli quality \"wonderment from a child's perspective\" kind of childishness. No, it's the \"a 5 year old came up with this story\" kind. These characters are cardboard cutouts borrowed from the infamous one-dimensional list of archetypes that constitute most anime casts. The characters are trite and hackneyed and make the game feel like it was intended for very, very young children who can't appreciate deeper characterizations. And they're not helped by the dialog, which is poorly translated from Japanese. If you happen to speak the language, the game plays with a constant and ever-gnawing sense of \"I could have done better.\" If you don't, I have a feeling that it plays with little more than a sense of \"What? The? Eff?\". I can always tell exactly where the errors are and how they were made. It's like someone attacked the original text with a first-year dictionary, picked the first possible translation on a word-by-word basis instead of translating the whole sentence and picking the best ones, and then didn't bother going back and trying to actually make the story make sense in English. And the idioms are horrible. A lot of Japanese idioms are culturally ingrained and just do not work in English, but, in true first-year fashion, the translator tried to force it, which results in this constant flurry of \"why did they just say that?\". And then I have to remember that this wasn't originally in English. On top of that, most of the script is barely even grammatically correct. I don't understand how the voice actors said most of this stuff. Do they have no self-respect? Did nobody question the translation? Do they turn their brains off when they read their scripts? This seems the most likely, as most of the dialog is delivered extremely stiffly, which makes me question the reviewers who said it was good. Were they reviewing the original Japanese voice cast? Because the English is terrible. Just. Terrible.There's almost as little feeling in the speech as there is in the characters' faces. The character models just run around the screen like vaudeville idiots, with more lanky-armed slapstick humor than actual witty dialog. It might be that the wit was consumed by the horrendous translation, I don't know. Either way, it wouldn't annoy me so much if there was some expression, but the faces on the models Never. Change. They just blink with this wide-eyed, blank-faced stare that's pure, unadulterated creepy. The only time there's ever any expression is when you get to watch the pop-up cut scenes that randomly trigger throughout the game. And even then, it's not animated. It's very detached with individual pictures for the characters that are involved. Whenever a character \"reacts\" to what another one is saying, their picture might change, or move around the screen or shake. But it's never *animated*. For me, that just creates a big disconnect. If I wanted unanimated character stills, I'd be reading a manga, not holding a controller.White-knuckled holding a controller, I should say. I'm not a controller-chucker, but I have to fight the urge for most of the game. In typical JRPG fashion, the bulk of the game is extruded through near-constant combat encounters. You can pick and choose what you fight just by avoiding touching enemies (except on the world map, where monsters can just appear in front of you before you can dodge). However, once you're in the combat cloud you'll find pretty quickly that it's atrocious. Your role in battle is very much active, and you have to constantly perform combos. Most of your combat will involve using basic attacks so that you can charge your TP meter and perform special moves. However, the character can only perform a maximum of 3 strikes in a row. And no matter how many strikes you choose to use, wheter it be 1, 2, or the \"full\" (pathetic) 3, once you're done he does this incredibly idiotic dance where he tosses his sword around his body. During this time you cannot do ANYTHING. You cannot move, block, use items, or use abilities. Not that blocking is ever really useful, but this means that you're left defenseless EVERY SINGLE TIME you use a basic attack without leading into a special move combo. And even then, I think he still does his sword dance after special moves. Either way, you're defenseless for a hugely asinine amount of your time in combat. I cannot get over how @#$()@#)$%(&* stupid this is.During the opening hours of the game, it's not a problem because enemies generally drop quickly and are very weak. Within a few short hours they'll drop with just two or three hits, making these short combos useful. However, once you get up to the first real boss fight, it starts to get very annoying. Like a lot of games that have come out in the past decade, this one makes bosses several times more powerful than the surrounding area's enemies (something that annoys the hell out of me: make the normal enemies harder or the bosses weaker, but don't surprise me with a random pounding... that's not what I'm paying for when I buy a game). So you may think you're doing pretty daggum well, kicking butt and not bothering to take names, and then you turn a corner and find your own familiar seat-warmer sitting cheeks-side-up on a platter being served back to you for lunch with a side of whoopass. During boss fights, your TP meter runs out in a hurry because you're trying to use as mnany combos as you can while ineffectually dealing damage. Meanwhile, your party members are dropping like flies because they're utterly useless AI-controlled trash. So once you run out of allies, any means to revive or heal them, and finally out of TP, you're stuck trying to recharge with ultra-short combos that render you defenseless. If you attack and get blocked, you're doubly screwed because not only have you not dealt any measurable damage, but then you go and do the \"I'm @#$%@#$% Stupid\" sword-toss dance. This is the exact moment that the boss opens up with a much-more-than-3-hit combo that punishes you for spending any amount of money on this crappy game.Once you're done surgically reattaching your rump, you're free to try to level up. But most areas just don't have powerful enough enemies, and the game will concoct some bizarre reason why you can't leave the area to go find stronger enemies. After scrounging for 20, 30, 60 minutes to get a single level, you go up against the boss for a rematch and last all of an extra 10 seconds - maybe taking an additional 5% of the boss' health - before the same thing happens. I squeaked by the 1st boss on the first try, had to retry the second boss (some kind of golem) 2 or 3 times before I got him, and finally got to the 3rd boss (some kind of cokatrice-looking mofo). Once you get stuck on the route to this SOB, there are all of 5 enemeis that will not respawn unless you run to the save point, save, and reload the game. This makes grinding out that level extra-stupid-annoying. I spent some insane number of eye-clawingly boring hours trying to get a level that ultimately didn't matter, and I saved, turned off the Xbox and haven't picked the game back up since.I hate games that force level grinding, and this one is pretty bad about it. It wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that for however many hours I've forced into this pile of garbage, there are only about 8 enemy models that come in 2-3 flavors each. It's bland. Just bland. The only thing good about fighting so many monsters is all the little prizes they drop.There's a neat little equipment management system that lets you upgrade your weapons and armor, and if you're out in the wild you can 'cook' meals with ingredients dropped by monsters that heal or lend certain effects to your party. However, there's not a whole lot of reward to it and the system gets bogged down in the minutia pretty quickly. It's not quite as bad as Dragon's Dogma in terms of sheer bredth of available items, but I don't remember it being as simple or straight-forward, either. In Dragon's Dogma, you can upgrade any item at any time so long as you have the proper materials (which the blacksmith will identify for you, even if you've never seen it) and the right amount of gold, and \"learning\" combinable item recipes just involves finding the components (having owned both at some point will tell that you can make something, the first attempt to do combine them will tell you what it makes). In Tales, it seems like upgrades are unlocked as you progress through the game, and figuring out what does what and whether or not it's worth it is a die roll. And the 'cooking' skill is just crap. Even if you manage to learn a recipe, the characters are apparently all inept and almost never get it right. Leveling has a neglible (if any) effect on this, so you just burn through materials. And it doens't seem to matter if a character claims to be a good cook, they still suck. If you're caught with your pants down by a SURPRISE! (super) boss and don't have a lot of useful combat-worthy items, the 'cooking' option will NOT save you.I'm not really looking forward to finishing the game, either, because even if I do the rest of it perfectly I won't get all the achievements. I have to play through at least twice, maybe even three times. I just don't like games that force multiple playthroughs to get all the achievements. A game should stand on its own merits to warrant a second visit (like any of the Halos), not numb players' minds with a full lather-rinse-repeat that lacks any difference, takes just as long to complete, and yields some arbitrary and insulting paltry amount of \"gamer score\" for your effort (like Mass Effect 1 & 3). This just compounds my annoyance with the game, because I can't be one-and-out if I ever DO bother to pick this turd back up.There's very little here to be enjoyed. In my opinion, save your money. Play something else.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2012"}

Angel \"americanpride\"","summary":"Fast, furious, and efficient fun for all ages.","reviewText":"My wife and I have been playing the Mario Party series since the beginning.  Mario Party 2 and 3 are among my favorites.  This is by far the best since those in my opinion.  This game is the first in a long time that takes little time to setup a new game and the game keeps moving.  I found that the GC renditions and MP 8 continued a trend of taking more time to accomplish less, which was not as fun for us.I'm surprised at the multiple reviews talking about no strategy and no items.  It's true that there isn't a magic lamp that automatically gives you a star, nor an item that teleports you to another player, etc....but between the dice block choices, captain games, Boss games, reverse minigames, and many of the minigames you have a plethora of strategies you can employ.  Like other Mario Party titles luck is still involved, but you can definitely improve your chances to win more frequently.We have a family of 5 (ages 37, 36, 8, 4, and 2...he watches) and we all have had a blast every single time we play.  When the oldest two kids play by themselves, they are continuously cracking up and enjoying the game.The extras are fun too...the kids love unlocking and viewing the constellations and there are extra boards, characters, difficulty levels, and minigames to unlock.I can't say enough about the changes being fresh and positive in every way.  The games last 30-45 minutes max and there is little down time waiting for other players and things to happen.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2012"}

Another One?","reviewText":"The Gameboy Advance debuted in 2001, and was an astonishing system to behold.  It was like carrying around a Super Nintendo, and it gave old school gamers a chance to enjoy the 16 bit era all over again!  The problem with the regular Gameboy Advance is the screen wasn't backlit and buying batteries over and over again was a pain.In 2003 the first Gameboy Advance SP came around, and it was one of the few times when I simply didn't think about buying a reissued system, I simply did it.  It had a backlit screen, a rechargable battery and an LCD fold down screen.  Now I could truly say I was carrying around a handheld console.  There was nothing to be concerned about with the Gameboy Advance SP.  A long lasting battery plus a backlit screen, and being an old school gamer who absolutely loved the 16-bit era.  The Gameboy Advance SP simply was carrying around a piece of heaven.Now we have another GBA SP, with a stronger backlight.  It is a lot brighter (with the battery being about the same), and the cover is shiny, but that doesn't really make it worth the buy.  It's great that unlike the Nintendo DS, you can play regular Gameboy games and Gameboy Color games, and the backlight actually makes the graphical output of the game better, but I simply can't help but admit that aside from this neat tweak, it's exactly the same as the original SP.  Simply put, if you've already got a GBA SP, you probably won't need the newer ones.  They're better than the GBA Micro, and they're easy to carry around, but a brighter backlit screen doesn't really warrant it a buy, unless it's really cheap.The other thing that hurts the GBA is simple: Gaming is propelling forward.  The GBA's moment of sunshine is basically over.  As much as I hate to admit that, it is.  The handheld war is now between the Nintendo DS and the Sony PSP.  Even so, if you've got the system just for Gameboy Advance games, the Nintendo DS is probably a better way to go.It is still a good system (why on earth would you compare this to the PSP?), but it's time to shine is coming to an end.  Fantastic system, and I love living the 16-Bit era again, but it's not too worthwhile if you've already got a GBA SP to begin with.  However, what garners this the four it so rightly deserved is simple.  If you don't have a Gameboy Advance this is undoutebly the best one to go with.  A fold down LCD screen means less scratches, the backlight is fantastic, and the games are just all around good games.In short...The Good+It's still a classic system+A Super Nintendo in your pocket+Plays regular Gameboy games and Gameboy Color games (unlike the Micro and DS)+Excellent presentation of the games+Fold down LCD screen+The backlit screen really brings out the best in the GBA's graphics, and it's more vibrant and colorful+Don't have a GBA?  This is the best one to go withThe Bad-If you've already got the regular Gameboy Advance SP, it might not be worth getting this simply for a brighter backlit screen-The Handheld Console war has moved on to the Nintendo DS and the PSP, if you're a gamer that simply must keep up with the times, this isn't for you","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2006"}

And a little violence...","reviewText":"One of my few reviews and I'm not good at them so bear with me...*spoiler free*After some good reviews, and being familiar with platinum/sega games in the past (vanquish for example) how they are done well with action/speed/smooth/style I was a *little* hesitant to get Bayonetta but Vanquish had a unique Japanese game feel to it and watching a few trailers of Bayonetta this one was looking pretty good.  I was sad to see Dreamcast die off many years ago but it's nice to see the Sega coming back with so many good games and I hope they continue to bring over more (YAKUZA KENZAN HELLO!!).  Sega is a VERY GOOD video game company bringing over some pretty good ones! (Valkeria Chronicles/Yakuza/Vanquish/Bayonetta ect. ect.)I'm not into gory/violent \"god of war\" type games so I was worried this would be sort of the same type, hack and slash repetitive nonsense...it took some getting used to the ultra combo move endings being bloody and violent but after a while I got used to it.  **Just note you cannot turn off blood in the game**  It's a game with a different twist, playing the dark side(usually I'm anti-dark games but this one is entertaining haha..).  Like I mentioned before, I enjoy Japanese style games, and at first I thought this was done in cheesy American voice actors but from what I can tell, this is the same voice acting they used in Japan (weird..) since the Japan demo used the same audio. *shrugs* but the story/cut scenes almost remind me of a metal gear type story...excitement/suspense almost like a movie character fighting against it all but the story is on the wild side :)I'm in Chapter 4 of the game and I'm still smiling since the first chapter, enjoying the game, playing on normal, and making sure I don't fly through the game real quick (spoiling my enjoyment) as Bayonetta jumps/walks walls/summons beasts and has a huge amount of control.  Some sequences are HARD (nice to see hard games still out there).  Very impressed with the quality of programming/level of detail.  Very little slowdown and you just want to cheer on Bayonetta.Those who have posted about the PS3 being the inferior or less quality is total junk. I have tried the demo on xbox.. very little or no difference. I have a 40\" bravia 1080p and the game looks great!  Smooth, fast loading (of course I downloaded the update) so I think you should be able to pick and choose what platform you're into (I'm a Sony guy..prefer the PS3 controller)Just a warning, this game is sexed up - I love playing female characters; from female Shepard in Mass Effect 2 to now Bayonetta, not sure why..maybe I think it's sexy playing a strong female character but you wouldn't want your young children watching or playing this or just like a god of war series game even listening to some of the audio.  Lots of sexy poses, hair flying, nudity and the major violence part..not to mention you deal with lots of dark characters, swearing (F-words and such) so it deserves the M rating for sure!Overall I'm VERY happy with the purchase and I hope the ending is not a sad one..thank you Platinum games/Sega for bringing over a great game!

{"product_name":"B002I08WVY","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"It's a portable version of the PS2 original with sub par 3D ~","reviewText":"I love the Tales franchise, so I borrowed this game from my local library.  I also own the PS2 original Tales of the Abyss.  So there are a few things I like about this game and a few things that make me scratch my head about this conversion.First, the game itself is pretty great.  But with the lack of new content from the PS2 version, it makes me wonder why anyone would go for this version other than the portability (if they have a PS2 or have the PS2 version already).  But I wanted to see for myself what the changes were. And basically it's the addition of very lackluster 3d.  The main issue I have with the 3d is that unlike most other 3DS games, this game seems to have a very tiny sweet spot.  Even if you are in the sweet spot you can sometimes get the double image effect.  I immediately shut this game down and tried several others and the difference is dramatic.  But it does remind me a bit of Star Fox for the 3DS, so maybe there is something to do with the conversion of existing games to 3D?The game itself is far from the best in the Tales franchise.  I would even put Tales of Graces F way ahead of this, if only for the better battle system (free roaming).  In Tales of the Abyss, you are locked onto a line, so it is a lot like the older Tales games.  But after playing Tales of Graces and then going back to this title, one can really feel the difference.The other minor annoyance is the voice acting.  Seriously, the hero, Luke?  He needs a reality check.  \"But I wanted to go into Tachi Station and pick up some power converters!\" Oh, wait, wrong whiny Luke.  But really early on you get tired of his \"But I wanted Van to train me!\" or \"I just wanted to go outside, geez!\" and such.  The little extra cut scenes (accessed by hitting start) aren't voiced (but their lips move and they are timed so you can't advance them, so I wonder if the Japanese original had these voiced).The intro video is nice, but it probably took up a huge chunk of the memory.  Perhaps that is why no extras?  But Namco should really have tossed in a few extras for those who have played the PS2 version.  Shame on them!  Even SE tosses in extras for the Final Fantasy remakes.So final verdict?  I like the PS2 version.  There is something nice about playing on a full size screen with a very nicely designed controller.  It's not worth double dipping for sloppy 3D and portability.  On the other hand, if you like the portability and haven't played the PS2 version, then this is a worthy purchase.

I've only completed first 2 missions and I've already called in Hellfires, huge bombs, sniped from a mile away, done stealth operations, rode in trucks and ATVs while getting chased, overall great experience.Online is a lot of fun, the ranking system is balanced and you look forward to what you will unlock next.

You can tell this game was made in Japan because the missions were kinda out there almost Metal Gear Solid-type stuff.  Really unbelievable.  They should've made the games more like the Navy Seals SOCOM series where you had threats that were real and in real locations.  It's seemed too futuristic for me.  What saved this game is the control, the combat, the missions, the weapons, the fact that you can buy additional air craft and you can actually replay the game from the beginning, keeping what you've bought and earned so far!!!The cut scenes have this stupidly, out of place narration that thankfully can be skipped.  However, the fact that they poisoned the game with that junk really is a shame.But, I enjoy the game a lot.

Through the years, they've amassed a nice collection of franchises they can bet on to keep people coming back.  So here's another entry...The Legend of Zelda on Nintendo DS.  Fans of the series should know what to expect, this game is really no different from any of the other ones.  What made this one fresh is the fact that it's on one of the most innovative consoles ever, bringing that innovation to the Zelda series.This is a direct sequel to GameCube's The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.  While that game isn't the strongest entry (that honor goes to Ocarina of Time for N64), the cartoon look and humor fits quite nicely with the DS and I personally wouldn't have it any other way.  All the usual Zelda elements are there, but this time you control with the stylus, which makes playing it all the more fun.  Sword-fighting is done by simply touching the enemy or making a slash mark.  The boomerang is used by tracing the path you want it to follow (this is simply ingenious!).  Your ship's course is determined by tracing the path you want it to follow.  The fact that you can also write notes on the game's map is very useful too.Story-wise, it's simple and to-the-point.  Obviously, Nintendo wanted to focus more on gameplay than story, and that's not a bad thing. The dungeons are rather short, but again, simplicity is rampant in this game.  I really like the incorporation of the microphone!  While it doesn't have speech recognition, you can simply blow in the mic to make things happen.  I'm not a fan of having to do the main dungeon over and over again.  That will definitely get tedious.  The roll move is somewhat difficult to execute, which takes away from the otherwise brilliant play control.My biggest complaints stem from aspects that have been done before in other games.  The fairy that accompanies Link speaks for him and also suffers from memory loss, which is identical to Tippi the Pixl from Super Paper Mario (they even look similar).  Also, in the main dungeon, Link's life will slowly drain unless he's in designated \"Safe Zones\", which is straight out of Dark Aether from Metroid Prime 2.  Sure they change that up slightly with the use of the Phantom Hourglass, but that just serves to make the game somewhat on the easy side.  Incidentally, Metroid Prime 2 borrowed part of its gameplay (light and dark worlds) from Zelda: A Link To The Past, so I guess the favor is returned?Overall, however, this is probably one of the best games for the DS.  It certainly will keep you occupied and coming back for more.  While those looking for an expansive Zelda epic like Twilight Princess will undoubtedly be disappointed, this wasn't the point of Phantom Hourglass and it should still satisfy fans.  It's a strong entry in the Legend of Zelda series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2007"}

You've got more characters this time around, new items to purchase at the little shops on the map. For instance, you've got green balloons (these allow you to lift out of a pit you've fallen into, so instead of dying you'll be lifted back up to land) and blue balloons (refills your air meter for swimming under water). Speaking of swimming under water, I LOVE doing that in this game. For all the years I've played video games I have always hated water levels. My hate for water levels dates all the way back to the early Sega Genesis days. This is the FIRST game where I actually ENJOY the water.

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Michigoon \"tech geek\"","summary":"KOTOR: Best Star Wars game ever?","reviewText":"It's just after the Sith Wars, thousands of years before the movies take place. Darth Revan and his apprentice Darth Malak have been causing a stir in the Jedi order, a conflict that threatened to throw the whole galaxy into peril once again. The Jedi send a strike team to eliminate this threat, one of whom is Bastila- known for a meditation skill that can turn the tide in any battle. Malak turns on Revan, and becomes the master himself when Revan disappears. The game opens with you waking up on a damaged ship heading home not long after this conflict.Quick note: This game uses the classic Bioware RPG systems. You talk through menus, you fight by issuing commands, you level up when you obtain experience. It's a system that most people love, but if you're the kind of gamer who wants direct control over the action- a la fighting games or shooters- you might want to look into the other Star Wars titles.The good:-Fantastic story.-Massive worlds- Each planet you will visit (yes, multiple) is massive and completely detailed. The game's graphics are top-notch, making for some mind-blowingly beautiful vistas.-Customization- You choose the way your character looks, the way your character develops, and what skills your character will have. When you equip weapons or armor, they actually show up in-game, meaning you may sometime find yourself scrapping better armor for better looks if you're picky about that.-Star Wars authenticity- Blasters sound right. Ships sound right. Lightsabers are perfectly done. You couldn't ask for more.-Everything you've ever wanted in a Star Wars RPG- You will become Jedi, you will craft your lightsaber, you will gain force powers. You will see a Wookie, and his name is Zaalbar (okay, so it's not Chewbacca). Tour famous planets, see famous sights.-You choose- Don't like good? Be bad. Don't like your lightsaber? Change its color and properties, or just use another weapon. The game can be completed with blaster pistols or vibroswords. You will also encounter nine party members who you can mix and match when you go out into the world.-Seperate endings for dark and light sides means this game is worth replaying at a minimum once more just to experience both sides. If you play through as completely evil or completely good, it's hard to recognize it's the same game for perhaps the final third of play.The bad:-A little linear. Endings are different, and you're very free to roam the massive worlds. But in the end, you're being pulled toward one final conflict.-Loading times, framerate jumps- The game really pushes the Xbox to its limits. Loading times are a little on the lengthy side, and some of the more massive locales can lend themselves to skippy framerates when you get into battle. Very minor annoyances, overall.The end: KOTOR isn't perfect, but it's close. This is simply the best Star Wars RPG I've ever played. Alongside the Jedi Knight and Rogue Squadron series, it represents the best in Star Wars gaming.ALSO: Game has a downloadable addition if you have Xbox Live.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2004"}

It is not without flaws, but these are forgivable and easily overlooked when you get into the heart of the action. My general impression of the game is that the title is fitting to a degree seldom seem in the RTS genre.BFME focuses on exactly what you might expect- the clash of the forces of Middle Earth at varied locations, many of which are taken verbatim from the movies, but some of which appear only in literature. The four playable factions- Rohan, Gondor, Isengard, and Mordor- feature units and structures that are instantly recognizable to anyone who has seen the films. There is little micromanagement, as buildings can only be built on specified camp areas, and resource gathering is done by structures rather than units. However, this doesn't mean you can ignore your base- buildings gain veterancy that allows production of superior units or more resources. Losing veteran structures can very well mean losing the war.Not only are the graphics visually representative of the movie look, but they function and behave like them too. Cavalry can run over foot infantry like so much grass, Mumakils charge into a dangerous frenzy when badly wounded, and Nazgul make devastating flyby attacks. Troops cower and run when something big (e.g. a Balrog) comes charging at them. Many units have special capabilities that add both uniqueness and strategic depth, such as the troll's ability to pick up and heave rocks at enemies. Heroes are likewise unique, critical to success at higher levels, and offer many interesting abilities. The voice acting, sound, and visual effects are all of the finest quality. Of particular notice is that many of the original cast members did voices for the game.There is a limited degree of freedom in the single play game, in that many objectives are optional and there is a 'living map' mode where you can choose areas to attack. At some points in the campaign you are drawn to pivotal events (e.g. Frodo entering Shelob's lair) that loosely follow the Tolkien script. This is where some purists might cry foul, as it takes pretty significant liberties with the plot. You don't have much choice in fulfilling the main objectives, either, so Gandalf is going to have to walk out of Moria after putting the Balrog in its place. Then again, it is kind of fun to do something different, rather than just replaying the story as we know it.The interface, music, and overall production values are superb. BFME uses the C&C; Generals engine, though the gameplay and quality is generally (no pun intended) superior. The game is exceptionally stable- I've played it for at least 40 hours, and it has not crashed a single time. This is literally unheard of in my (extensive) gaming experience. Unit balance is well done, with good balance of numbers vs. quality for the various races.Pluses aside, there are a few problems with the game. Units move around as squads, in a manner similar to the Total War series (though with far fewer units in general). On occasion, however, I've had individual men get stuck on buildings, rocks, or nothing in particular. The AI is also rather deficient, often attacking stupidly despite taking heavy losses or sending piecemeal forays at heavily guarded areas. It doesn't seem to know how to use the (very handy) light or dark powers to good effect, and units in general don't respond to being shot at by archers. Additionally, when there are many units on the screen performance can take a serious hit. I had to turn down detail several times to make the Minas Tirith level run decently.I must also say that the single play campaign is a bit too easy and forgiving. You can resurrect dead heroes at any citadel, so in any mission where you have one, it's really hard to not have the hero continue the campaign. If you're at all good at RTS type games, you'll soon have a crack corps of veteran units that simply can't be defeated, no matter how many hordes the enemy throws at you. I also dislike the look of upgrades in general- the glow weapons and armor take on looks silly, even if it does clearly identify such troops. Many campaign missions also suffer from repetitive objectives- just go out and kill them all. There are a few surprises, but not as many as I'd have liked. Fortunately, all of the areas are unique rather than randomly generated, which adds diversity to the look of Middle Earth.For those who are interested, there are skirmish and multiplay modes. These add the rather amusing ability to play as good vs. good or evil vs. evil, and you can pick most of the campaign areas to wage multiplayer warfare. The tactical aspect of the game is interesting enough to make this fun, but I've so far found the campaign to really be the meat of the title.If you enjoy the LOTR movies and like real time strategy games, BFME is a must-have. Even if you're not that big a fan of the series, the cinematic quality of the game is really something that must be seen to be be believed. LOTR: BFME is also a great strategy game in its own right, and certain to bring many hours of enjoyment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2005"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J5FG","description":"","reviewerName":"Adrian Jenkins \"southerndudeman\"","summary":"A lot of fanboy stink here, but this is a nice collection nonetheless","reviewText":"I was hesitant to buy the Team Ico collection. I had never played Ico, and in fact, I had generally stayed away from it mostly due to crushing expectation given to it from critics and fans (\"Breathtaking!\" \"This game is art!\" and the like). To each his own, sure, but the game had fanboy stink all over it. I had once owned \"Shadow of the Colossus,\" but wasn't nearly as impressed as others, and traded it in soon thereafter.But, as both games together were $39.99, I decided to purchase them, to see if maybe I had missed the boat on them the first time around. And the answer to that is...kind of.Anyway, let me review each game separately:ICO:Ico is a nice 3rd-person game in which you control a boy who is attempting to escape from a castle-like structure. On the way, you encounter another person, the affable Yorda. Much of the game has you figuring out how to get Yorda to follow you to the exit of rooms, often by taking her hand and dragging her behind you. Honestly, this is a fantastic idea for a game, and it should have been a slam dunk. But, it's just a lay-up in the end, which does score, but doesn't wow.The problem? The game is way too short. I don't want to call it easy, per se, but it's just too short. A beginning player (like myself) will beat the game in 4-5 hours, with absolutely no outside help. There is actually a trophy for beating the game in 2 hours or less, so that tells you what you need to know. As the second title of a $19.99 collection, this is OK, but I would have been gravely disappointed if I had spent full price on this in 2001, particularly alongside other games like MGS2 and FFX.This game (as well as its \"sequel\") sells itself on its art and ambience. Atmosphere is everything, and it's pretty nice. The game is very quiet, which makes sense given the nature of what you're trying to accomplish. Control is mostly OK, although Ico will do strange stuff sometimes (particularly when jumping). There was one particularly annoying segment (involving a water wheel) where I felt control really got in the way, but mostly, I thought it was OK.The music in the game is OK, but not stellar. I know some people rave about it, but I found it to be mostly throwaway (and paling in comparison to its counterpart, SotC). The visuals are pretty dated. I'm not even sure how they compare with contemporaries (it's hard to compare with my FFX, e.g., as that game has yet to be released in HD). But in the end, I was disappointed that I beat the game in one night.All in all, the game gets decent ratings for fun, but the length hurts it overall.Fun: 4 starsOverall: 3 starsShadow of the Colossus:This game, when it goes, is one of the most fun games I've ever played. Unfortunately, often, it goes nowhere.The premise of this game is simple: there are 16 colossal giants out there, and you've got to beat them all down. At its core, this game pits you against a monster, one on one. Each monster has one (or several) \"vital point(s)\", which is the only place to deal damage. Unfortunately, you are often the size of an ant compared to these towering creatures, and so you've got to figure out how to get to these vital points. And man, is that fun. Each and every battle is memorable, and no two battles are the same. Some people might complain that there are only 16 battles, but with the originality present in each one, I can't number myself among them.The story is mostly throwaway, regarding some guy (with the name of Wander - nothing like subtlety) who wants to raise a girl (I don't remember her name, and am not sure if we're ever told who she is) back from the dead, and so ventures to the \"Forbidden Land\". Most of this is told to you in the opening sequence. I still do not understand this stuff about \"breaking bounds in storytelling none of us knew existed\" (to quote a review from the games original release). There's not much here - I can't imagine how people feel much emotion for the mostly-mute main character, or the dead girl, etc. etc. Imaginations run wild, I guess. I did think of my own story to follow the game, but it's a little silly and...racy for Amazon. However, I will give credit where it's due: there are some cool visual effects in the game, which loosely tie to the \"story\". As you kill colossi, your character seems to become...corrupted. He starts off looking like some silly anime character, but looks incredibly cool by the end.If there is one thing that draws an emotional response, it is the amazing music. I admit - I DID miss the boat on this one. The music in this game is stellar, and has not aged one bit. Battles with colossi, which are already outstanding, become epic due to the soundtrack. When that music changes its sound, you know that you are doing well. At times, it put me on the edge of my seat, literally.There is one huge problem with this game, however. While the battles against the 16 colossi are epic, the part in-between is anything but. At BEST, you can hunt for lizards and fruit. At worst? You are traveling for long stretches with no real landmarks, no music, and no fun. The travel segments are among the worst I've ever seen in a video game. I can understand the loner feeling that the developer was trying to convey, but it's just too much. Exacerbating the situation is the horrible control for the horse. I can't even begin to describe this utter failure, but let's just say - you'll hit buttons much more trying to spur the horse than for every battle combined. However, I will say that overall, the control seems better than when I played the game a few years back - with the exception of the horse, which is just as bad today.The visuals of this game hold up even today. The graphics remain amazing. Also, this game is longer than its predecessor, but some of that is due to the travel time. Even with that, you can beat this game in less than 10 hours.If there was just a little more to this game, it would be 5-stars all around. The fun factor when fighting the colossi is still 5-star stuff. But the terrible travel filler brings the overall score down. So,Fun: 5 starsOverall: 4 stars","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2011"}

They're annoying and you just try to get through them to get back to the real game. Ico is nothing but one long escort mission.(-) Ico A.I. is broken, that stupid B***** doesn't do what you tell her, she's always dying or making you back track to get her because her AI is so bad it won't follow. God...I hate this terrible game(-) Colossus - is much better, but should be a 5 dollar download. Graphics are ugly, PS2 they may have been passable, but even with the HD treatment, you're looking at a middling PS2 title.Pros----(+) some of the collosus are kind of cool I guess.Bottom line. These games are only for those who played them, and have some happy nostalgia associated with them. Sadly, neither held up over time. Ico is so bad it's unplayable, and it's lame boredom inducing game play will get a capitulation from even the most strident of completists.

{"product_name":"B00004TC6E","reviewerName":"\"neomurtle\"","summary":"If you are a fan of RPGs, don't pass up this sleeper hit","reviewText":"Crono Cross is the long awaited sequel to one of the best RPGs on the SNES, Crono Trigger.  Even though Crono Cross has few connections with Crono Trigger other than a couple of remixed music tracks here and there, it is still well worth any RPG fan's time.  The battle system in Crono Cross is the most obvious change from traditional RPGs, and can be confusing at first.  Instead of Magic Points, the ability to cast spells and using items in battle are reliant on elemental levels.  Each time you attack, your elemental level increases allowing you to use more powerful spells according to how you &quot;allocated&quot; them on that character.  It's not as confusing as it sounds though, so anyone who has played a lot of RPGs before will be a able to quickly adjust within a few hours of gameplay.  That said, Crono Cross is probably best reserved for those who are seasoned RPG players. Other features such as the graphics, sound, and story are all top notch, so there's nothing to worry about in those departments. Branching paths and well over 40 different characters add even more reason not to pass this one up. If you want a break from the same old style of RPG, or are just looking for a title to hold you over until Dragon Warrior 7 or Final Fantasy 10, I strongly recommend Crono Cross.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2001"}
{"product_name":"B001E8VB6O","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Brilliant Surprise","reviewText":"I have been a gamer since playing dig dug on the Atari back in the day.  Over the years I have seen a lot of games come and go in an attempt to capitalize on peoples favorite super heroes.  Most are total junk where a select few are actually decent fun but nothing to really get excited over.  When I first heard about this title and the hype surrounding it, I was a skeptic from my past experiences with other super hero games.  Arkham however is a game changer.I started with the demo and was immediately blown away by the amazing graphics.  The level of detail they put into the Arkham island world was nothing short of astonishing.  Little details from stain marks and scratches to loads and loads of 'lived in' items scatter the maps to breath life the world.  Not only was it detail but the art and style was very unique.  It had a more comic book feel than the newer movies yet retained a gritty HUGE believable world.The story is a little bit of a stretch but is very well done and the performances by each character is incredible.  The dialog is pretty good and the Joker in particular keeps things amusing as the story progresses.  If you pay attention there is a lot of content in the game from the characters in the form of speaking, recorded tapes, and other 'easter egg' type things.  The story and characters are very deep and it is obvious the developers spent a lot of time and thought on this product.The demo takes you through a few of the main things you do in the game to give you a taste of what to expect from the full title.  Fighting, Sneaking, and Puzzles.  That is the essence of this game and the demo gives you several scenarios to play through.  After loving the demo, I got the full game and am glad I did.As Batman you get to fight a lot of bad guys.  You get a nice assortment of weapons such as the batarang, explosive gel, and the cable claw with each getting different little upgrades along the way.  While those things are nice and certainly have their places (especially in the sneaky areas) most of your combat is face to face bruising it out.  You can punch, stun, and counter.  While that might not sound like a lot of options, there are tons of combos you can pull off including using the terrain and your tools to make for some very fluid and nasty combat.  The animations and variety hear was awesome and I really enjoyed the hand to hand combat of the game.Batman is not an idiot and being mortal means not Samurai charging enemies that have guns.  In those cases and other cases where you want to not get ganged up on, you deploy your sneaky tactics.  This means hiding in the shadows, using small ducts to get around or getting to higher ground and then taking out your prey one by one while never being seen.  The game gives you so many options and as the bad guys move around you can plan out a solid ambush to start taking them out.Puzzles is the other main point of the game.  While you can get through the game without solving all the puzzles, you will miss out on a lot and not get some of the experience you need to max out Batman's gadgets and such.The island has a lot of different environments from the cell block, to medical facilities, to gardens, etc.  It is HUGE with lots of areas to explore and bad guys to ambush/fight.  At first I had a really hard time wrapping my mind around the scope of the game but once I got the hang of things and used the map more, it all came together great.After the game is over and if you spent some time on the puzzles, then you can unlock some bonus game modes where you either straight up fight through tons of bad guys or try and take them down sneaky style.  The bonus gives you some challenges and various locations to fight.  At the end it then scores you and you can see how well you did compared to other players out there.  You also can unlock an 'armored' Batman which looks awesome and has thick... you guessed it 'Armor!'.  On the PS3 you also get an extra bonus to be able to use the Joker in some of the combat as well and he moves very similar to Batman but has his own personality and style.So while each of those things was great there were a few things I felt they could have done better.  Personally I would have liked to see the action in the city instead of on some island.  Though I admit that would have made it difficult to tie all the characters together that they did in this game.  Sometimes the game felt a little too pushed along in certain directions though for the most part you can explore things at the time of your choosing.  I can understand their need to do that but would have liked a few more choices in that regard.Also you come across a lot of places that you need spacial equipment to get into but you are not given any indication that you need something special there and until I learned what was needed, I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out how to get into areas that I had absolutely no way to get into.  Then later when you finally do get the equipment you need, you have to go all over the place again to finally get to those spots which gets kind of boring since there is no action there anymore.Overall I just loved this game.  It was a huge surprise to see how well done it was and how enjoyable everything was for me.  I got hours and hours of solid fun playtime on this title and now I am enjoying the 'challenge mode' and looking for news on a sequel in the works.  One of the best games I have played in the past few year by far.  If you are on the fence, do yourself a favor and get this game.  It really is that good.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2009"}

The graphics and settings are amazing. The islands are rendered beautifully with huge draw distances and lush foliage. The gun fights are actually pretty frantic and the vehicles can be cool at times. The game also has a pretty good length, one of the longest FPS games I have played in a while. There is a good selection of weapons, and you are limited to four different guns which can add a bit of strategy when you select what to take with you.Now on to what I don't like. First, whose idea was it to put a checkpoint save system in this game? That person needs to be fired. Honestly, I can not think of a single pc game that has a good checkpoint save system. It would have been bearable if the checkpoint system was at least done well, and offered a generous amount of checkpoints. Instead, you get a bunch of checkpoints that mostly seem to be placed at random. At least they generally give you a checkpoint before a large firefight, usually. But there will be times where you will have to travel large distances over and over and over again.Next, up is the AI. What's so bad about it you ask? Well, it cheats. There were many times when they actually spotted me through solid walls. They can also hear the slightest noise from a mile away, and instead of going to check out the sound, they usually go on full alert. The cheating AI makes the stealth aspect of the game completely useless. There is no point in trying to hide or be quiet with the slightest thing will set them off. There were times when I would creep around a corner and as soon as I peak out, I would get a rocket in my face, even though there was no way they could have possibly known I was there. The cheating AI and the checkpoint save system can make the game extremely frustrating. Not to mention the cheap mutants later in the game with rocket launchers for arms that can take you out in one or two hits, but take what seems like hundreds of shots themselves to take down. It doesn't help that they also usually throw half a dozen of them at you at a time, often in indoor levels where there is no where to maneuver.Then there is the vehicle physics, or should I say lack of realistic physics. Jeeps and the like bounce around like crazy, making them almost impossible to control at high speeds. Then again, you won't get too much use out of them as you can't even take them off road much due to the amount of trees, rocks, and the rest that will get in your way.Of course, that didn't make me quit the game, I felt compelled to play until the end (no thanks to the story, which is pretty bad). I think Robert Coffey said it pretty well when he said, \"It would be so easy to dismiss Far Cry and the devastating effects of its save system as just another game disaster, but the truth is, the game does so many other things not just well but exceptionally, that you almost hate the game more because it could be so great.\" If only they had spent more time on the save system, and fixed the obvious cheating AI, the game could have been a lot more fun.Would I recommend the game? Yeah, its pretty cheap now, but I would highly suggest that if you have an Xbox, pick up Far Cry: Instincts instead. From what I played in the demo, they fixed many of the PC games problems.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2006"}

There are a lot of things you need to take note of though as they have revamped so many of the things that we were used to in previous iterations of the game.I really think Infinity Ward change some things they should definitely not changed in this game. Removing things like Search and Destroy, theater mode, one button mute all in the lobbies, challenges (they are now call operations and you can only work on 50 at a time it's annoying) and even prestige, things like this definitely don't help  long time CoD players enjoy the game.

But I do like it I look forward to playing Call of Duty Ghosts on the Next-Gen consoles as I think that's where this game will really shine.One thing I want let you know your squad points are tokens you can earn while playing the game, completing challenges, winning matches etc. be very cautious how you spend these tokens and what you unlock with them as they are kind of a pain in the butt to earn and it sucks to drop a bunch of tokens on a really crappy piece of gear. I would recommend going into local multiplayer because all your gear is unlock there and you can try out everything before you spend your valuable tokens on them.One last thing I have to say about Call of Duty Ghosts is I really kind of think some of the maps are way too big. I mean some maps I spent 15 minutes in a game of Kill Confirmed and my team only collected 40 tags because we couldn't find the other team. And it really sucks that you can only play 6v6 whereas on the next generation of consoles they will be doing 9v9.Thanks for reading.PS if you have any questions regarding the game feel free to ask them here and I will comment back.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000067FDY","description":"Star Wars Galaxiesis a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that lets you assume the role of nearly any type of character in theStar Warsuniverse and interact with thousands of other players' characters as well as established characters from the movies. You can be a shady smuggler, like Han. You can be a cold bounty hunter, like Boba Fett. You can even be a Jedi, like Luke. You can create and develop any character you like and seek out adventure and excitement as you see fit. Best of all, the game never ends--it persists and changes online, even when you're not playing. Interaction with other players is what this game is all about; you can get together with your Rebel friends and raid an Imperial bunker, or work with other Imperial troops to squash Rebel scum. You can instruct young Jedi in the ways of the Force, or you can work with other bounty hunters to hunt down outlaw Jedi and bring them to justice. Or you can manage a cantina or parts shop and marvel at the galaxy's vast variety of heroes, scum, and villainy.","reviewerName":"James Duckett","summary":"Addicting, but repetitive... expect more from Sony and Lucas","reviewText":"I've been playing this game for a while now.  Here is what I see from the game.Positives:1)  Addicting!!!!  I'm talking \"I'm gonna lose my job because I stay up all night playing this and almost fall asleep at my desk\" type of addicting.  Yes, this is more addicting than Bejewelled.2)  Creating Characters.  Bar none, this gives you the ability to create the most unique look.  I've never seen two people look exactly the same.  I mean it literally when I say that there are a million possible looks.... even down to the arrangements of the freckles on your face.  And that is just the human race.  There are other races and so many options you can take with each.3)  Different types of experience/diversity of professions.  There are so many professions you can undertake.  You can be a medic/doctor and heal yourself and others.  You can be a scout and trap animals.  You can be a merchant.  You can be a dancer/entertainer.  You can even be a politician and run for office!!  There are just soooooo many things you can do and become on this game.4)  Even if you can play for 15 minutes a day, you can still get stuff done on here.  Or, you can spend hours and hours playing.  You can even set up a macro to do some things for you and then walk away from the keyboard for an hour or two and come back to see how you did.  Very useful for surveyors and medics!Neutral:1)  Limits on skills.  I think this number is waaaay to low.  You can master two or three professions and then, that is it!!!  You can unlearn these professions and start learning another one.  This is good so that no character gets too powerful, but this is also bad because you can't have two characters from the same account on the same server.  See negative #5 below for more info.2)  Graphics/sound.  This is okay.  I'm not blown away by the details of anything out there, except for the character generation of course, but I've also seen much worst.  The sounds are okay and I find it a joy to hear a lot of sounds from the Star Wars universe.  But from a game sponsored by Lucas and written by Sony, I would expect more in both categories.3)  The $15 per month to play.  Yes, you need to pay to play MMORPG's but I would expect much more for the $15 I'm spending.  I would be more than happy to pay it if I was getting my money's worth.  I don't feel I am, however because there is very little variety in game playing and questing.Negatives:1)  Lag.  If you are around others or have just entered a town, the lag is unbelievable.  It is hard to imagine some people play this on dial-up.  I get a lot of lag for a high speed connection to the game.2)  Grinding for experience.  Sometimes you need to do something again and again and again to build experience in a certain profession.  If you want to be an artisan/crafter be prepared to make a lot of something that ends up getting destroyed and never used.  Prepare to make it again and again and again and again.....  This can be very boring.  Almost every profession requires something boring like this.  The only exciting one I've found is being a marksman or brawler where you get experience points for fighting and even then this is rather boring.  See #4 before.  For $15 a month, I'd expect more.  It would be nice if there was tasks you could take on for some professions to help build the experience and add variety to the game.3)  This is a resource HOG!!!  Half a Gig of memory and 4GB of hard drive space?!?!?!  Come on!!!  With this type of demand on my system I would expect much more.4)  Same-ol' bad guys.  Okay, I do quest after quest and they are all almost the same.  I fight the same small band of bad-guys, get my reward, and then repeat.  There is not much in the ways of getting different quests to perform.5)  Can only have one character per server.  This is the reason I'm not going to play anymore.  I wish I could build many characters on one server so I can still play with my group of friends.  I would like to have one character with a certain skill set and be able to swap him out for another character with other specialties for a certain quest.  However, each character you create has to play on different servers.So, if you like Star Wars, give this a go.  You might find it addicting to.  As for me, I'm bailing as I am switching over to World of Warcraft which seems to overcome many of these weaknesses... especially negative #4 and #5.  That just kills the enjoyment for me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2005"}

This is a fantastic game that has no comparison.  No game has a combat system like this.  No game has a magic system like this and no game has a world with as much personality as Fable 2.The combat system may not be particularly challenging, but it is finely tuned and fun to use.  The magic system, called Will, may not be the best in any game, but it definitely doesn't take away from the overall experience.  The story certainly takes a back seat to everything else you can do in the world.  It is hardly the highlight of the game.What makes this game so great is the world and all its underlying statistics.  Every character you encounter in the game has a name and a set of likes and dislikes.  Every city has an economy that effects market prices.  Every building can be purchased.  You have a dog that helps you out.  You can get married and have kids.  Or you can murder entire towns of people.There really are few words that can captivate the experience of this game.  I enjoyed it greatly.  I am an avid gamer and I played through the first Fable at least 3 times, so maybe I'm biased.

{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Andrew C.","summary":"The Light and the Darkness","reviewText":"KotOR is a very admirable effort by Bioware, renowned for its excellent Baldur's Gate fantasy roleplaying series, to bring its expertise to the Star Wars universe. Overall, the effort pays off handsomely, and I would rank this game as the best use of the Star Wars license, with the exception of Jedi Outcast.  It has a suitably epic story, Bioware's typically high-quality character development, and easy-to-learn and enjoyable gameplay. There are a few problems with KotOR, but in general, it is well worth the $20 that it can now be bought for.Gameplay: Like its great Baldur's Gate series, Bioware has delivered a storyline that is epic in both scope and depth. It is not particularly original and follows the Star Wars formula: rescue the damsel, fight the evil empire, discover the weakness of its super weapon, and duel the dark lord at the end. However, the storyline ranges over several planets, ties in a number of fascinating characters, and has a shocking plot twist about two-thirds of the way into the game that will make you reevaluate your character's purpose.  Much of the story is told through your interaction with 9 other characters who can join your party (though only 2 can travel with you at any given time).  As with Baldur's Gate, Bioware continues to do character development and interaction better than any company that I know of.The game itself is fairly easy to figure out and play. You develop a player character at the beginning, which you can customize in ways similar to the Dungeon & Dragons statistical model. The game is played through the keyboard and mouse.  Combat is turn-based, though it appears fluid and in real time.  There are a range of options for customizing your experience, from the kinds of skills and Force powers you choose to the wide range of weapons, armors, and other items that can be found or purchased.  Actually, the game resembles Diablo 2 in the way that it allows you to endow weapons and armor with various attributes.  Fortunately, unlike Jedi Outcast, there are not many puzzles to frustrate you and the game flows at a nice, even pace. It lasted me about 45 hours, which seemed long enough.  (One very fun mini-game called Pazaak, a sort of blackjack-like card game, could add several more hours of gameplay, as could trying to complete every side quest.)Unfortunately, all is not perfect with KotOR. I found the game to be very unstable on my computer, which surpassed the recommended requirements.  Even with the 1.03 patch, I counted almost 50 crashes to desktop during the loading of new areas and saved games, which is inexcusable. I am not sure why Bioware released this otherwise superb game with such a terrible bug, which many others have experienced. Hopefully, this will be avoided with KotOR 2 and future Bioware games.  More minor in nature, occasionally characters would not instantly follow the commands that I entered.  For example, the game automatically pauses when an enemy appears to allow you to queue a response.  Let's say you order one character to throw her lightsabre or order another to use Force push.  Occasionally, the character might just stand there or may run headlong into melee, as if you never entered the command. This is generally a minor annoyance, but can mean the difference between winning or losing some of the tougher fights. The only other problem that I saw with the game was balance. The blasters were nowhere nearly as good as the lightsabres in combat. Fortunately, you'll do just fine in this game with a lightsabre (or two) and some grenades and never really have to rely upon blasters.Graphics: The game is beautiful.  Character models, outdoor environment, special effects, and cutscenes are all very well done. The lightsabre combat looks as good as that of Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy, but you have much less control over it in KotOR.  The worlds that you visit are done in great detail, though they are not living worlds in the sense that there are no day & night time cycles or weather changes. The cutscenes look like movies, except the lip syncing for the models is somewhat off. Also, some character face models appear much too often throughout the game.Sound: The game sounds good, too.  The soundtrack by Jeremy Soule mixes some well-done original music with the epic music of the Star Wars movies.  Special effects, such as light sabres, alien voices, and space ships, sound as they should.  The voice acting is also well done.Replay/Value: I personally have no desire to play the game again, but I could definitely understand why a person would play it at least twice--once as a good guy and once as a bad guy.  There are so many dialogue options (every word of which is written and spoken) to choose from that you'll be curious to see how different responses affect the story.  Overall, this game is a great value for the current price (but do get the latest patch, for all its worth).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2004"}

It took me a little time to figure out the more advance controls, such as topspin or slicing the ball, but it really isn't too complicated.I think this game has a perfect balance of difficulty.  The tournaments start out fairly easy, allowing you to get used to the game and how the ball bounces, and then steadily get more difficult.One of the most impressive features, I thought, was that the game is chock full of many different things to do on the side, such as Hole-In-One mode, practice modes featuring specific kinds of shots, Ring Mode where you hit the ball through rings, Slot Mode where you can only use certain clubs, Character Matches where you can unlock special star versions of each character by beating them in a tournament, and much more!  There's even secret tournaments and several unlockable characters to find.If there is one particular flaw in this game, I would say that the putting really annoys me.  The putting, in my opinion, is not forgiving enough.  I have had scores of putts that stop just inches from the hole when they should go in.  Putting is definately the most difficult part of this game to master.So, if you like casual, fun golf games, or are a fan of the Mario sports games, then this game is definately one you should check out.

The graphics are great and the whole new veil/mire-stuff is also cool. A medallion that can make time go slower for you, empower your weapons and protect you. Many cool weapons as well. Unlike Return to CW, where you continously came to new locations all the time and never visited the same place twice, in this game you are mostly in the same town all the time and you'll travel back and forth to the same places many times, and it actually works quite well. Great game*****Tip: If you want a cool assignment, go to \"Midtown West\" after you have been briefed about the hospital-mission. Open the map of \"Midtown West\" and you should see a green question mark somewhere on the map. Go there and talk to the person standing there. He will tell you to go to a warehouse. Your next mission after that will be to pay a visit to a local obergruppenf&uuml;hrer's home and take him out. I think this is the coolest mission in the game.

Alright, now that you have it, know that you just spent the best $60 of your life.  Buying Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter (GRAW) is like getting two complete games for the price of one, Single Player campaign and Multiplayer, each alone being worth the price of admission.First we look at the single player campaign:  Without a doubt, the most jaw-droppingly gorgeous visuals ever created for a console game. GRAW boasts incredibly detailed 3D modeling and textures that one must truly see for their self to know how impressive it all is.  Then there are the effects... effects out the wazzu, from convincing particle effects like torrents of fire, rolling dust clouds, billowing plumes of smoke and explosions of atomic proportions, to stunning lighting and immersive atmospherics, every facet of the graphics are top-notch and life-like.  As for the sound design... wow, just wow.  The sound is just as beautifully crafted as the visuals, you can hear gun-fire in the distance and a crying baby down a desolate alley just before it all hits the fan and bullets zing by your ears from the left and an RPG comes in from behind and blows your eardrums out, temporarily deafening you.  GRAW employs some of the most advanced techniques and technologies to create a truly stunning masterpiece that is not to be missed.Next up, Multiplayer:  Many of you will jump straight into the LIVE (online) aspect of the game, which is ever so slightly toned down in comparison to the single player campaign, but still graphically outshines every  game you have previously played, single player & multiplayer alike.  The physics are spot on, if you down an enemy while he's standing on the stairs, his body will realistically tumble down the steps to the ground.  The objects and environments are so detailed you could easily find yourself getting sniped if you get too awe-struck and start staring at rain droplet's making ripples in an puddle or shiny shell casings rolling on the ground.  Every map in multiplayer is well balanced and loads of fun to play, you will have your favorites, but every one of them is a gem.  Not only are there many maps to chose from, there are many game modes to chose from like Elimination, Objective, CO-OP, and a myriad of option to create user definable custom match types.  More than enough to keep you busy.If you only buy one game in the next 4 months, make it GRAW.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2006"}
{"product_name":"B000TT4GBG","reviewerName":"Brian Seiler","summary":"Okay - Let's Get Serious","reviewText":"Kind of shocked there aren't more less-than-stellar reviews at the time that I write this, so I'll clarify some things before I begin.  For starters, we need to understand what we're reviewing.  We're not reviewing the game simply as a game, but instead the game and the three external control devices that you get for the princely sum of one hundred and seventy dollars.  That's going to be important in a minute.That out of the way, quick summary - Rock Band is basically Guitar Hero with drums and vocals, or, if you're not familiar with that game (for all you parents out there that couldn't possibly care less), it's a game where you take a plastic guitar or microphone or funny looking drum set and play along with some popular music roughly from the general direction of rock, probably with your friends.  Since I'm talking to the parents, I'll take this opportunity to let you know that unless you're strictly conservative (as in Shakers or so level of moral conservatism), this game is probably okay for your children so far as the content goes.  My filters don't pick up anything objectionable in the content that comes with the game.Now, this game is really four games (guitar, vocal, drum, and multiplayer) so let's look at each independently.The guitar part is unquestionably the best element of the game, which makes sense, since it's just an extension of Guitar Hero in that regard and that was pretty well refined at the point that Harmonix handed it off.  Comparing it to its nearest competitor (Guitar Hero 3), the set lists are better, the song styles are more varied, and the tabulature makes a lot more sense (Guitar Hero 3 was developed primarily by game designers, so they had a terrible tendency to just make everything a chord in hard and beyond, while the folks at Harmonix are all musicians, so things that should be single notes typically are only single notes).  The controller, however, is a weakness.First off, if your controller isn't broken, that's a good thing, and you're lucky, because mine was.  There was apparently some bad doings at the factory and the glue that holds the strum register on tended to break on some of the first run models, which led to your guitar becoming virtually unusable after five hours.  The tilt sensors in a number of them were also totally fried.  Outside of those technical issues, it's a mixed bag.  I like the weight and feel of the control a lot better than any of the other alternatives (it almost feels like a real instrument, with a proper weight distribution), and the different widgets are a lot more convenient to get to, but it seems that in fixing the problems earlier guitars had, the designers went overboard.  Now it's easy to reach from the green fret button to the orange fret button with one hand, but that's because the buttons are now adjacent.  They click much deeper than before and it doesn't take a lot of pressure to do that, and the result of all that is that you're going to hit a lot of buttons you don't mean to.  Most of the people I know that have the game are still using the Guitar Hero 3 controller, if that's any indication of how awkward it can feel.The drums....well, let's put it this way.  Either you're a drummer or you aren't.  The easiest drum parts are as hard as most normal guitar parts, and I can easily believe there are large numbers of people that just plain won't be able to do it very well and no amount of practice will help.  That's bad.  The drum charts that they force you to play also don't do much to help you learn how to, for example, keep one time with each hand and another with one foot.  The foot pedal has to be pushed pretty deep and it gave me leg cramps after a while.  The set itself is also loud as a donkey bleeding to death in a metal barn, which might be an issue for parents.The microphone works pretty well.  That's good.  Alternative microphones, however (like, for instance, a 360 headset) do not.  I am convinced that this is because things like screaming and loud talking are best filtered out of in-game conversation (what the headset is built for), but are necessary parts of rock music.  Long story short, if you intend to play and sing, you're going to end up buying a microphone stand.  I personally object to the difficulty of the vocal tracks, and the microphone (any of them) seem to do a remarkably terrible job of picking up high-to-low tone transitions.  You're probably going to be a little frustrated trying to nail five stars in normal on some songs if you're not a pretty good singer, which is bad.The multiplayer, I'm led to understand, is enjoyable, and I could definitely see that.  The multiplayer campaign is wonderful.  And should be the single player campaign.  And isn't.  And this bothers me.  The development team didn't get the online cooperative elements finished by release, with the result being that you cannot play the cooperative campaign online.  If you don't have friends you can bring over, or can sing well enough to play and sing at the same time, you'll never know how much fun it is.  I'm an old person.  My friends are married with children.  I cannot bring them over to my house to play pretend guitar with me.  This is unacceptable.On the whole, I wish I could recommend this package, but I just can't do it.  You're better off spending the money to get Guitar Hero 3 (inferior game, but superior value in this case) and just the game itself and playing the guitar parts.  In six months, and particularly if prices come down, it might be a good idea, and the downloadable content support for the title is amazing so far (cheaper than Guitar Hero 3 and better songs besides), but for the holiday season, I have to warn undecideds to stay away.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2007"}

It plays similarly to the older Fable games, but it's just not as well done.- Firstly, the graphics are kind of... muddled.  As you move, there's a sort of motion-blur to everything, so you can't really enjoy the scenery as you walk/run along.  It's only when you're stopped that everything is clear, and even then it's almost always too dark - I had to turn the gamma way up.- My tip to you: is don't save the game in the cloud.  Doing so won't allow you to cheat/get money like last time by adjusting your XBOX clock.  Save your games on your hard drive!  Although they've kinda gotten around this exploit with a new \"repair\" choice:  You can only collect rent for so long on a place until you need to \"repair\" it or the people renting from you will refuse to pay rent any longer.  Saving up gold is always utterly tedious in these games.  Make a million pies, hammer a million swords, dig up a million hidden packages.  It's repetitive and dull.- Interactions with people is utterly long and drawn out.  You have to dance and play pat-a-cake with people to get them to like you, and every interaction lasts 10-20 seconds, so you spend a lot of game time seeing the same thing 1,000s of times.  So boring.- The map isn't all that clear as to where things are in relation to each other.  I have no idea where anything actually is - I just use the map to fast-travel wherever I need to be.- Action is ok - using weapons and magic is kinda fun.  I have no idea where my health bar is though, mainly the game yells at you that you're low on health or something.- I don't like the new menu / interaction with items.  All items are now on a pillow or something at every vendor stand/shop.  It's weird.- I am not a big fan of the game so far.  It's more tedium than fun.  I may stop playing this if I find something better soon.**** UPDATE *I won this in no time flat!  I was playing it and next thing I knew, it was time for the \"final battle\"!  You don't get much warning beforehand, and I was looking to do a number of things before the game ended.  But BOOM - won it and I'm done.  I have no desire to re-play it or explore.

Footprints will be left in mud, for example, but only until it rains and then they will wash away. Lara's shirt will also get wet, and she's more likely to lose her grip if she is standing on a slippery, rain-soaked ledge. When the sun comes out, her shirt will dry and the slippery surfaces regain their friction.In Underworld, Lara also has a lot more flexibility in how she makes her way through a level, as there is often more than one way to get from here to there. She can now climb walls with texture and rocky outcroppings to reach areas she previously wouldn't have been able to access.All of these additions have been made to give the game a non-linear, open feel. Players can interactive with the environment by doing things they find to be intuitive, and the game will respond in an appropriate way. When Lara interacts with trees, for example, she will push aside leaves using either one or two hands depending on whether or not she's holding something. These details give a lifelike, immersive sensation to the game.New Melee Combat SystemUnderworld introduces a new melee combat system that requires players to strategically strike with offensive, defensive, and evasive maneuvers. Lara can now attack enemies with different punches, kicks, knees, and other acrobatic onslaughts. Items lying on the ground, such as poles that were previously walked on, can be picked up and swung at enemies. Players can also perform a greater variety of actions with weapons; for example, Lara can now hold onto a ledge with one hand and fire a gun with the other.Realistic Enemy and Animal AIThe AI in Tomb Raider: Underworld has also taken a big step forward--both enemies and animals now make independent decisions based on their surroundings, employ ambush and squad tactics when fighting, and will retreat if deemed necessary.With updated graphics and a more immersive and realistic gameplay, Tomb Raider: Underworld will have both fans and newcomers excited about the newest installment in this popular video game-pinup franchise.Tomb Raider: Underworld is loaded with a new melee combat system, various weapons, and smarter AI for both enemies and animals.","reviewerName":"Cute Chihuahua","summary":"Fun game overall but has some bug issues","reviewText":"Tomb Raider Underworld is the most recent and 8th game in the Tomb Raider series.  On a positive note, the graphics and the interactive environment aspects of the game are impressive.  Some of the levels are drop dead gorgeous.  For example the lush jungles of coastal Thailand with Lions that you must defend yourself against and the very realistic looking Mediterranean Sea complete with Sharks that will attack you if provoked.  During your adventure you will utilize a variety of weapons and tools like a grappling hook, dart gun, assault rifle, shotgun, sub-machine guns, pistols, sonar, medi-kits and more.  Laura's movement is much more realistic than in past games.  They claim there are over 2000 different movements that Laura can make in order to make her more life-like.  The levels are full of puzzles just like in previous versions of Tomb Raider and some may be very difficult for younger kids.  There is more combat in this version than on any other version.  The game is fun to play but has a lot of glitches that should have been resolved prior to being releases.  Some of the glitches that I found within the first few hours were being able to walk in mid air and getting stuck at certain unintended spots.  The camera view is often frustrating and often is difficult to see what you need to see.

The locales and palettes are just not as appealing, and the story meanders a bit. It takes some cool turns with flash backs and questioning motives, but it never feels like it knows quite exactly where it's going or how to properly address such important subjects.Multiplayer was good, after a lot of patching, the maps are lacking though compared to Uncharted 2 and the season pass was a complete ripoff.

But it is a waste! This was the first driving game released for PS4 because if it was released after any of the other driving games there would not have been enough sales to cover the costs to create this game, which is funny because it seems to be a very low budget game.But since so many people want to buy the game because it is NFS series, go ahead, you can return it within 30 days back to Amazon and pay only a restocking fee.This game is wack, poor graphics, poor gameplay, every aspect of this game is garbage. I bought this because I pre-ordered the PS4 and pre-ordered every game that was coming out for it, this game just became available months after there was a release date for PS4 and months after the other driving games announced they are coming out.When you see the name \"Need for Speed\" you already have certain expectations of the quality of this name and that is why you buy it. This game is crap, is seems like it was put together at the last minute only to take as much money as possible from people buying on day one. The game has single handedly ruined the reputation of Need for Speed series and most likely will cause failure of the future of the name as well. Other games for PS4 have trailers that already blow this game out of the water.The developers seem like they knew from the beginning that the only way they could make money in PS4 is the rush this release ahead of all other driving games because of its inferior design, graphics, gameplay and multi-player action.I played this game a few times and sold it for $30, I felt like I robbed that person because a month after its release the game had already dropped from $60 to $40.Wait for another game for ps4 to come out, this will really disappoint you.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2014"}

After I finished up with World At War I was hungry for some more and I picked this game up and I got to say it is a lot of fun.The graphics are pretty good for when it was made. Character models and particles such as smoke and fire look good. The level design is superb and better than most  shooters on the market. Also the cutscenes look nice and are well animated. Sound like most COD games is nothing short of excellent. The voice acting is great and it is cinematic enough and some of the characters have some funny lines along the way.Gameplay is fun and if you have played a Call of Duty game before you kind of know what you are in for. The way it works is enemies respawn until you reach an invisible checkpoint by following the mark on your compass. Once you hit the checkpoint the enemies stop respawning in that area and you move up and repeat this process. The scripting of the enemies is pretty good.The aiming controls are good but not perfect. If you have played a Wii FPS you will kind of know what to expect. They work good for aiming but they are not as good as games like MOH 2. The motion controls work most of the time but this was released early on in the Wii lifespan so at the time developers thought every single aspect needed waggle and thank god developers have learned not all motions will work good enough.Overall this is a very good game. It has a few shortcomings such as the controls are not perfect. It lacks all of the multiplayer modes of the other versions but it is still a very fun game. There is concept art and other things you can unlock also as you progress. I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys the FPS genre or anyone looking for a good game to pick up and play once in a while.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2009"}

I think that it is an amazing device.  As a late adopter of the PSP, I was disappointed at how quickly the PSP became obsolete compared to smartphones.  The Vita is my solution to all those problems.  There are just so many things I love about the device that I will just list them instead of writing a long review.-Incredible 5 inch OLED screen.  Maybe the best screen on any handheld device ever.  Once you watch movies or play PSP games on it, you will never want to go back to a PSP.  It makes them look their absolute best.-Amazing graphics.  I don't really need to explain this one, just watch any gameplay video.  With games this impressive at launch, it makes me excited to see what will be coming in the future.-Great interface.  Some don't like it, but I love the UI that has separate apps (I like to think of them as programs) running at the same time, and you can easily get to ones in the background by hitting the home button.-Cool community aspect.  With stuff like Near, cross-game chat (excellent microphone), friends app, and group messaging, you really feel connected to your community.My only real complaint with the system is the battery life.  I have been playing Uncharted GA at 75% brightness, and I usually get around 4-5 hours on a single charge, granted, Uncharted is the most graphically impressive Vita game.  Other than that, I am in love with this device.  If you have $249, don't hesitate to buy this machine, especially if you have a PS3.  Having a PS3 in tandem with the Vita will make downloading demos and transferring items back and forth that much easier.  Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2012"}

However, in this one, UbiSoft moved the developer to Shanghai and thus removing the intellect and creativity of the Montreal team -- and removing the inspiration from the original game.  The alarm system now mirrors the alarm system in Metal Gear Solid almost to a tee.  Next, the graphics remained the same with significant clipping still of dead bodies.  Third, the game has generally become too dark or too bright.  Additionally, the automatic &quot;auto&quot; of the SC-20 (when not in scope mode) has to the incredibly stupid addition in the game.  I liked the original when you could change whether to have single shot or automatic fire for the gun.  Lastly, the supporting characters (e.g., guards) are so bland.  I thought Ubisoft was going to include actual native-speak like in SOCOM 2.Now to the good stuff --There were several inspirational things in the game.  First, Sam will encounter an area which he must hide in the light which is a change.  Next, the train portion has to be the most enjoyable section of the entire game (although short-lived).  Third, the overarching storyline involving biological weapons being deployed in the United States is particularly disturbing.  Additionally, when Sam enters LAX Airport and the discussion between Lambert and Sam about LAX has to be the most freakish level in the entire game.  Lastly, the inclusion of the SWAT turn has to be the best change for Sam Fisher in the game.  It is invaluable.Overall, this game should be considered as partial sequel.

{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S. BubPros:Compelling, well-told storyGood action and combatFantastic sound and graphicsCons:Plot is familiar to fans of kung fu action filmsTask-and-exploration gameplay might seem slow to action gamers","reviewerName":"AMM \"adrian_m\"","summary":"Easily the BEST Dreamcast game released","reviewText":"Shenmue is the game that really got me back into gaming.  How is this possible?  It does something no one has been able to do correctly until now---create a living virtual world that is not only interactive, but open ended enough to allow plenty of freedom for the player.  I made the decision to buy an XBOX on launch day partly due to the fact that ShenmueII would be available for it...again, something I've never done before for ANY gaming system!I had purchased many DC games before Shenmue as was thoroughly disappointed or bored with them.  When I bought Shenmue, I found myself so engrossed in this epic game that the hours would pass by without me even consciously knowing it...something no game was able to do for me since the 16-bit days.  For that alone the game ranks very highly.Anyway, you've heard me rant about how I love Shenmue, but what's it about and how does it play?  The game is about a young Japanese man who's father is killed by a mysterious man.  The young man (Ryo) takes it upon himself to avenge his father's death and herein is the beginning of this awesome adventure.  The game is similar to a role playing game in that you build skills, solve some minor puzzles and do LOTS of questioning of townsfolk and so on to get to the bottom of the mystery.  Along the way you'll have the opportunity to not only focus on the quest and your physical martial arts training, but thanks to the open-endedness of the game, you can also play and have fun whether by playing actual arcade and parlor games, gambling in the casino, visting bars, or shopping for stuff and building your collection of toys!  It all takes place in a third person point of view similar to Tomb Raider, but with incredible graphics and without the horrible control.  Basically, you can do and see whatever you want.  Some minor rules such as time of day and some physical boundaries exist, but nothing too restricting!If you don't have this game yet and own a DC, you must play it now.  If you have an XBOX, be sure to buy SHENMUE II when it's released this fall!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2002"}

I will explain how it is superior in both performance and content, as I do not want my fellow Amazonians hindering themselves needlessly:1) PerformanceDigital Foundry, as usual, does a good job at explaining it, with comparison videos and proof:\"Framebuffer measurements give us our first indication of the quality of this multi-platform project. The Xbox 360 version of Dead Rising 2 runs at native 720p resolution with the bonus addition of 2x multi-sampling anti-aliasing. The edge-smoothing is welcome: the engine concentrates on handling huge numbers of zombies with plenty of draw distance, so the actual levels of geometry in the environments are fairly basic. In short, there are plenty of large edges to smooth!The PS3 version of the game shares the 2x MSAA of its 360 counterpart, but the unfortunate reality is that resolution has been compromised. There's little doubt that Dead Rising 2 on the Sony platform is running sub-HD, with 1024x576 appearing to be the game's native resolution.\"\"First up, there's some good news for Xbox 360 owners. Probably the most immediately apparent upgrade over the first game is that the developer is running with v-sync active, meaning that there is absolutely no screen-tear at all - so all tear graph indicators on the video refer to the PS3 version of the game.\"\"The PS3 rendition of Dead Rising 2 appears to be using an entirely different approach to the rendering. V-sync is disengaged completely, as is the 30FPS frame-rate cap. What this means is screen-tear is an ever-present element of the image, even when the game is exceeding 30FPS.\"[...]2) ContentAs if performance issues weren't a reason alone to choose the 360 version instead, now there's content, too. The Xbox 360 got an XBLA game a few weeks back titles: Dead Rising 2: Case Zero. It's the prologue of Dead Rising 2 and shows how Chuck enters Fortune City with his daughter. The surprising thing is, although only an XBLA game, it plays and looks very much like the actual game. It broke XBLA week 1 sales records, too. ([...])As if that wasn't enough, there is going to be an exclusive Dead Rising 2: Case West for the Xbox 360 (unknown yet if it's a retail game, XBLA or DLC addon) where, you guessed it, you can play co-op with FRANK WEST from Dead Rising 1! He \"covered the war,\" y'know.Lastly, Dead Rising 1 is only on Xbox 360, and although this isn't a reason really, it's just there. Capcom couldn't let DR2 stay exclusive since Resident Evil 5, Devil May Cry 4 and many others are now on Xbox 360, too. It just wouldn't be fair!Enjoy your game guys; I know I am.

During their voyage, they discover a nefarious entity has created turmoil in the structure of time in order to take control of the world, causing the heroes to travel to places they never imagined possible. Remastered exclusively for the PSP system, this all-new anniversary edition features all-new character art, updated graphics, new dungeons, full 16:9 widescreen presentation and an updated camera view that gives players a new vantage point on such a timeless classic RPG.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A Classic Reborn Again","reviewText":"It's hard to review a re-release of the first Final Fantasy.  On one hand, the game is pretty good; great for it's time.  The keywords being: For it's time.  On the other hand, with yet another re-release of Final Fantasy, you kinda wish by now that Square-Enix would do something to make it more \"modern.\"  Regardless of where you fall, Final Fantasy is a good game.  The problem is that for the more modern day gamer, there's no assurance that you'll really get into this if you can't deal with the 20 year old mechanics.  The other bad thing about Final Fantasy on the PSP is simply that if you've already got Dawn of Souls or Origins, then there's no real incentive to pick up the PSP version.  The fact that the other re-releases included Final Fantasy II can also be a sting to the PSP version of the game.Final Fantasy is a simple basic storyline.  Four warriors must come forth and save the world by using the power of the crystals.  Your main characters don't say a word, and you begin the game by choosing their character classes.  There's no narrative to drive the story along either, and like a ton of RPGs made in the 80's and early 90's there's also no way of telling where you're supposed to go next without talking to lots of people and then running around aimlessly, while gathering tons of levels in the process. To me that spells fun, but if you're an RPGer who began with the later games in the series (particularly from the Playstation era), it's hard to say you'll really love Final Fantasy if you can't let those little tidbits slide.  The game is also incredibly slow paced.  Again, it's something that RPGers who began with later Final Fantasy games or later RPGs will have to take time to get used to.Gameplay wise, Final Fantasy hasn't changed a bit.  Not in the slightest.  Battling is as basic as ever.  Completely turn based.  However, Final Fantasy is usually pretty fun to battle in.  Provided you don't mind that sometimes combat is sluggish (or that you could be attacked by nine enemies at once).  The music in battle is upbeat, and the enemies are really nicely drawn.  Just the same, it's pretty strategic.  You choose a class for each of your characters at the beginning of the game.  You can make them a Warrior, White Mage, Black Mage, etc.  It makes a huge difference in how hard or easy the game can be as a whole.  For example, only Red and White Mages can heal, but only White Mages can learn the more advanced White Mage spells.  So battling remains pretty fun, even if it is pretty straightforward.What will probably annoy gamers is the unforgiving random encounter rate.  There are times when you just don't feel like battling.  It also doesn't help that the failure rate of running is also somewhat high.  If you've been playing RPGs since the SNES days, the slight dip in difficulty might annoy you.  The game is still challenging, but not nearly as challenging as its 1987 original, or the 2003 version.  It's even easier than the Dawn of Souls remake.The biggest problem that Final Fantasy on the PSP suffers from is that if you've already played through the adventure in one of the other remakes, there's really nothing here that justifies doing it again.  Final Fantasy is a gem; a game everyone should play at least once... but some of its aspects have not aged very well.  For PSP owners the only plus they get (aside from all the extras in the GBA version) is one new dungeon.  It also doesn't help that the other re-releases of the game came with Final Fantasy II, and they were priced at the same value.On the positive side, however, the PSP version is the best looking version of the game yet.  Everything is given a lot of artistic detail.  The sprites and enemies have never looked better.  It doesn't quite push the PSP to its limit, but it's still really beautiful to look at.  Just the same, the music also sounds really good.  It's also really cool that you'll be seeing the game in widescreen too.Really, the only big problem with Final Fantasy is that it's a remake of a remake of a remake that doesn't offer enough new content to justify a buy to those who've already played it before.  Also, like the re-release of Final Fantasy III, its age is really starting to show.  There are just some aspects of the gameplay you wish Square would've thrown in for the sake of updating the game.  What it boils down to is simple: You're buying an NES game.  Expect the NES limitations.Regardless of whether you believe it needed a more \"modern\" update or not Final Fantasy isn't a bad game, but investing in another remake if you've already got Origins or Dawn of Souls?  That's hardly worth it.Even if you haven't played Final Fantasy before, the PSP one is hard to justify when you put into account that the other remakes also came with Final Fantasy II, and they were priced at the same value.  If you absolutely MUST play Final Fantasy and you haven't done so, I suggest heading on down to your local used game store and picking up the GBA version.  It may not be as pretty, but you get Final Fantasy II with it, and it's cheaper.Pros:+The prettiest version of the game yet+Still sounds good+There's a bonus dungeonCons:-The pacing of the story is really slow-The random encounter rate is really high-There are just some aspects of the game that don't age very well-It's another remake of Final Fantasy... but this one offers little in the way of new content.  You get all those GBA extras, but the only PSP exclusive extras are some enhanced graphics and a brand new dungeon.  It's hard to urge a gamer that already has the GBA version or even the Origins version to go out and get his one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2007"}

Now repackaged as one of PlayStation'sGreatest Hits, this top-selling game takes you away on a tropical island adventure that is filled with precarious enemies and challenging levels. Our spiky-haired hero Crash needs no weapons to survive the harsh jungle. Instead, he jumps, jogs, and spins his way through numerous lush and downright fun environments.With 26 levels spanned across three tropical islands,Crash Bandicootis sure to amuse old gamers as well as new. Crash must rescue his girlfriend, Tawna, from the evil clutches of Dr. Cortex. Along the way, he can gather fruit for extra lives, smash boxes for random prizes, and gather tokens that can be used for bonus rounds. Numerous big bosses block your path, which also includes more than a few risky jumps that require split-second timing.Crash Bandicoot's impressive graphics and strong gameplay have already won over many hard-core and casual gamers.

In the end, many gamers liked Crash's non-stop action, but others simply just skipped it. Even though it was very promising, Crash's gameplay did not really offer anything new, which featured elements you can find in a 16-bit platformer.You play as Crash, whose girlfriend is kidnapped by Dr. Neo Cortex. You basically just run through the levels from start to finish and fight bosses after each world. Even though the action is intense throughout, the gameplay becomes really tedious. Crash Bandicoot did nothing new for adventure games and it isn't really 3D since you're restricted to one path. All you do is make your way through levels, dodging obstacles, avoiding enemies, and collect items and nothing more. The difficulty level is not exactly high either, and the challenge is severely lacking.Crash's graphics are quite impressive for a PlayStation game, including well-textured environments and colorful characters. Effects like running water and mist and fog are great eye-candy. The visuals are the game's only saving grace. Controlling the bandicoot can be a hassle since it doesn't use analog. You're forced to deal with sensitivity of the crosspad and at times will result in unwanted deaths.Aside from good graphics, you're left with nothing but an average platformer equivalent to that of a 16-bit Sonic game in a polygonal world. While it may be 3D, Crash plays out too much like an old side-scrolling game of the past. I don't know why would anyone want to play this game because Crash Bandicoot pales in comparison to other breakthrough adventure games at the time, like Sega's NiGHTS and Nintendo's Mario 64.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2000"}

{"product_name":"B007V6MQR6","description":"","reviewerName":"AeroEngineer","summary":"Confused game, bad controls","reviewText":"This game is a hybrid of games we've all played before but it makes for an overall confused experience because of that. It is an interesting idea to take the best games and sort of mix them up though. It's got the focus button and combat cover system of Gears of War along with RPG elements in it and button mashing/timed events too.I'm not a big fan of the \"mic\" commands interface since I don't have a mic on my computer it makes for an awkward unnecessary element in my mind. I'm forced to push the tab button and then select a command with the F button all while trying to blast the bad guys. Trying to pick the right comment to get what you want out of teammates is more of a tedious chore than any fun and their usually phlegmatic responses don't improve it. Having to watch for the comment button to move forward I guess forces you to be attentive. Even if I did have a mic button it's just too weird to talk to myself out loud while I'm playing a game. Hope they drop this part if there is a second game.Also this is just not a PC game, it's really an afterthought port. It's painfully evident from the first time you start the game. The controls are default Xbox control mapped. Once you change the settings to mouse/keyboard(MKB) it's another painful surprise that the mapping seems odd. Spacebar and F are the enter and exit as well as action buttons with the mouse being standard point/shoot. I wish they could have done more work with the mouse wheel/wheel buttons as far as switching weapons, etc.As far as combat it's pretty standard GOW stuff, cover, shoot etc. I wish there was the option to use the grenade as a separate button as it is you have to use 1234 to switch to grenade throw it then switch back to your shooter. The weapons are pretty standard which is disappointing in such a futuristic game a bit of imagination there would have been nice.There are too many cut scenes in this game, thankfully they had the good sense to make them largely optional. It feels like you are just watching a CG movie, 3-4 cut scenes in one long sequence.This game could have been much better but there are too many elements that take away from the flow of the action, which is what this game is at heart: an action game. The RPG elements via the command menu are unnecessary to me and poorly executed. When not in combat the character interactions/interaction menu is uninteresting and annoying. The whole trust system via making the right comments and actions is another unnecessary.Graphics are pretty standard, nothing spectacular but nothing terrible.I wouldn't recommend this at it's current price, if you can wait until there is a sale or simply wait a month or two and get it when it's at the correct price: 20 bucks or less.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Michael J. Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"Feed me, Seymour?","reviewText":"I played through the first Halo and really enjoyed the single-player campaign.  I never played the multiplayer game until I bought Halo 2.Let's get this out of the way first: Halo 2's multiplayer is unparalleled.  With a multitude of multiplayer games (Capture the Flag, Juggernaut, Team vs. Team, etc.) and a dizzying variety of terrains, there's plenty to keep Halo fans busy blowing each other up.  The addition of the alien Elites as a playable character spice things up.  You can also wield two weapons at a time, one in each fist, providing another combat option for those gunslingers that like their battles John Woo-style.Unfortunately, Halo 2's single-player campaign is not as impressive.  To whit, the alien Covenant's entire society is based on the idea that activating the giant rings throughout the universe (known as Halos) will put them on their journey of spiritual evolution.  The reality is that Halo is a weapon designed to destroy the Flood, an infestation of aliens who turn human and alien alike into vicious zombies.  And how do you keep the Flood from infecting every living thing?  Why, by utterly destroying every living thing in the universe of course!Play alternates between Master Chief and the alien elite known as the Arbiter.  This gives the player both sides of the story, which is interesting...to a point.  Eventually, the plot converges enough so that the two characters should really end up fighting each other.  That would have been something, if the AI made you play through both battles from opposite sides by creating an enemy that uses your own moves.But instead, about midway through the battle for the universe, a giant plant that looks like Audrey II from Little Shop of Horrors shows up. This planet, speaking in Jabba-esque guttural tones, rams the plot down our throats by grabbing the Arbiter and Master Chief and shoving them into opposite plot lines: the Arbiter ends up working with the humans, Master Chief ends up doing the alien dirty work.Then things really get going, and just as Halo 2 hurtles towards the final battle on Earth...the game ends. I should have guessed something was up when, during E3 interviews about Halo 3, the CEO of Bungee only had this to say: \"Are you ready to finish the war?\" What he meant was, \"Are you ready to finish the game you thought you were finishing in Halo 2?\"As you've probably noticed from my review of the second installment of Pirates of the Caribbean, I really, really, REALLY hate movies and games that fail to provide a whole story.  It doesn't matter that this is part two of a three-part series.  Writers and developers have an obligation to provide a full story; you CAN create a story with a beginning and end even though it's the middle of a series, as evidenced by The Two Towers.Halo 2 is an improvement on the original, but it loses points for a weak campaign that forces you to play both sides, then throws in a talking plant to clean up the mess.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2006"}

{"product_name":"B0009O7HVW","reviewerName":"D. Mok","summary":"Sadly, major flaws mar an otherwise exceptional game.","reviewText":"This was indeed a saddening experience.  The first X-Men Legends was pretty flawed, but this one was really a blast to play for the most part.  I was smelling a five-star rating until the last third of the game, when serious problems crop up to make this game sometimes frustrating, sometimes infuriating...and at this point, unplayable (more to follow).Pros:- Most of my criticisms of the previous games have been acknowledged.  Character abilities are much more diverse, so they feel much more like unique personalities now.  And who wouldn't like playing with Magneto, Toad, or Juggernaut?- Character training has been improved.  In the previous game, the biggest problem was that you get so few ability points that you don't get to play around with some of the less useful, more exotic character skills.  Here, characters can be customized to an impressive extent.- Bishop was always one of my favourite X-Men, not to mention one of the few genuinely black characters (instead of a white character with brown skin, like Storm) in the comics.  Great to see him in this game.- The new \"Blink Portal\" feature allows you to call up a save point in most places every five minutes.  This is an excellent balance between not letting the player save for 20 minutes straight (a major problem in X-Men Legends) and so many saves that the challenge goes right out the window.- The fighting system has been tweaked, all for the better.  Enemies are smarter, and sometimes it's frustrating to fight them, but in this game, it's a good kind of frustrating -- challenging instead of annoying.  Whereas I couldn't wait to get the fights over with in X-Men Legends, here they flow seamlessly into the rhythm of the puzzle-solving, exploration, character training, and story.- Maps are much, much clearer.  The Automap feature is absolutely indispensable.  And probably in response to accusations that X-Men Legends was too short, they have increased the maps drastically in size.  But thanks to the new save system, it's not a laborious bore to explore the world.- Item collection is more accessible this time around.  It's much easier to discover things as you run/fly around the map.Cons:- This is the biggest one.  I beat the game once and was delighted to see an option I clamored for in the first X-Men:  The ability to replay the game using the characters you've been using, retaining your hard-earned abilities and items.  But as I played on after beating Apocalypse, the game acquired this incredible tendency to crash.  I'm not talking every hour -- I'm talking about loading a game, walking two paces to get to Zealot, and having the game freeze up the minute I defeat him.  The game crashed at least 20 times (not an exaggeration) in one morning.  Basically, it's unplayable.  I don't care what the cause is or what game this happens to; it's unacceptable.- Some of the Danger Room missions are well nigh undoable.  In one Defend mission, you're supposed to protect Havok from harm.  He's standing on the other side of the screen and it takes about five seconds to get to him.  For the first dozen times I tried this course, Havok died within three seconds of starting the mission, before I even had time to switch characters to activate a healing ability.  Did they actually test this?- They actually put too many items into the game.  Variety and flavour are good, but at a certain point, it became too much of a strain to try to distribute equipment over and over.- Lots of the voice work and cinematics are poorly paced.  I don't need eight seconds of the camera panning to the electric trap I just disarmed, thank you very much.  They should have allowed us to skip some of these with the Start button.Overall, I had a very good time playing this game.  So it was very frustrating to see that the massive crashing problem suddenly emerge, rendering the game pretty much unplayable for me.  X-Men Legends had the same kind of crashes, just not as frequently, and none of my other games has this problem, using this exact same console with the same memory cards, which leads me to believe there's something wrong with the way the game was programmed.  Activision really needs to solve this, because no one will ever have the patience to play a game that crashes every three minutes.  What a dismaying development to what is otherwise a very fun, well-balanced game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2005"}

Rhodes","summary":"Stunning Handheld Gaming at Your Command","reviewText":"The Nintendo DS has enjoyed much success lately.  Star Fox Command joins the ranks of being one of Nintendo's better DS games out there.  It has a couple of misses, but it excels heavily in the places where it counts.  Star Fox Command is a fantastic handheld gaming experience.The Star Fox team, after defeating Andross, has disbanded.  Soon afterwards, a new threat known as the Anglar has emerged.  It's up to Fox McCloud to deal with these foes, and there's no way he can go at it alone.  When you first go through the game, there's not really a whole lot you can do, and the story doesn't seem very satisfying.  In fact, the first time through the game the path you go is completely set for you.  The standard storyline is pretty short and easy.  The good news is once you complete the standard story you can choose different paths to take, and uncover several different endings in the process. Each character has his/her own storyline.  In short, the game will keep you busy for a while.Star Fox Command definitely sports some fantastic graphics.  Perhaps even some of the best the DS has seen.  There's no slowdown, and the character models and storyboards are fantastically detailed.  It's far superior to Star Fox 64.  The graphics are just one of the high points of Star Fox Command.One of the high points of Star Fox Command is the gameplay.  While in the past Star Fox has pretty much been your standard flight/shooter.  Before it was to kill everything in sight.  Now the gameplay has taken on a more strategic feel.  Just about everything you do is done on the touch screen for the game.  At first it feels a little strange, but the execution is straight on.  You'll have to plot out your ships courses and then fly to them.This isn't to say you won't be doing any aerial combat. The game has a map mode and a battle mode.  When in battle mode it's basically the same as all-range mode on Star Fox 64.  This will mostly be used to battle bosses and shoot down enemies.  From time to time you'll have to do a \"chase\" mission. In these mission you'll have to fulfill special tasks, such as shooting down a missile.  The only thing the touch screen isn't used for is to shoot.  You'll use the face buttons (or directional buttons) for that.  Other than that, all your flying mechanics take place on the touch screen.There are plenty of things to beware in a mission, however.  The objective is mainly just to kill all the bad guys, but there are plenty of ways you can lose.  If the Great Fox is destroyed, or the time runs out, or you lose all your spare pilots, the game is over.  It may seem like a lot at first, but most of the areas to fight your missions in are pretty small, and it's not so hard to deal with everything going on at once.  Of all these assets that could cause you to lose a mission, the only one to pay any real attention to is making sure the Great Fox doesn't get destroyed.Star Fox also has multiplayer.  Up to six people can play off of one card.  Or you can go online and battle with three other people.  Multiplayer drops the strategic ploy, though and instead pits you in aerial combat against your friends (or online opponents).  Multiplayer basically consists of you shooting down your opponents and collecting the stars they drop.  It's on a time limit, though, so you have to work fast.  When the time runs out, the one with the most stars at the end wins.  Multiplayer is a blast, but there really should've been a lot more of it to go around.  There really aren't enough modes.There's no voice acting in Star Fox Command.  It's mostly the gibberish you heard in the original Star Fox on your SNES. However, the game does allow you to record your voice using the DS's microphone.  You can say a few things into your DS microphone and Fox, while in combat, will say these things in your tone of voice.  It's really cool, but doesn't really enhance the gameplay any at all.  It's just a neat little gimmick.Star Fox Command is a great game.  It has a couple of short-commings, but for the most part, it's a great gaming experience.  Star Fox fans should be pleased at the new strategic direction of the game, and the intuitive gameplay.On the Positive Side+The game looks absolutely gorgeous+The strategic gameplay is fairly addictive+The touch screen controls are great+Extras after you complete the main storyline+Different scenarios+Recording your own voice is pretty cool+There's MultiplayerOn the Negative side-The main storyline is rather short-The game is also rather easy-Multiplayer is fun, but severely limited-Even though it's really nice to record your own voice, it's rather sad that the characters don't have real voices, and instead have the same gibberish used in the original Star Fox","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2006"}

Little did i know this is actually one of the best series on playstation it is basically an up to date platformer in the vein of mario with collecting coins and tons of collectibles. What sets this apart is the cool spy stealth angle where you hide from villians and you also can mask yourself in this. The cool part about this is you go in time to see all of Sly's relatives which gives the game a lot of depth. There is so much to do and explore its crazy and especially for a handheld, I don't think the other handheld can approach something like this. Anyway i got this version without the ps3 because I am so often traveling to work on the light rail, and like a meaty adventure like this to make the time go away. It still has a great look and different style than most games and also has that old school gameplay of the ps2 without changing like ratchet did in the last versions.

{"product_name":"B0000TSRA6","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"Outbreak puts the S back in Survival","reviewText":"As it stands Outbreak is the pinnacle of the Survival Horror genre, but does not come so neatly packed... however it certainly is a very original and a new type of gaming experience. Minus the cons this is still a five star game and a must for SH fans, but those who do not always like this sort of game may find Outbreak a little, how do we say, complex and tedious. The problem with this game is whether you will like its style or not. If you are a SH fan then obviously just get it. If you are not such a SH fan then rental is probably advisory, but be prepared to spend a day or two adjusting to it.Outbreak sports what could possibly be conceived as endless playability but some things must be sacrificed and changed from the older titles. There is no complete story... (except possibly continue scenarios in Outbreak 2 which looks likely)... just 5 rather large scenarios. Each scenario has roughly two to three save points in vast levels. The gaming experience can last up to thirty minutes between save points. Each game is run in real-time. This means that the pause screen is no longer the items menu screen, but a different button. When you access the item menu screen the game does not pause (this has to do with the online multiplayer mode) and thus things can still attack you. This is actually very good and just makes the game more dramatic and frantic... which it is most of the time. There are 20+ characters to choose from when you fully complete the game. Each character has a special ability for the gaming experience which can range anywhere from picking locks to having a very big weapon at the start. In single player mode the character AI is like nothing you have played with before. The right analogue stick is used for commands... like when you have been attacked by a zombie and are down to your last bit of health you can scream for help and if someone is nearby, and in good mood, they will help you. Sometimes they will not. Other times they will tell you that they do not want to help you ever. If you survive and save them, then you could find them doing very helpful things for you. You can also swap items between players, however this is mainly because you have a very limited inventory (usually only 4 - 5 items) and need cooperation from another team member to help you out. You can also pick up the wounded and drag them around while trying to escape. In real-time this makes Outbreak an absolutely thrilling experience. There is no question, once Outbreak starts to rock it REALLY ROCKS LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE SEEN BEFORE! Imagine standing on a ledge, a zombie smashing through the window trying to catch a wounded guy while you fill some dead nurses head full of hot lead, who happened to be your best buddy only two moments ago before you let her get bit by a rabid dog, while at the same time the doctor who you need to survive is screaming in the corner for help because he has just been attacked by some beast that has just been vaporized in the temperature control room. You don't think twice about it. Floor stomp the nurse when she is down, pick up the doctor and drag him onto the next level to try and find some meds so that he can help you to get better... while at the same time the clock is ticking because everyone is infected and you can not let the virus meter reach 100%! It has all the puzzles, all the monsters, all the mazes of the original game for the diehards.Load times are Major Pain #1. Some levels take 20 seconds to start up. Movement between rooms is the worst with a delay just under 7 seconds. If you want to play a fluid moving Outbreak experience then you need to buy a PS2 Hard Drive which reduces the load times considerably... but investing in extra PS2 gear may not be the way to go because of Major Pain #2....... is that Capcom have really messed up the game's multiplayer system. If you are getting this game for that then be prepared for the ups and downs. This was the game to really pioneer the broadband capability of the PS2. Instead it just doesn't work, is buggy or when it does work you are playing with people who are useless. To have a good on-line game is like winning the lotto. In Europe Capcom delayed the game for half a year because they could not get ISPs to work with them. So everyone in Europe waited for nothing. Capcom says that they may get a European Multiplayer going soon but I would not chance waiting another half a year for it. Multiplayer is flawed at best.Aside from the problems that game design is amazing. The character movement can be stiff at times and avoiding some zombies nearly impossible, but the damage dynamics of the objects and weapons on yourselves seems almost endless especially when more than two characters start crawling about on the floor while a third limping one is trying to help you up. It is all very realistic with a very organic feel to the whole environments. Although this is not half as scary as Silent Hill 3, the levels look better and the cut scenes are up there in the million dollar cost region no problem.The bottom line is that this is one of the best PS2 games ever... depending on how you like this Genre. However it is probably a disaster on the Multiplayer front so only get it for the Single Player mode only. Get the HD for faster load speeds.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2004"}

{"product_name":"B0050SWBAE","description":"","reviewerName":"SDolnik07","summary":"Great fun game to play alone or with another!","reviewText":"The singleplayer of this game is great! You end up controlling three different captains which you can use strategically along with 5 different types of pikmin that each have their own strengths/weakness/uses. In order to do the best each level you need to split your captains up and have great time management and multitasking skills! Each day is a couple minutes which leaves you to find fruit to bring back to your ship in that set amount of time and once the day is over you got to get your pikmin back to your ship or they die! You will want to replay levels after you beat the game because you sometimes find out faster and better ways to use your time and map out your captains and Pikmin accordingly. The boss fights are challenging and fun as well! The main game takes about 10 hours to beat but is longer depending if you replay levels to get all the fruit.Multiplayer is also very fun you are able to pick between Bingo battle which is a fun and addicting vs mode or you can play treasure, creature or boss battle challenges together or single player which are fun and keep you coming back for more to try and platinum them!The Game supports the Gamepad, Pro Controller and the Wii remote with a nunchuck. Ive played the game with all of them and every control scheme works wonders, the gamepad shows the map and lets you move captains around manually through touch, as well as showing you were fruit and Pikmin are located. The Wii remote with nunchuck is probably the best control scheme because the pointer controls really are more responsive and accurate then the control stick on the Pro or game-pad controllers.I overall give the game a 9.5/10 Id recommend it highly to anyone who has played the past games in the series. This is my first game of the series and I loved it. If you also love strategy games or games where you learn and improve as you play then go for it! Its one of the freshest and most unique games I have ever played!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2013"}

Now a letter from your father provides the first clue in a strange adventure to the mysterious Blood Edward Island. But what could a memory-generating computer and a ghost named D have to do with your parents' disappearance? Blood Edward Island won't give up its secrets easily, so you'll have to trace the clues to find the truth.","reviewerName":"Lestor neeker Wong","summary":"An adventure that's over almost too quickly","reviewText":"The Nintendo DS has served up some intriguing games of late, and Trace Memory is definitely one of them. Unlike games that place emphasis on violent contents to attract a fan base, Trace Memory relies on the good old point-and-expore adventures that we used to play on the PC. With many instances of puzzle-solving, several areas for exploration, as well as some stunning visual and audio presentations, Trace Memory could really be one of the best DS games to date. Unfortunately, before we could even get warmed up, it's over. The length, or lack of it, of the game is perhaps the one thing the mar the otherwise great adventure.The plot of the game is simple. You assume the role of Ashley Mizuki Robbins, the daughter of a pair of scientists working on a research known only as \"Trace\". Believing that your parents were dead, you were surprised to receive a package from your father just before your 14th birthday. The package contains a DTS (Dual Trace System), which looks exactly like the Nintendo DS, as well as an invitation to a certain Blood Edward Island to meet him. Your adventure begins on this island, which used to house the Edward family.While searching for your father on the island, you come across the ghost of a boy named \"D\", who has been dead for almost 57 years. Logic tells you that he has something to do with the Edwards. So begins a few hours of companionship, which sees D and you scout around the island and the Edwards' mansion for clues that may lead to a recovery of both his or your memories.Throughout the search, you'll encounter several puzzles that made up the bulk of the game's gameplay. The puzzles you find can range from the relatively easy, to the ultimately head-banging. Solving puzzles mostly requires the use of your stylus, but at times, the entire DS comes into play - no, I'm not kidding. In fact, some of the puzzles in this game can't be solved unless you find an out-of-the-box way to utlilise your DS.Examining the areas in this game will unlock several items, which will be useful in solving the puzzles. Backtracking is frequently required, however, because you won't pick up items that you find no use of. Apart from items, you'll also find DTS cards, which are shaped like a Nintedo DS game cart. These carts contain messages from your father to you, as well as his journals. Reading them will give you more insight into the story.Puzzles and items aside, you'll come across snippets of the past all over the game. These will either trigger D's, or your very own memories. Collecting all memories for D will unlock an alternate ending, but it's not essential for the completion of the game. Unless you're a completist, or you really feel for him, you may just conveniently get done with your side of the story and move on.As I mentioned, the game is relatively short though, and a first attempt going through it shouldn't take you than five hours. A second playthrough, if you already know the puzzles and manage to skip past the conversations, will take half that amount of time. All in all, the length of the game makes it really unfulfilling if you're looking for a longer adventure. Completing it a second time, however, unlocks some different messages of DTS cards, as well as an additional ending, which may interest some players. But after that, you'll find no incentive to replay the game.Still, you can't fault Cing's attempt in creating the game. Not when the graphics are so beautifully rendered, and the sound, so perfectly complementary. You'll find both 2D and 3D graphics in this game, and they're drawn in a mixture of anime and American style, which should appeal to people from most masses. The details on closed-up items are also nicely drawn, which is a testimony to how much effort has been put into the graphic designs. The audios may be a little bland for some quarters, but the various background music fit the mood of the scenarios pretty well, which is also a plus point for any game.In close, I'll say that Trace Memory is a fun game for fans who enjoy games of this genre. However, even so, it may not be worth the retail price since it's just too short. I'd only recommend a purchase if you don't mind the length, or if you're looking for a short, but refreshing game that doesn't take up too much of your time to complete.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2005"}

Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both?

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

F.E.A.R. stands out from shooters today for it's ability to slow down time with the click of a button, and because it's really gory, which is a good thing. The graphics are superb and the audio is really amazing. Only downfall of having a high-profile game is it comes at a hardware cost. You'll won't be running this game on low settings with 256MB of memory (which why in the world would you only have that in today's world?).The single player portion of the game is alright. There's nothing really exciting about it, especially giving the length in which to beat it. I beat it around 5 hours, which after playing many great first person shooters, such as Half-Life, you really wonder why they decided to make the game this short. Other than that, the levels are extremely linear, which makes the game really easy. I really didn't have any trouble knowing where to go next, which is a good thing and a bad thing. There should have been more puzzles laying around the game. The characters in the game are very limited as well. You'll fight a total of 5 or 6 different style enemies: humans, Robocop robots, flying robots, and some ghosts. There's nothing too special about them, aside from the robots are harder to kill. The good thing about the slow-motion is that you can literally aim better, as well as get a few cool looking shots in at the last moment. The bad thing is that the slow-motion makes the game extremely easy. The last really bad thing about the single player is the lack of an end-game boss. The game just sort of ends, after a short epilogue. Being it's a horror game, I'm really not sure what I was suppose to be scared of. I jumped once or twice, but that was pretty much it. The quality of the story was pretty good though. They have some good twist at the end, leaving you wanting more, which is exactly what happens.As far as the single player goes, the game was very mediocre, at best. However, the multi player, is where it's at. There's a lot of options in the game types, such as your typical DM/TDM all the way to Slo-Mo DM, which is generally a mix of DM and capture the flag. You run and look for a device to slow down time, all the while fighting off everyone that's following your glow. However, if you happen to charge up your Slo-Mo, you can literally slow down time to your advantage, meaning you'll move slightly faster than everyone and shoot more accurately. There's plenty of really good maps to fight on as well. You'll recognize a lot of the single player areas in the multi player, which is pretty cool.The only thing that really doesn't do it for me about the weapons is the lack of selection. There's some really unique weapons (the predator, or spike gun, to some), but overall, the weapons are just pretty boring. However, in the multi player, you won't really mind as much since one of your best weapons is going to be your melee combat.I recommend this game for someone looking for some amazing multi player, but I really can't recommend the single player to anyone. It really feels like a console first person shooter, meaning it is shorter than normal, and very limited. However, I really don't even recommend buying the game unless you just want to support Sierra and Monolith. You can download F.E.A.R. Combat, which is the full multi player experience of F.E.A.R. for free on their website. Maybe if they release a platinum edition of F.E.A.R. (with both new expansions), I could recommend it as a purchase, but it's really nothing more than a few hours of fun, aside from the multi.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2009"}

I love everything about them, from the music, to the graphics, to the storylines intricately woven into each one.  Now comes Silent Hill 4 The Room, which is a new story that revolves around the events in all the other games.  Well, I shouldn't say that, but the other games have something to do with this one, in one way or another.I have just beaten this game, and I was quite impressed.  The story was good, the graphics were good.  But wait, something is missing.  Actually, make that three things are missning.For anyone who have ever played any of the Silent Hill games, you should have noticed certain reoccuring items in 1 through 3.One, the fog.  Two, the radio.  Three, the flashlight.  None of which make an appearance in the new game.  Sure, it is set in the town of Ashfield, near Silent Hill, but still, that only compensated for the missing fog.  But what about the other two items?  I mean, what's a Silent Hill game without your radio freaking out and your crappy flashlight barely giving you any visibility?  I'll tell you what it is, it's a new survival horror game that is never really dark (light-wise).In fact, it is quite possibly the brightest of all the games.  I mean sure, the other games were bright when you were outside, but still.  They also had some pitch black areas too.  Almost throughout the entire game, everything is well lit.  Which won't hurt the games score, but it's just something that i've grown to love in these games.  And as for the radio, well, the only thing that comes close is the ghosts making your screen start to mess up and then there's a bit of static, but there's no explanation for it.  Well, I guess it makes his head hurt whenever they are near, so it does make sense in that way.  But still, even then, he's still lacking that small appliance from his person.Which is something else, you have a limited amount of items you can carry on you at one time.  You have a chest back in your room that you can drop things you don't need at the moment into, but if you accidentally pick up something you didn't really mean to pick up, you have no way of dropping it until you find a hole to get back to your room.  So sometimes you'll have to waste a full clip of pistol ammo or use a nutrition drink to clear up a slot so you can pick up the key item you need to take with you.  This is probably my only complaint, and it really isn't worth whining about.  I do like the on-screen health bar and swing meter, which thankfully fade away after you're out of combat, as does the item selection menu.  Because I would be really pissed of if I had to have some freaking crap cluttering up my screen and blocking the gorgeous graphics.If I can I'd like to add a little here on the new main enemies, ghosts.  These apparitions come through the walls and float around chasing you.  If they get too close, without even getting their hands on you, you will recieve damage.  The coolest one is that of a main (semi-main) character, who, when in ghost form, kind of resembles the little girl from The Ring, you know, the one that crawls out of the television.  What I really found cool about this character is when you knock her down, she doesn't always get right back up, sometimes she'll use here arms to pull her around all crazy like on the floor toward you.  Pretty creepy.I know that I don't talk much about the story or the characters in my reviews, maybe that's because I like to sprawl out the rest of the stuff in the game that nobody else talks about.  But if you want to know, you play as a man named Henry Townsend.  And at the beginning of the game, you have already been trapped in your apartment for five days.  The front door is covered in chains and locks and none of the windows open.  While in your apartment, you can listen to the radio, if anything is on other than static, look through the peephole to the hallway outside and watch people walk by or have an arguement, look through the hole in your wall in the living room to see into the room next door where a very special girl spends time watching t.v. or painting her nails.  But one day, you find a gaping hole in your bathroom wall and decide to ivestigate, upon doing so, you get a steel pipe (i'm glad they atleast left that in there, I sure do like beating things with my steel pipe), and the story begins to unfold.  And on the story, while good, it wasn't what I expected.  Sure it was twisted and insane, but it just didn't have that punch at the end.  No real shocking twist.  But oh well, if you liked or loved the other games, buy this one immediately.  But I would just like to warn you, this game is totally different from the others.  It's not so much Silent Hill 4, it's either The Room or Ashfield Heights.All in all, a great game, just not a real Silent Hill game.  Still spooky though.  If it does one thing better than anything else, it's the sense of claustrophobia you get from spending so much time in your room, which you won't want to stay in for too long later in the game...one word: haunted.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2004"}

I purchased this game as I loved the original Crysis and it did justice to my new system I put together. After installing it and playing it, the euphoria died when I read online that it was protected by the same unnecessary DRM that plagues BioShock and Mass Effect viz. SecuROM. SecuROM is a very bad product and in general I hate DRM. DRM means rights management, not rights take-away. I have the game and play it, but am worried what will happen if I use up all my licenses. I don't want to waste time calling them on phone for this. Now it might be a few months before I call them and game price will drop [...]by then - so its easier to just buy it again then instead of wasting time and money on phone call - but I hate all this.EA is very notorious for being an unethical bad company but buying out all the good companies and making mediocre updates. However, Crysis is a fantastic game. If you don't mind being tied to the stupid DRM, then its a fun game. I am all for protecting your protect, but DRM isn't the right approach. DMCA and DRM are a blight that we need to overthrow soon.Sadly the only way to do it to do mass boycotts thereby losing on the fun and several developers not then making games.EA should be ashamed for making a DRM infested game. Pirates are gonna pirate it anyways. I feel foolish for having SecuROM on my system now. So far, nothing has happened, but I don't like SecuROM.

Its also addicting.  Its also frustrating and sometimes boring as all heck.  On my second full playthrough now, and its getting better and harder.  My machine is pretty robust, and I have no performance problems (crashes once in a while, but most games do!)Visuals:  These are just beautiful, original and creative.  The landscape, characters and stuff in general is very well thought out, and just plain nice looking.  The rendering and speed of the game is quite good too.  You actually get immersed in the feel of the barren planet, the crazy inhabitants, and the strange landscape.Characters:  This is not exactly Academy award stuff, but the voice acting is really pretty good, and  some of the characters that are consistent throughout the game are quite good. The woman who voices Tannis is probably the highlight of the game, and the only one who is always there.  Some of the \"boss\" characters are ok, but you just kill them after you meet them, so its not like they really matter.  There are a bunch of dopey robots scattered about, and their \"spongebobesque\" voice is cute in the beginning, but becomes somewhat annoying later on.  There are also tons of NPC characters throughout the game that just stand there and mumble silly diatribes here and there and seem to have no real purpose.  You can \"talk\" to them, but they say nothing and do nothing.Weapons:  The studio and the \"professional\" reviewers made a big deal about the weapons, their amount, and the variety.  One of the developers even went so far as to say that the randomly generated weapons are so numerous, they really have no idea how many unique weapons can be had.  Big deal....  Many of the weapons are redundant, confusing and plain ineffective.  There are a \"bazillion\" as their marketing points out, but most are just plain dumb.  I personally, would rather have a proper RPG method of upgrading and updating, rather than relying on random weapon generation to progress forward.  But hey, that's just me.  All in all, while weapons are numerous, most are not particularly special.Story:  Ridiculous, derivative, shallow and not much to speak of.  They story is not exactly a linchpin of Borderlands.  It is there, but is has zero relevance to anything.  The main missions are mostly the usual RPG fare of gathering \"clues\", \"parts\", and \"stuff\" to get to the end.  You NEVER know how it all fits together and why though, which doesn't matter because it has no real substance anyway.  There are a bunch of side missions, that are pretty decent.Logistics: The single worst part of Borderlands is the lame and confusing navigation.  It is a HUGE space, and the maps have bizarre connections, with totally unclear methods of getting from one area to another.  There are ZERO labels on the connections from one map to another, so you never really know where you're supposed to go.  To get from one mission to another, can require going through dozens of portals, crossing entire maps, and killing enemies that you've killed a zillion times already.  This was my fundamental frustration with playing Borderlands.  The only thing you see on a map is a flashing star, and inevitably, it is on the total opposite side of a map from where you are.  Dumb.  Also, the method of dying, health regeneration and saves are all just shabby and not well thought through.  I can forgive some consolitis in the save system, but this one simply does not work.When you die (which is sometimes random, and from forces unseen), you go into a mode where you can save yourself by killing another enemy in this half dead state.  Unfortunately, you can't always find an enemy, nor aim at them.  Many times, you die, while the enemy near you dies, and and then you are just stuck there to perish and regenerate with a huge cost in time, progress and game money.  Its really really silly.  The game checkpoints at strange but inconsistent times and locations.  If you choose to exit the game (you know, to do other things in your life like eat and sleep), you may or may not restart where you left off.  More often than not, you have to start a huge section all over again.  I've never quite figured it out.Also, there are save points throughout the game, which are these long thin poles with red/green lights on top, some maps have many, others have few.  In console ports, this has become more and more popular, and its a decent compromise between pure checkpoint (console style) and infinite saves (PC gamer style)...  Dead Space has a similar approach with worked well....  Unfortunately, Borderlands tells you it saved, but if you restart, re spawn, or die and come back to life, its usually not at the last save.  A true head scratcher.Gameplay:  This is where Borderlands shines.  Its just plain fun and addicting.  There are a zillion silly enemies to kill (almost Painkiller in spirit), as well as interesting things to find.  The RPG inventory system is a hybrid shooter/true RPG, in that you have a limited amount of stuff, but very little actually improves your lot in life.  There is also, notoriously, no storage locations.  So you only have what you are carrying.  Which fills up fast with useless guns.Its more annoying because you need to sell stuff to get enough money to deal with the the things that arise in the game from time to time (each post death respawn costs 7% of total money), and there are limited inventory slots.  This wouldn't be bad at all, but when you get through an entire map, then go to a vending machine to sell your stuff, if you try and go back to where you might have left other stuff laying on the ground because you have limited slots, the stuff you just left there is gone, and the enemies that you just killed have respawned, and you have to start all over again.  Another frustrating thing.Gunplay is fun.  Most folks find a few weapons that they like and just keep them loaded.  There are fun corrosive, electrical, burning or explosive effects too that make it even more interesting (corrosive being my personal fave).  Basically, its just fun to run around and kill things.  The planets animals are goofy and explode really nicely when you shoot them.  And there are all sorts of comedic crazy planet dwellers that die wonderfully as well.Overall:  This is a solid 4, that could have been a solid 5 star game with a few technical improvements.  Saves, gun improvements, maps that make sense and have information, and bit more characters that matter would have done it for me.

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists. The only hope of the colonists seems to be a vault discovered in the side of a mountainside, rumored to contain alien technology and secrets about Pandora. Will this discovery be the colonist's salvation or their end? Discover their fate inBorderlands.GameplayAs in a traditional RPG,Borderlandsis built around the continual leveling of characters as they delve into quests.

That basically captures the mechanics of the weapons system and the shield system. You jump like you're on the Moon with almost no gravity and your shields will deplete as you take damage and leave you unprotected eventually. You have to give them time without being damaged to recharge. The death mechanic is definitely like Bioshock, because you just respond to the station with a minor penalty. To me this is really offputting because you could just run in, no actually are forced just rush in and fight bosses or anyone you die against over and over with them keeping the damage you gave them. It makes boss fights unfair. I'm the kind of person who auto saves every 30 seconds, I selected beat a boss without just wearing him down over and over and over.As the ads for the game stated, this is a hybrid of an RPG and a shooter. Depending on the role you pick you get a special power which you been able to in crease by choosing certain paths on a tech tree. It's not a very deep system, but it gives you some amount of strategy. The game is big tagline is that it is 100,000 or more guns, which is probably strictly true but you have to consider it like the weapons and Diablo or you probably found 100,000 different sorts and 90% of them stunk. Shooting mechanics are again very much like Bioshock, which is a bad thing if you like that game.The terrain is done pretty well. There a lot of open desert areas but at least the game lets you almost perpetually jog, lets you drive around in vehicles, and has an instant teleport system. These features help make what would ordinarily be a really annoying set of fetch quests where you have to go get the assignment, go do the assignment, and come back to get your reward, a lot less painful. I really don't understand the night and day system that they have. I think the cell shading looked really good in the day, the kind of messy night. One of the quest they talk about a 90 hour day on the planet, but nine days seems to change every half-hour or so. I would've liked a flashlight for the night missions but sometimes it was hard for me to see.If you liked both Bioshock and Halo, then you really should get some fun out of this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2011"}

It does so many things right, albeit with a few flaws. Then again, no game is perfect. Before I break things down in the review, just know that this game is one of the few games that is actually worth the $60+tax.PRO'S1) Huge, and I mean HUGE, open world to explore. Over 600 square miles of mayhem. Hundreds of locations and vehicles to discover. Finding every location on the map will probably take you over 75 hours easily, and that's without doing any missions. Another thing that's great about the environment is that every climate is represented. You have your desert, snow-capped mountains, jungles and everything in between. Sometimes I just hijack a plane and cruise around, hypnotized by the stunning graphics.2) As just mentioned, the graphics are really spectacular. Seriously, an open world game that is this large, you would expect there to be framerate drops and loading screens....nope. Every thing is beautiful and fluid.3) Variety of missions. This is the best part of the game. There seems to be a perfect balace between the variety of missions and the amount of time causing chaos to unlock new missions. Since you do missions for different factions, most vary pretty considerably. Anything from escorting an important official, to hijacking a plane or shooting a space rocket down before it reaches orbit...crazy stuff. IMO, there is nothing better than blowing up a communications tower and jumping off right at the last minute, pulling your parachute to make the great escape.CON'S1) Story. This is easily the weakest part of this game. The voice acting is not good, and I found myself skipping almost every cut scene. Forgettable story to say the least. Basically you're playing both sides against the middle.2) Sometimes the game is almost TOO big, if you know what I mean. Yes, you can call the black market dealer, and he can extract you to any location on the map. But, he only can do this for the locations YOU'VE ACTUALLY DISCOVERED. So....let's say there is a mission that you want to get to, but there are no found settlements nearby. You would then have to get extracted as close to the mission as you can and then travel by either plane (if you have money) or foot to reach it. This, sometimes, is several miles and can take up to 20 minutes just getting to a mission.3) Inventory System. For some reason I found this aspect very annoying. You can pick up ammo off any soilder you kill, but it's confusing to me what gun I'm actually picking up. This becomes even more annoying when you're in the middle of a mission where people are shooting at you, but you can't figure out what weapon you're dropping and what weapon you're picking up. Small annoyance, but still worth mentioning because it has caused several deaths.4) Causing chaos to unlock missions. This is more of an annoyance at the beginning of the game. Because you're limited to what explosives and guns you can buy at the outset, it becomes difficult to destroy whole military bases or settlements in order to raise chaos levels and, ultimately, unlock new missions. Once you're about 10 hours into the game though, this becomes much easier as you have access to more weapons, explosives, and armed hellicopters.BOTTOM LINEThe bottom line is...this game is a MUST BUY. It is seriously addicting, fast-paced, and will provide you with over a hundred hours of gameplay if you're looking for 100% completion. In my opinion, this game rivals GTAIV as the best sandbox game on next-gen systems. Don't let this one slip through the cracks.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2010"}

I played Mario Galaxy and that was a  great game despite the fact that Yoshi wasn't in it, I thought they made a mistake at first but after playing MG I felt who need him.  Until I played Mario Galaxy 2 Yoshi is back and better than ever  with  new colors and  new abilities, depending on what he eats. Yoshi get bloated and  blows air so you can fly for a short period of time when eating a blimp berry, he turns orange and runs faster after eating a dash pepper, he turns a hot yellow and  brighten hidden paths after eating a glimmer bulb berry it's just so awesome how they made him.  Now for the star of this game Mario himself  he returns with most of his previous MG abilities with of course some new ones as well such as Rock Mario, yes rock his hat and overall turns to stone giving him the power to turn into a boulder and roll and jump around to destroy enemies.  Another new power is Cloud Mario, he clothes become puffy looking resembling fire Mario but now he can create clouds to ride on as well he can now walk other clouds he would fall through this power up is very limited as you will see.  So as you just read Mario has once again came back and is better than ever, with a new challenging yet fun to play game.  This is a must-have for any Wii owner.

It probably would have been flippin sweet back when the movie came out.  This game has some pretty lackluster graphics even for PS2 standards.  While learning the controls i never really felt like i was in control.  It didn't seem to matter if i was carefully timing the moves or just button mashing as it kinda just fights the battles for you.  The absolute worst part of the control scheme is the gunplay, holy shizzle its bad.  I mean if i had an extra hand, maybe it would work.  You have to hold down one button to aim, another button to fire while your holding the aim button and then press another button to activate the slow-mo matrix effect.  That's 3 buttons all at the same time folks, and they are all in different places,  and try jumping while pressing all these buttons, thats 4 now.  Did they try playing this garbage before they shipped it out?  They also thought it would be a good idea to throw in tons of movie clips which we have all seen countless times, yeah we get it, its the matrix now let me play the game.

{"product_name":"B00008QOL6","description":"When it comes to first-person shooters, there are two schools of thought. One harkens back to the originalDoom--frantic action, scary monsters, big weapons, and story is given short shrift. The second school is best exemplified byHalf-Life: strong narrative, consistent real-world weapons, consistent monsters, and settings.Doom'sheirs up until now have beenQuakeandSerious Sam, but nowPainkillercomes onto the scene leaving bloody footprints, and &#x85; let the carnage begin!You play a man who dies in a pathetic car crash (he's distracted because he's holding his girl's hand) and has spent a long time in purgatory. He thinks this is unfair because, despite being well-schooled in the art of killing, he maintains that he's done nothing wrong. Heaven makes a deal with him. Take care of a little invasion problem concerning Hell, and our hero can enter those pearly gates.Weak storyline aside,Painkillerbasically amounts to a brilliant series of arcade-style levels and challenges. The settings include darkened monasteries, graveyards, a horrifying asylum, a medieval town under siege, and even H-E-Double Hockey Sticks itself. The level design is brilliant, varied, and jam-packed with enemies. There seems to be no end to the amount and variety of cool monsters to fight, and they each explode into chunks of blood and gore in a most disturbingly satisfying manner. At the end of each level is a challenge, such as collecting a certain amount of gold or killing a Boss within a time limit. Winning the challenge gives you tarot cards you can use to make the game easier. The different cards bring haste, double-damage, invulnerability, and so on. This simple mechanic makes the game far more replayable than your average shooter.The graphics are first rate, which means you need a powerful PC to run the game with all the detail settings maxed out. The only other problem is a CD-copy protection bug that makes the game unplayable for some (a patch is available).Painkillermay seem a bit silly at first glance. But the gameplay mechanics, replayability (full multiplayer is also available), variety, and brilliant level design make it one of the finest and most satisfying shooters ever made. -Andrew S.

{"product_name":"B002I0JAVK","description":"","reviewerName":"Ferdy","summary":"I Can't Stop Playing","reviewText":"This game should be labeled as potentially addictive.  It is so much fun and offers so many different options for play that you keep on finding new things to do and new places to explore even after playing for hours and hours.  I started by playing through the story campaign in which Batman is trying to find the cure for some kind of toxin that the Joker has infected him with.  The Joker has been poisoned by this toxin as well and his plan is to expose Batman to it and thereby force him into finding or making a cure which will work on them both.  The quest takes Batman all over Arkham City (the former Gotham city has been turned over to the Arkham Asylum inmates and sealed off from the outside world so it's now Arkham City).  He meets many of his old foes like Penguin, Two Face, Harley Quinn, Mr. Freeze, teh Riddler, the League of Assassins and more. There are primary missions to complete along with side missions.  They are definitely challenging.  You have armed and unarmed thugs to contend with as well as titans and the \"boss\" in each section.  You have codes to crack and riddles to solve and you have to figure out how to access the buildings and other places that your mission takes you.  As you accumulate points, you earn more high tech gear and gadgets.  Another great feature of this game is the downloadable Catwoman feature.  She is a completely separate playable character with her own story and mission to complete.  I have completely played through the story campaign and now I'm going back to complete all the unfinished side missions like tracking Deadshot and solving all the Riddlers puzzles in order to save hostages.  The graphics in this game are completely amazing.  It's like being able to play a character in an animated movie.  There is nothing negative that I can think of to include about this game.  It comes as close to perfect as it is possible to get in a video game.  It's worth every cent.  If you've considered buying it but are on the fence, don't hesitate any longer.  Arkham City has to be the best game of the year if not the best of the decade.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2011"}

Equal parts amorphous blob of paint, struggling artist, revolutionary and juvenile delinquent, de Blob's goal is to replace the drab, lifeless gray coloring that the I.N.K.T.

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"An excellent game which merges RPG and shooter elements","reviewText":"Every fifty thousand years a race of sentient alien starships, the Reapers, scour the Milky Way of organic life for unknown reasons. The time of their return is at hand and the races of the Galaxy are not ready. It took the combined firepower of several entire fleets to destroy the first Reaper scout, Sovereign. In the process the Citadel - seat of the Galactic Council - was so badly damaged that repairs will take five years to complete.The Council believes the threat is over, and discounts reports that an entire fleet of hundreds of Reaper ships is lurking beyond the Galactic Rim. Their scepticism grows when Commander Shepard, the only human to know the true extent of the threat, is apparently KIA. But, two years later, Shepard resurfaces, now working for the Cerberus organisation outside the authority of Earth or the Council. Shepard now has the resources to carry the fight to the Reapers and starts by attacking one of their servant species, the Collectors, who have been raiding human colonies in the lawless Terminus Systems. But Shepard's allegiance with a borderline terrorist organisation threatens to alienate his former allies and undermines his attempts to expose the scale of the Reaper threat.Mass Effect 2, released in 2010, is the middle volume of a computer roleplaying trilogy. Unlike a lot of such series, which are normally developed ad hoc based on the sales of the previous game, the Mass Effect series was always envisaged as a trilogy with events building from one game to the next and culminating in an epic finale (to be seen in Mass Effect 3, released next month) which pits the entire Galaxy against the invading Reapers on a massive scale. Mass Effect 2 is therefore something of a bridging game, with a surprisingly small scope compared to the events of the first or third games (these things are relative, however, as ME2 still features ferocious firefights in alien starships dozens of miles long).The game's structure sees Shepard working for Cerberus and its shadowy founder, the Illusive Man (voiced with gravitas by Martin Sheen), an alliance of former foes (Cerberus is a side-enemy in the original Mass Effect) against the dual threat of the Collectors and the Reapers. The bulk of the game is set on the new starship Normandy SR-2, with Shepard choosing what assignment to undertake next. Early assignments revolve around building up a team of allies to help in the battle. The cast of the original Mass Effect has been scattered across the Galaxy and most are unavailable to help out in the new fight (though two of them do sign up and the rest show up in cameos), so Shepard is mostly reduced to forming a new team of dubious reliability and melding them into a cohesive unit. This is done by undertaking 'loyalty missions' for each character. Whilst optional, winning each character's loyalty pays dividends for the final mission - where unreliable or disloyal characters might die, or cause others' deaths - and hugely extends the playing time of the game (doing all of these missions results in Mass Effect 2 clocking in at about 25 hours, or twice the length of the original).This structure relies on the characters being compelling. Fortunately, Mass Effect 2 is the work of BioWare, who have created some of the most memorable characters in RPG history (and one of their most famous, Minsc from Baldur's Gate, gets a couple of hilarious shout-outs in ME2). There is a sense of early disgruntlement that most of the characters you got to know over the dozen or so hours of the original Mass Effect have been jettisoned, but this is soon overtaken by an interest in the new cast. BioWare have gone to some lengths to give each character their own motivation, personality and goals, backed up by strong voice acting and some excellent writing. There's some geek-friendly casting, with the likes of Yvonne Strahovski (Chuck), Michael Hogan (Battlestar Galactica), Robin Sachs (Babylon 5/Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Keith Szarabjka (Angel) and Tricia Helfer (Battlestar Galactica) providing voices, but all do great work. Keythe Farley deserves a special mention for his exceptional voicing of Thane Krios, the spiritual assassin dying of a terminal wasting disease.Gameplay-wise, Mass Effect 2 is an evolution - critics might call it a devolution - of the mechanics in the original game. Just as the original game downplayed some traditional RPG elements (such as inventory management) in favour of shooting, Mass Effect 2 takes this even further. Character advancement through levelling is streamlined considerably, with the removal of the original game's extensive skill tree in favour of a smaller, more combat-focused levelling mechanic, whilst the inventory has simply been removed completely. Inventory-less RPGs have been made before (such as the splendid Freedom Force superhero games) but it's still disconcerting to see in action. However, more careful examination of the game reveals that many of the same tangible effects of the inventory management of the first game (upgrades to weapons, grenades, armour and abilities) still exist, but have been transferred to the new research/upgrade system.This system employs a research lab which has been installed on the Normandy. Once Shepard has recruited a scientist, he can start researching upgrades to existing weaponry, armour and abilities, or unlock new weapons altogether. He can also upgrade the Normandy's capabilities. Again, this seems optional but it plays a major role in the game's finale (extending to some characters dying if the ship hasn't reached its maximum potential). Researching doesn't come for free and resources must be gathered from planets to fund it. This leads to a side mini-game where the Normandy orbits planets and scans them for resources, launching mining probes to recover them. This system can be slightly annoying (spending significant amounts of time mining when there's Collectors to be killed can be frustrating) but it's a much more intelligent use of resources than the original game (where they existed solely as an optional mission objective to make you look good).To the meat of the game, which is the in-mission view. There are two types of mission, 'hub' missions set on planets or space stations mostly inhabited by friendlies where Shepard has to resolve issues, typically through roleplaying. The game's intelligent dialogue system (slightly refined from the original game, with the addition of Paragon/Renegade actions you can undertake in addition to the simple speaking of dialogue) comes into its own here, with Shepard using diplomacy, threats or a mixture of the two to get a favourable outcome. However, far more commonplace are combat missions where Shepard and two allies have to fight their way through various enemies to achieve a mission objective.Combat is similar to the first game, in that it emphasis cover and directly shooting enemies rather than any kind of turn-based or pause-based combat, though you can still pause the game and bring up a tactical command menu, giving orders to your troops or employing special abilities yourself. It's been refined, with a more intelligent cover system (less sticking to a wall you just happen to brush up against) and the addition of area-based damage, such as headshots. Those looking for a more RPG style of combat may be disappointed by the directness of the battles, but at the same time those used to pure shooters like the Gears of War series may find the addition of dialogue options and a great degree of player freedom and choice to be liberating. BioWare are conflating the two genres here and doing so well, but RPG fans may feel that the game is a little imbalanced towards the shooter genre. Those who like both genres (like myself) will feel more at home with the game.Overall, Mass Effect 2 is a very strong game which emphasises player choice in the fields of characterisation and story development. What you, as Shepard, say or do in the game has enormous consequences, potentially leading to most of your crew being wiped out. Decisions also have important ramifications in Mass Effect 3, which may give players pause (for example, deciding the fate of a cure to the krogan plague or whether to pit the geth and Quarians into full-scale war has little impact in Mass Effect 2 itself, but will be major plot points in the final game). Complaints that the game is a dumbed-down RPG due to a streamlining of the gameplay systems are understandable, but the game also makes great strides forward in characterisation and the impact of player choice on personal interrelationships. This is a fascinating development in the way games handle characters and how relationships between them work, and shows how games can handle these factors in a way that films and novels cannot, an important evolution in the medium.Of course, those less interested in the title's place in gaming history can ignore all of that and get on with saving the Galaxy by laying waste to everything in sight with overwhelming firepower.Mass Effect 2 (****) is a very good game, with some excellent writing, memorable characters and strong combat sequences. The reducing of RPG elements in favour of shooter ones may offend RPG purists, but overall BioWare handle the merging of the two genres successfully. The game is available now in the UK (PC, X-Box 360, PlayStation 3) and USA (PC, X-Box 360, PlayStation 3). Mass Effect 3 is released on 6 March 2012 in the USA and three days later in the rest of the world.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2012"}

Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme inChinatown Warsutilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons.Key Game Features:The Largest DS Game Ever- Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.Endless Gameplay- Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.Street Economics- Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.Play with Friends- Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.Bragging Rights- Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.PDA Interface- Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.Online Bragging Rights and MultiplayerCare has been taken to ensure that players can share theirChinatown Warsexperiences with friends and fellow players in different ways.

The controls stick straight to the directional pad and the right-side buttons, but the touch screen comes into play by minigames.If your busting a car window, defusing a bomb, or pimp-slapping a hooker, swiping and tapping the screen will get the job done perfectly.Violence hasnt been a strong staple for GTA in the past. CW falls into the classic bland GTA combat system. Gunplay is simple: lock on and shoot. That's it, the whole mechanic of fighting feels static and janky, it's just standing and shooting. There's no real depth to the combat, so any confrentation felt unwanted, tacky, and not enjoyable at all. The fun illegal actvity is being a drug lord. CW's story revolves around you doing the dirty work for the kingpins, while gaining honor back to your family name. You control Haung, the only sensible character in a crazy world full of the zanny GTA style cast. Inbetween missions of your cartel, you can be, guess what? A Dope boy. Haung hustles drugs off on the sidelines in the passing period between missions. Depending on the drug economy, prices will alter on what's the best deal.CW reverts back to the traditional top down views from GTA and GTA 2. Using a more artsy form, Rockstar gives a stylized version of the Liberty City you grew to know in GTA 4, you may recognize some localations, rehashed in a fresh new light.CW is a full fledged GTA experience, and Rockstar used the DS' funtionality to deliever a must play game that surely will hold it's own aginast the DS hardcore titles.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2009"}
{"product_name":"B003S2MXQG","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"In The Future...There is Only Waaagh(war)...","reviewText":"This happens to be the first game I've owned of the Warhammer 40k franchise, so when it comes to the lore, I am pretty much in the dark.  I know War40k is an RTS game and Table-Top game, but it seems that Warhammer40k has come a long way, now spreading out into the action/shooter genre.  Does this Space Marine have what it takes to survive the battle?  Well let's find out!GAMEPLAYWarhammer40k: Space Marines (War40k from this point on), is a game that hits you with action the moment you start it up.  There is very little in the way of downtime besides occasional dialog segments, or transitions into new areas.  Right off the bat you will be fighting through masses of Orks to reach your object, picking up a variety of weapons along the way(gun and melee) as well as upgrades for these weapons.The gameplay is very simplistic in War40k, almost too simple at times.  You have the ability for ranged attacks using guns, and up close melee attacks with a variety of weapons that you can find throughout the campaign.  When enemies get to close you can switch on the fly to your melee weapon of choice and start hacking away.  Mix in your \"stun\" attack occasionally to initiate a variety of stun moves(single target, or AoE).  When an enemy is stunned you can initiate a fatality move which produces plenty of blood, a nice death kill animation, as well as granting you health.  An interesting, and refreshing way to regenerate your health I think.Not all is good with this setup though.  While the gameplay is fun, there is little variety to it.  Within 3-4 hours you will begin to notice that despite a change of melee weapon or switching between guns; you really don't have as much freedom as one might think.  Combat is repetitive, though satisfying.  Another problem is the lack of a cover system.  Taking heavy fire?  Only thing you can do is walk behind cover and stand there until it is clear to strafe out.  If anything the lack of a cover system  hurts the shooting element of the game since intense firefights turn into scrambles to walk behind a box that is as tall as you. Overall the gameplay is enjoyable yet repetitive, but not repetitive enough to turn you off to the game.GRAPHICSGraphically this game looks alright.  There isn't much in the way of impressive visuals, other than those nice gory fatality moves, but it doesn't really impact the game at all.  No frame rate problems or oddities, though it was funny seeing mobs occasionally explode and instantly vanish upon death, rather than a corpse dropping to the ground for a second or two.  I'm sure this was done because of the vast # of orks that show up on the screen sometimes.  Overall the game is not all that graphically impressive but it does enough to make the trip enjoyable.SOUND/STORYVoice acting I found to be pretty good.  There was clearly some good effort put into the voices of the characters and logs you find, plus the Orks sound really awesome I think.  They remind me a little of the Lord of the Rings Uruk Hai sometimes.  Weapon effects sound satisfying and have a good punch to them.  As for the storyline, it is honestly hard for me to truly comment on.  Being my first Warhammer40k title, it feels like being tossed into season 5 of a 10 season Drama on TV.  After a while you pick up the gist of things yet still feel a bit confused.  The story flushes out well, and deals with your character, Captain Titus, leading an assault to prevent an Ork invasion from stealing a Battle Titan.REPLAY/LENGTHWar40k will be at least a good 8-10 hour adventure.  The game is broken up into 17 chapters spread out amongst 5 parts.  Throw in hidden logs, multiplayer and Co-Op(see below) fans of the genre and gameplay style will have plenty to keep themselves occupied with.** CO-OP will be added about a month after launch and will be free to those who purchase the game (activate their MP pass). From the looks of it, the Co-Op being given out is going to be similar to a horde mode for up to 5 players.OVERALL 82% (8.2 / B-)War40k is a good game.  It isn't a great game, nor does it try to be a great game.  It does exactly what it was intending to do, and that is bring the Warhammer40k universe into a new genre of game.  For a first crack at a shooter/hack and slash action game; Relic did a pretty good job I think.  While all the elements included in War40k are not 5 star material, they come together nicely making for an enjoyable game that even a noob to the Warhammer franchise (like myself) will have no major problems figuring out what is going on.Despite some repetitive gameplay; a simple yet fun Multi-player element and the addition of some form of Co-Op, free of charge, help boost War40k into being a game that is worth the purchase if you are a fan of the genre or gameplay style.  Repetitive gameplay aside, it can be a lot of fun tearing up waves of orks!  4 stars!**NOTE: Co-Op will be included in an update slated for October 25th.  It will contain 2 maps..  4 player Co-Op... where you will battle against Ork's or Chaos.**NOTE: 9/22 Patch released to resolve MP problems for PS3 users.  Matchmaking and lag problems have been resolved (finally!)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2011"}

Despite this gap and apparent poor planning on the part of Microsoft's release department, does Halo 2 for Vista stand up even with the test of time?The first difference comes with the transition from the uniform, high-end console to the more variable PC, with regards to graphics and computing power. While even at \"high\" settings I did not notice a marked improvement from the Xbox's graphics (though opinions tend to differ on this point), Halo 2 still commands a hefty \"5.0 Recommended\" rating on Vista's new gaming rating system. To put that in perspective, my current system is a \"5.3\", and newer games like Company of Heroes, World in Conflict, and Command and Conquer 3 top off at \"4.1 Recommended\". Apart from its variability with regards to graphic quality, Halo 2's only other new technical feature is the option for a widescreen Heads Up Display (instead of the stretched-out one used in the Xbox version).Halo 2's connectivity to Xbox Live is the other major new system added in the PC transition, and this is simultaneously well-done and irritating. It is well-done because, like a console, the live system integrates itself almost seamlessly into the game and adds features such as online play, unlockable achievements (the first \"Games for Windows\" title to feature them), and friend lists. However, there is also a step back from Halo 1 for the PC; while Halo 1 had free, no-strings-attached online multiplayer, Halo 2 requires at least a silver account to play even the single player game. Thus, as with Valve's \"Steam\" software for Half Life 2, one must be online in order to play the game. However, unlike Steam, one need only log on to make an account and then transfer the account to one's computer; after the first time, there is no requirement for online connectivity for single player. The free account also allows access to Halo 2's online play, though many of the features (including matchmaking services and private rooms) are reserved for people with paid \"Gold Accounts\". Finally, Halo 2 for Vista features 2 new official maps for multiplayer, as well as a map editor. However, said editor is mostly intended for hardcore designers, not casual fans. Despite this, it is a fairly welcome addition and allows for a community effort in creating new and exciting arenas.Overall, this game is done reasonably well by itself. However, when counting in its status as a ported version of a 3-year-old game, and adding the further frustrations of \"Live\" play and its unusually high requirements, I would not recommend this game to anyone who has already played it. This game is a last resort, meant exclusively for people who only have a PC, and who have not played Halo 2 prior. I rate it a 3/5.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2008"}

It took away the tactical insert and overall changed it up a bit and I will admit black ops II  has a better multiplayer.Ghosts is still solid here but if you have black ops and you want it for the multiplayer alone just stick with what you have.Next ExtinctionThis was different but same yet weird all in one bundle.It clearly is a shot at taking from the arcade like success of zombies but missed some of key essentials to be comparable these alien like things came out of the earth it seems and well it is different.I don't know what to say here it is fun and different but it isn't write home about it worthy but still worth the time.Next plotHere is where it made some improvement.The plot is based around south america raising united (conquered) by Venezuela and rising up as the federation and destroys near half of America and WWIII pretty much happens.Its different its not the usual russia Germany or China based villain we are used to its something new I like that.Finally graphicsHere its meh.

They are definitely confusing at first, but once you get the hang of them, they're manageable. It's a bonus for me.

Honestly, I think this is just an elongated PS3 controller.The other issue is that when you  haven't used the remote for a bit and it goes to sleep, and then you issue a button press like Pause or Stop, you have to do it twice, because the first time the button press won't do anything except wake the remote up, then the second button press will actually work.The obnoxious part about the remote is that it has *no* indicators of any kind on it. So you can't tell if it's on, off, asleep, synced or out of batteries. You just use it and if you push a button 3 or more times and it doesn't do anything, it's safe to assume it's dead.A simple LED on the top would have done the trick, but then they wouldn't be able to keep the $29 margin of profit they make on this piece of hardware.Overall it's a poor remote, some \"throw in\" you would expect with a normal TV and overly unacceptable as a remote for a nice TV (not even backlit).But it's the only way to control movies on the PS3 without using the controller, so if you need it, I guess you are going to buy it.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2007"}

{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"I like it!!","reviewText":"I finally broke down and got an XBOX 360 a few days ago; nearly a year after it first came on the market.  My first two games I picked up where COD3 and this game.Because I was familar with COD from the PC, it was the first game I tried. I really liked COD3, but I then decided to try GOW and honestly, I didn't really like it the first time I played it.  The 3rd person view made the game cumbersome and certainly not what I was used to in a shooter.  I spent the remaining of the day and half of the next day playing COD3.  I finally decided to give GOW another chance and the 2nd time around, I started to get into it, I got used to the controls and the3rd person view fairly quickly after I figured out that you had to pull left trigger to actually aim your gun to get more accurate shots off.  After that I was hooked and I haven't had COD3 in my 360 ever since.GOW is a highly addictive game, the graphics are superb and the sound effects are amazing.  Guns actually sound like guns, and not pea shooters which is one problem I had was Halo 2.  The attention to detail is almost scary.  Pick up a sniper rifle and shoot an enemy in the head and you will see their head litteraly being blown off; other times their skulls gets pushed in from the impact of the bullet.  The good guys also are done very well, while they seem to be maybe a little unproportionally big, it makes the game that much cooler.  Seeing them walk down the road in their body armor makes you want to just kick some a-- and it really gets you into the game.Like others, I don't know much about the story line, but to me it seems that the humans are at war with an alien race of some sort.  I try to follow along during the cut scenes but I am still kind of lost of what i really going on.  The atmosphere in this game is generally dark and suspensful.  And while this game is not scary, it is very creepy, if you have seen the movie Pitch Black there is one level that will remind you of that movie.The gameplay once getting the hang of it is pretty seemless.  It may take a couple of tries for people who are used to FPS shooters, but once one understands the controls, they will find that they are actually quite simple, yet very effective, every button is where it's supposed to be and after a while it just becomes second nature.  One thing I like about the game is its attention to running and shooting from cover.  It makes the game realistic and fun.  I like being able to hide behind a burned up car or a road barrier while occasionally looking up to get some shots off at the enemy.  Not only is it cool, its nescesary or you will find yourself dying quite frequently.The sound in the game is another great thing about the game.  From the background music to the sound effects of bullets blazing and enemies dying it is truly a joy to listen to through my home theatre.  The voice acting in this game is also done very well.  It is believable and comical at the same time, its almost if you are watching a good action movie at times.  I honestly haven't seen voice acting this good in a long time.Now for the short list of cons.  First I would have liked to be able to use the voice communicator to actually speak orders to my squad like you can in Rainbow Six 3 on the regular XBOX.  Its not really a big deal, but the person in Best Buy told me you could, but it seems that you can't.  Another issue is that it seems that your squad is at most you and three others; when you have more than 3 others in your group, one always seems to get killed off in a cut screen right before you are given control of your character again.  I would have liked to see more people in the squad, to make the game even more fun.  I guess it was done like this because the 360 only has 4 controller ports.  My final complaint is that because of the dark enviroment, it is sometimes hard to figure out where you need to go next, a lot of time can be spent going in circles until you happen to see an opening you didn't see the first 4 or 5 times you walked by it.I don't play games online mainly due to the stupid kids that are up there, so this review like all of my reviews are based on single player mode only.  Overall its a fun and highly addictive game with few flaws.  I am glad I picked it up; I am actually feeling kind of bad for COD3 because I haven't played it since I started getting into GOW.UPDATE:  Well after playing this game for less than a week, I have beaten it already.  Add that to the short list of cons for this game..entirely too short.  I was very into the game after an exciting level, then just like the gears accomplished what they needed to do and the game is over.  Kind of dissapointing, because it was such a fun game, and came out wanting more.  I dare say I want a sequel, but my fear is that a sequel will suffer the fate of many sequels to awesome title; they are never as good as the original, but there is always a chance.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2006"}

The control Pad ... well it just like a tablet had a touch LCD screen it need and extra care when you are playing, for example how much time you or a some while are playing are drop off the control ? for and accident, or because got angry to lose the game... well try to do it with the new Pad on the Wii U ... the control pad could resist the impact, but the LCS screen ??? and it is not just the control pad, it is about the safety of a Kid, if the LCS screen get broke ? it is not just glass it is had plastic but this little broke pieces can hurt to someone ... it is not a good idea give it to a 12 or 8 years old kid right?. Ok you can play Wii games on the wii U, using the Wii motes or Wii motes plus so is a kid drop off the control is not a big issue I had 30 years old and I accidentally drop it some times because the game are very interactive and need to be move just like some games on the Wii U.And Thi is the real reason Why i don't recommended this console for kids.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2013"}

As a teenage girl named Heather, players must explore and unravel the mysterious connection between the god-forsaken town and her inner fears. The game features enhanced graphical detail, a more complex storyline, and even more grotesque monsters than the previous games.","reviewerName":"Benjamin S. Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"One of the best in the series though to some it might seem a bit short","reviewText":"I found this gem in a pawn-shop. By that point SH 3 had become difficult to find. It seems like all these games have that defining fault. (Luckily I'm getting an X-box 360 about the time SH V hits shelves). Regardless I'm sure you've heard many things both  good and bad about this one when in comparison to SH 2.Well the truth is I'm not a SH 2 fanatic. I actually liked James alot, and yes his story was interesting but what some people termed \"gradual build up of suspense\" I thought was boring as I explored a town that was in many ways a bit too open ended. Yes, SH 2 is longer than SH 3 (I own it too) but does longer always equate to better? I suppose that depends on who you are.The truth is I'm a lover of the first game. Alot of fans say it was too\"cult influenced\" but when you think about it the monsters were STILL generated by someone's nightmarish delusions and it was still far more psychological than it was cheap shock thrills. (Not that there is anything wrong with the later either mind you. Yes, I do like RE as well.)SH 3 is a little piece of black sunshine in many ways. First of all it is the first time a girl protagonist is introduced. I've heard many debates about Heather. You either love her or hate her. But before you past that judgement you should get to know her. Yes Heather is a wise cracking loner. She does not hang out with gaggles of giggling girls her age. She doesn't like being followed and yes, she has major \"trust issues\". If she was like this for no reason I could understand the angst of gamers. But as it stands she has a VERY GOOD REASON for being as paranoid and aloft as she is. The only man she can trust is her dad and when you find out who she was in the past you can forgive her for being abrasive. SH 3 does much to prove \"human beings\" are the worst monsters and not even Pyramid head can compete with the scum baggery of certain individuals out there.The game is definetly a roller coaster ride. Your dream sequence in the amusement park is scary enough to make you question playing further. Right from the beginning you are dropped into the jaws of hell and they bite down hard.SH 3 does mess with you. For example there are parts in the game you \"almost\" feel safe. No monsters around and you can hear comforting muffled human voices on the other side of the walls. You actually start your true journey having over slept in a mall that has closed down around you. Their is a very subtle anxiety about trying to make your way out of a building past closing time. Its' not you fear monsters or irrate security guards. It just feels creepy being in a place that normally bustles with activity after everyone has gone home.In the first area Douglas a concerned detective and a strange woman named Claudia make their appearances. Douglas is hired by Claudia to take you back to your \"home town\" under the suspicion you have  been kidnapped. Actually it gets sloppier. Your father killed someone in self defense and you have both been on the run awhile making your situation questionable. Apparently your \"happy home-life\" has not always been so happy.Of course being Heather you don't trust Douglas the middle aged gruff cop movie reject nor do you trust Claudia even though she claims you used to be friends that grew up together. Like a typical teen with angst issues you set out on your own.From here on out there are things worth noting. The first is the graphics in this game are darkly beautiful and filled with ambient atmosphere. Truth be told this is the best looking SH out there. Secondly the creatures are bigger and meaner. Some fans liked this...others did not. Regardless the strait jacketed spinning pendulums with their whirling blades and the fat grotesque insane cancers add a sense of claustophobia and impending doom when you are sandwiched in close quarters.The enviorments are also worth complimenting. The subway, church, and lake side amusement park haunted house come to mind immediatly and throughout the game alot it divulged about your past as well as that of \"The Order\" everyone's favorite group of resident crazies.Claudia and Douglas are interesting enough but when you meet Vincent your really in for a mind freak. Vincent is almost too genial and polite making you think a cackling insanity is being held down just beneath the surface. He even makes you question if the \"monsters\" you have been slaying are actually real people and it is obscure to figure out which side he is on.As the game progresses these people fall into the roles of \"watchers\" \"antagonists\" and \"supporting friends\" but I will not give away anymore than that. Regardless the point is the side characters are well defined and intriguing which has always been a trade-mark of the SH mythos.By the end of the game I was endeared to Heather alot. She was not perfect but frankly I get tired of perfect anyway. She was not \"super model beautiful\" but yet she was cute enough to be that girl next door you might have had a crush on. Heather is \"one of us\" the normal people and in that lies her charm. She is acessible and you could imagine hanging out with her doing stuff you'd do with your friends. Though she gets scared she is brave and dedicated. While her laugh sounds more like a whimper when confronting various monsters at least she trudges onward and once you DO earn her trust she's there for you through thick and thin. Females really don't have many good role-models in gaming so in that regard Heather is a breath of fresh air. She dresses plain and her cleavage is not about to bust out of her shirt.I should mention the game-play is a bit smoother compared to SH 2 but not much. The combat system in SH has never been deep but if you could multi-hit combo creatures through walls it would defeat the aspect of being a normal smuck amongst terrifying circumstances. As before you get an assortment of melee weapons and a few guns. As before you can stomp creatures on the ground though some of them will try to latch onto you. Beat the game and you'll get a few nifty items that pack alot of punch or are blatantly ridiculous fan service.The only negative gripe I have with SH 3 is not so much it is a bit linear (I don't mind that) but that it only has 2 endings. Ok 3 if you count the usual UFO parody ending but compared to SH 2 its' like they made a sub-way sandwich with less meat. It still tastes great but it is definetly not as filling. For some this will hurt the re-play value.Regadless if you can pick up this game. I don't exactly know how easy it is to find but it is likely one of the better installments in the series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2008"}

{"product_name":"B008XMSR6G","description":"Neo-Paris. 2084.Personal memories can now be digitized, bought, sold and traded. The last remnants of privacy and intimacy have been swept away in what appears to be a logical progression of the explosive growth of social networks at the beginning of the 21st century. The citizens themselves have accepted this surveillance society in exchange for the comfort only smart technology can provide. This memory economy gives immense power over society to just a handful of people.Remember Me is a 3rd person action adventure where players take on the role of Nilin, a former elite memory hunter with the ability to break into people's minds and steal or even alter their memories. The authorities, fearful of her knowledge and capabilities have arrested Nilin and wiped her memory clean. After her escape from prison, Nilin sets out on a mission to recover her identity, helped by her last and only friend. This search for her past leads to her being hunted by the very people that created this surveillance society.","reviewerName":"The Matrix Fan \"Video Gamer since 1979.\"","summary":"I want to remember it, but it's not too memorable.","reviewText":"+ PROS:+ Interesting memory mixing concept+ Several in-game collectibles+ Create-your-own combo system- CONS:- In-game movies cannot be skipped- Repetitive fight mechanics, simplistic boss battles- The game feels unbalanced:  96% fighting to 4% memory mixingPLOT:The year is 2084. The place is Neo-Paris. The person is Nilin, an elite memory hunter who's had most of her memory erased by the Memorize corporation. She is about to head into final processing when Edge, the leader of the Errorists, helps her escape.Nilin will have to fight her way through Neo-Paris to regain the memories she's lost...but will she like what she finds out about herself?GAMEPLAY:The main portion of this game is fight mechanics. In the beginning, you start out with a 3-hit combo. Over the course of the game you can unlock 5, 6 and 8-hit combinations. This leads to 2 kinds of attacks:First, there are 4 types of power-ups called \"Pressens\" -(1) Power Pressen - these give out extra damage.(2) Regen Pressen - these regenerate health.(3) Cooldown Pressen - these reduce the S-Pressen recharge times.(4) Chain Pressen - these inherit and multiply the effect of the previous Pressen.Second, there are 5 types of S-Pressen attacks -(1) Sensen Fury - free flow attack for hitting enemies without pause.(2) Sensen DOS - stuns enemies(3) Sensen RIP - turns robots against your enemies(4) Sensen Login Bomb - affects all enemies in the blast radius.(5) Sensen Camo - Nilin can turn invisible for 30 seconds and overload one enemy undetected.Nilin also picks up extra abilities along the way as the game progresses.There are also elements of platform gaming, little arrows will appear to show where Nilin can jump or shimmy to hand-over-hand. These aren't too difficult to figure out.My favorite part of the game by far, is the memory mixing. When you dive into someone's mind, the setting of each memory is raw and unfinished; which reminded me of the Star Trek episode \"Spectre of the Gun\". We watch a memory unfold from beginning to end, Nilin is given a task to complete by changing memory elements to form a new outcome, and she can't leave until her goal is reached. Once done, she has completely changed the character motivations of the target.There are also puzzle elements where the player must pay attention to verbal/visual clues and solve the puzzles to move forward.TROPHIES:The trophies in this game aren't too difficult to gather. Several are story related and can be earned by finishing each episode, and there are a few hidden ones that can only be unlocked by meeting certain combat conditions (defeating 400 enemies, using all Pressen types, etc). There are also several memory mixing trophies to earn. A majority of the trophies are combat related and can be earned with one or two playthroughs of the game.PROS:As previously mentioned, I loved the memory mixing. It was fun to jump inside someone's mind and cause them to remember past events differently. Some of the memory elements wouldn't change things very much, while others were pivotal to completing the task. I liked interacting with each element and seeing how it affected the target's memories.In regard to the collectibles, there's a lot to find. The game advises us to find SAT patches and Focus boosts to power up our character, and picture clues are left around the levels for us as hints. The scaramechs are a little harder to find, some of these might require a lookup online. Finding these items and earning certain trophies will unlocks concept artwork and 3D models.The combo system was pretty simple to use. By unlocking and combining Pressens, we could build longer chain attacks with massive damage, speedy cooldown times, and health regeneration. If the chain is broken, the full effect was lost.CONS:I was surprised to see the in-game movies and chapter introductions couldn't be skipped. While I understand these are necessary going through the levels the first time, all it does is pad out the gameplay when you're trying to replay a level to find missing scaramechs or mnemist memories or SAT patches or Focus Boosts.While the combo system in this game is pretty unique and there were lots of combos to mix and match, I found myself only using a variation of the 3-hit combo throughout my first playthrough. I would start with Power Pressens to take out the harder enemies, switch to a healing Pressen midway through, rinse and repeat. None of the boss battles were particularly difficult; eventually the on-screen prompts gave hints if certain S-Pressens were needed to defeat a boss. If there were a lot of enemies on screen, it was rare to pull off anything higher than a 5 hit combo, even with dodging, because the enemies would swarm me.Finally, the ratio of fighting to memory mixing was horribly unbalanced. The fights felt bland and repetitive, and didn't change much throughout the course of the game. Once I figured out a particular enemy's weakness, the game degenerated into button mashing. The memory mixing, which was by far the most entertaining part of the game, only happened four times over the course of eight levels. I was hungry to twist the psyches of my enemies into oblivion with memory manipulations...and was left wanting.WHAT WOULD I HAVE IMPROVED?The game describes Nilin as an elite memory hunter, which suggests she's been doing this for a long time. However, we never get to see her at the top of her game, save for one flashback. There was an opportunity here to show past memories of her sneaking into corporate offices and convincing CEO's to sell their companies after remixing their attitudes. She could have bribed public officials by threatening to expose torrid affairs, which never actually happened, because she implanted them in their minds. Or, she could have mixed the memories of random citizens to give her access to bonus side missions. Sadly, none of this is found in Remember Me.I also would have liked to see multiple endings - depending on who Nilin remixed, if the remixes were successful, if certain people were alive or dead, these factors could have branched into several storylines.FINAL VERDICT:I REALLY wanted to like this game, and I was expecting a anti-heroine like a character in a Philip K. Dick story. Unfortunately, Remember Me had several missed opportunities. The combat system was unique, but became boring rather quickly. The memory mixing should have been the central part of the game, instead of feeling like a last minute addition on top of a repetitive street brawler.This game is an entertaining rental, and PS3 trophy hounds won't have a problem getting an easy Platinum, but I wouldn't recommend Remember Me for ownership until the price drops down.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2013"}

Oh lets not for get the infamous run faster than the speed of light...the magical knife slash that lets you run through a whole clip to your chest...NO long range sniper maps, but your can run around like an idiot quick scoping. Kill cams are awful, one minute a random bullet near some one kills, next minute a full clip dont even register . Camping is the worst ive ever seen in a COD game. Oh and its been hacked to the point people can give you gold and diamond guns...so who knows what else they are hacking.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00503EAG2","description":"eli","reviewerName":"J. Harley","summary":"Fun latest entry to COD","reviewText":"tI started playing COD with Black Ops, so maybe my expectations weren't as high as the true vets of the game.  I like the game.  Sure, there are a few annoying differences between Black Ops and MW3 that even a COD newbie like myself wasn't happy about.  First, a lot  of the things that I really loved in Black Ops, (combat training, more freedom to choose and practice on maps, more flexibility in creating classes, more menu options, etc) have been removed. The graphics are pretty good and play a little smoother than Black Ops did when maxed out. It's pretty easy to familiarize myself  with some of the weapons that I hadn't seen before in Black Ops.I was going to originally buy BF3 after seeing the eye popping graphics and based upon the fun I had playing BF2BC.  However, the solo campaign for BF3 didn't exactly receive glowing reviews, so I decided to stick with old trusty COD.  Sure it's more of the same, but if more of the same is still fun, it's good enough for me.  I realize there are people out there with gaming rigs worth several thousand dollars containing graphics cards that cost nearly as much as my entire system who are miffed at the deluge of recent console ports.  But guys like me are happy because we can get decent graphics and frame rates on slightly above \"normal\" machines.  Don't get it twisted, you're not going to play this on a Black Friday special laptop with integrated graphics, 2 gigs of RAM, and a slow dual-core CPU. But if you have a semi-decent machine (For instance, mine has a decent spec Sandy Core CPU, gobs of RAM, and a decent discreet GPU), you won't feel as left out as you did five years ago.  Sure, they should offer an absolute eye stunning mode for people with dream machines, but as we all know, most of these are console ports nowadays anyway and MW3 looks every bit the console port.  At least it plays at a decent resolution even if it's not the most texture and effects heavy game ever.Getting back to the game play itself, I haven't really run into any major server or lag issues myself.  It took a minute for me to restore my server browser in multiplayer (instead of allowing the game to auto-assign me to a server). One thing I absolutely applaud is no more crashing at critical points resulting in the loss of all saves since last restart of game.  Nothing ticked me off more in Black ops than nearly completing a level, passing several save points, and having the game crash.  I'd have to end it forcefuly in Task Manager, restart and all my saves would be gone.  I'd have to start at the beginning of a level if I hadn't restarted since beginning the level.  So, to make it a little (and I do mean VERY little) less annoying, I restart the game after each crucial save point to ensure my save was really saved.  So far, game play on MW3 has been great, with no such annoyances.  Both solo and multi-player are very fun.  I'm still in the New York segment in solo mode and I will mention, the New York battle does remind me of Crysis 2 just a tiny bit.  I haven't played solo as much as multiplayer because I'm playing mulitplayer nonstop in an attempt to level up before the cheats, campers, and map trolls start making MP life miserable as usual.  As long as the maps are relatively new to everyone and the cheats few, I'm scoring a lot more kills and have a much better ratio compared to my first time playing Black Ops just this past spring.If you're a casual COD player like me, you will enjoy this version.  If you've only played Black Ops so far (again, like me) you'll love all this new version has to offer.  I love the weapons, environments and gameplay stability.  I know the purists will hate that statement but it's true.  I do believe even a lot of long-time COD players will like it.  But before anyone beats me up too badly with negs for not typing \"it sucks!\" a million times or \"It rocks!\" a million times, just remember, I'm reviewing for th casual COD fans.  I'm sure more hardcoe players will weigh in as time goes on with more detailed reasons why they hate or love it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2011"}

Even the track creator is amazingly simple to use, much more so than LittleBigPlanet's level creator.The load times can get a bit tedious, but with how smooth the frame rates and overall gameplay are, it's well worth the wait. Replay value is tremendous, and the community is already loaded with user-created content to check out. This game is definitely kid friendly in almost all aspects, but if you let your kids play online I wouldn't recommend letting them wear a headset, as foul language is rampant and not moderated.

{"product_name":"B0050SX9VO","description":"","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"Better than the first","reviewText":"In 2009, gamers were treated to \"Borderlands\", a unqiue, genre-blending title that incorporated all the best elements of first person shooters and RPGs, and incorporated a good dose of looting just for good measure. So how does the sequel compare? Well, brilliantly. This one is even better than the first.PLOT: The game is set five years after the first game. Unlike the first game, from the start there is a clearly defined villain. The game's antagonist, Handsome Jack, has claimed the wealth that the vault hunters uncovered in the Eriidan Vault from the first game. Handsome Jack now runs the Hyperion Corporation and is now Pandora's dictator. Handsome Jack's first priority is to kill the colonists that makes up the main population of Pandora, clean the planet up, establish law and order, and bring in industry. Like \"The Hunger Games\", Handsome Jack conducts a gladiator tournament where participants fight to the death for precious loot. You start out in this tournament and the beginning of the game. After winning the tournament, Handsome Jack denies you your prize,a nd you are contacted by the Guardian Angel from the first game and who informs you that Handsome Jack must be killed and the four orginial vault hunters must be freed.CHARACTERS: The original characters from the first game all appear as NPCs. There are four new characters:Salvador: analogous to Brick, he can use two guns of any type at the same type.Zero: An Assassin. Like Ryu Hybasi from \"Ninjga Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos\", he can create a copy of himself and also turn invisible. Similar to Mordecai.Maya: She can suspend enemies and is similar to Liltih.The Classes and differing abilities that you can use in tandem create unique gameplay experiences. For example, you can use Salavdor to engage enemies in gunfights, and in conjunction use Zero (my personal favorite) as a deadly assassin to sneak behind the hordes and slaughter them. Or using Maya's phaselock, you can blow the enemies away with Salvator, or have Axton slay them all with a turret.Although the character customization is weak on how the characters appear graphically (you are only able to change their skin), in class skill customization \"Borderlands 2\" far outperforms \"Borderlands\". Although the four main classes (Gunzerker - two guns at once, Siren - Phase locking, Assassin - invisibility and using surprise attacks, and Commando - turrett warfare) are all clearly defined, each skill tree offers a new nuance within these clearly defined parameters to suit a broad style of game play, far more extensive than the original game.Like the previous title, you share your loot, so choose your partner carefully in co-op. There's a great new option called \"Duel\", where you select different items for wager, and whoever wins the duel takes all the loot. The vehicle driving sequences are rather weak, being both limited in that you really only use the vehicle to get you to where you are going. These sequences aren't nearly as much fun as Halo's vehicle sequences.For fans of the first game, \"Borderlands 2\" takes everything the first game did right and steps it up a notch. Oh, and don't forget the guns. That's only about a \"bazillon\" of them. It's amazing how many different types of guns are in this game. Between the highly detailed skill tree, the unique interaction the different character types that afford so many different possible stragetgies for different segments of the game, the expertly written story line and fantastic artwork, \"Borderlands 2\" is an essential purchase for those who love gaming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2012"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors.

To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind.

The control in the other versions is impossible at times, and a bugger to learn if you are a first time player.The game by itself is excellent. Lot's of puzzles, and lots of Zombies to shoot down. There are times (many of them, actually) where you much be careful how many zombies you shoot, because you can run low on bullets very quickly. The story is standard for any Survival Horror game: A group of soldiers are locked in an old mansion that is infested with zombies. An evil company has eperimented with a chemical that turns people into zombies, and the fallout turns the WHOLE TOWN into zombies. To survive, you must make your way through the mansion, and solve all the puzzles. This is definitely a challenge, and one that can be frustrating at times, but rewarding once completed.Here are the pros. The graphics are superb. The detailing of the zombies and the surroundings give you are real sense of dread, and yes, the blood flow is well detailed, it sprays when you are wounded. The music is ominous and ambient, giving just the right mood to the situations you come across. The story is also well put together, even though anyone who has seen George Romero's \"Living Dead\" trilogy (and what horror fan hasn't?) can get a sense of deja vu. All these elements make this a game well worth getting.Now for the cons. This game is not the toughest game for the Playstation, but it can be darn frustrating when you get stuck. Sometimes, a puzzle is very tricky and requires you to back-track just to see if you missed anything. This adds much more time to the game, but not in a good way. There is also the frustration of running low on bullets when there are three zombies coming towards you. Each zombie requires about three bullets each to finish them off, but bullets are so scarce that you must conserve. Also, the acting and dialogue is so hammy that it is comical, and you feel compelled to just skip through it so you can get back to killing zombies.Overall, this is a great game with a few shortcomings. But then again, nothing is perfect. If the Survival Horror concept sounds appealing, then you should check this one out. The \"Resident Evil\" series has become the benchmark of Survival Horror much like \"Final Fantasy\" has for the RPG genre.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2002"}

Jongeling \"slice of heaven\"","summary":"The Differences between RE D-C and RE2","reviewText":"Since last night I've been waiting to do this review, because I've been studying the exact differences from RE2 and RE Directors Cut. This review will really help for someone who has played RE2 but is wondering what RE DC is about. Well, you've came to the right place.  First of all, here are the facts:1. Each zombie takes 5 shots NO MATTER WHAT. (with the Beretta)2. Jill is a blonde all though she doesn't look like it (a very dumb blonde)3. BARRY HAS A MAGNUM AND HES PROUD!!!4. You have to kill zombies up to four times if you leave the room when you shoot them down. (that means they come back alive once they are dead and you leave the room...the just pop up!)5. This game has hilarious dialogue!Well, speaking of dialogue, the grammar is also very bad...and I mean VERY bad. Examples are: (when you pick up the 1st floor map)  &quot;You got the 1st floor map&quot;  RE2 says &quot;you've taken the 1st floor map&quot; that makes more sense.  &quot;You got the acid rounds&quot;...funny sometimes. Also, what I found is that Jill doesn't know what blood is. Barry is inspecting a pool of red liquid on the dining room floor. Jill comes over and has the nerve to ask &quot;What is it?&quot; and she stays there and studies it...??? Barry replies with &quot;I THINK it is blood. I hope this is not Chris's blood!&quot;  And they have exaggeration at the completely wrong times. But when there is a big monster coming they just talk &quot;wow. its a monster. what do we do?&quot;  and when there is like a door that doesnt open (during movie scenes) they say &quot;THIS DOOR WONT OPEN!! WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO??&quot; Also, a really hilarious part is when Barry hands Jill the acid rounds Jill says that he should keep them for himself, and Barry replies &quot;No that's okay...I have THIS!!!&quot; And holds up his Magnum...I laughed my head off...he sounded so stupid! No offence to the makers of RE or anything but it is just so funny!Another fact is that the camera angles are bad, but the puzzles are harder. Hmmm? Resident Evil is a very very very good game...but it is just the dialogue and camera angles...ive been talking it down but now its time to tell you that it is DEFINATELY worth getting, despite it's happy mediums.So theres a few final things I have to say here:1. Barry has a magnum 2. Wesker has shades 3. And the three zombies at the top of the stairs above the M Storeroom 1F sound like cows.Cheers! ~Jongles","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2001"}

Players will achieve soaring levels of power, explore Northrend (the vast icy continent of the Lich King), and battle high-level heroes to determine the ultimate fate of Azeroth. As you face the dangers of the frigid, harsh north, prepare to master the dark necromantic powers of the Death Night -- World of Warcraft's first Hero class. No longer servants of the Lich King, the Death Knights begin their new calling as experienced, formidable adversaries. Each is heavily armed, armored, and in possession of a deadly arsenal of forbidden magic.If you have a World of Warcraft account with a character of at least level 55, you will be able to create a new level-55 Death Knight of any race (if on a PvP realm, the Death Knight must be the same faction as your existing character). And upon entering the new world, your Death Knight will begin to quest to level 80, gaining potent new abilities and talents along the way. This expansion allows for only one Death Knight per realm, per account.New Environments in Northrend AwaitJourney through the remote, diverse lands of Northrend and explore Dragonblight, Grizzly Hills, Borean Tundra, and Howling Fjord. Named for bones of perished dragons and majestic shrines to the fallen creatures, Dragonblight is an arctic wasteland surrounded by dense forests.Not everything is frozen in Northrend. The lush mountains of Grizzly Hills are the ancestral home to the furbolgs, who have grown accustomed to relative peace. Although their tranquility is being challenged by trappers, goblins, and ice trolls, Grizzly Hills remains a vast and dangerous wilderness.The southwestern tip of Northrend is home to the sprawling Borean Tundra. The Horde has established a dominant presence in this icy portion of the continent and has formed a bond with the tuskarr, a walrus-like race of nomadic fisherman. Magical energy is afoot in the region, and it has caused increased tension.High above the Great Sea at the southeastern tip of Northrend lies the Howling Fjord. Ancient mythology holds that a race of half-giant warriors, the vrykul, once inhabited the land, founding a prosperous civilization. They mysteriously vanished, leaving deserted villages and abandoned temples. In present times, the Alliance and the Horde have come to Howling Fjord to confront the Lich King. Strangely, this has prompted the return of the vrykul, who are attacking the Alliance and Horde settlements. Howling Fjord presents a difficult challenge on two fronts: withstanding the vrykul's onslaught and battling the evil Lich King.A Multitude of MonstersStrange and terrifying creatures inhabit the frozen continent of Northrend, such as Nerubian Viziniers, Plague Eruptors, Shoveltusks and Flesh Giants, to name just a few. Half-spider, half-humanoid, the viziniers utilize sorcery and high intelligence to emerge as the rulers of Nerubians' underground kingdom. The Plague Eruptors are walking corpses created by the Lich King's evil experiments to spread horror and chaos across the living world.Massive curved antlers make it easy to identify the Shoveltusks. These grumpy beasts are very dangerous, territorial, and best left alone. The Flesh Giants are nothing short of nightmarish abominations. Cobbled together from the pieces of giant body parts, the Flesh Giants employ tremendous strength to carry out the Lich King's wishes.The World of Warcraft: Wrath of King Lich expansion pack allows you to engage in epic siege warfare. The pack presents the first Hero class and allows you to transform your Death Knight's look with character customization that even include hairstyles and dances.

The beginning areas of the continent have a very old-world feel to them, and you can immediately understand that this place has history.  Anyone who played the prior Warcraft games knows that Northrend is a place with a certain feel to it, and the creators of the expansion have hit that dark, evil feel on the head.The expansion is typical of a WOW game with numerous quests available the moment you get off the Zeppelin.  There is a lot of variety, and as soon the starting areas clear out from all of the people looking for new continent, there really is a lot to do.Graphically they've improved the look of the game completely, which is saying a lot because the prior content looked amazing as well.I've only run one instance, which was Uthgarde Keep and it was stellar.  The difficulty was there, the place was just crazy looking with a huge forge and an outside area where dragon riders fly over head.  The loot has been upgraded to be in line with players over level 70, and unlike Burning Crusade, not everything is as obvious an upgrade.  Many of the stats on items have been redefined so you won't always be looking for the same stats you had looked for previously.I've only played myself to level 72 which is a lot of play considering Blizzard has DOUBLED the amount of exp it takes to gain a level.

This means one doesn't need to play RDRevolver in order to enjoy RDRedemption, in fact that's what most gamers appear to have done. Taking place in the year 1911 in the final days of the old west, you are John Marston, a former outlaw who finds himself with no other choice but to take up his guns again and kill his former gang of outlaws in order to be reunited with his wife and son, who have been taken from him by less than moral government agents. The game opens with Marston being sent away by the agents to the last known location of his first target and he ends up getting himself shot when he finds him. A woman named Bonnie McFarlane finds him bleeding on the side of the road and takes him to her ranch to get himself treated. From there the game lets you get used to the controls by having you perform a few jobs here and there for Marston's new friend by herding cattle on horseback, shooting pesky rabbits that are eating the ranch's crops, and other rather menial tasks. This is actually helpful, since the game's controls take a bit of getting used to, especially when it comes to riding horses and moving Marston around proficiently. The game does start off a bit slow, both in terms of gameplay and with somewhat lengthy cutscenes that take their time in actually telling us what Marston's purpose is in going after his former gang buddies, but that's part of the reason why this game hooks you. Marston himself knows what he has to do and why, but we don't find out the juicier details about Marston's past until a bit later when he talks to some of the other characters he comes across about their lives. Don't worry, the game has you doing more interesting things soon enough like accompanying U.S. Marshals on raids to gun down or capture outlaws, rescue hostages, and other things involving entertaining gunslinging.Both in the main missions and the many side missions known as Stranger events, Marston will be doing favors for all kinds of people like collecting important items scatterd across the land and bringing them back, escorting friendly NPC characters, and riding horses or horsedrawn wagons through the desert landscape while shooting pursuing enemies, all in the hopes of getting a decent lead on the location of his former gang. In the Stranger missions, Marston is tasked by a character to perform a job or favor for them (what a surprise) and the player can either choose to leave the task unfinished or complete it and get something in return, usually money or ammunition. What's interesting about these side missions is that they all have their own stories behind them that are separate from that of the main game and usually involve several stages in order to be completed. They range from tracking down missing persons, gathering parts for a man to build a flying machine/glider, getting money for an abandoned pregnant woman, and doing favors for a mysterious man who seems to know Marston from some time in the past. Most of these Stranger missions have endings that will leave you thinking and at times even regretting that you completed them. Marston will also run into many random encounters with people, whether it be hookers being attacked by unsavory patrons, people asking Marston to help them rescue a loved one from being hanged by criminals, people appearing to need a ride to a nearby town only to then try to steal your horse or rob you, or law enforcement needing help in capturing or killing fugitives. Marston can either help them, ignore them, or kill them. Helping people in these random encounters, completing Stranger missions, and killing enemies raises Marston's Fame, which allows him to get away with certain crimes like horse theft more easily or bribe civilians and lawmen to forget about other crimes he commits, should the player choose to commit any. Tied with Marston's Fame is his Honor, which can go down for committing crimes like indiscriminatley killing people and bribing, while assisting law enforcement and civilians under attack raises Honor. The higher Marston's Honor, the more likely his more serious crimes will be overlooked (again, if he should commit any) and he'll receive discounts in shops and taxi rides. Committing crimes will have a bounty placed on Marston's head, so law enforcement and bounty hunters will be after him until he either pays the bounty off himself or turns in a pardon letter.With regards to the number of favors and jobs you have to do for people, the game does tend to throw a seemingly endless list of chores at you to the point where Marston himself, a relatively patient man, grows irritated and almost hostile by the constant demand of favors by predominantly unscrupulous and dishonorable characters. Most of these characters almost always have their own selfish agendas, with most of them simply milking Marston as their unwilling errand boy to do their dirty work for them. While some of the characters in the game are entertaining and humorous in their own ways, others just beg for the player to want to put a bullet through their eyes. Fortunately, some of the characters are actually willing to help Marston for more modest and much less selfish favors like the aforementioned Bonnie McFarlane, U.S. Marshal Leigh Johnson, and elderly gunslinger Landon Ricketts. These characters are the rare gems of decency in the almost lawless land of New Austin (in Texas) and Nuevo Paraiso (in Mexico) who ask Marston to help them in assisting people in dire need of a helping hand. Whether they're selfish criminals and scam artists, or more decent folk, the many main and even supporting characters are well portrayed and realistic; the game really makes them feel real with their wide range of distinct personalities, appearances, and character flaws. Rockstar has outdone itself with creating a world with REAL people in them: most can't be completely trusted and some are not so bad. Some characters also have their own views on politics and race relations that correctly show how people thought about these things back then: they were mostly pro-slavery, anti-Mexican, and against women voting, and these opinions are revealed in humorously inappropriate ways. Aside from simply doing favors for people, you can take part in bounty hunter missions where Marston takes down a wanted poster, rides out to a marked hideout, and after doing away with the bounty target's henchmen he can either kill the target or bring him back alive and earn double the money. There are also challenges that can be completed involving locating hidden treasures, collecting plantlife, skinning animals for their pelts, and scoring several consecutive headshots in combat. As if all this wasn't enough to keep a gamer busy, there are other things Marston can do to pass the time: he can gamble in card games and horseshoes, attack gang hideouts for more ammo and money, watch black and white \"moving pictures\", and buy and read newspapers (these movies and newspaper articles add more to the game's deliciously controversial issues of racism and politics).To deal with his many enemies, Marston has access to a wide range of weaponry and items he gains through completing missions, purchasing them in shops, or looting them off enemies. He'll use many different revolvers, pistols, rifles, shotguns, throwing knives, fire bottles, dynamite, and even sniper rifles. He'll also get a lasso which allows him to capture people alive and acquire wild horses for him to ride. Making a return from RDRevolver is the \"dead eye\" mechanic, which comes in three levels. Level one functions like regular bullet-time and lets Marston place a single, well placed shot; level 2 works just like it did in RDRevolver and lets Marston automatically mark specific areas of a target wherever the targeting reticule goes; level three lets Marston manually mark his targets wherever he chooses. The game's combat is pretty fun and works well, with Marston being able to fire from cover and take out many enemies with just a couple of shots each. Due to the game's rather realistic approach to combat where enemies will die after just 2 or 3 shots, there are no boss fights in this game, just entertaining combat and then chase sequences against the big time enemies in the game. Also making a return from RDRevolver is an improved version of dueling, where Marston will be challenged by someone (usually a random encounter) to a duel where you once again grab your gun, draw it, and enter \"dead eye\" mode where you have to place more shots on your enemy than they place on you when the targeting reticule turns white and small, since placing a shot when it's large and red will make it less powerful (a meter shows who has more shots placed). You can also take the merciful route and shoot your dueling opponent's hand to disarm them with style, but only with the random encounter duels. Unlike the dueling in RDRevolver, the targeting reticule during duels in this game doesn't drift around so much, so that's a big plus.The lands of New Austin and Nuevo Paraiso are truly impressive. To say that the in-game world is expansive is an understatement: in truth it's MASSIVE. The old west of Red Dead Redemption makes other large environments like Haven City from Jak II and the Capital Wasteland from Fallout 3 look like little playgrounds in comparison. At times, the world will seem a little too large, especially when you have to travel from one end of the map to the other. It could easily take you five minutes (in real time) to reach certain places on horseback, which is the main mode of travel, and if you get stopped on the way by the many random encounters and events, the many trips you take in this game will be even longer. These extended moments of down time will turn some players off, even players like me who don't mind simply taking in the scenery will grow tired of these overly long horseback trips at times, but it also adds further to the game's realism. Marston can even buy rooms in different towns where you can save your game and change into the different outfits you acquire after completing certain objectives; some of these outfits look cool and offer unique perks like walking among outlaws or law enforcement without being attacked or arrested. He can also make camp in the wilderness to sleep and save, as well as fast travel to previously visited towns; I never use fast travel in games, I prefer to enjoy the trips and the encounters they offer, but other players will surely take advantage of the fast travel mechanic. Aside from guys with guns, there are plenty of dangers out in the wilderness like wolves, wild boars, bears (oh my), and the ever annoying and deadly cougars that you should definitely watch out for, as well as more passive animals like rabbits, deer, cows, elk, and of course horses. Unlike most free-roam games, this world is of course not populated by an endless number of buildings and skyscrapers that you can't go into, instead it's mostly vast and empty plains of grass, barren deserts, mountainous landscapes, and even snow filled forests, with different and mostly small settlements and farms, and the occasional forts and strongholds; you can also go into and explore almost every building in the game. The town of Blackwater stands out the most, since it's a surprisingly modern looking town with cobblestone streets, houses, and seaside ports, setting it apart from all the other settlements in the world. No matter where you are or what you're doing, this game looks AMAZING, especially for a free-roaming sandbox game. The graphics are comparable to those seen in games like Enslaved and Metal Gear Solid 4; all the facial features and flaws on the characters' faces, as well as the movements and appearances of horses and other wildlife, are superbly done. Even during cutscenes you'll see characters' coats and hair blowing in the wind along with surrounding blades of grass: that's some serious attention to detail.The DLC for this game, Undead Nightmare, is its own blast of fun. It's basically an alternate universe side story to the main game, so while it's not directly tied to the main story, it does include almost all of the main characters. The story here follows John Marston who once again has to save his family by curing them of a zombie infection. About half of the population of New Austin and Nuevo Paraiso has also been infected and Marston will have to help old friends and the familiar towns from the main game to battle hordes of the undead, which range from the classic shambling zombies, faster zombies who run on all fours, obese zombies who charge at you, toxic zombies who spit out acid, and even zombified versions of wolves, cougars, bears, bulls, and so on. Marston will use the same kind of weapons he used in the main game, as well as bait to lure zombies to one spot so they can be disposed of en masse, a torch to set them on fire, holy water to dispel their evil, and a blunderbuss (explosive shotgun) that can reduce the undead into bloody stains by using zombie parts as ammunition. The main missions have Marston following leads that may allow him to find a cure for the zombie plague, but he'll have plenty of other things to keep him busy. He'll have to periodically clear out towns of the undead so they will be safe enough for him to do the usual sleeping, switching of outfits, and saving his game; not to mention to make sure the entire population of each town doesn't get \"zombified.\" Replacing bounty hunter missions are missing person missions, where Marston will take down a missing person poster, save the person from the attacking undead, and take them back in one piece to a safe zone. Stranger missions are now Survivor missions that have you doing other things to stem the tides of the undead like burning coffins in cemeteries and capturing undead alive so people can study them (or in one case use them as \"actors\" in a zombie film).Random encounters have you dealing with people feeding the remains of other people to their zombified family members, people trying to communicate with a newly undead loved one, undead chasing down civilians, and of course groups of undead shambling around aimlessly across the land. There are new challenges to complete, mythological creatures to kill and capture, and money is no longer an object due to the zombie apocalypse. Instead, as John Marston himself says, guns and ammo are \"more valuable than gold now\", so he'll have to get ammo and certain weapons by looting the undead (and regular dead) and saving towns. Fame and Honor are also no longer factors in this game. The same kind of dark humor present in the main game returns in Undead Nightmare, such as Marston watching with a slight smirk when an extremely racist and unlikable man gets devoured by zombies, or people blaming the plague on the Mexicans and discussing who should take over leadership of America once they've reclaimed it from the undead. The only real complaints I have for RDRedemption are: the auto-aim sometimes locks onto nearby civilians instead of enemies, the targeting reticule is puny (and unclear during duels), the movement controls can sometimes be unresponsive, the aiming controls are unusual and a bit awkward, and on-screen tutorials tend to appear and then disappear too quickly; some players will abhor these minor problems, but I was able to get used to them. There's multiplayer in both games as well, but I don't play them (though I've heard they're fun). Red Dead Redemption has a lot going for it and even more to offer, keeping players busy for days or even weeks. Undead Nightmare alone has a lot for you to do, especially for a DLC that's only half as long as the main game. You don't even have to be a big fan of westerns to enjoy this game, but those who are will probably enjoy it more. As for the ending of the main game, well... most will initially be upset and angry, but then be left with a sense of satisfaction and closure. Just make sure to keep playing the game until you see the credits, otherwise you haven't seen the real ending.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2011"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game.

On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

Wang \"nycmode\"","summary":"Monumental Achievement for Video Games","reviewText":"Often I am not so enthused about a video game sequel given that I find there is a lot of repetition and frankly a lot of corporate interests to cash in on an award winning franchise.  But once in a blue moon, you often find a game that not only meets expectations - but exceeds them with flying colors.Mass Effect 2 is such a game.For those of you not familiar with Bioware, they are responsible for some of the best story driven action RPGs of the recent video game era.  They are the minds behind Knights of the Old Republic, Jade Empire, and more recently, Dragon Age.  Their games are defined by excellent storytelling, dramatic flair, and choices that ultimately determine the outcome of the epic story that you are thrust into.Mass Effect 2 continues the great storyline from ME1, which featured our hero Shepard - who was charged with the monumental task of fighting off a massive invasion of machines that threated the very existence of all living beings in the universe.  In an effort to avoid spoilers, I will only note that the storyline in ME2 does not disappoint fans of the first game and provides a ton of new twists right off the bat.But one great aspect of ME2 is that you really don't have to play the first game in order to get sucked into the amazing storyline.  You won't feel lost at all, though I will say that if you played ME1 and made substantial progress in that game, you will be glad to know that there are definitely some nice advantages of exporting your character from that game.  Having that sense of continuity (and stat bonuses) of seeing your created character from the first game is definitely very satisfying.  You really get the sense that something you created is part of a long chain of events, and that is something seriously lacking in a lot of video games these days.  It just makes your attachment to your avatar even more interesting (especially considering Mass Effect 2 is the second installment of a planned trilogy - which gives you incentive to really build your character now as well).In terms of gameplay - it is extremely intuitive and easy to pick up on.  Bioware really listened to what players wanted and addressed some of the shortcomings of the first game.  First up, inventory control is pretty simple and not as intense or complicated in the first game.  Given how important combat is in ME2, it is good to know that weapons and biotic power management is easy and will not turn off casual gamers.  Mass Effect 2 puts a strong emphasis on storyline, and I am glad to see that gamers are not encumbered by dealing with sorting out their inventory or powers in a complicated manner.  I also like how they cleaned up little details in the game, such as making load screens not asCombat is like ME1 in that you fight real time battles.  But this time, they've really cleaned up the animations.  The previous game was sometimes choppy, and often you get lag when the battles get too heated or intense.  Here there is minimal lag and Bioware also added a wonderful cover system that really adds a new dimension to the game.  Now rather than just running around like a headless chicken and just standing behind a box, you can actually take cover and put your head down and and take well aimed shots at your enemies.  Given that the AI has improved, it does come in handy that you can duck and cover and not get your head taken off by some huge monster or mech due to the poor animations.But the biggest part of this game has to be the excellent storyline.  The voice acting, like in ME1, is absolutely phenomenal.  The plot twists, excellent dialogue, and realistic graphics definitely makes this aspect alone worth the price of admission.  Last but not least, your actions will determine how your game ends.  As with most Bioware games, you are given plenty of dialogue choices and in-game actions that will play a major role in deciding the outcome of your adventure.  You can choose to be a heroic Paragon, or an evil Renegade.  The choice is yours and that provides another wonderful element of replay value that is often lacking in other games.Last but not least the game simply feels BIGGER and more EPIC than the previous game (which at the time, was already a big production as is).  In one point of the game you return to a location in ME1 and everything about it seems improved.  The visuals, the interaction with NPCs, everything you can pretty much imagine is just better.  I am trying very hard not to provide spoilers, but I can say with confidence that within minutes of firing up the game, you will be totally immersed in the story, atmosphere, gameplay and most importantly - the general fun factor of the game.For fans of ME1, seeing old characters return really adds to the sense of continuity and epic scope of the game and the current storyline.  For those who like great stories, ME2 provides a plot that rivals most big budget Hollywood productions.  There will be more than one occasion where you will feel very tortured about the decisions you make in the game.  Over time, players will quickly bond (or detest) certain squad members and that in of itself is an accomplishment.In short - get Mass Effect 2 you'll be happy you did.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2010"}

Gordon","summary":"The Western Genre Finally Done Justice In a Videogame","reviewText":"While the Western genre was represented in videogames from the early days of arcades and consoles (Outlaw on the Atari 2600, Gun.Smoke in the arcade, and Wild Gunman for the NES are just a few that come to mind), the genre has always taken a back seat to other themes, such as military action, high fantasy, or sci-fi.  As a uniquely North American setting, and one wrought with controversy over the battle between settlers and Native Americans, the appeal to a worldwide gaming audience wasn't quite as enticing to publishers.  To make matters even more difficult, much of the charm of the Western genre comes from the aesthetics: wide open spaces, a sense of loneliness and desolation, and an archaic feel that teeters on the cusp between the young days of the United States, and its emergence into modern living.  With the advent of 3D, \"open world\" games on the PS2, Xbox, and their current successors, it would have seemed as if that intangible essence could finally be captured in game form.  However, the first major attempt at this, the 2005 title \"Gun\", ended up disappointing many despite its positives, with its lack of content and surprisingly small rendition of the old West.  When Rockstar Games, the home of the GTA series, announced an open-world pseudo-sequel to the Western action game Red Dead Revolver, the question lingered as to whether they would learn from the mistakes made by Activision's development of Gun.Well, the good news is that RDR manages to make good on the concept of a Western open-world game, and with a vengeance.  Without giving too much away, RDR encompasses 3 of the major archetypes of Western movies in each of its acts: the traditional \"sheriffs, tumbleweeds and wastelands\" type of Western, the \"spaghetti Western\" sub-type set in a volatile Mexico, and the more \"socially conscious\" Western a la \"Pale Rider\", set in more northernly climes.  Linking these 3 themes is the story of John Marston, a former outlaw forced back into the gunslinger lifestyle by shady government agents, who need his help in hunting down his old cohorts.  The game takes place in the early 1900s, as the Old West slowly fades into the wind in the face of encroaching technology and societal development.  That's not to say that the game eschews the traditional vistas of westerns; in fact, the march of progress is more of a vague backgroun murmur.  You'll ride through prairies, pine forests, deserts scrublands, red-hued mesa canyons, moss-laden swamplands, Mexican villas and forts, snow-covered highlands, and rough 'n tumble towns.Wagon-trains, locomotives, and horseback riding are the means of transportation here, and whether you prefer a six-shooter revolver, or a lever-action rifle, there's always the threat of your brand of frontier justice buying you more trouble than you thought it would. To that end, you'll end up learning to use the slow-motion \"Dead Eye\" to not only win duels at high noon, but to hunt wildlife, or to shoot the rope off the neck of an unfortunate lynching victim in order to save her.  Yes, you heard right- out and out heroics in a title from the house that Grand Theft Auto built.  RDR gives you the choice to build a reputation as either a hero or a villain, although the main storyline will still play out the same way.  And there's no doubt- this is a world in need of a hero, even if many of the stories you become involved in along the way end up taking a dark turn (in typical Rockstar Games fashion, the spirit of sarcasm and dark humor is alive and well here).  Marston, while certainly not a white-hat wearing saint, is certainly more akin to the traditional hero than the stars of prior epics to come out of the Rockstar stable.You'll get more chances to make that choice than in GTA IV. While the number of \"proper\" side missions is still a bit too skimpy for me, the developers have placed a fair amount of random encounters and tasks that will pop up at any given time.  These can include rescuing a man's wife from a hanging, stopping a stagecoach robbery, foiling a kidnapping, transporting dynamite on a wagon, giving a stranded person a ride to town while fighting off bandits, or catching a horse thief.  There are also various challenges involving hunting, the ability to become a night patrol deputy, and of course, the perennial favorite of the frontier- bounty hunting.  Gambling, horse-breaking, and \"five finger filet\" round out the activities.  Also available is the opportunity to replay story missions you've already completed.  And then there's just the simple joy of riding out into the wilderness, which is rendered surprisingly well, and with a stupendous feel for atmosphere.  Few games have succeeded as well in rendering a real sense of time and place, with moody lighting and art design that really works.  While the focus is ostensibly on the single-player experience, there's a surprisingly robust on-line multiplayer component, that uses the environments of the single-player game.  I've only played a little of it, but it certainly felt entertaining, even to a primarily single-player gamer like myself.I would be remiss if I didn't note the shortcomings, even in a well-crafted game such as this.  As was the case with GTA III, the third act of the story felt relatively truncated and rushed in comparison to the earlier parts of the game, as if the final deadline suddenly popped up, and forced the developers to hurriedly wrap up the storyline.  The controls are still somewhat awkward, even if ostensibly made so in an attempt to give your character \"weight\" and realism.  And let's not forget, the setting does not lend itself to the type of chaos and wanton destruction that GTA fans might crave (although the ability to lasso and drag any given bystander behind your horse does present quite a temptation to the inner miscreant in us all).  The game is more contemplative and reflective than your typical open-world free-for-all.....yet does manage to feel more fun than you would expect, in part due to a more liberal dosage of things to do outside the storyline.  In sum, I'd recommend it both due to the fact that there's really nothing else out there that fills this niche, and due to the fact that aspects such as the mission replay feature and the constant stream of random mini-missions and distractions gives the single player aspect of the game more longevity than you'd expect.  Recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000O5DS32","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"General Mindless Dinosaur-Slaying Fun","reviewText":"Turok is sort of a space-marines-meets-Jurassic-Park story. In a futuristic world with high end weapons and armor, you're pitted against the raw muscle and razor-sharp teeth of  meat-eating dinosaurs.Really, the game is all about fun. It has nice graphics, but not nearly as stellar as other games out there. The scenery of black mountains and drifting clouds are pretty, but could be better. The character animations are all right, but sometimes clunky and clippy. The voices are all right, but sometimes get flat or cliched.When it comes down to it, this is all about pitting yourself against dinosaurs with the best weapons you could imagine from various sci-fi shows. It's you against bit, sharp-toothed monsters of gigantic proportions. They are faster than you, stronger than you, there are lots of them out there. Can you hold your own against them?The answer hopefully is yes. There are multiple levels of gameplay here, so you can start with the easier one if you haven't played these games before, or just dive into the killer-hard level if you enjoy a challenge. You'll be sneaking around, taking shelter behind jungle plants, plotting out the best place to lay your ambush.Yes, there's a plotline of sort, with crosses and double-crosses. You get your hands on various weapons. Ironically, we tended to stick just with the knife, for silent, deadly kills. The other favorite weapon was the bow with a variety of arrow types.The game is a good length and whether you enjoy it or not probably depends on whether the idea of blasting away at dinosaurs for hours is a fun thing to do. We did enjoy playing our way through it, but it was not one of the games that we kept on the active shelf to revisit for months afterwards.If you're not a dinosaur / monster-slaying fan, it might be best to rent this one for a weekend and see how it appeals to you. That way you could get the dinosaur mashing out of your system if it's not your cup of tea - or get yourself completely hooked and decide to get one of your very own.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2008"}

I love it when a game really earns my money in its length, and the sequel definitely earned my $50 as well, but there is a problem... This is the longest Metroid I have ever played, and unfortunately there wasn't enough story to keep it going for the 15 hours longer this installment took me to beat it. That's not to say the game gets boring, far from it, but you do start to ask, \"How much longer is this going to take? For me? 15 hours more than the original.Now it is true that you can rush through it, and skip on weapons and items upgrades, but believe me, like the original, you will want everything when you face down with the 2nd to last boss of the game. Even with all 255 ammo upgrades, and 255 missiles, you will still likely deplete your ammo supply before ending the Emperor Ing's first phase.There's another area of debatable improvement. Metroid Prime is harder than the original. Some of that difficulty comes artificially; the beam weapons require ammo (thanks a lot you whiney Halo fans) worse yet the ammo can only be replenished is certain conditions are met (IE to get light beam ammo you have to kill with the dark beam.) I did not like this addition to the game. I spent far too much time hunting down ammo and not enough time playing. This game is NOT a first person shooter, it's a first person adventure, and people need to remember that so we don't end up with flaws like that again.By this point you probably think I hate the game. To the contrary I love it, it's just that the game has left me feeling exhausted. To go that kind of time in a well written deep RPG is one thing, but about 20 hours into the game you're out of stuff to scan, and wander for 15 hours more collecting the upgrades and not much else. Never the less the perfectly balanced first person adventure style action that the original introduced is back with, with an easy to use lock on system, a ton of nifty gadgets (including a perfectly executed 3D screw attack) a great (albeit short) story, and some pretty creepy environments and visuals.This game didn't give me nightmares, but did manage to give me the hebejibees a few times, and a few monsters managed to get me to jump as well, quite an accomplishment, and a much-appreciated addition to the series. I loved the light world/dark world thing (even though they're borrowing that theme from A Link to the Past) and Dark Samus was great... Come on we know she's the Metroid Prime from the original. Anyone else remember the secret ending? Yeah.Aside from the game not having enough story to compliment its overall length the vast areas to explore are so strikingly beautiful, and massive that it will take a great deal of time to get bored with what you're looking at. Water effects are a lot better than the previous installment, and the game bare no frame-rate drops, and almost no aliasing running at 480p. It would have been nice to have a true wide screen presentation though.My favorite addition is that for the first time in a long time there are new weapons, and armor. Most Metroid games its Varia and Gravity suit, this one introduces the dark and light suit, and both are awesome. I also loved the annihilator beam. It was great to blast things to pieces like nothing, but it does burn away your ammo pretty quick, again, this is a first person adventure, why do we need ammo?The Metroids in this game were also a lot creepier and intimidating than the last one, though not much harder to kill. I loved the look of the monsters in this title; Retro did a great job with the overall design of the landscapes and creatures of the game.Definitely pick this title up, its a worthy successor to the original, just be warned, it is longer, and you need to be prepared for the moment that the story just kind of drops off the face of the earth until the end of the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2005"}

The depth is incredible. While on foot, you play as one of five specialized classes (assault, medic, scout, antitank, or engineer) with varying equipment and abilities. The choice of vehicles ranges from a selection of tanks, jeeps, and other fairly standard mechanized land vehicles to exotic craft like battleships, submarines, and dive bombers.

Then, when you run ouf of torpedos, parachute into the water next to the carrier to climb up the safety net and snipe some of the crew. Then, move on to steel one of their aircraft and take off, just to bomb them with your own bombs before returning to your own home base where you switch into a Jeep to make it to the next stationary cannon to fire at an enemy destroyer, just to realize they have spotted you and taken out the whole facility with a precission strike...

{"product_name":"B0001VGFK2","reviewerName":"Enlightened \"Both Eyes Closed, see what u don...","summary":"You Already Know...","reviewText":"This game is simply the greatest game to come out on any console (since Tetris!).  San Andreas is by far the largest of its kind and its immersing storyline and gameplay outshine the rest.  Be prepared to spend many days with this joint.  In fact I played it so much I had people referring to me as \"CJ Fool\" It's like an RPG/adventure game where you can basically do anything you want.  The gangsta lifestyle quickly pulls you in as you attend the funeral of your mother...apparently murdered by a rival gang.  No matter who you are or where you are from you probably couldn't have that going down without some type of retaliation.  So in that case the story immediately relates.  From then on...anything goes.  Kill rival gang members to gain territory and take over the city.  Defend your hood against attacks from rival gangs.  Decorate the city with your graffiti to show who's territory it is and to gain respect.  Think you are outnumbered?  Command up to a 7 man army and trek into the enemy's territory and show em what's up. Anything is possible.  Take your girlfriend  ( yes girlfriend ) out on a date ( drinking, eating, dancing - yes dancing).  Outhop the competition with your hydraulics on your lowrider.  Customize your car with hoods, rims, nitro (yes nitro), exhaust pipes, colors, sound systems etc.  Eating is essential, exercise is essential...otherwise CJ will lose weight or he won't be able to knock somebody out.  He won't be able to hop the fences when the heat is after him ( yes hop fences).  Get your weight up in the weight room.  Deck that man in some nice threads or have him rep his hood with bandanas and hoodies.  Give that man a fresh cut or a nappy look.  Play arcade games or gamble away your money.  Steal cars, break into houses at night, interact with people walking on the street, kill drug dealers parading your streets.  Race cars, fly airplanes or better yet buy a ticket and fly to the next city, play basketball, participate in the triathlon.  CJ can now swim, so accidentally drive off a cliff and it's no problem this time around.  The highways are intricate and mountains and buildings are tall.  Mountains you ask?  You damn skippy.  You think it's gonna be sweet having to run down a mountain if you lose your bike?  No way.  Get lost in the country side and find yourself walking where you need to be.  And that country side is huge complete with small towns, tractor trailers, farms ( yes farms), and forests.  Highways are complete and people don't lollygag on them either...don't get caught slippin cause they will ram you and keep on trucking.  And speaking of trucks you got big rigs patrolling that country side...flying over them hills trying to get where there going.  The features of this game are endless.The missions aren't anything sweet either and are challenging to say the least, more challenging than the last two GTA games.  The westcoast lifestyle is exemplified in the soundtrack with classic tracks by Snoop, Dre, Eazy E, NWA, Da Lench Mob, 2Pac, Ice Cube, DOC, and Cypress Hill.  If you feel like chillin to some funk they got that Zapp, Cameo, Ohio Players, Rick James and George Clinton, James Brown, War.  Want that soul they got that Isley Brothers for you.  Want to relive the early nineties they got the classic Bobby Brown, Ralph Tresvant, SWV, GUY, En Vogue, Bell Biv Devoe, Boyz II Men, Soul II Soul, and Aaron Hall.  Want that old school rap they got that Big Daddy Kane, Slick Rick, Eric B & Rakim, Biz Markie, Public Enemy and Brand Nubian.  Simply put the soundtrack is off the meter.  The game is also long enough to warrant 50 bucks being spent, and prepare to lose sleep, friends, jobs, relationships, time and sense of reality after you buy this game.

{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

Rhodes","summary":"Gameboy Advance SP is now the new handheld console to get!","reviewText":"For those of you complaining that you need to get another gameboy and all that, no need to complain. Just because the GBA SP is out and you've got a GBA already that doesn't mean you HAVE to get a GBA SP if you're content with the GBA you have now then you'll be fine.  Others, such as myself may find the GBA SP to be a nice investment.At first you'd wonder why anyone would buy a GBA SP if you've already got a GBA.  Well, let me tell you why I invested in mine.To start off, the GBA SP has a fold down LCD screen and it comes with a backlight!  That was reason number one for me to get it.  Since the LCD screen is fold down it makes it a lot easier to take care of it.  My original GBA screen is much too scratched up and that doesn't have a backlight so I was always running around searching for light. What's also nice about the backlight is that you can turn it off if you like and save battery power that way.Second, all games that work on the previous gameboys work on this one perfectly and let for little problems. You can also play original Gameboy games and Gameboy color games in widescreen (though some look TERRIBLE that way).Thrid, the GBA SP has a recharable battery that can be recharged up to 500 times!  Much better than having to run out to the store and buy batteries all the time.  The GBA SP can be played for hours before having to be recharged, and if you turn off the backlight (you don't need to have it on ALL the time) you can play even longer. Also, if your battery dies just plug in the recharger and you can start playing before it gets fully charged while the adapter is pluged in. The GBA SP will CHARGE WHILE YOU PLAY!With those three things also come a few problems.  What stands out first is the obvious, no place to plug in your headphones meaning that after you spend 100 bucks on the GBA SP you'll have to spend more to buy a set of headphones!The other problem is that the L and R buttons take some time to get used to. They're not as big as they were on the original GBA. Also to go along with this, because the L and R buttons are small if you've got big hands it's a pain to press the buttons and it feels uncomfortable.While the backlight is a nice feature, remember that the screen IS LCD meaning that the backlight can sometimes cause a disturbance in the graphical presentation of the game. Sometimes its best to turn off the backlight.Lastly, eventually you'll have to replace that batter and getting that screw off is very frustrating and'll take you the better half of the day to do it.The GBA SP is actually not a bad investment.  As far as games go there's no difference in the presentation and I'd hope you all know that already.Finally (and this applies to all GBA users), you might want to check out some reviews on GBA games. Chances are if it isn't an exclusive GBA game or it's not an SNES port it isn't worth the buy. If the game is already on the PS2, XBOX or GCN it usually isn't going to be that good on the GBA, so some reviews are handy.OVERALL:The Good+Nintendo finally put in a backlight!+Fold down LCD screen makes it easier to take care of+You can take it virtually anywhere! It fits in your pocket just fine+Rechargeable battery pack!+You don't need to constantly buy new batteries+You can turn the backlight on and off+A HUGE selection of games (especially if you count Gameboy and Gameboy color games).The bad-The backlight can sometimes bring out the worst in the graphics-No place to plug in headphones forcing you to go out and buy some-L and R buttons are small and take time to get used to-If you've got really big hands the original GBA is your best bet","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2004"}

Creating and renting out your pawn too the gaming community may sound like a gimmick but its a good one. I care more about my pawn stats and gear then I do my main character.Anyway the game is about your hero who is the chosen one to kill a dragon. Yes that's cheesy but its a open world game and gives you a reason to be out there fighting and questing. I was a little disappointed in the world and its size. The world in Dragon Dogma is not that big its medium size easy too get a round. The world also has  only 2 towns in the whole thing. They said this game is open world and yes why it is open (some what) it still linear. The game is set around roads with little grass areas surrounding them.The fighting in this game is okay but I seen better. Its more of action fighting and button mashing , but there is no combos it this game. There is some strategy you may have to kill a certain monster with fire and a different one with ice. Some times you have too break some monsters amour off be for you kill it and etc.The broken part about the game is the bugs , and some of these bugs are game breaking. Also the quest menu is horrible.  you cant really tell the difference if your doing a story quest or a side quest, so you might move along in the story quest and can never go back too do side quest you miss.Overall The game was a good buy at full price, I liked it way more then I enjoyed reckoning , I just wish it had more polish.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2012"}

I haven't played a Mortal Kombat game since Mortal Kombat II on the Sega Genesis.  But, I thought I'd give it a try.  So far I haven't played all the way through the game, but I have made some observations:1) The graphics aren't too bad, but there are some spots where it is almost painfully under par (e.g. at the crux of the arm/inside of the elbows where the arms bend, it almost looks like a plastic toy).  The animation isn't the best, either.  I've definitely seen worse, but I do expect better from the machine that is supposed to be the biggest baddest thing on the market.2) The voice actors really stink.  I don't think there is a single character in the game where I could say that the voice actor was good quality.3) There isn't really any plot in the storyline4) Arcade mode is exactly what you would expect and delivers in classic Mortal Kombat style.5) Combos just don't work the way they're supposed to. After attempting the combat challenge, I can say that you have to be way too exact with the timing of your button-pressing for most of the combos to work.  It becomes extremely frustrating very quickly.And that is it from me on this game.  I am waiting to receive the game guide that I bought from Amazon, as well.  We'll see if maybe reading up on this game helps the enjoyment.  So, look for my Mortal Kombat vs DCU game guide review in the not too distant future.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2012"}

{"product_name":"B007XVTR3K","description":"","summary":"Another amazing COD! Give it a chance!","reviewText":"First off all these people writing bad reviews dont know what theyre talking about.  Theyre just mad because theyre those people who used to play Mw2 sitting in a corner with one man army.  The fact is Call Of Duty games have slowly been moving away from just having a high k/d ratio, to actually winning the game.  People get mad because it's harder to get your score(kill)streaks sitting in a corner.  Black Ops 2 is by far the most objective based COD yet.  The score streak system is amazing.  Let me put it this way.  In a domination game you get 100 score for killing an enemy, 200 score for capturing an enemy flag, and 125 score for killing an enemy attacking or defending a flag point.  In Kill confirmed you get 50 score for killing an enemy and 100 score for actually collecting the dog tags that were dropped from your kill, and if your buddy collects the tags instead of you, you only get 25 score.  If you don't know, the score actually counts towards your killstreaks which are now named scorestreaks (How appropriate).  So obviously this system is going to favor the objective based player.  The people that are giving this game bad reviews are either mad about shifting to objective/aggressive based gameplay or too impatient to give this game a chance.  Every game has problems when it's first released.  And to be honest i have encountered very little problems so far.  Not too many host migrations, and when there is a host migration it is very quick.  Lag also does not seem to be nearly as bad as the first Black Ops.  And the fact that you don't lose all of your attachments on your guns when you prestige makes you want to use every single gun.  Overall the multiplayer is a huge step forward for COD.  COD os finally supporting aggressive, objective based players, ALOT!  And that's what the game is about right? Wnning should be your main objective not getting a high kill/ death ratio.  The single player campaign is the most action packed it's ever been.  And the fact that your choices affect the outcome of your missions give the campaign a breathe of fresh air. Oh, i almost forgot..... there is finally HIT MARKERS IN THE CAMPAIGN!!  I'm not gonna say anything more about the campaign because i don't want to spoil anything, but Black Ops 2 does not dissapoint!  I'm not forgetting zombies.  I havn't played it too much yet.  But, the maps seem to be on the smaller and less complicated side.  And i've only played the zombie story mode a little.  But so far zombies seems to be the weakest part of this game, but i'm sure it will get amazing once i can stop playing multiplayer lol.  DO not pass up Black Ops 2!!!!

With every firmware update Sony adds new features and modifies others making the overall console better and better.The online function for the PS3 is made using Sony's idea of keeping it a free user based network. Even though it is limited currently you can send messages to other users keep a buddy list, browse the internet using Sony's own internet browser, download music, movies, game demos, arcade games and more.Currently there are 82 games available for purchase at retail or for download off the PlayStation Network Store. Prices for downloads range from 3.99 to 39.99. There are also PS1 games that can be played on both the PS3 and the PSP if you own one. Don't worry though, Sony announced that there will be 200 more games released by the end of the year, it's also rumored that one of the games will be Metal Gear Solid 4. On a side-note, it's been confirmed about 60 times that Metal Gear Solid 4 is PlayStation 3 exclusive and won't be going to the Xbox 360 so don't believe anyone who says otherwise unless its confirmed by the creators themselves. Sony's full E3 2007 press conference is currently available on the PlayStation Network Store and game trailers from the Tokyo Game Show and the Leipzig Game Convention.If you want to make yourself feel good you can use the Folding@Home feature that helps the medical branch of Stanford University study protein stains from diseases in hope of finding a cure from everything ranging from the common cold or AIDs, cancer, and herpes. Recently thanks to the PlayStation 3's contribution a new protein was discovered that folds at the speed of one nano-second.You might be wondering even though these features are great it doesn't completely justify spending 499 (60GB model) or 599 (80GB model/bundle) bucks let me explain why this is worth it without stating what I said above, those are mainly just a giant plus sign.The key reason for the price being so big is because of the Blu-ray DVD drive. You might be wondering why Sony would jam their format into a gaming console. It's for two reasons. So you can watch movies every resolution up to full 1080p and so game developers have enough space to make a huge game without having to worry about changing discs. We all know changing discs for a game went out with the original PlayStation, and yes this is where the Xbox 360 will greatly suffer down the road, the first game that is multi-disc on the 360 is Blue Dragon.Now what's so great about Blu-ray that HD-DVD or standard DVD's can't do? HD-DVD has mostly everything Blu-ray does but doesn't offer nearly as much space which can cause movie studios to limit the amount of HD content or special features on the disc. Blu-ray also has a new feature available now called Blu-ray Java which will allow the menus to look even better and run better then they currently do on HD-DVD. Another key detail is that 6/8 Hollywood studios and most hardware manufacturers support Blu-ray.Another great feature is the internal Wi-Fi Adapter. This allows you to not have to either buy an external Wi-Fi adapter to make your gaming console have wireless internet and saves money on Ethernet Cables.The HDMI port built in to the console is rated to run HDMI 1.3. Some will say \"but the Xbox 360 Elite Edition has HDMI.\" Well there's a major difference, the Elite 360 only supports HDMI 1.2 which is greatly limited compared to HDMI 1.3 which supports 7.1 lossless-audio which is currently the best audio quality available. HDMI 1.3 also supports up to a 1440p resolution so once TVs manage to obtain the Ultra-High-Definition levels the PS3 will be able to at least play some of its smaller PlayStation Network Store downloadable games at that resolution.Now finally the key advantage, the Cell Broadband Engine, the heart of the console. This processor is designed by Sony, Toshiba, and IBM. The Cell is currently the most powerful processor to date, and basic desktop processors are expected to take another 4 or 5 years to match its power. The Cell has been rated to be 12 - 15 times faster than Intel's Core 2 Quad-Extreme.Theres a good amount of titles released and going to be released this Holiday season.

{"product_name":"B0050SW8OS","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A great Vita game, but not the best Uncharted","reviewText":"The Good: Best visuals on any portable system ever, excellent controls, Uncharted gameplay is intact, good use of the Vita hardware, entertaining story, witty dialogThe Bad: No epic set pieces, too familiar to basic Uncharted gameplay, story isn't as deep as PS3 versions, no multiplayerGolden Abyss is the prequel to Drake's Fortune for PS3. This one is coming from Syphon Filter (for PSP) vets Bend Studios instead of Naughty Dog. We follow the hero Nathan Drake as he uncovers a 400 year-old massacre and travels through various dangerous locales to get there. Of course this isn't an Uncharted without some bad guy trying to get the fortune all for himself, but this time there is two, so this makes it a race. A new heroine is introduced as Marisa Chase, but fans will come to not like her as much as previous females in the series due to her lack of charm and charisma. The overall experience is the same as the PS3 versions, but with some added features exclusive to Vita.The story itself doesn't tread any new ground besides carving a new adventure. It isn't as deep as the last two Uncharted games (Among Thieves and Drake's Deception) because it doesn't explore anything about Drake's past, or push his character any. The game felt a lot like the first one, and that's fine, but the Vita version could have been a lot more. The combat and platforming hasn't changed at all, but what's here works well. If you are familiar with Uncharted`s gameplay already you won't need to learn anything new except the Vita features. You can climb around handholds as normal, but you can \"paint\" your path with the touchscreen which is helpful during long shimmys. You can use the touchscreen to climb ropes (as well as the rear touch pad), as well as accessing menus.Thanks to the second analog stick you won't have camera trouble, and this also includes combat. Gun fights feel just like the PS3 versions, but hand-to-hand uses the touchscreen. You can press the fist icon on the enemy or just use square. The final blow is laid by a swipe direction on the touchscreen. In fact all quick time events are done with the touchscreen. This doesn't really add anything significant, but it is a nice touch and makes use of the technology. The tilt sensor is used to balance yourself on beams and the gyroscope is used to fine tune your aim. These features are just subtle touches, but it doesn't really make the game any easier.Golden Abyss has 34 chapters, but the game can be beaten in about 4-5 hours if you aren't looking for collectibles. There are tons of them, and without a walkthrough you won't find them all. This includes taking photos and doing charcoal rubs with the touchscreen. This is probably the best use of the touchscreen because it fits so well into the Uncharted gameplay and setting. The story is delivered with excellent voice acting, and the dialog is top-notch with Drake's sarcastic and snarky comments. There are some interesting puzzles that use the touchscreen, but they are easy and not as challenging as the console versions.The visuals are a real treat, and is probably the best looking handheld game to date on any platform ever. The lighting effects and highly detailed textures are unrivaled on any other portable device. It doesn't look as good as the PS3 versions, but it looks very close to the first Uncharted graphics wise. There are various locations to gawk at such as night caves, lush jungles, and dense villages.After you beat the main game there really won't be any reason to come back except to find the collectibles and unlock trophies. The story is entertaining, but not nearly as memorable as the console versions, but this Uncharted is lacking one huge thing that brings it down so much: Epic set pieces. Uncharted is famous for this and there isn't a single one in the entire game. No exciting train chases, or anything like that. It feels too familiar to the basic gameplay and doesn't stray far from that path. Golden Abyss is a great Vita game, but not the best Uncharted game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2012"}

This game has incredible graphics, an outstanding soundtrack, unbelievable surround sound, and an innovative control scheme.You play as Rohn, who must fight to save his fellow Asylians from their northern neighbors, the Mokai.  You ride your dragon and engage in brutally intense aerial battles.  You will destroy other dragons, destroy catapults, giant rhinos, and even incinerate, trample and eat foot soldiers!  The game is mission-based with the ability to unlock specials depending on how well you carry out your task.As far as the game quality, it's use of the PS3's power is definitely impressive.  While I've heard the controls described as unresponsive and clumsy, I've actually found them to be quite good!  It's a totally different experience to control yourself by tilting the controller.  However, your dragon is fairly incapable of doing quick, sharp turns...and this makes some missions more difficult than necessary.  The missions are intense, but sometimes it is difficult to tell who are the Asylians and who are the Mokai.  If you don't have a high-definition TV, good luck with that one, since the details will be lost.One more nagging annoyance I have is how the wonderful music will play through a scene, then abruptly cut off as it starts a new one.  I think they should've made the transitions more seamless.  However, this is a minor cosmetic issue and has no bearing on the gameplay.So is this a classic, timeless game?  Not by a long shot.

Don't get me wrong, this game is good and I love the Prince of Persia series, but this game just seemed a little... unnecessary. The Sands of Time trilogy was great and it had a great ending which very nicely and neatly wrapped up the series. So to bring back the same Prince again instead of continuing the new Prince of Persia story with the new Prince and his partner Elika... again seems unnecessary. Ubisoft obviously just wanted to cash in further on the Prince of Persia movie (which was decent) by releasing this game alongside it. Oh well, at least this game wasn't a movie tie-in, because then it might have sucked. This game actually takes place during the seven year period between The Sands of Time and Warrior Within. More specifically, it takes place just months after the Prince's adventure in Azad in The Sands of Time. How do I know this? Because in this game, the Dahaka hasn't appeared yet to chase the Prince wherever he goes; the Prince doesn't even mention the Dahaka. Anyway, in this game, the Prince visits his older brother Malik (yes, apparently the Prince does have a sibling) and finds his brother's kingdom being attacked by an invading army. In desperation, and ignoring his younger brother's advice, Malik acquires a medallion (a different one than the currently inactive Medallion of Time the Prince carries) and uses it to awaken King Solomon's Army: an army of sand monsters created by the evil djinn Ratash.Hoping to use the sand army to destroy the invading army, Malik ends up unleashing something far worse upon his kingdom and the sand creatures turn all of Malik's subjects and the invading army into sand statues. The Prince and Malik are unaffected since they both carry the two halves of the medallion which released the sand army. Afterwards, the Prince meets Princess Razia, a water djinn, and she tells him to stop Ratash and his army from destroying everything. An overrun kingdom, family in trouble, a princess, and sand monsters... sounds A LOT like the first game, doesn't it? Well, aside from this game having nothing to do with the actual Sands of Time (Ratash having a sand army is just a coincidence), this game is very similar in design and gameplay to the first game. Even the level layout in the game's opening is almost an exact copy of the opening level in the first PoP game when the Prince is climbing outside the Maharajah's palace. The Prince himself, aside from his armor resembling the one he wore in Warrior Within, is also very much like he was in the first game, which makes sense since he hasn't yet gone through the traumatic experience of being hunted endlessly by the Dahaka. The Prince is just as charmingly sarcastic as he was in his first adventure, while also being a little bit wiser and more experienced from the same adventure. And once again, Yuri Lowenthal provides the voice for the classic Prince, like he did in all the PoP games except Warrior Within.Not yet having fully mastered the deadlier arts of the blade, the Prince fights with just one sword in this game against up to 30 enemies at once; don't worry, most of the enemies in this game are of the \"zombie fodder\" variety, meaning they're slow and easy to avoid. There are a few more challenging enemies later in the game like teleporting creatures who summon other sand creatures, Chargers who...charge at you like rhinos, and towering Titans who try to step on you a lot. For the most part though, this game relies on just throwing large numbers of wimpier enemies at you. There are a couple of boss battles in the game as well, but only the final boss proves to be a worthy challenge. The Prince himself controls well, if a little sluggishly. The four face buttons let him use regular or charged sword attacks, kick/push (more useful on shielded enemies), vault/jump, and roll/dodge. The medallion he wears also lets him use upgradeable elemental magic attacks which are activated with the directional buttons: he can imbue his sword with ice or fire and take out multiple enemies with each swing of the sword, surround himself in stone armor to become temporarily invincible, or knock his enemies down with a powerful wind shockwave. These and other combat and health upgrades require you using experience points/sand essence from defeated enemies. Razia also grants other abilities to the Prince's medallion. He'll be able to rewind time (just like with the Sands of Time), freeze water so he could wall-run on frozen waterfalls or pole swing on frozen water spouts, and recreate walls and floors that have been destroyed in the past and run on them to advance across normally unpassable areas (much like the new magic plate power in the Epilogue of the new Prince of Persia game).The Prince can only use each of these powers one at a time, so when he reaches some of the more challenging obstacle puzzles towards the end of the game that require you to cross lots of empty space using only the water freezing and wall/floor reappearing powers, you'll need very quick reflexes and precise timing to activate the right power at the right time so you don't fall to your death. The earlier obstacle puzzles are just moderately challenging, but there are also plenty of the good old fashioned switch pulling and lever pushing puzzles all us PoP fans are so accustomed to. The graphics to this game are actually pretty good, but the character models could have used a bit more polish, and the elemental attacks could have looked a bit flashier. So overall, this game could have been more fun if it were more consistently challenging; the first three quarters of the game range from easy to slightly challenging, then the last quarter jumps to being pretty difficult. The story was also a little predictable and could have been more fleshed out, especially with the relationship between the Prince and his brother Malik. Ratash should have also been a more involved villain. The story should have had a more significant impact on the Sands of Time trilogy as a whole, but alas, The Forgotten Sands is mostly an extra side story of the life of everyone's favorite Prince. Running at about 8 hours, only big fans of the series like me should buy this game, others will be more than happy with a simple rental. It's a good game, but it could have been better.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2011"}

{"product_name":"B007A7UJ4S","description":"","reviewerName":"VA Gamer","summary":"I didn't think they made games like this anymore","reviewText":"Ni No Kuni may be one of the all time RPG greats. The style, game world/setting, music, characters and animation sequences are done by Studio Ghibli - the folks that made the films Ponyo, Princess Mononoke, and Spirited Away amongst others.The gameplay is joyful simplicity granted depth - truly enjoyable design rarely seen in RPGs these days. The battle system is a mix of classic RPG and real time elements. It can prove complex and challenging without being overwhelming to players new to Japanese-style role playing games. The tutorial is streamlined into the opening hours of the game, easing players into the layers and nuances of the various systems. On the normal setting this game definitely grows difficult at times and demands that the player leverage their spells, allies, and a novel attribute system to succeed. Battle demands that the player cycle through his allies and familiars, executing attacks, defenses, and interruptions while exploiting the weaknesses of enemies and bosses. However, an \"easy\" difficulty setting is included for players that prefer to focus more on the story and less on combat. This setting makes battles rather forgiving and can be toggled on or off at any time.You manage an array of spells and familiars (mystical companion beasts that do your biding) in and out of combat. Familiars can be trained, outfitted, and coddled to increase their affection and effectiveness. You can explore the world to find secrets, items, and assist NPCs that have been emotionally distraught by either the game's antagonists or just daily life. It includes an in-game lore book that is fully realized, animated, and illustrated with over 300 pages of compendiums, stories, and maps. You uncover more pages within this book as you make discoveries or progress further into the story. You can progress through the story at your own pace while also engaging in a vast number of distractions such as side quests, claiming bounties on troublesome and powerful unique enemies within the open world, or crafting items, treats for your familiars, and alchemical concoctions.The graphics and animation look crisp running at 780p. You're treated to animated cut scenes created by Studio Ghibli interspersed within animated game sequences. The transitions are seamless and the in-game animation is so well crafted and realized that the line is barely blurred between the cartoons and the gameplay. Every setting is as imaginative and evocative as a Ghibli feature film. It's just stunning to behold. The music was created by Joe Hisaishi, who composed the scores for a myriad of Studio Ghibli films including Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away. When you transition to the over-world map, with its wind-swept and painted Ghibli landscapes beneath Hisaishi's score, it feels like you're navigating your way through one of their animated features.While the game play is strong and engaging, there are some classic JRPG design elements to consider. You'll find yourself backtracking often while completing quests or claiming rewards. There is a fair amount of \"grind\", that is the repetitive vanquishing of enemies as you make your way through areas or attempt to gain character levels to grow stronger. While you can save any time within towns or the open world, you can only save your game at designated locations within dungeons/dangerous zones, and these save points are often scarce. While these things may bother some players they're far less intrusive than similar elements in earlier JRPGs, and the game is generally so well realized and enjoyable that I found myself not noticing them after a while.This is easily one of the best purchases any fan of RPGs could make. If you're a fan of Studio Ghibli I think you owe it to yourself to pick this one up. If I did not already own a PlayStation 3 I would purchase one just to play this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2013"}

He's not above wasting a good guy to get at a bad guy.  So keep your youngun's away. :o)I had high hopes for this after reading the description, and boy, were they fullfilled.  I hate to say *too* many good things about a game and come off sounding easily impressed, but God of War is very, very easy to say good things about.First and formost - the fighting.  You do a lot of it and the battle engine was all but flawless.  No slowdowns or snags no matter how many enemies flooded the screen, except for one or two specific situations.  Even then it wasn't jarring.  Your weapons (you start with two swords-on-chains, then soon get a more powerful single sword, and can switch between them at will) and the attack combinations are great fun and the really useful ones are easy to remember.  Enemies (playing in \"normal\" Hero mode) are tough enough to keep you working but not so hard as to wear you down.  I'm also in love with the Greek beasties used, like minotaurs and Satyrs.  One mistake God of War *didn't* make that so, so, so many games do - kill and enemy and they're gone.  Move on a ways and come back, and they're still gone.  I hate perpetually re-spawning enemies, especially when I want to backtrack.  Thank you, thank you, makers of GOW for making the dead stay dead.You also acquire various magic attacks which come in very handy at times, and they're upgradable along with your swords.  Make sure you find the more obscure caches of red orbs to charge things up.Puzzles you must solve along the way (there are plenty of breaks from the carnage where you have to think things through) are usually solvable without resorting to a walk-through.  Just do the usual and look around carefully.As others have mentioned, graphics are great and PS2 games have really improved here.  There are lots of mechenizations that are nicely conceived and detailed, and the game keeps up with it all.Cut scenes are good and not too long, so you don't waste a lot of time watching movies when you could be playing.So what's bad?  Well, I prefer camera control and the game uses it's own, so you often find yourself running at the camera without being able to see where you're going.  But as fixed cameras go, this one is very good and almost never aggravates.The ending is a little anticlimactic, once you've defeated the final foe, but very fitting for the storyline.My biggest complaint is, once you finish the game, you unlock \"God mode,\" the hardest setting.  I don't know how anyone could possibly play this.  I couldn't get past the very first fight (on a boat against a small hoard of swordsman), for crying out loud.  Maybe I'm just lame, or there's something I don't know, but it was a disappointment.  Oh well, the replay value on normal (I also did the easiest just for fun) is right up there.If you have any doubts, don't listen to them and get this game.  It really is excellent.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2005"}

{"product_name":"B001UWGBC8","reviewerName":"Jonathan","summary":"A complete game review","reviewText":"Yes, I'm aware that the game only came out two days ago. I've had no social life since then, but after seeing those credits roll, let me tell you, it was worth it. I should let you know that while what I talk about in this review is nothing you couldn't see from the trailers, if you want to be totally surprised you might want to stop here.\"Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2\" (MUA2) picks up right where its predecessor left off, as Nick Fury leads a strike team into Dr. Doom's Latveria. As you would expect for a prologue in a Marvel universe story, it's not just a \"here's how to play the game\" - it ends up having far-reaching consequences, eventually culminating in the split over the Superhuman Registration Act and leading to the game's \"Civil War\" arc, where pro-registration forces (led by Iron Man, Mr. Fantastic and Songbird) clash with the \"anti-reg\" forces (led by Captain America, Luke Cage and Iron Fist).About 1/3 of the way into the game, the player is forced to pick a side. The side chosen dictates what levels the player goes through in Act II, unlocking some traits while locking others, limits what charcters the player can choose (as the aforementioned characters are stuck on their side; other players can play either side), and determines whether or not some heroes can perform one of their three \"heroic feats\" to get a Boost (more on this later).While the first two acts have a deeply engaging story, something happens in Act III (no, I'm not going to give it away) that will really seem to come out of left field, which makes for awesome gameplay even if it makes the story a little less plausible.Speaking of gameplay, those familiar with the \"X-Men Legends\" (XML) series and MUA1 will have no trouble adapting: it's still four characters working as a team, beating up lots of drones (though they tend to appear in much bigger groups but just a tad less frequently, which I like) and using powers, with a boss battle thrown in every now and then for good measure. The game starts with just a few characters, a la XML1, but the player rapidly gains characters through plot progression or, in the case of Jean Grey, Thor and the Hulk, through finding a certain number of \"collectible items\" throughout the game (similar to the mechanic in MUA1 used to unlock Daredevil and Black Panther but with easier-to-see pieces).Each character has three \"heroic feats\" they can accomplish (e.g. \"Beat 50 enemies after choosing anti-reg\" or \"Perform 5 perfect fusions with Human Torch\"), two of which unlock Boosts and one of which will unlock an alternate costume. Unfortunately, costumes in this game are just that - no special abilities granted depending on the costume, and only two per character. Items and the credit system are gone too. Now there are only power pips (one gained at each level and 10 hidden in-game) to level up your powers, health orbs (obvious what they do) and ability orbs, which level up the passive abilities.The biggest change one will notice is that MUA2 does away with combos and ultimate attacks and replaces them with the Fusions. The Fusion is powered up by damage dealt (both melee- and power-originated), and two can be stored at a time. These are tag-team powers whose effects vary depending on who the two players are. There are three main types: Targeted (lots of damage in a really small area), Clearing (good damage spread over a wider area), and Guided (good damage in a small area that can be maneuvered).A good example to look at is Storm. If she teams up with Juggernaut (a preorder-exclusive character who will be available as downloadable content soon), Juggernaut rips out a hunk of the ground, which Storm strikes with lightning as he drops it on someone for a Targeted Fusion. If Storm and Jean Grey do their Clearing Fusion, Jean will gather all nearby enemies into a pile, which Storm hits with lightning. And if Gambit and Storm team up, Storm forms a tornado that the player can then move around while the Ragin' Cajun throws dozens of energized cards into it.Gone, too, is the \"Portal\"/\"Extraction Point\" concept. Players can now save anytime, but cannot leave a mission midway through it. Likewise, the simulator can now only be accessed at HQ, and there are only a dozen missions. The discs are all easy to find, and each has three reward levels, just like in MUA1.Since the extraction point was how the resurrection mechanic worked in MUA1, things are a little different here. Players will occasionally find or earn a heal token. Two can be held at any given time, and using one will either resurrect a fallen character to a percentage of their health or fully heal a wounded character.The \"energy\" concept is a little different here as well, and is referred to as Stamina. Each player gets a set amount, and using powers depletes that. However, there are certain conditions for regeneration: the character has to be on solid ground and not using powers. To make up for this new requirement, the bar refills faster, and in general powers use less of the bar then they did in previous games.Powers are limited to four per character, one for each button. While RPG diehards are probably freaking out, it actually is not that bad, as the four powers given are at least three (but usually four) different styles. Captain America, for example, has a projectile attack, a bashing attack, a charging attack, and a buff. The powers are simpler to execute, with only basics, rapid taps and hold-and-release attacks, unlike in MUA1 where for some powers you had to rotate joysticks or push them forward and back. This makes controls much more intuitive.Buffs are much rarer in this game than in XML2 or MUA1, as only about a quarter of the character have independent buffs (as opposed ones liek Wolverine has, where he gets a buff after executing one of his attacks successfully), but each character instead gets six passive attributes. Two are always unlocked. Depending on which side a character chooses, two more are unlocked, and beating the game and continuing with those same characters will let you play as the other side and unlock the other two. Characters fixed on either side will get access to the last four after the split, and characters acquired after the split may or may not have all four unlocked, depending on the specific character.Another buff-like feature in the game is the Boost. These are medals that a player finds in-game or earns through heroic feats or simulator missions. Three can be equipped at one time (though they are never lost once found and can be switched out), and each does something different (or can stack with similar ones). There are so many of them, however, players may find the choice of what to equip frustrating, especially early in the game when most of the effects are minimal. This might be one area where the control freak may want to select \"auto-equip.\"The game looks beautiful - the graphics on the 360 version really shine. I love how many of the in-game cutscenes actually feature the characters you are using, as opposed to XML2 and MUA1 where all movies featured a pre-set group of characters. However, the camera is a little less intuitive than it was in MUA1, and is the main (though minor) source of irritation for me. In some areas you have only limited camera control, and with many areas with several vertical levels it became a nuisance.Another thing I miss from MUA1 is the \"team\" concept. As opposed to picking a roster of heroes, who then can receive collective benefits, we've returned to the simple combination of characters (The Fantastic Four, Forces of Nature, Femme Fatales, etc.) that get bonuses. While this is, honestly, not a big loss in the grand scheme of things, it is a bit of a downer to those who liked a little RPG with their action. Luckily, the game retains its difficulty options - there are easy, moderate and hard options out of the box, and beating the game on either of the last two will unlock a \"Legendary\" difficulty.Minor nitpicking aside, MUA2 is a stellar game and is a blast to play alone or with friends. I have yet to play the perfect video game, but this comes darn close.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2009"}

This is the Wii U why are they releasing a game with 5-10 year old graphics?.  This is the walking dead they could have done anything with it, even an open world they had so much to work with.  I find the game fun (save the tired stabby stabby when you get 1-4 zombies on you) because I am also a fan of old school shooters and this bought back some memories and the walkers are well done minus the cartooney look to some of them.  The voiceovers are ok too even though some of them are not done very well.

{"product_name":"B00D4WTO1M","description":"","reviewerName":"Bradley Corwin","summary":"Call of Duty's Next Gen Adventure","reviewText":"I have played the Call of Duty franchise since it started.  It's pretty cool to think of where it came from and where it is now.  Ghosts on the PS4 has amazing graphics.  People will tell you that it is more of the same but you know that when you are buying the game.  The thing is even though each Call of Duty has a lot of the same elements they continue to improve the competitive multiplayer, write a great campaign and add some new crazy cooperative experience.Campaign:  The story has an explosive start.  Without ruining too much, a conflict starts between the Federation (united South American countries) and the United States.  The game shows you the history of the main character to try to create a connection to him which some of the previous Call of Duty's have lacked.Competitive Multiplayer:  A big change if you played Call of Duty's on the PS3 is that the controller button layout is now more reminiscent of the Xbox (R2 is shoot instead of R1, etc).  I like this setup better.  You get to build squad points and unlock the gear that you want.  I like this system better than waiting until a certain level to receive something.  It allows you to find the gun you like and tweek it to work the best for you.  The customization isn't overkill as it has been in some games.  I like the maps and appreciate how you can snipe again.  I have never felt right sniping since MW2.  The prestige system is slightly different because you work on a new character instead of resetting your level and leveling up again.  Quick scoping seems to be gone which also makes me really happy.  I'm definitely not the best player but I still have my fun.Extinction: In this mode you are in a squad and work cooperatively to use a drill to destroy alien hives.  This mode is reminiscent of zombie modes in Black Ops.  This mode adds more immersion, you get to pick your starting pistol, soldier type (assault, tank, engineer and healer), and four things you can call it at a cost.  I like how it makes you move around and constantly getting swarmed.  So far it's been really fun; my only criticism is that it is hard to find guns on the ground sometimes but I'm sure it's just because it's new.Squad Mode: Squad mode is a great addition.  You pick any of the multiplayer maps and fight waves of computer opponents.  There are weapon and killstreak drops that you get to run around and pick up.  This is a great way to learn the maps, weapons and killstreaks without getting completely destroyed in multiplayer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0009SQF0C","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"not quite great but it's sure fun at times","reviewText":"Whatever controversy that Rockstar Games managed to bring with Grand Theft Auto series was further elevated when the infamous \"Hot Coffee\" mod was found. Bully is supposed to be slightly more tamer until you notice just how much levels it shares in common with GTA. There's no guns in the games, or deaths but you can do a host of other things that to me doesn't seem like a big deal, yet I'm sure parents and conservatives will have huge issues with it. Is it a good game though? Well there's something there but it doesn't reach the heights of what they did before.Story: You play Jimmy, a 15 year old who's been booted out of every other school. You're sent to Bullworth Academy and everybody has a reason to want to beat you up or ignore you. Pretty soon you'll find yourself making some headway with the various cliques, making you a more popular student in the progress.Graphics: Very well done. We can't all expect sharp-as-hell resolutions like Final Fantasy games or superb art direction like Shadow of the Colossus yet at the same time, this world is very fluid and quite detailed. Only real problems is that the game has a tendency to have big environments on screen so in some races and such you'll end up crashing because of the camera angle as well as less obvious turns and alleys.Sound/Music: Although I wouldn't buy the soundtrack, it's certainly a very memorable soundtrack. A playful tone throughout, some of the themes actually reminded me of what Danny Elfman would compose for Edward Scissorhands or Nightmare Before Christmas. While there's no real noticeable voice acting, everybody is top-notch and helps makes the funny and at times ludicrous story shine even more.Gameplay: As anyone who's played San Andreas knows, there was a lot of gameplay elements that were noticeably different. From exercising in gyms to flight school to DDR-like contests, there was a significant increase in gameplay types. Same here, starting first with the classes. You have classes like Art (where you gotta make boxes on a canvas while avoiding enemies) Chemistry (DDR-style), English (word scramble) Gym (wrestling or dodgeball) and Photography. Only main issue I have is that you can't tell what the class is at times so you think it's in one building but then find you have to run clear across campus to get to the Gym.Instead of advancing weaponry, you instead learn new fighting moves. From takedowns to combos to roundhouses, it helps add some different flavor to the fights. Of course you have missions which range from fetch quests to protectors to races and some students ask you for a certain errand. Some range from protecting nerds get from one place to another while others want you to break into a loved one's locker and plant a gift. The one major complaint I have is 2 things: the time and the truant prefects and officers. Time moves rather quickly and certain missions are pains because they take longer than they should. One missions I literally had to give up because I was near the 2:00 AM pass out time. The other is while on missions, the aforementioned prefects try to get you either back into whatever class you have or your dorm. It can get incredibly frustrating trying to do a mission when you're constantly being chased around. Plus you can be on the way to your class, and the prefects try to catch you anyway.Is it a fun game? I'll say this: it's incredibly easy to into. Despite a rather long feeling first chapter, after that things ramp up and you'll find yourself playing it more often. Only thing is certain things will annoy you greatly so it's kind of a good play with frustration thrown in.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2006"}

The people of Haven City have grown to distrust Jak's dark powers, and as rumors boil of Jak's ties with Krew and Kor, the city blames Jak for its current woeful circumstances. When the palace is destroyed by a surprise Metal Head attack, even Ashelin cannot protect Jak as the High Council's power broker, Count Veger, forces Jak into banishment to the desolate Wasteland. Jak is flown to the harsh island and dumped. With Daxter and Pecker bravely by his side, the three begin their next adventure where the battle for the city has just begun.Five times the size of Haven City, the Wasteland is a desert environment with multiple areas including mines and a volcano. Given the enormity and variance in terrain, vehicles play a large role as off-road transportation is introduced, fueled by a true-to-life physics engine. With a rugged new look and suited with armor, Jak is also equipped with an arsenal of new weapons with upgradeable mods that enable players to increase their firepower and enjoy the freedom to strategize and activate their arsenal at any time.As Jak has been exposed to Light Eco, players can now experience Jak's magnificent transformation to Light Jak.

The one area where I find the game lacking is that certain aspects have made the game a bit on the easy side, but I will get into that.Story: 4/5-Truthfully, the story is ok.  I find the Desmond part of it so dumb and pointless.  Also the part in the beginning where you have to play as Desmond is aggrivatng as hell.  In essence Desmond's story is that he is an ancestor of Enzio and is being chased by the Templar, he has to defeat the templar by using a virtual realty system to overthorw the Borgia in Rome (that is wher eyou play as Enzio).  Enzio's story is really good especially when they start delving into the hidden missions regarding his past via the hidden Christina missions.Gameplay: 5/5-The gameplay is great, smooth and extremely elegant.  There are tons of missions, all of them related to the game and related to your life as an assassin (unlike Prototype where they are tedious side quests).  Most of the missions are not overly difficult and are pretty staight forward though many of them really require to strategize if you want to get a 100% completion for the mission.  Many of the side quests revolve around assassinating Borgia affiliates who are terrorizing the people of Rome.  Additionally, there are 15 Borgia towers where there is heavy enemy influence, you must kill the local captain who is a beefed up guard and burn down his tower in order to remove the influence.  If primary quests are in Borgia influence areas it is in your best interest to destroy the tower first or the missions will be a nightmare.The weapons are great especially the heavy swords.  My favorite weapon is the hidden blades, I find them the most effective.  There are swords, axes, maces, a cross-bow, a gun, poison and blades, all of which are exceptionally useful.  In my opinion the addition of the gun and cross-bow as well as their ease of use have made the game way too easy as I can just stand on a roof and snipe guards from a distance without being seen.Additionally, there is the inclusion of you being able to hire help from 3 distinct classes.  I find the mercenaries make the game too easy as you can take them with you into a mission and have them attack the guards while you do their thing, allowing you not to be detcted at all or allowing you to peform executions whaile the guards are busy fighting.  The inclusion of these mercenaries makes even the most difficult Borgia captain a breeze.Finally, through the game as you take down towers, you are able to rebuild Rome.  As you buy blacksmith's, art shops, banks, and doctors, you make money and you are bale to buy new items.  It is easy to spam this system, which as you buy banks, you make money at a super fast pace and can buy as many bullets or arrows as you want.Graphics/Visiuals: 5/5 - This is easy, the graphics and visuals are gorgeous.  You are running around 1500s Rome.  They producers made the city as close to historically correct as possible.  The game graphics are nearly flawless, smooth and there is minimal glitchyness.  Thank god, the load times are minimal, that drives me nuts!Multiplayer: 5/5-  The multiplayer is a real party.  I love it!  You go around killing other players either by stealth or brute force.  It is addictive.  Although it can get repetitive after a while, you really get addicted to it.Overall, this game is phenominal and a must buy.  Certain aspects make it slightly too easy, but that is rectified by the amount there is to do and the sheer insane number of missions.  Also, blowing through a mission may be easy, but getting full completion can be agrivatingly difficult, that definately makes up for it.Definately buy it!!  I love it, you will too!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2012"}

This one is no different.  What sucks you into the game is that it's non-linear.  I can actually play the same mission different ways.  You don't have to accomplish the objectives in specific order and use a specific path.What I don't like is when your team mates get \"stuck\".  For example, you tell them to go downstairs, but when one of them does, he seems to be 'stuck' in the same place and he can't move past it.  It's bad collision detection I guess is what they call it.  Also, you can't shoot out the lights like you could in the first one.  This is a very cool thing to do to stay quiet.  I'm on the last mission and it's going to be great!!!  I'm trying to finish each mission with an A rating which I have done so far.  I hope this unlocks something cool.Anyway, buy this game and play it before Socom 3 is released.  Then you'll have a great time playing it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2005"}

Once you dig into Killer7 you're swimming through a plot of deep politics and a weird paranormal setting. You are seven of the Smiths who are hired assassins for the government...or so it seems.The gameplay is very different from what you're used to. You press A and the game is \"on rails\". You choose which way you want to go by hold the analog stick in a direction and selecting the destination with A. This makes things a lot easier and lets the gamers concentrate on the puzzle solving and story. Use you the characters to solve the puzzles such as Kaede slitting her wrists to spray blood everywhere and call Harman Smith's ex wife to blast open invisible barricades...yeah I know WTF?! You can use Coyote to jump up high places and Mask De Smith to blast open cracked walls.Some of the puzzles involve getting a certain amount of objects, deciphering messages etc. You kill the Smiles by hitting weak points on them and there are dozens of variants. You have to hold down R and then scan with L and shoot their weak points. The voice acting is top notch and the graphics have a great cell shaded style to them. It's really hard to explain this game unless you play it. The game sports unique boss fights and is a perfect length of 12-14 hours.

Even if I don't know what the heck I'm doing I still have a blast doing it!!!  Breaking LEGO stuff is a ton of fun.One thing that kept this game from five stars was its simplicity.  This game is probably the easiest game I've ever played!  If you have the time, you can probably beat Episode 1 in an hour, and Star Wars freaks in 45 minutes (without all collectibles).  However, to truly \"beat\" the episodes, you need to fill up each chapter's True Jedi Bar by collecting coins.  Don't worry, if you cqan't collect tham all on your first time, you can do Free Play Mode to finish it.  Beat each Episode to get Episode 4.  The game also gets very repetitive.An excellent feature that this game has is the drop-in/drop-out co-op mode.  Since all the chapters have multiple characters, instead of swapping between characters, you and your friend can play as different characters to beat the chapter together.  It really is a unique feature.LEGO Star Wars is an extremely fun game that anyone can enjoy.  I hope they make more LEGO movie games!!!!!!!!!!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2008"}

But fans ofGTA IIIshould note that  whileState of Emergencycontains adult themes and extremely violent  gameplay, that's pretty much where the similarities end. WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player. In spite of these flaws, the game remains  addictive and fun.

You have ground to ground, ground to air, air to ground, air to air, sea to sea, sea to land, and sea to air combat. There is simply no other game on the market that allows for this kind of combat, except for Grand Theft Auto, but that is a more arcadish, and 3rd person game. This game truly defines what a Battlefield is all about.In CoD you have to earn a killstreak to get helicopters or planes to come to the battle, and they are all controlled by AI. In battlefield you can be riding in a Humvee across miles and miles of baron wasteland, then hop over into a chopper along with a couple other teammates, you can jump out at any given time and parachute onto land. You can also have sea battles, riding across an ocean to get to the enemy island.I encourage anyone to pick this game up, even if you are a CoD only fan. What you can only see in the cutscenes of a Call of Duty game, you can EXPERIENCE first hand in Battlefield. MW3 comes out in two weeks, let's see if it's the exact same thing as all the other CoD games with just different guns and maps.If you are into realistic battles, realistic environments, and realistic teamplay, pick up battlefield. If you are more into fake junk like quick scoping across a map with no bullet drop, or stabbing a guy with a knife to kill him while he is spraying bullets at you, by all means, pick up MW3, we don't want you in our Battlefield community.To my Battlefield brothers, Hooah!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2011"}

The maps are good for the mosy part, the new over the top gore is very much enjoyed, the increased hordes are kind of annoying when your stuck in one spot chewing up your ammo surrounded and can't move.  The tanks are not as cool in this one as they were in L4D1 and they don't look as good either, but still ok I guess.  The suspence/terror is just not there anymore due to the insane $hitstorm of enemies all the time non stop.  The spittler and charger are decent new enemies, and the game features good new weapons.

L4D 2 has great new features like boomer bile jars, fire ammo, explosive ammo and laser scopes.  The characters in this game are not as cool, interesting, memorible or fun to play as as the origional four.  Maybe sometime we could get a mod or DLC to play as them or have them meet up with the new characters, that would be awesome.

I will say that Heavy Rain is a wonderful interactive experience unlike any other game I have played. The comments about how this is more of a interactive movie than a game can honestly be made. You interact thru series of button and joystick moves. You have a standard walk that you can do and can pretty much explore any level thoroughly. During the action sequences you have to perform the button and joystick mashing in a timely manner. Failing to do so can result in extending the action scene and your character being damaged in the process. One of the most amazing things about this game is the expanse of actions you can do. This is the first game where I have ever actually changed and fed a crying baby...LOL.

The controls are terrible.  The camera angle is annoying and the levels are very uninspiring.  Then you have this interaction with other humans that is just useless.  You choose certain sentences and that is supposed to alter the game somewhat.  All it does is use up precious game space on the disc.  Utterly useless!!!The music, is beautiful.  But these games are known for their music.  The graphics are nice, when you can see them.  The game is way too dark.  I know it supposed to be dark as you are in a tomb, or cavern, but it doesn't have to be that dark to where you can't see certain objects or other nuances.I also judge a game on how I can just sit and play without reading. In this instance, I had to consult the manual because the controls weren't intuitive.  Like the auto-aim and manual aim.  Some of the \"bosses\" were so lame.  At first you think it's going to be a challenge.  But, you try and try and try, and you can't beat it.  Then you do the unthinkable.

The game combines elements from Hollywood action thrillers with the latest in video game technology to deliver a highly original gameplay experience.","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"Definitely not Crash Bandicoot","reviewText":"Max Payne is a cinematic, film-noir type game that mixes you standard action and intrigue. The story is as cliched as they come: a rogue cop framed for murder must fight against incredible odds to survive. This is from the same people who made Grand Theft Auto, the PS2's crowning title. Here is my impressions of Max Payne.The Pros:1. Cinematics. The story sequences come in two forms: as an on-screen graphic novel, and full motion sequences. They highlight the important points in the game quite well. Despite what others say, I don't think the voice acting is that bad. Believe me, I've heard much worse. The cinematic cut-scenes make the game much more enjoyable.2. The details. What else would you expect from a PS2 game? The graphics are similar to Grand Theft Auto III, in that the city, the buildings, the rooms, and the enemies are very intricately detailed. Unlike GTA3, that is almost no pop-up in the background, and the rendering is amazing. But it is the little details that will strike you. You can turn lights on and off, move boxes, and even make drinks come out of the coke machine in the hotel (this is early on in the game). Note that I have layed both the PS2 and Xbox versions, and have noticed no difference.3. The automatic save. There is nothing more frustrating than getting killed before you've had a chance to save your game. At the beginning of each new segment, your game is saved. It does the work for you. I like that feature a lot.4. The A.I. The enemies are tougher to beat here, since the difficult levil changes according to your progress. If you are having a hard time in the game, the enemies will lighten up, slightly. But if you are having a ball, they will get tougher on you. They are also very good at evading your attacks. The improved A.I. (artificial intellegence, in case you didn't know) gives the game more challenge.5. Storyline. Though it has it's ups and downs, the story is classic film-noir. I didn't get Max Payne looking for an innovative storyline (though I wouldn't have complained if it was). It is a good, old-fashioned caper story.The Cons:1. Loading time. It seems that Max Payne has a longer than normal loading time, wich can be very frustrating if you get killed off a lot in the beginning. Since the game is so well detailed, I can only assume that is why it takes longer to load. The game takes about 2 minutes to get the game up and running, so patience is a vitrue you must possess to play Max Payne.2. Control. Though this becomes less of a con as you get used to it, the controls are tough. Unlike most games, Max Payne requires use of BOTH analog sticks, so it take a bit of getting used to. People who have played Silent hill before will probably know what I mean. Also, the targeting system is tricky in the begining, since all you have to aim with is a white dot on screen.3. Sometimes you cannot skip through the cinematic cut-scenes, which is frustrating is you get killed and have to sit through the same bits over and over again.I bought Max Payne on the recommendation of a friend who is pickier than I am when it comes to video games. I am very impressed with Max Payne, and am now addicted to it. Some games are like that. Anyone who liked GTA3 or Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty will love Max Payne.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2002"}

{"product_name":"B000G7PMXC","reviewerName":"Stephen M. Lerch","summary":"A review for 2009 point of view on this game","reviewText":"I just recently purchased the original Rainbow Six Vegas, 3 years after it's initial release, and seeing how most of the top reviews are from '06-'07, I figured it would be a nice change of pace to give this a review from today's point of view.The price Amazon is currently charging for this game is a knockout steal; much lower than MSRP. At the current pricing, about $9 lower than MSRP, if you're thinking of buying the game, just do it. If your only criteria to owning the game is that it needs a lower price, just get it. If you think it's a game you'll enjoy, at this price it's definitely worth it.The graphics, compared to games today, look dated. Character models lack detail seen in today's games, but for a game released in '06, this would have looked awesome. Some of the flight sequences while arriving at your destination are amazing. Unfortunately when you're actually on the ground things don't look anywhere near as good. But again, be a little more lenient in your graphical requirements and you should be able to enjoy this game despite the \"dated\" graphics.Sound work is very good as well. I'm playing with surround sound and you hear people walking behind you and gun fire sounds as realistic as you game released today. There is some music there, but it's in the background. It never really gets obnoxious or in your face. The only sound effects I find annoying are the one armed bandits in the casinos are always making noise and that, I suppose, is authentic Vegas.Gameplay is typical first person shooter with a Gears of War style \"hide behind an object and blind fire\" mechanic. Blind fire in RS: Vegas, however, is aptly named as actually pulling a shot off and killing an enemy in this way is difficult. This mechanic, of course, doesn't seem to be \"blind\" fire for the computer, as it seems even on the normal difficulty setting enemies can be DEADLY accurate with blind fire, sometimes frustratingly so.Multiplayer isn't bad either. There are a ton of options available, which includes Co-Op via Live (co-op can be done local split screen as well). My only gripe with playing the co-op story mode is that it lacks the story. You can play through the levels together, but when you would normally be receiving information in the chopper or wherever, there is a prolonged silence. Take the first flight sequence in the helicopter. You have someone in the passenger seat, briefing you on what is going on and what you are getting into. In co-op multiplayer you sit in the chopper with... nothing. The other gripe with co-op multiplayer is if everyone in the party dies, you start at the beginning of the mission. In the beginning this isn't so bad as the missions aren't TOO difficult, but later in the game this can be an exercise in frustration given how the end sections of a mission ratchet up the amount of enemies coming after you.One big complaint I have is enemy pop up. I will play on-line with my father in co-op, we will completely clear a room and move on... only to occasionally have enemies pop up in the rooms we just cleared, killing us from behind. I've actually witnessed enemies popping into existence. I would prefer a set amount of enemies on a map in standard locations, however Ubisoft opted for random appearance and MOSTLY random location of enemies.Overall I think that this game for $20, for those who aren't too graphic obsessed with games and enjoy first person shooters, is a decent choice. It wouldn't be my first choice in aging first person shooters (I may give that honor to GRAW 2 instead), but it is a solid choice.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"W. freeman","summary":"More Of The Same, with some updates","reviewText":"UNLESS YOU just want new MULTIPLAYER, i don't recommend this game, if so, go for it!! So while Modern Warfare was really groundbreaking for it's time, i have to agree with most reviews i've read or seen that it is becoming \"stale\". Not much has really changed with the game, only the graphics have been bumped up (just a tad) from MW2. A bit better textures, more varied sound, a few new psychics, and of course new better looking weapons make for a pretty enjoyable experience. However the only things with games like this and BF3 is that there is only a certain amount of innovation you can keep adding to a war game. Or just first person shooters in general. After a while as with any game, you get tired of looking at a gun, or your hand with a knife in it. At least i do. I actually prefer platformers, or something a bit more in depth like Elder Scrolls when it comes to first person. That doesn't mean that MW3 isn't fun, especially the multiplayer which is why 90% of people buy it in the first place. I played the campaign for about an hour, and it's really nothing new under the sun. And from what i've heard it's only 5 hours long, guess we'll see. So yes this really is a lot like the last one, and to me it's basically just another war game, even though i know i'll get lynched by \"fans\" for saying that. I'm a 36 year old man, and my gaming time is limited, so i'm not a troll (whatever they really are) or some little 15 year old who sits for 18 hours a day playing, who has no life. I'm a casual gamer.I did grow up with video games from their inception, so that's what still makes me a fan today. So i've gotten to see everything from Atari, Nintendo, to PS, Sega Dreamcast to 360 and PS3, but i'm more of a PC gamer. So in conclusion the game itself is still a MW game, with a few slight differences, that being the graphics, new maps(which mostly consist of cities and a jungle here and there), for multiplayer. I got it strictly for multiplayer, and have only done that for about an hour as well. But it was very fast paced and a lot of fun, except for all the little kids getting mad when they go down. The controls and aiming are very spot on, and killing does seem easier and smoother than the last game. Melee attacks also seem easier and less sloppy than the previous two games. So as far as multiplayer it's still one of the funnest games around. That being said from what i've played it's really not a step forward or backward, it's just another step. MW with a 3 in it. BF3 may be a lot prettier, but it's basically the same as well. Even great games like Drakes Fortune are seeming to run out of ideas, but honestly how many ways can you sing the same old song. Here's an idea, bring back a game like Redneck Rampage revamp it,Boogerman, or Blackthorne (these are computer, and nintendo classics btw) something not so serious and definitely different. I like these games for what they are, but nothing more. War is war, and shooting is shooting, after a while your thinking wow, lets race.Pros-Graphics improved a bit, good multiplayer, new weapons are a treat, small new psychics features.Cons-Same ole story, uninteresting dictator(again), only 5 hour single player, it's like every other war game, only with great multiplayer. Which i knew.Btw. If you post a response and it's negative, i will only respond with. Because I Like The Multiplayer. Because I Like The Multiplayer.

Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"It's good!","reviewText":"I put off buying Nier due to the lukewarm reviews, but I tried it when I was betwen other \"must-have\" games and I really enjoyed it. As far as I am concerned it is a successful and thought-provoking game.Nier is from Square-Enix, but it's nothing like Final Fantasy or any other games from that tribe. The closest comparison I would make would be \"Ico\". More on that later. To keep it simple, you play in Nier as one character, who is searching for a cure for his sick daughter. Nier's world is rural, with a peasant-style village, open plains and rivers and lakes. You run around the world in real time, going between lost temples, other settlements, deserts and caves, following clues that might lead you to saving the life of your daughter. Although classed as an RPG, these elements are very much in the background - Nier does level up but you'll never know when he's about to as there are no EXP points in-screen (although you can examine the menu to see them) and no numerical health bar or hit-points seen in attacking. There are various weapons, you can buy or find better ones, and you can learn magic, although all the magic is for attacking, there are no healing or support spells. Fighting is done real time - enemies can clearly be seen on the screen, and the fighting style is pretty easy to master, very simple combos done with one button plus a few linked to jumping, evading and blocking.So let me address the good and bad points that a lot of reviewers have pointed out - first that this game is ugly to look at. Well, I would not say that. It is not richly detailed, I'll admit, but it has a certain style. Colours are muted, landscapes are pale and hazy, and this was one of the first aspects that really reminded me of \"Ico\", as architecture is huge and monolithic, open spaces look chilly and lonely, and even the sunlight looks fragile. I found the look of the game very appealing. Nier himself is an ugly brute, mind you, with a really bad haircut, outfit and caveman-style face, but eventually I became fond of him. Other characters are more out-there (namely Kaine and Emil), so there is variety.I'll also say that the battles in this game are great fun. The common enemies are featureless, wispy and transparent - again very much like in \"Ico\". The boss fights are great fun, all have a theme and some really cool attacks, although the pink spheres that get fired at you seem to get recycled a bit too heavily - is this the only type of magic in this world? But Nier's fighting style suited me very well, although I chose two types of magic attack pretty early on (you can only assign two at a time), and pretty much ignored all the others.I will agree with one other criticism though: Nier is full of sidequests that are brain-numbingly boring. Find a flower, find a missing husband, find a lost jewel for villager A, go ask villager B if they have the right materials to build a water-wheel for villager C, who then asks you to take them to villager D to build it...I got really tired of this stuff, and a lot of those villagers were not close to each other, I can tell you! Some quests are also nigh-on impossible due to the rare drop frequency of the required ingredients, and add to that the only reward for them is usually money (which you don't really need) rather than opening new areas to explore, and you have a recipe for frustration. Do them at your own risk, I say.So lastly, the good points about Nier are the story, which is very serious and quite touching on several occasions, the graphics - which I liked, and the music, which is excellent. It's a bewildering game to play a lot of the time - it has a prologue set in a burned-out city centre that NEVER appears again in the rest of the game (you do eventually find out why), companions who include a floating, talking book, a ninja-style woman in her underwear, and a...well, I don't know how to describe Emil! The ending does have a few great twists, and there are also other endings to discover if you can face playing more. I enjoyed Nier and I think it is well worth a purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2011"}

Its complex plot and setting, in conjunction with exciting gameplay and absolutely breathtaking design, makes for a game that initially seems good. However, the unfolding story and various mediocre levels take the wind out of its sails enough to turn it from a great game to a middling game.Nier is a fantasy action game with a few RPG elements. It's based largely in the \"beat-em-up\" genre; as the titular character, you fight through huge crowds of enemies with swords, spears, and magic. Nier handles extremely well, and has some really satisfying acrobatic dodges and combo attacks. The game's spells are one of its centerpoints - rather than being distinct spells with different elements and so on, the spells use the same generalized energy but manifest it in different forms. For example, one spell creates giant lances of energy, while another shoots out homing blasts. One spell creates a large wall, while another creates a doppelganger of the main character to strike at enemies. The spells work extremely well for their own purposes, and feel like a natural extension of the swordplay in most cases rather than being entirely separate.However, action isn't Nier's only draw. A few dungeons switch things up; one dungeon is highly puzzle-centric (by putting you in rooms with certain restrictions and forcing you to work around them), while another is actually a text adventure. A few dungeons, on the other hand, are monumentally boring - essentially just hallways full of monsters to fight through, with no defining features or charm. This is made worse by the fact that you visit each dungeon at least twice over the course of the game. While normally it would be okay to just have a bunch of combat rooms, the fact that it's such an unavoidable slog pushes it over the brink to be fully annoying. Still, the few cool dungeons and memorable boss fights make up for it.The game's design, including its graphics and sounds, are probably its strongest point. The game takes place in a far-off post-apocalyptic world, where civilization has started to regrow in some capacity. The maps and dungeons are littered with the remnants of the old world, from conspicuous escape pods used as housing to giant wrecked railroad bridges. Many of the areas have a very \"Shadow of the Colossus\" feel to them, combining monumental structures and areas with an overwhelming sense of emptiness or abandonment. The music helps foster this feeling with the use of ominous choruses and orchestras. While in technical terms the graphics aren't great, the presence of \"jaggies\" makes it seem in some ways closer to games like Ico or SOTC. The spell effects, at least, are great, and the design of the locations, characters, and enemies is enough to overcome technical limitations or failings.Of course, Nier has its bad points, as well. In addition to the aforementioned slog dungeons, a lot of the quests and story advancements are just \"run from here to point x\". While the quests are fairly interesting, story-wise, in gameplay terms they amount to an annoying amount of running back and forth delivering stuff to people. In addition, the story starts out strong and intriguing, but generally fails to deliver in later areas. Supplemental documents answer some questions (especially about how the game relates to Cavia's previous game, \"Drakengard\"), but overall the plot twists seem eye-rolling and overwrought.On the whole Nier is a fun action game that it's easy to get caught up in. The incredible delivery of the game, however, is marred by repetition and padding, and so the experience as a whole is somewhat tainted. Still, it was an enjoyable game overall, and definitely worth at least one playthrough.Rating: 7/10We bought our copy of Nier with our own money from a gaming store.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003PHLTDC","description":"","reviewerName":"Dustin D. Smith \"Duster\"","summary":"Vanquish... A breath of fresh air in this dank world of ever occurring run-of-the-mill shooters.","reviewText":"Let me get right down to it, there is a lot more to Vanquish if gamers actually take the time and give it a fair chance and see it for what it truly is...A huge, daring leap in this genre of gaming; which has succeeded beyond my expectations.In this Call Of Duty and Halo obsessed multiplayer age of gaming, a lot of stuff is starting to get really dull when it comes to the shooter genre. All the multiplayer obsessed gamers have forgotten where games originated from. Games used to be about a great SINGLE PLAYER experience where you could sit back and enjoy everything without being cursed at and being called a \"noob\" when you mess up.Some people are hating on this game because it has no multiplayer. Just because a game is a shooter does not mean it needs multiplayer to be successful at providing a stellar gaming experience. I look at this game and praise the creators for going outside the \"standard\" for modern day shooters. I also compare this game to titles such as Devil May Cry, Ikaruga, or any type of score keeping game. It encourages the (determined) gamers out there to replay the campaign over and over again to challenge themselves and see how great they can be and achieve the highest scores. If you have ever played Ikaruga (a top down space shooter) you will understand what I'm talking about. There are bullets flying everywhere, intricate level design, sharp graphics, a level of strategy involved, big badass bosses to kill, and knowing that you are going to die a few times (or a ton of times) to finally become proficient at winning.Vanquish is not a toy that you play with once and toss aside. It is meant to be played again and again to fully appreciate its beauty. If you consider yourself a hardcore gamer looking for a great challenge and looking to return to the roots of gaming, you will agree with alot of the views I have on this excellent game. That being said, I will get to the main points on why Vanquish is a must play title.STORYIf Vanquish has a flaw, it is the story. It is your typical good vs evil with some mediocre characters that you do not really connect to, but some of the stuff they say is quite funny or rather cliche depending on your view. The game knows it is over the top and doesn't take anything too seriously so it sort of makes sense. I could care less about a solid Triple A story so this flaw does not bother me at all. If you are going into Vanquish looking for a deep story; just go play Heavy Rain...Vanquish is an action junkie's game.GRAPHICS/SOUNDWOW...this has got to be the prettiest game I have seen in 2010, everything is so crisp. Your character's suit has so much detail and moving parts I literally spent about 2 minutes just moving the camera around looking at every little detail. Environments look amazing too, there would be a lot to look at, but take your eyes off the action too long and you're dead. Your robot enemies all look superb. They move how you would expect robots to move, just picture one of the latest Transformer movies and that will tell you exactly how detailed they are; ranging from the smallest to the biggest of the robots they are all great. Your enemies look even better when they are being blown up, explosions are fantastic and the larger enemies' explosions are like the 4th of July; all kinds of colors and sparks fly in the air and slowly dim to nothingness, leaving only a tattered broken shell of what they were. If you love big explosions and bursting gunfire you will love Vanquish, every sound is crisp and never sounds out of place.GAMEPLAY- Most important part of a game to me.This game is not about hiding behind cover and taking pot shots at your foes. Cover is best used for seconds at a time to either recover your health or plan your next attack. Stay behind cover too long and it will eventually be destroyed by a bigass robot. Slow motion or \"bullet time\" has always seemed cliche in games that just tack it on as an after thought, but it actually works in Vanquish. When everything is going so fast all the time, it is excellent to slow down time and line up those headshots with the sniper rifle or vault over some cover, slow down time in mid-air and blast a robot in the face with a shotgun, that is the definition of badass right there. When you are near death, time will slow automatically and this gives you a chance to retreat and let your health regenerate as well as give you time to think about your next move. Vanquish is all about speed and elegant flow of combat. The speed comes in the form of your suit's boosting ability. You can boost all over the battlefield for a limited amount of time before your suit overheats. This ability really gives a whole new dimension of gameplay and allows you to retreat quickly or go in guns a blazin'.This game is actually not just a mindless shooter, but requires some strategy, if your going to boost up to that big robot and melee his ass across the battlefield, you better hope there are no other bots around because once you melee, your suit is overheated and you cannot boost away from danger. Some may say this is cheap, I say it just makes things more interesting and doesn't make you so powerful that every battle is easy. Weapons range from standard assault rifles, a shotgun, sniper rifle, missile launcher, grenades. There are a few unique weapons too, buy the game if you want to see them. You technically have one weapon, but here is the best part...It literally transforms into whatever weapon you select. Right before your eyes you see your shotgun morph into a sniper rifle or your assault rifle morph into a rocket launcher. The animations for these transformations are the coolest thing I have ever seen in a game and is great to see because I have grown tired of watching my character constantly swap guns off of his hip or back or see them appear from nowhere *cough* Grand Theft Auto...excuse me... Overall the gameplay is superb. And those looking for REPLAY VALUE: there are challenge missions that you unlock which are basically like Gears of War's Horde mode where waves of enemies come after you, the challenge is to kill them all as fast as you can with only one life...and they literally are a challenge because they get really hard on the later waves. Hardcore gamers rejoice!CONTROLSYou can't have great gameplay without great controls and for the speed that Vanquish moves, you surprisingly never feel out of control. It may take a good half hour until you grasp the control scheme, but once you do, you will be killing robots left and right and feeling like a badass while you do it.Vanquish is a title not to be missed, I really hope people do not overlook this game. This is a hardcore shooter/action fan's dream come true. Give Vanquish a thorough play-through and I dare you not to crack a smile when you feel like a god killing all those robots in such a stylish destructive force.NEW: I bought the triple weapons pack for vanquish. The three new guns are awesome! They just add that much more to an already near-perfect third person shooter experience. The download is pretty cheap too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2010"}

This version will have new weapons, veteran and rookie drivers, weather effects, and night driving.","reviewerName":"M. Donnelly","summary":"Reevaluation in hindsight","reviewText":"I originally reviewed this when I was a few years younger, so the review didn't look very well-written at all.  My comments are still the same, however.  If you liked the other Twisted Metal games, you will likely enjoy this one.  Lack of online play and a bit of a difficulty imbalance are the only things really keeping this from being a 5-star game, in my eyes.  The controls are a bit difficult to get used to, in terms of using them with finesse, at least.  One of the boss fights is nearly infuriating with difficulty, while the last boss of the game seems a bit too easy, in comparison.Judging by current standards, on the brink of the next generation consoles becoming the standard, it is hard to rate it based on technological standpoints, but in its time it was superior.  In addition, the style of the storyline is very interesting, and worth looking at.  I played through God of War, and in some ways one of the cutscenes from God of War reminded me of the style used in this game.So ultimately, if you like the style of game, definitely get it.  If you don't like the gameplay typically, you won't like this one, as it has a similar feel to the others in the series.  However, this is not a must-buy, by any means, in my opinion.  I could have lived without it, despite it being a 4-star game, quality-wise.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2001"}

WOW! The Wii Fit was a fun way to work out, and kept me motivated. Next, I purchased Gold's Gym Cardio Workout. WOW! I was sore all the time, and my arms look more muscular. Finally, I purchased EA Sports Active. I've been training on a consistent basis, and I must say I'm getting a great workout. I canceled my membership at the gym, and don't have to leave the house and fight traffic. The Wii as a fitness tool really delivers.As for the games, that's why I own a PS3. Wii games are mostly geared towards families, and I can say that their games are very responsibly made. As a veteran, I wouldn't want my child playing PS3 war games, because the bottom line is that war isn't pretty. Adolescents shouldn't be exposed to this glorified violence.

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Franke","summary":"Its a hit and a miss!","reviewText":"The Wii is \"next gen\" with its wiimote (motion sensing), and is very fun to play because of the motion sensing it has in its games.  It makes you feel like your actually doing something with a game besides mashing buttons with your thumbs.  You can also get a bit of exercise with some of the games and it gets your butt off the couch.On the other hand, the Wii has terrible graphics when compared to the Xbox 360 or PS3.  The graphics are not \"next gen\" and are comparable to the Gamecube.  All that said, the Wii can be very fun though, like Wii sports for example...for a few hours...When I was playing it, I just kept thinking, \"I can't wait until they make these sports games with better graphics and better gameplay\".  You aren't given the option to field in the Wii baseball for example, which was disapointing.With having and playing a Wii, another problem is going to be the height of which your TV is to your eyes.  When I stood up to play the Wii Sports, (which you really need to stand up to play to get the fun out of it) I was looking down a little at my TV, because my TV is not eye level when I stand up, which caused me to have my neck pretty much bent down the whole time I was playing, which was flat out annoying and uncomfortable.  I'll have to somehow prop up my TV, so it sits higher up.  What a pain...As a gamer, just having the Wii, doesn't cut it.  Thats why I own a Xbox 360.  I want \"next gen\" graphics and a very good on-line play setup that the Wii lacks!  Wii has on-line play, but compared to Xbox's \"Live\", its extremely primitive.3 Stars Overall, for being a very fun console and the wiimote motion sensing is very intuative and new for a game system, but the Wii is lacking \"next gen\" graphics, and does not have a very good on-line play setup like Xbox's \"Live\" or PS3's \"Home\".

You play an interstellar prince, and it's up to you to replace all the stars in the sky.  To do this, you use your Katamari to collect all kinds of items on Earth, and roll it around to do so.  You start off picking up small items, like screws and small candies, and gradually work your way up to collecting bigger (and bigger) items.  Like I said, you have to play it to believe it.  You control your Katamari by using both of the analog sticks to move and roll around.  While this takes some time to learn and get used to (there is a helpful tutorial before the game starts), once you get it down you'll find it hard to put the controler down.  Katamari Damacy is insanely fun and undeniably charming with its interesting approach in the graphics department, and some pretty funny dialogue from the King of the Cosmos.

Andrews Jr.","summary":"Love it and Hate it","reviewText":"I've been playing Tekken ever since the first came out when I was a kid. I've always had fun with it, and I considered myself really good. Until I found out about the Juggles in Tekken 6. I don't ever remember Juggles, but it's to the point where you can't get one hit in before 95 percent of your energy is gone.  On that note, I still love the game for the characters and the CGI endings. There is no side story like in Tekken 6, but it's replaced with a \"training mode\", that is somewhat helpful, but other time impossible to get a perfect score. (I can't get out a throw to safe my life, lol).My biggest gripe is the difficulty mode. I put it on easy to get through the game fast to get the endings, and just to practice some other toons. Well, let me tell you, it isn't EASY. It's like your playing some Expert online. Especially the boss. You like a ball getting juggled by a clown.  I'm no Noob by any means, and I pretty good, but I still have trouble with the last boss. I read there is a patch to fix this, so if you get this after October 8th, there should be a easier mode than easy they say. If you play Online you'll need a Online pass, but it comes with the game. (Just in case people don't know, the Online pass is like DLC. Once you enter the code you always own it. There is a lot of people complaining about this, because they don't understand)The matches do seem to take a while to get one going, and the games saves EVERYTHING. You loose. Save. You edit a toon. Save. You win. Save. Go back to the main menu. Save. You pick a wrong toon by accident. Save. It's to the point where I wanted to chug my controller at the T.V. Why do I have to save everything?  I still love the game and if your a fan you will too.  I wish the series would tone down the damage on juggles or at least give us a way to get out of it. Other than that and the save issues, the game is great.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000R39GPA","reviewerName":"Caleb Williams","summary":"Absolutely Stunning","reviewText":"I have to tell the truth here and say I bought this game expecting it to be a complete disappointment. Placing the story somewhere between episodes 3 and 4 of the Star Wars saga, I just expected it to be a little money maker for the franchise with very little thought put into it. Boy was I wrong. This is not just one of the most entertaining games I own, but it's also one of the most epic as some of the scenes placed within this game would make the original movie series blush at their own inferiority.The story goes like this. As mentioned before it's set some time between episodes 3 and 4 of the film series. Vader is on one of his missions to eliminate all remaining Jedi when he comes across an orphaned child who seems to posess amazing force strength. Vader takes the boy under his wing as his very own secret apprentice and as he grows older, teaches him the ways of embracing the dark side.The first 3 missions or so consist of you going on assassination missions and confronting prominent Jedi names in a fight to the death. Nothing is as it seems, however, and the apprentice can't trust his masters specifically the Emperor who orders Vader to kill his apprentice. Vader appears to do the Emperors bidding but it turns out Vader feels too much for the young apprentice and holds negative feelings towards the Emperor. So the remaining part of the game consists on you taking part in secret missions that will dethrone the Emperor from his empire.So why is this game so special? Well first off as the name implies, it's a game that focuses around one of the main entities we are all familiar with from the Star Wars series and that's the Force. As Vaders secret apprentice, when you progress through the game completing numerous assassination missions, your force powers increase. These introduce you to more powerful aspects of particular force elements such as lightning and force grip. As your level improves in an RPG type style, you can upgrade your current skills. Say for example you can increase your force lightning strength or your ability to heal your force energy at a quicker rate.Along with the force skills, your ability to wield a light sabre like the Jedi Masters of the movies is something very special also. It's very much just button bashing for the most part, but as you progress your learning you will develop skillful combos that will help you take out the level bosses in an instant. The absolute coolest level bosses have to be the menacing Rancor. Surely this animal is one of the most memorable Alien creatures to grace the Star Wars universe and considering its short appearence in the films, I'm glad they get a more prominentn role in the game.Along with it being fun to play the look and feel of it is just incredible. The scenarios and planets you find yourself on are detailed to the very last blade of grass and interact with your body and the force to present the realistic environment that just has you wanting to use your force moves that would interact with it, such as using your force grip to pick up a giant plant or boulder to launch at one of your enemies.It's one hell of an entertaining game and I'm hoping for a sequel that will take us much later into the Star Wars saga, maybe placing your apprentice character at the end of the movie series and becoming the Dark Side replacement of Vader? That would be pretty cool and with you being the same apprentice, the movies already learned at max level can be included in the next one and you can increase on them which would be a lot of fun. Anyway, just get it. It's brilliant from start to finish, and if you're a fan of previous Star Wars games then you know what to expect and your expectations will be met and then some.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2009"}

You get a mix of vehicles, land, sea, and more to fight your way through.The game is aimed towards realism. There aren't cartooney characters or bright colors here. Often you can barely make your character out against the background. You work your way stealthily towards enemies, trying to snipe them without being seen. The background music themes are generally soft so you can hear the sound of approaching enemies.The graphics are really rather stellar for the PS2. From floating clouds to drifting dust clouds, from scraggles of grass to gritty textures of buildings, you get the sense that you're in a war zone. I really think they did the best they could with the PS2, in portraying a natural environment.The maps are quite large and intricate. This is great for both single player and multiplayer purposes. Often a game is well geared towards one area or another, but SOCOM does a good job pleasing both sets of players.Some of the key combinations can be really challenging, especially for newcomers to the SOCOM series. Trying to get your troops to get into a vehicle with you - or heck, figuring out how to get YOU into a vehicle, can be challenging. This is a game that takes a bit of time to get the hang of.But that being said, there is a lot of wealth in here that can get quite addictive once you've immersed yourself. The environment is that compelling.Well recommended for fans of combat / fighting games, even in modern times.

I bought it shortly after it came out (several years ago), and yet I still play it! I bought this new version, expecting the same core gameplay, updated for the Wii. Well, that's what I got. Only problem is, as other reviewers have said, there are very few updates. That wouldn't bother me so much, but what has been changed has been changed for the WORSE! Instead of the simple \"acre\" system from the first game, you now have to walk on a round \"globe\". Personally, it made me dizzy, and it also makes it hard to find things. Everything must be controlled with the Wii remote. To do something as simple as open the menu, you have to raise your arm, move the cursor, and click on something (where previously you could just push a button); while walking around, I had to keep my arm raised CONSTANTLY. Very tiring. But the worst of all is that you can no longer ask your neighbors for jobs, etc! THEY will approach YOU if they want something; if you talk to them more than once in a row, they get annoyed and start yelling at you. This makes it much harder to find things to do. Just to add insult to injury, they now make you water the flowers. That's right, you must water EVERY SINGLE FLOWER, EVERY DAY. Otherwise they turn brown.  After two days of watering flowers and hanging around, waiting for the villagers to ask me for something, I got bored out of my skull and went back to the GC Animal Crossing. I have never been happier. End of story.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2009"}

I do remember the fun I had playing them and with the new one, the feeling if back trifold. I Haven't finished the story but that's mostly due to the immense replay value. If you're a completionist like me, this is the game for you. I spent hours replaying levels so I could finish the challenges.I also spent some time doing the Contracts Mode. This mode allows you to either make a contract kill, or create one. I find it to be a nice change of pace and it's fun to top the scores of other players.My only real gripes are with the rating system and using the fiber wire. Well the rating system is half a gripe. It's in the top left of the screen and it's always there. When I first started playing I found it distracting and a little annoying. It made me cautious of my actions and detracted from the fun a little. Now I guess I've gotten used to it and it's quite satisfying to see the score skyrocket and I see the purpose of it. You are supposed to be a silent killer after all. It's also quite amusing to watch it go into the negatives if you go on a killing spree. Now with the fiber wire, I find that if you and your target aren't on even footing it won't work.

I'd read the reviews on this, and other sites, and knew not to expect anything earth shaking. All I was looking for was a fun, gun fueled romp. Unfortunately, Bodycount couldn't even deliver that.I am of the mind that a games graphics don't need to be phenomenal for it to be great, but they do need to be more than functional. The world of Bodycount is one of muddy graphics, cookie cutter characters, and bland, boring level design. In a time when the market is flooded with quality first person shooters, this just isn't acceptable. The controls are servicable, but nothing special. Most disappointingly however, is the lackluster gameplay.I bought this with the hope that it would be a me vs. the world kind of game. One where I use all manner of fun, imaginative weapons to destroy everything in my path. I was immediately disappointed by the basic, and very boring, weapons offered to you in the game. Pistols, machine guns, shotguns, and not much else. There are one or two enjoyable weapons thrown in here, but they come late in the game, and don't do enough to change the overall experience. Worse yet, the boiler plate weapons aren't even fun to use. The enemy AI is caveman stupid, and never presents a real challenge, besides numbers. You can chain kills together for more points, but killing someone with a body shot, the easiest and most efficent method, stops your chain. Only exotic kills like head shots, multi kills, final bullet, ect, racks up points but the controls aren't tight enough to make these efficient options.The biggest problem with Bodycount is that it lacks what so many other, far superior games have. Rage, the Fear series, the Bioshock series, the Call of Duty series, Borderlands 1 and 2, Far Cry 3, the battlefield series, the Crysis series, the Halo series, and many more are just plain better than Bodycount in gameplay, graphics, story, weapon creativity, and control. Many of these superior games can be purchased, on amazon, for as much, if not less, than Bodycount, so there is no reason to buy this. I paid $14 and STILL feel I paid too much for what I got. All in all, Bodycount just isn't worth a purchase over all the other, better games out there. Definitely not a buy.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2013"}
