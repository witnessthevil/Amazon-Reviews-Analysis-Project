These are not necessarily good though. I would like it if there was a post game show and halftime show like NFL 2k5 but does not seem like they will ever get it. I hate that there is no soundtrack, what the hel*. I have to listen to boring music the whole time, it's so annoying. Especially during off-season of my connected careers, I am going to lose my mind. The online like always is kind of slow and it is glitchy. The way the players move is better but the tackling is so stupid. Someone gets tackled and they fly 10 yards. Other times people are falling over there teammates messing up the whole play. I must say I like the passing more but it isn't much different. The madden moments are free so that's a good thing. Last time what were they thinking making us pay for stupid stuff like that. The best part of madden is the new rosters, just like it is every year after 2005. The online connected carrers is a stupid idea. Who wants to control their team that seriously. \"Hey mom I need to find a computer to fix my Madden team\". No, that doesn't happen, we don't care that much. Everything else is the same or worse than Madden 12. I wish they would just listen to what the fans say because we are the ones buying it. If they want to know what we want, it is NFL 2k5/Madden 2005 mixed together with an awesome soundtrack, better graphics,and better gameplay. They got everything perfect in 2005, why change anything? I cannot say I hate this game because I play it like everyday. I buy every madden and play it for a few months until a new game I like comes out. Madden 13 is not worth getting if you do not have money to spend, otherwise, go ahead and get it if you like Madden in general. It might be best to spend your money on a better game, like GTA or COD, or Battlefield, or something that is actual going to be really good.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2012"}

That's the first impression I got when playing this game. Now I wasn't too surprised that the puzzling levels didn't make sense half the time, cuz Ive played the first game(Sands of time) and it was the same(if not less frustrating). Ok but I hate to start with the bad in games, though I will spit it out at the end of my review. But for now:the good. This new installment of the Prince of Persia series provides a basic, but exciting story: the prince has unlocked the sands of time, leaving a furios monster,Dahaka, after him. You kill many cool-but-fierce monsters and bosses while trying to flee from Dahaka, and find the Sands of Time. You see, if you find them, then you can turn back time, and never open them, therfore sparing your own life. Translation:Kill oober cool enemies and haul butt when a big black monster comes your way. Make sense? But I dont want to give anything away, so I will mantion simpler things. Graphics. Ah yes the wonderful, crisp graphics. I love them you will too I assure you they are much much better than those of Prince of Persia Sands of Time. Also, I was very impressed with the amazing range of weapons and that you could dual weild if it suited you. The sound.......well lets just say it gets quite rough at times, with the new voice actor for the Prince, because this guy cant seem to say one-sentence things he sounds like he just got braces on or something, he can't talk like a normal person. Ok I know im slowly fading from good to bad, but what can I say? this game is as bad as good. Now where was I? Oh yes i remember now:the horribly difficult puzzling levels they are oober hard I made no sense of them, and even with help from Nintendo Power magazines(thanks a million guys at NP, you saved my controller from being chucked out the window,thanks to your expert help) I found it extremely difficult to beat these levels. Yea PP:WW=HARD. But if your up to a challenge and love more puzzling levels than you can shake a stick at, this game is for you. Besides the sense of power is undenialbly great after you beat each hard level. Plus, maybe its just me. If your extremely patient and dont mind the out of place hard rock music all the time, and dont mind some annoying voice acting errors, this is a VERY worthy sequal. If the bosses dont slay you, the wonderful graphics will.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2005"}

This game provides a way for you to set up your own workout and weight loss routine.  It starts with a fitness test and you have options for choosing the length of time you want to exercise, how many days per week and what you want to accomplish.  You can use it for weight loss, core strength or flexibility.  You can also customize it for use with hand weights, an exercise ball or step bench if you have them.  Just trying it for a couple days of workouts it provides a good cardio workout and lots of good flexibility moves.  I'd have to say it's more strenuous than most of the Wii Fit exercises, many of which are more concentrated on balance than on cardio.  But the one thing I wish they would have included is use of the Wii balance board.  This seems like such a natural for this game and would have given feedback on your actual moves. As it is, this seems more like an exercise DVD in some ways than a Wii fitness game.Still, it does have many features that are interactive and that set it apart from an exercise DVD that I enjoy.  You can choose from among 8 different places or environments to exercise, whatever suits your mood on a particular day.  And there's a good selection of music that you can choose to exercise to. To me that's a big thing.  Nothing is worse than having to exercise to music that you find annoying.  Everyone should be able to find something they like here.  And you can keep track of your progress.Maya, your trainer gives you lots of encouragement and pushes you to achieve your goals.  I think being able to set your own goals and making a commitment to exercise and eat well is a very good way to lose weight or gain flexibility and core strength.  This game helps you to make that commitment and it gives you a way to measure your progress.  There are also a lot of different exercises, something for everyone and for every fitness goal.The music is good and the graphics are fine, not exceptional, but not bad.  The instruction and demonstration of the exercises is very good and easy to follow.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I thought it missed a good chance at more interactivity by not including the balance board.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2008"}

Christianson \"ABC\"","summary":"Great Game in the Beginning but Then Gets Way Too Difficult!","reviewText":"After numerous times of my computer crashing and having to start from scratch, I finally got an external harddrive so got further than I ever have.  I'm to retrieve something from a burial cave near a campsite of people who don't like you too much.  Not only was there some flame monster chasing me on the way there that wouldn't leave me alone after I got there, which the camp people didn't help me with.  They wouldn't even sell me potions or anything unless I forked out alot of gold!  Stupid!  The burial cavern is also impossiple!  You have to have magic spells or magic items.  If I would've known that, I would've brought all the ones I had with me!  The creatures in the cave aren't effected by normal weapons.  Not only that, but I'm gonna have to face that fire monster on the way back and may not make it.  Stupid!  You also get effected too much later in the game with blight or other status where you have to keep on taking special potions till you're back to normal.  I understand there should be an element of difficulty in games, but this is overkill!  Not only that, but it takes forever to get anywhere in this game.  There's too much to do and keep track of.  I'd rate the beginning parts/quests 4 stars, but so far I haven't felt like getting back to it, so I'd rate it at most 2 stars where I'm at now.  If you like first person RPGs, I suggest King's Field.  Think they only made those for the PlayStation 1 and 2.  They're about due for another one!To be fair to the game I decided to follow up this review with something I would've written before I got stuck.  The game is pretty inventive and has quite a bit of tasks that will keep you busy.  The only thing is the game seems a bit repetative.  There's not enough variety, and I do agree with one review I read about there not being any waterfalls, bird filled forests, sunrises and sunsets, and other similar visual attractions.  Yes, this game is a bit dark, but isn't bad.  For the time it came out the graphics and sounds aren't bad.  I like the first person view and that you can make it 3rd person to look at your character and she how awesome he/she is with his/her current armor/clothing.In my opinion the positives are:1) You can bribe salespeople so you can buy low and sell high.2) You have free reign with your character creation.  You have quite a bit of options to choose from as far as character origination, class, and specialty.3) There are alot of items you can find in caves, homes, etc.4) You can clean out homes as long as no one is watching.  I find this funny as I can clear people's shelves and take the pillows off their beds. LOL  You can also steal from shop owners.  I stole quite a bit of weapons and armor from someone's chest while peaking around the corner of a village not too far from the one you start in.  Only thing was I had to keep on coming back, because I would get overencumbered.  This really helped me build some money and get some good equipment.  I know it's not good to steal, but this is just a game, and if you don't get caught, why not? LOLIn my opinion the negatives are:1) Later on in the game you get infected with blight, disease, and other status effects too often.  I guess they want me to always carry a bunch of cure potions on me???2) You end up being unprepared for some places you spend alot of time getting to.  I am in one such place now.  I spent alot of time getting there as well as having a flame monster chasing me.  I didn't have what I needed and the people at the camp did not want to help me.  This quest is actually part of the main game.  Casius Cosus, or whatever his name is, tells you to come here to prove you are the chosen one.3) Some things are too repetative:  people say the same things; the caves look the same, I've had the same armor like forever; same enemies except some are blighted, diseased or otherwise; your quests are all the same where you have to go retrieve some item... sometimes you have a hard time finding it4) Your weapons and armor breakdown too fast. Would be nice if they lasted a bit longer or allowed you to repair them yourself. I have repair vices, grips, etc. but the game doesn't allow me to use them for some reason.5) Some of the enemies are way too hard for where you're supposed to be in the game. I was kicking butt until I got to a place that required me to have magic weapons/skills... really stupid. I don't like being forced to have to use magic if I don't have a magic based character. I find that really stupid.6) It takes too long to get to some places, especially if you become overencumbered. I was in one such place in Vivee I believe... took me forever to get there and back and would get overencumbered too quick. Also had enemies there that kept on decreasing my stats thus making me overencumbered too quick anyway. When I learned this, I would save right before facing them, and they kept on re-appearing after I already killed them all. Maybe there's a wizard/sorceror that keeps on calling them up there. Who knows?7) Some towns are way too big and confusing: towns like Vivee. Everything looks the same, and it's easy to get lost. I understand there should be some mazes here and there, but in towns???So all in all as I said originally I give this game 4 stars in the beginning when it's easier to figure things out and things weren't so repetative but 2 stars later on when it gets too boring, repetative, and hard.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0007D4MVS","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"Fun but mindless","reviewText":"Nintendo, always known to make unique games, hit a high note in originality when it released the original Wario Ware on the Game Boy Advance two years ago. Soon enough, there was a GameCube version. Now, with the capabilities of the new Nintendo DS handheld, Nintendo has had more than enough open space for innovation. The product is one of the DS&#8217;s most anticipated titles&#8212;Wario Ware: Touched!.All of the Wario Ware games test your endurance and your ability to think quickly with dozens and dozens of quick mini-games. Wario Ware: Touched! goes a step further with a new means of control: the DS&#8217;s stylus and microphone. This time around, you&#8217;ll face up against 180 &#8220;microgames&#8221;, each with a different type of action you&#8217;ll need to perform. The microgames are truly unique, simple, and hilarious&#8212;some of them are almost disturbing&#8212;but they are all, for the most part, a blast. However, not one of them lasts more than five to ten seconds, so you&#8217;ll never get stuck for an extended period of time on a certain game.I personally enjoyed most of the microgames, although some are certainly more fun than others. One that I thought was hilarious involved a little fire burning on the side of a mountain. To put the fire out, you are instructed to use an angel that is dangling from the sky, armed with a hose located in a &#8220;certain&#8221; place. Another that I enjoyed was one of the last games you play, where you guide an explorer through a cave of traps by cutting down bushes and breaking rocks by tapping them with the stylus.As fun as individual games are, you are hardly given time to notice. As you play Wario Ware: Touched!, you unlock more and more characters with their own unique premise behind each game. You&#8217;ll use your stylus-tapping skills as Wario, your scribbling abilities as the ninja twins Ana and Kat, and even blow or sing into the microphone as the karaoke robot Mike. As you run through their quick little &#8220;stories&#8221;, you play microgame after microgame, with each one getting faster then the next until you reach a &#8220;Boss Stage&#8221;. These stages are actually quite simple in comparison to some of the other games. You are given much more time, even if the ultimate goal is a little tougher.Another perk to Wario Ware: Touched! is the simple production value. The graphics are never a steady quality. Some microgames use simple sprites, others use real-life images, and a select few use the 3D capabilities of the Nintendo DS. Even though this might come off as a fault, it actually adds points to the originality of the title. Also, the music is fast, cheery, and very upbeat. It always keeps you glued to your handheld, ready for the next quick round of microgames.Wario Ware: Touched! does have its share of problems, though. The biggest issue, and one that you&#8217;ll quickly notice if you purchase the game, is the fact that the fun only lasts a few hours. It literally only takes two to three hours to unlock every microgame and every &#8220;toy&#8221; (which range from a calculator to an advice simulator). As quirky as the two or three hours might be, a game shouldn&#8217;t cost so much for such a short ride. The price of admission is $34.99&#8212;meaning each hour of gameplay is worth $17.50&#8212;but the only positive note is that the game doesn&#8217;t end when you&#8217;ve unlocked everything. The fast-paced games and the strange charm will keep you coming back.Although there are a lot of good things about Wario Ware: Touched!, the basic flaw still remains: it is a tough choice to throw down so much cash for such a short experience. The game can easily be replayed for hours and hours, but you&#8217;re basically paying for 180 hits of attention deficit medicine rather than a full-length game. The only ending comment I can say is that if you were a fan of Sega&#8217;s Feel the Magic XY/XX or past Wario Ware games, you&#8217;ll definitely eat up the addictive microgames in Wario Ware: Touched!. Otherwise, you will most likely be disappointed with the super-short length and the nearly-pointless gameplay.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2005"}

So you're getting a game, the Kinect sensor (which will probably sell for over $100 by itself) for only $50 more than this.  Even if you go by the Titanfall bundle's regular price of $499, the value of this SKU is still worse.  So don't mistake this for a price drop, it's an un-bundling/cheaper SKU.At 399, you really have to consider the PS4 as well.  It has more powerful hardware for the same price, which means most multiplatform games will look better and/or perform better on PS4, and multiplatform games make up for ~90% of both system's software libraries.  If Xbox One exclusives interest you more, then it's a decent system.

That's all the good things I can say about it. The campaign is far too short and takes less than an hour to beat each one, No story what so ever to go along with the campaign, Weapons are very limited (Pistols, Shotguns, Assault Rifles), and the AI are rather useless at times.Not to mention the Game of the Year edition doesn't come with much. It only comes with Survival mode and the 2 other campaign based maps for it (So now instead of playing just 2 of the 4 campaigns' total levels, You can now play survival on all 4 campaigns). Wouldn't really be calling that a Game of the Year edition kind of thing when it should have been a standard add on for the game in the first place.

I have played, to some degree, Final Fantasies 1 - 9. Of all these Final Fantasy games, I would have to say that FINAL FANTASY 6 IS THE BEST TURN-BASED RPG EVER! Some people say that the music is not all that great. I disagree. Yes, it is sometimes repetitive, BUT IT SETS THE MOOD, unlike lots of games out there. ESPECIALLY the first two tunes when you start the final battle, which is really divided into 4 or 5 parts. Every time I hear those tunes I KNOW that I'm at the ending boss. The character development is OUTSTANDING. Most novels would be hard-pressed to come up with such an interesting group.

The storyline is AMAZING. Magic has been outlawed, but there are some who would like to bring it back and replace technology with it. There are some parallels to Star Wars and the Wheel of Time in here. Eventually you join a rebellion against the evil Kefka. But two of the best parts in the game are: 1--when you get to the opera house for the first time. 2--when the ENTIRE face of the earth is changed and you must start from SCRATCH. I LOVE that part. It is so NONLINEAR. You have to find all your buddies ALL OVER AGAIN, but you can do it in almost any order you want. Sure, the graphics are outdated on this, but GRAPHICS don't make a game, THE STORYLINE DOES. And there is no denying that the storyline in this game is TOP-NOTCH. Final Fantasy 7 and 9 come VERY close, but no cigar. Nobuo Uematsu really put his whole heart into this game, turning out some of the best video game music ever written. If I had the money, I would buy MULTIPLE copies of this game, since I knew that I'd be returning to it again and again . . . .","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2001"}

However, there is something about Diablo 3 that just isn't fun.  I have been grinding out hours on my DH on Inferno act 1 and feel that is as far as I will get.  Gear drops are boring and too rare.  Way too much dependence on the AH.  Blizzard, it is not fun to have to farm farm farm farm farm gold just to BUY gear from the AH.  One of the greatest feelings in these hack and slash games is getting USEFUL gear that makes you go \"OH YEA!!!\".  I have put in plenty of hours and have only had maybe 2-3 of those moments.  The drops suck.  Mostly trash.  I find this highly disappointing.  If the drops were better the maybe the inferno difficulty would not be so infuriating.  Anyhow, that is my two sense.  Decent story plot.  I like the skills and functionality of the DH at least but find myself with very little interest in even playing the other classes just due to my frustrations thus far.In short, I will likely shelve the game and find something that I get enjoyment out of an not something that makes me want to smash my computer.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2012"}

{"product_name":"Razer DeathAdder 3500 PC Gaming Mouse - Left Hand Edition","description":"&nbsp;","reviewerName":"J. Fig.","summary":"Not DOA, but FAULTY on arrival.","reviewText":"First, let me get the pros about this mouse out of the way...PROs:Extremely well balanced. Paired with the right mouse pad, you can have a killer set-up. I personally have the Razer Destructor mouse pad, which helped this mouse, my Mamba and even the Logitech G500s slide smoothly for a great gaming session.Great grip. Both sides have a rubber-like section that aids when handling the mouse, giving you great control, special for FPS games.The boom is just right. Compared to the Logitech G500s, the DeathAdder is much easier on the hand, limiting fatigue, and quite honestly, I did not suffer any for that matter.The Right and Left mouse buttons have a slight shape to them, which again, aids greatly when playing FPS, as you'll find your fingers less stressed and will feel a much more control when taking shots and/or aiming.The actual \"click\" is spot on. I didn't notice any lag between my input and output to the games I played.The feet. Wow, they do wonders, but again, I have the Razer mouse pad, so I believe it gives me an advantage.The cord. Braided. Very long and not cumbersome at all. I don't really see the need for a cord bungie, but again, that's personal preference.Gold plated USB. Gold will keep interference off at a greater rate.NOW...sadly, this mouse arrived not DOA, but FAULTY.The side buttons, did not \"click\". Basically, I pressed on them, but I had no output. When managing the mouse's software, I had set these buttons to serve as DPI adjusters. (higher/lower value), but I had no response from the mouse. After a few \"hard\" constant clicks, they finally started to respond and I could actually hear them click...but after playing for only 10 minutes, they went dead again and I found myself pressing them hard again, to get them to engage.That's the only CON I have. And I'm extremely picky with my gear.There is one NEUTRAL aspect that I'd like to mention, but IMO, it does not affect the performance.Most will argue that the Software included is  buggy or simply a pain in the butt, but I beg to differ, COMPARED to previous versions, Razer has really raised the bar and has improved their software by a long stretch. You can manage your mouse's performance, re-map the buttons and save such settings on any number of profiles. For example, (before I noticed the faulty buttons), like I mentioned above, I had the side buttons as DPI levels, which I saved under a profile I named BF4 and for desktop use I had them as backward/forward buttons for page and folder browsing, which I saved as Desktop profile....You can also select the number of DPI stages, etc.I have a Razer mamba 2013, and the software recognized the DeathAdder right away, switching to it without any hiccups.I had the chance to use the Logitech G500s, since I had the original G5, but after using the more balanced, weight free Mamba (two different versions), I found the G500s to be too bulky and its boom to high, forcing me to use more of a \"claw\" style, which unless you are used to, can be quite painful. But also, the G500s, lacks the shaped right/left buttons that both the DeathAdder and Mamba have, which makes the G500s kind of hard to use when sniping.That's my experience with this mouse. I hope this helps.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"msnola","summary":"la la la","reviewText":"This game is great.

You can tell there was a lot of effort put into this game, and I'm going to chalk up the shortcomings to the fact that this was essentially a unique experiment for Disney and the Wii.

{"product_name":"B003O6E7DI","description":"","reviewerName":"Steve","summary":"The Best Professor Layton Yet","reviewText":"The latest entry in the Professor Layton series is pretty much the perfect portable game, assuming of course that you're into puzzle solving.  It's fun and quick to pick up and play, with high production values and a ton of content.  If you've played earlier entries in the series, then you won't be too surprised by this one - it follows a fairly similar formula.  Professor Layton and Luke (his faithful assistant) travel to London in order to see a demonstration of a brand new invention: the Time Machine.  Things go a little haywire with the demonstration, and then a few days later the Professor receives a letter in the mail from Luke - sent from 10 years in the future!  This kicks off a whole adventure of puzzle solving, and things only get crazier from there.This game has 12 chapters, and a total of 165 puzzles - which should be enough to keep anyone busy for a while.  There's a hint system available in case you get stuck, just like previous entries in the series.  As you play through the game, you'll collect coins that can be used to purchase hints if you're having trouble with a puzzle.  If you're REALLY stuck then you can buy a super hint - which is a new addition to the series and pretty much just tells you the answer to the puzzle.  So don't worry too much about getting stuck and frustrated.Professor Layton and the Unwound Future is a lot of fun to look at.  They did a fantastic job with the art style and animation, and there's even some decent voiceover work.  If you're a fan of the Professor Layton series then you should pick this game up immediately.  If you haven't played any of the previous entries and you're into puzzle game, then definitely give this one a shot.  You don't need to know about any of the previous games in order to enjoy it, and it really is one of the more polished DS games available.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2010"}

Romano \"Avid Gamer\"","summary":"Medal of Honor Airborne Could of Been Made  A Better Game","reviewText":"First of all, Medal of Honor Airborne only has six missions to play in and that is it. The game should have had at least twelve missions to play in it to be called a full version game. This game is suppose to be a full version game. Not a add-on or an expansion game. I feel like I have been ripped off by someone.Of the six missions, only the first four missions honor the brave soldiers that fought in World War II. The last two missions do not honor the brave soldiers who fought during World War II. The last two missions are fantasy made missions that remind me of going to amusement park. You have super Nazi's in the last two missions that take forever to kill. Shoot them in the head or blow them up with grenades it doesn't do any good. It takes at least fifty to a hundred shots with your weapon to take down one of these super Nazi's. I felt like I needed to find a super weapon like a laser gun to bring them down.I notice in the fifth mission (Operation Varsity) there are railroad cars that are not European made rail cars. They are North American made railroad cars. What is up with that? It is quite obvious that somebody just slapped some North American railroad cars into the mission just to finish it.In the last mission, (Operation Der Flakturm) American paratroopers land on a German Flak tower in Germany right after Operation Varsity. This mission never took place during World War II. The Russians were the only ones to assault German Flak towers during the war. In fact, the Flak tower used in the game never even got built in Germany. There was three generations of Flak towers built by the Germans during the war and only the first two generations of towers were built in Germany. Those towers were built in the German cities of Berlin and Hamburg during the war. The game shows a third generation built Flak tower built in Germany, that was actually built in Vienna, Austria during the war. Somebody screwed up.It almost seems like two different teams of game developers work on the Medal of Honor Airborne game. One team worked on the first four missions of the game which were realistic and actually happen during World War II while another team worked on the last two missions in the game which are more sci-fi and fantasy. I really wanted to like this game because I'm a big World War II fan. With all the actual events that happen during World War II, why would the game developer need to makeup any missions for the game?This another example of a game that should of went somewhere that ended up going nowhere. Either the game publisher or the game developer just wanted to hurry and finish the game just to try to beat the holiday rush. Somebody was trying to hurry and make some money on this game before the other big name titles come out later on this year.

I gave great praise to the first Left 4 Dead a year ago, and yet, desired a lot more than what was presented.  When I heard that the production company Valve was releasing an entirely new sequel barely one year after the release of the first game, I was very, VERY skeptical the developers would pull off a good game.  In fact, there was a massive online boycott being organized almost immediately following Valve's announcement of a sequel due to a lack of downloadable content, quick release.  Many speculated that Left 4 Dead 2 would be nothing more than a glorified expansion.Despite all the controversy, however, I through all caution (not to mention the money for a full-priced game) to the wind and purchased the game on it's midnight release.  Having played Left 4 Dead 2 for a few hours, I can safely say that the sequel has lived up to the hype despite prior skepticism and controversy.Left 4 Dead 2 closely follows the basic gaming principles of its predecessor, a gratuitous first-person shooter against the backdrop of a global zombie pandemic.  The player follows four new survivors (although possessing similar personality quirks) across several campaigns with an almost endless supply of ammo, almost as many zombies including special mutated ones, and no shooter's shoulder to worry about.  Towards the end of the campaign the survivors must defend a position to await rescue whilst going up against seemingly impossible odds.  Like the original, Left 4 Dead 2 focuses on teamwork survival rather than the typical one-man-army.  It is virtually impossible for one gamer to survive the campaigns without assistance from either ally AI or from another player and no, this is not a dare to try.  Weapons are hyper-accurate similar to doom as you simply have to point the weapon in the general direction of your target in order to hit them, thus making the Left 4 Dead franchise the ultimate zombie shooter.  I definitely agree with the Left 4 Dead 2 television commercial that, even with 10 million zombies, there just isn't enough to go around as a player can kill more zombies than Electronic Arts has killed more Nazis in the Medal of Honor franchise.(BTW: to any worried parents or concerned citizens that are hesitant or disgusted by the intense violence of Left 4 Dead, lemme just say this.  It's a gratuitous shooter, it's supposed to be this violent.  Don't be surprised if you see head chopped off or limbs fly around as that is a common sight in the game.  You've been forewarned so either watch what your kids play or don't play it.  Step aside and let us gamers deal with the zombie apocalypse.)Left 4 Dead 2 also contains the same online multiplayer experience with survivors versus special infected (oh the fun of peeking around the corner as a boomer and unloading your stomach contents on the survivors all the hoard to survey), online campaign co-op, and survival mode similar to firefight mode in Halo 3: ODST albeit with considerably more difficulty.  It's a good thing Valve did not try to tweak these features too much since that can easily ruin a good feature that everyone liked to begin with.However, like any other sequel, Left 4 Dead 2 sports several improvements over the original game that are certainly worth noting.1:  Left 4 Dead 2 possesses a defined story arc with character development.The original game had a very, VERY basic story with little character development.  The most extensive story development in the original game was contained in the instruction manual and not the game itself.  The story involving the campaigns seemed almost mutually exclusive from each other and lacked any real focus.  While a lacking story beyond survive and kill did not hinder Left 4 Dead from being an absolutely awesome game, it could have made the game a whole lot better.  Left 4 Dead 2 differs from this as it gives a defined story involving how the survivors found each other, their backgrounds are more defined through dialog, but their interactions with each other is just as hilarious as the first such as the survivor's discussion of NASCAR.  Also, the campaigns are linked through a common thread rather than being mutually exclusive.2:  More diverse firearms selections.One of my original criticisms of Left 4 Dead was the lack of weapons selections.  You had two full-automatic choices, two shotguns, one pistol, two types of grenades, and one rifle.  That was it.  Left 4 Dead sports the exact same weapons as well as several new automatic weapons, more shotguns, more pistols, and most importantly...3:  Melee Weapons!!Let's face it, we've all wanted to take either a fire axe or a katana to a zombie.  Now you can!  The player can also choose between such melee weapons as a guitar (which makes a loud metal sound similar to the one in Dead Rising), a cricket stick, Gordon Freeman's signature crowbar, frying pans, and everyone's favorite: the chainsaw.  This was one of the most redeeming qualities of Left 4 Dead 2 as cutting through zombie hordes with a chainsaw has been a dream of many gamers since we witnessed that burlap-sack-chainsaw-welding maniac on Resident Evil 4 decapitate Leon S. Kennedy over and over.4:  Realism Mode.Left 4 Dead, being a gratuitous shooter, does lack a more relatively realistic approach that other survival horror games offer.  As such, Valve included a realism mode that A) prevents the player from seeing the other player's silhouettes when not in direct sight, B) dead survivors can only be revived by a defibrillator (another new item), C) damage dealt to zombies is based on where it hits rather than one hit equals the same damage whether the zombie is hit in the arm or in the dead, and D) dead survivors cannot be respawned via redemption closets.  This makes the game considerably more difficult even for more seasoned veterans of the game.There are a few more subtle changes such as increased difficulty.  There are more zombies, some take more hits, and a survivor can only utilize a few melee attacks before becoming exhausted.  My brother and I, who are very big fans of the original game, used to practice playing split-screen co-op on hard but experienced noticeable difficulty on Left 4 Dead 2's easy mode.  Perhaps it was a fluke but we certainly were not out of practice.  This is an improvement in a way since it makes the player think more before charging into a room or open space.  Other improvements include smoother game textures (the weapons, in particular, are more detailed and refined), less loading time (the original took two minutes to load the menu screen), and more challenging special zombies such as the charger and certain zombies in riot gear making them more resistant to bullets.I'll admit, Left 4 Dead 2 does not feel so much as a new game but I wouldn't even come close to designating it an expansion.  Not in the least.  It is obvious Valve went to great measures to ensure their sequel would live up to the hype of the original and the price of a new game by improving upon the base formula considerably w/o sacrificing any good elements from the first.  Valve even designed the button placement and configuration to be virtually identical to the original.  From what I can see, Valve did not sacrifice anything good to improve upon the sequel and this is rare.At first, I was a very skeptical gamer when Valve announced a new Left 4 Dead but they turned me into a believer after all as I enjoyed the campaigns and the online multiplayer and will continue to do so in the future.  My only wish is that Valve would include more zombies, but I'll just have to wait until Left 4 Dead 3 next Christmas when they introduce more environmental weapons than Dead Rising!Happy hunting!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2009"}

I came into this game really stoked.Like \"This is going to be five stars\" stoked.However this turns out quickly not to be the case. I've spent time with this game years now since it has been released it used to be a regular play for me, until two far far better games have come into my life. Compared to Final Fantasy X this is a ten star on a five star level game. Compared to X-2, X-2 is barely even a game. But it's no Mass Effect, it's no Fable II, it's not Final Fantasy Tactics and it sure isn't on the grade of Fallout 3.What really helped me like Tactics was infact the job system. A system that needed some work but was very solid and well detailed for the characters. Each class felt useful and interesting. They had a great thing going here with it. So I was expecting a refinement of this!What did we get instead?The same \"I CAN DO EVERYTHInGZZZZ\" crap we have been having forced on us since Final Fantasy 7. Where character's don't matter because quite frankly they can all do the same abilities anyway. It wasn't cool in X (though it was done marginally better than XII did it) and it really isn't cool now.Characters should be unique from each other, that's the whole point of having characters party up really. They cover holes that the other can't fufill. Anytime you have a party that's more or less how it works. Even in so called classless games. And it also works much different in classless pen and papers because quite frankly they have more depth than any videogame will likely ever hope for.FFXII takes this, throws up in your face and says \"No! We were too lazy to make each character unique! or hand out just that many ability sets that Cloning never happens! NO! This is JRPG! IT iS OUR WAY\" while you are left staring numbly at the screen wondering just what kind of crac where they on when they made this facet of the game.Which unfortunately is a very very large facet of the game. There's still mindless grinding for levels which if anything thanks to zero specific to character ability sets feels even -more- pointless and tiresome than it has in probably almost any other game I've played that has levels.The abilities they have are too few for this \"classless\" approach.The other big thing I hate in this game, is just like the other FFs that are classless is that monsters just feel like bags of Hp. Especially Bosses. Oh how I hate bosses. First off, due to there not being 1 that many interesting abilities in the game, and 2 you are able to spam your big damage dealing spells /melee attacks the bosses have been given greatly inflated Hp totals that don't reflect their challenge factor at all nor enhance it. It just feels like a level grind killing bosses half the time.Unless of course you use another stupid mechanic which ties right back into why they gave bosses such large Bags Of Hp. Mist Charges, talk about an interesting Idea that they blew chunks all over. Mist Charges are basically this game's limit breaks they do ubsurd damage when you chain the more powerful sequenced ones together. (and you might not even be able to do that since it is stupidly random) blowing your entire mana supply for what might or might not be a payoff worthy of note.Which leads to point number three.Stop with Mana. Mana is stupid, it doesn't work. Especially when you can just Spam your best spells. More mana of course leads to more Spell Spam which then begs the question, why even put the lower level spells in the game. Cooldowns and Charge time based mechanics work far far better than Mana ever has! Stop with Mana already. Especially if you are going to let it recharge anyway just by walking around.You are probably thinking \"man this is alot of flaws what could be so good that Aaron gave it a three star?\". I'm getting there. First I felt it important to discuss the things I do not like about this game before I brought up the points that were just brilliant.Now for the good bits.Gambits. OH MY GOD. I love gambits. Being able to set up your AI partners in a semi real time and or real time game is a MUST. God I can't believe they are being so stupid with XIII as to not do this! This is the only way to do this kind of game! Short of pure turn based or total real time I really seriously can't think of a better way to do an ATB like system. Especially when you have to manage your friendlies on the fly.Given that I don't trust Square or pretty much any other JRPG maker at this point to make good AI scripts for allies (due to lots of bad experiences and the inane design problems that keep popping up in this segment of the market), there is no other option but to do Gambits if you are doing anything but turn based. I know they can't program Ai script worth anything so don't just let gambits run.Also Gambits help tremendously when doing said level and gear farming. They also help tremendously because you don't have to waste critical time managing your allies while your enemies set up to pwn your face off at any given moment. Combat -flows- with Gambits. Even as limited as the character abilities are and everything else, the potential for Gambits in this game are nearly endless in how you can apply them. Get poisoned? set a gambit to counter and cancel it out. Vunerable to Fire enemy? Set up the gambit.This is pure Genius. I really don't know why no one had thought of this system before, but for the love of the gaming gods it needs to be utilized again!Also the ATB system got a revision, you can always que up the action. THIS IS VERY NICE, you don't wait for a turn to pop up to set the que. You set the que on the fly whenever you want to.I hate ATB system, and I could play and -enjoy- it thanks to the lovely ability to que up an action.The story for this game is rock solid and good. Not Tactics good but damned good. It's a little slow and there's alot of nuance and subtlety but I love it all the same.This game could have been five stars but the tropes of JRPGdom have drug it down considerably.They need special abilities for characters, two they need if they do go classless special ability sets for different styles of characters. Ala D&D; 4th edition. (Where your melee character does more than just swing a sword and do a combo every so often. I mean stuff like hit one enemy move to another hit him and then do the same against the third and so forth) This is something FF should have done a very long time ago regardless of the system they use.Either give us classes, or give us a limited ability pool so that we can't just simply fill out the grid. Make it so that we actually have to make a choice with a character, \"Do I want a melee god, a jack of all trades, or a caster?\" not \"I CAN DO EVERYTHING MuWHAHAHA!\"Mana needs to die in a ditch somewhere.Gambits were awesome.Stop making Big Bad Bags Of HP for bosses. If you can't find a way to make him challenging consult me or someone that can, or don't even bother putting them in the game.Reduce possible damage totals so you don't have the Big Bad Bag Of HP syndrome.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2009"}

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or braving it solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house.Key Game FeaturesHunt Together- In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone. Hunt together with up to 4 players online or take on arena quests with 2-player split-screen action. In single player mode, you even have the ability to hunt with AI-controlled characters named ChaCha.Communicate Online- Because communication is key in coordinated huntsMonster Hunter Trisupports Wii Speak and text chat.Monsters with Unique Abilities and Attacks- Monsters have unique and dynamic personalities, abilities and defenses, increasing in complexity as the player progresses. They camouflage themselves to ambush hunters, but will flee or call for help if outmatched.Immense Living, Breathing World with Ecosystem- Monsters interact amongst each other in a living breathing ecosystem, complete with food chain. Monsters have stamina, migrate and even attack one another, the strong feeding on the weak.New Underwater Maps- For the first time ever in anyMonster Huntergame, you will be able explore land and sea and hunt monsters of the deep.Fully Customizable Equipment- With ten weapon categories &ndash; including the all-new Switch Axe &ndash; and new armor and weaponry created from the remains of slain monsters, there are almost limitless opportunities for equipment customization.Choice of Controls- Play with either the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, with the Classic Controller or Classic Controller Pro.Take Your Character with You- The ability to save your character to your Wii Remote lets you engage in multiplayer hunts anytime on a friend's console.","reviewerName":"Christopher M. Shatto","summary":"Great game reduced to good by some bad design choices","reviewText":"First off, I'm going to point out that the people that hold the graphics up as a high point of the game are doing so only insomuch as they're relative to the Wii. The graphics are good for a Wii game, but if you're used to PS3 or Xbox graphics you'll probably find this game's graphics grainy and low resolution. Honestly, they look like they'd be more at home on a Playstation II or the original Xbox.That said, Monster Hunter Tri is a fun game, but it has a few serious drawbacks that may turn some people off of it very quickly.In Monster Hunter Tri, you play the part of a Hunter, a warrior tasked with going into the wild and protecting villages, gathering resources to shore up village defenses and just generally do the whole \"hero\" thing that's required of any nameless RPG main character.To do that, you gear up in Moga Village, head into the woods, and hack and slash your way through dinosaurs, bugs, and other miscellaneous critters. At the same time, you'll collect \"resources\" from those monster and from the surrounding environment. The resources you collect come in the form of hides, claws, horns, berries, ores, even bugs and much more. When you get back to the village, those resources can be turned into gear upgrades, new gear, potions, traps, bombs and all sorts of other things.That's the core of the game. You go into the wild, kill monsters, collect things, and turn them into new things that help you do it all over again.Overall, it's a fun game. The combat is real time and fairly fast-paced. You are expected to slash at enemies, block, dodge and roll in real time. Enemies are varied and will attempt to avoid you, dodge your attacks and counter with their own attacks. Enemies come in the form of ground-based attackers, swimming attackers, and flying attackers, necessitating varied tactics ranging from traditional hack-n-slash with a sword and shield to two-handed weapons to long range bowguns.Collection is an important aspect of the game as well. You can collect things from various nodes while hunting. Nodes of all types are available including ores, mushroom, herbs, bone piles, even dung piles and flying bugs can be collected from. The resources you collect can be combined to create new items, and those items can be combined as well. Some resources can even be farmed so that rare items can be reliably sourced.Aside from hunting in the relatively limited Moga Woods area you can undertake quests. The quests range from killing monsters to collecting items to capturing monsters. As the quests progress, new areas become available that add new monsters and require new tactics.Another feature is trading which allows you to turn certain items into resources that can be used to buy services from the village (which in turn creates more useful items) or trade certain collectible items for useful items. You can obtain these tradeable items either by running around in the woods or by sending out fishing fleets from the village which adds some additional depth to the already complex item system.All of this is relatively fun, but there are some incredibly frustrating drawbacks that should have never made it into the game.First off, the camera and controls are absolutely terrible for a modern game. Controls are annoying, but the camera is just plain awful. Since you don't lock onto targets like in most third-person action games, it doesn't follow the action so it's not hard to wind up with your character facing the camera. This results in the enemy being behind the camera and not visible, making it very difficult to reliably attack, especially since enemies tend to \"dart\" out of the way to avoid incoming attacks.Adding to this problem is the slow control scheme and your overall interaction with the game. You can play the game either by waving the wand and using the nunchuck or by plugging in the classic controller. Perosnally, I'd recommend the controller becasue the game is just too complex otherwise. Using either, however, the controls are, at best, awkward, and, at their worst, a serious disruption.By design, the game's animations are very drawn out which means one wrong button press is enough to result in a serious injury being inflicted by an attacking monster. Since there's no way to cancel animations, it also means that if you accidentally use an item you're stuck with the full animation until it finished or you're hit by an enemy. Combine that the controls and you wind up with a game the feels very \"heavy\" and very difficult to interact with.Another annoying \"feature\" is the overall interface. Exactly what anything does is usually a mystery until you've actually tried it. The menus aren't much better. In particular, when you fill up your item pouch and then loot something new you get a menu with two options: Swap or Discard. Swap takes you into your item pouch and lets you choose something to discard in favor of the newly found item. Discard, on the other hand, acts on the item you just looted, dropping it on the ground to be lost forever without warning. I've lost a few items, some valuable, by mistaking the \"Discard\" option for the chance to drop something from inventory instead of dropping the new item.Certain monsters also have a kind of \"cheese\" factor that trades real challenge for a few cheap moves that are hard or impossible to counter. I've encountered a few \"Great Jaggi\" large (mini-boss style) monsters that have repeatedly used their little tail spin move over and over which doesn't really result in a hard fight so much as an annoyingly longer one.Ultimately, if you can get past the clunky control scheme and the terrible camera, the game is a lot of fun. It would be nice if it had a few more areas, but the areas it has are still entertaining and engaging enough to keep you playing for hours.

I can't complain about the number of titles for it...  it has the titles I'm interested in, and that's what counts.  Over all, the graphics and sound are outstanding.  I haven't played with the other features much, but it's nice to know they're there.  My only complaints are small...  The battery life is a bit short (but I usually play at home, so no real bother for me...)  Also, this is a new model, which is smaller than the old.  Unfortunately there are several nice accessories still available for the old PSP, but they won't fit this one.  So it's buyer-beware when shopping for these.Update: 10/2/2009So, I'm still rocking the same PSP, and it's still working like a champ.  Over the past year, I've gotten a little more aware of the capabilities of this little system.  It truly is a powerhouse!  Granted you won't be using it for regular web browsing, the internet capabilities are still quite nice to have.  Mostly for firmware upgrades and downloadable content from the PlayStation Store.  Downloading the games has 2 advantages:  Longer battery life, and fewer things to carry around (an 8GB memory stick holds at least 8 games...)  Sony was even kind enough to start releasing old PS1 games for download.  I'm currently playing through FFVII.  As far as the multimedia capabilities go, I still use my laptop for watching DVDs on the road, and my MP3 player for music.  This system is simply too small to use for movies, and too big to carry around for music.  But, neither of those were reasons for my purchase, so I'm still very happy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2008"}

I hear all these people saying it's better in some ways than the original and worse in others.  It's the same thing, the gameplay and concept remain unchanged period.  Only difference is this one has a bit more glitches during the talking, sometimes you can make a conversation last forever because you can make characters repeat the same thing over and over. My biggest grip is that you don't get a lightsaber until like 15 hours into the game and up until then some of the boss battles might be a little harder than in the original. Another difference is that you can lose or gain influence among your partners depending on what you do and how you treat them but this isn't a big factor. You hear this about games like Prince of Persia 2 and Metroid Prime 2 games that in my opinion were never that good to begin with but KOTOR 2: Sith Lords is just more of the same thing and makes a suprisenly good 1 year sequel by NOT changing anything.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2004"}

The dances are led by kids, so there's a wholesome fun flavor to the game.2. The dancers can actually be seen, not just their silhouettes as in Just Dance 2/Wii.3. The moves are geared at the younger set, so they aren't too crazy.4. There is a decent mix of songs for both boys and girls. And many songs have dancers of both genders.5. The lyrics and dance moves are sync'd very nicely with the music - no issues that another reviewer mentioned.6. It has good covers of recent teen hits such as Just the Way you Are and Dumb Love.7. This game seems to register better than with the Wii, but that is probably because of the better motion sensors in the Move.What she didn't:1. Quite a few songs targeted at really little kids were simply not interesting for her.2. The older songs were not familiar (though quite pleasant for reminiscing parents). The covers of recent music has much more of an impact and I wish they'd focused more on those.3. Some of the options feel gimmicky - the Freeze and Shake, for instance, where you must either keep your controller still or move it when prompted.As with any other kids game, the enjoyment depends on the kid ... so take this for what it's worth. But, the reason that we didn't rate this at a full 5 stars is that while the game was fun, Ubisoft seems to have forgotten that young children, like to play act to be older and cooler than their real ages. Including songs like \"Itsy Bitsy Spider\" ended up making this less than welcome to our daughter.I suspect she'd have enjoyed this far more had she received it about 2 years ago, and that she'd appreciate it even less a couple of years hence. In other words, going by my daughter's reactions this game probably would have more fun/replay value for children between 4 and 7, than for children between 8 and 10.Happy Dancing!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"V. Berk","summary":"Fine if you care more about multiplayer games","reviewText":"Halo 2 is a game that really starts well, but piddles out in the final acts of its single-player campaign.  The story of this game falls into clich&eacute;s and doesn't really try to surprise the gamer; most of the game is just predictable and offers far less replay value than its predecessor.The game just goes on, and on, and on without getting much done for its story, and aside from two levels taking place on Earth there aren't many levels that offer much in the ways of entertainment and replay value. Also, the feeling of the game feels very cheap, and light compared to its predecessor, which offered some legitimately intense gaming moments (such as the introduction of the Flood).  This game offers little worth remembering, aside from cool things you do on Xbox Live.  The game's single-player is just weak compared to the original game.  If this was the game we got in 2001 Xbox would have certainly been sunk.The character designs are a downgrade, I'm afraid to say.  The Marines units have been reduced to what I'd expect soldiers to be wearing in CNN newsreel footage and they do not look like they are from the future in any way.  This is just one of my many complaints about the feel of this game.  The first game you felt like you actually were serving a purpose and providing help (key word being \"help\") for the human forces.  Everything about this game can be summed up by \"Run in.  Shoot stuff. Cut scene. Repeat.\"  There never is really anything to challenge the gamer, other than whether or not he/she can shoot something enough that it dies, and then they have a clich&eacute; plot revolving around this concept (Serious, most of the missions you're goal is \"You must kill this dude/thing\").Halo 2 does offer some positive things.  The graphics are top notch, really improving upon the engines used in the previous game.  Visually a lot of work obviously went into making this game look good, and visually Halo 2 has little in the way of flaws.  It is probably one of the best games to look at in the original Xbox's inventory.  The main aspect of Halo 2 that makes it worth playing is the online multiplayer, and I do believe Bungie put more effort into this aspect of the game than the actual game's campaign.  However, if you're like me and seldom have access to Xbox Live you're gonna care more for the single-player campaign.It's a fun game especially for people who enjoy co-op and online multiplayer matches, but for someone looking for a thrilling 1st person experience such as that provided in the original game you'd best steer away from this game or lower your expectations.  That being said this game is 50x better than the rip-off that was Halo 3.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2009"}

Rhodes","summary":"Kingdom of Heaven!","reviewText":"Very rarely does a sequel out do the original, but Kingdom Hearts II manages to do it.  Not only does this improve on many aspects of the original, but it utilizes the same formula that worked very well in the first game.Once again you'll play as Sora visiting different sets of Disney worlds.  Each Disney world has its own plot that is very similar to that of the movies.  Some lines are even ripped straight from the movies.  That's not such a bad thing, of course.  At least for Disney fanatics.There's no doubt Kingdom Hearts II definitely improves on the gameplay.  Yes, it is still the same old hack and slash battle system of the original.  And yes, when you go into a world you'll go with Donald and Goofy, and be given a character to substitute. There have been a few additions, however, and they're welcome.  These tweaks have obviously been tuned up by Square-Enix.  Aside from being able to cast numerous spells and summon other disney characters, Kingdom Hearts II introduces limit breaks.  Where your entire party will perform a devastating attack.  It drains all your MP (of every character) but it's pretty darn powerful, and helps out.  The game also introduces drives which will have you combining with other characters to perform some devastating attacks.  These additions are welcome to the universe of Kingdom Hearts, despite the fact that the game is so easy you probably won't need them.  However, whenever there are small tweaks made to the gameplay they're welcome so long as it keeps the game interesting.There is a whole new set of Disney worlds introduced in Kingdom Hearts II.  Including the first Disney cartoon Steamboat Willie and Pirates of the Caribbean.  Each world, as I've noted has a smiliar plot and voice over to the movies.  This isn't so bad because the disney characters actually sound like their disney characters.  This is another strength of Kingdom Hearts II.  There's an all star voice-over cast.  You'll recognize the voices of characters and they're spot on.  For a game with as many voices as Kingdom Hearts, it's certainly nice to see that not a single voice is lackluster.  Some of the dialogue comes directly from the movies, and this probably won't bother Disney fanatics either.Although, for Square-Enix fans, I can't say the same for the Final Fantasy aspect of the game.  Final Fantasy characters aren't nearly as well fleshed out as Disney characters.  It's great that they're here and all, but they don't play an integral part in the storyline, and they're often given bad dialogue.  It's the only moment where you'll question Kingdom Hearts II.Graphically the game is solid.  Being one of the best looking on the Playstation 2.  Everything is vibrant and colorful and definitely has a great appeal.  Especially to people who enjoy Disney.  They've got the big feet, gloves and everything.  The final fantasy characters also look really good.  Even though some may not like that some of them look a little kiddie, it isn't really anything to be too upset about.  It's only keeping with the style of the game.Musically Kingdom Hearts II sounds great.  Most tunes you'll instantly recognize from your favorite Disney movie, and it'll be no surprise if you find yourself humming these tunes.  If you love Disney music, you'll love the music of this game.  The outside tunes also sound really great.Rarely is a second installment better than the first.  Kingdom Hearts II succeeds by improving the gameplay, and fixing a few things that kept the first one down such as the horrible camera angles.  While it could've used a bit more Final Fantasy influence, Kingdom Hearts II is a solid game.  Those who loved the first one will fall in love all over again with the second one.The Good+Outstanding graphics+Great Gameplay+Music is great+All-Star Voice Acting cast+A longer more fleshed out game than the first one+Several different worlds+New summon spellsThe Bad-The game is a little too easy.  Even though they've got these new, cool additions, you most likely won't need them.  You can easily hack and slash through everything-The Final Fantasy characters could've been put to better useThe game is fantastic.  Fans of the first one will absolutely love it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2006"}

It wallowed shamelessly on its grinding, its overblown violence and explosive pryotechnics. But whats come down the tube wrapped in the same packaging with a #2 on it is so... ordinary.Graphics are original Crackdown, with some additional cel shading on your player character, literally. 3 year old graphics, coming out of a develop that should still be sitting on a pile of gold from the initial games success. I've seen Oblivion mods that put more effort into improving backgrounds and other graphical elements.Gameplay is the formula you love. Jump, hit, and shoot like a superhero. The only problem is they've apparently decided that the only thing missing was areas that could be turned into a crater with a single stray shot. You have to spend five minutes clearing explosive barrels so that you aren't sent pinwheeling into the sky after 45 barrels all explode simultaneously. And while you're flying through the air, twenty enemies with semi-auto rocket launchers and pinpoint accurate grenade launchers will aid you in your sub-orbital flight. Again, otherwise, crackdown 1 gameplay. There are some new mini-games, but its basically go here and kill everything that moves. And some gratuitous finding missions. While those are as annoying as they ever are, they've at least made the concession that they're are fairly easy-to-spot markers to let you know something is nearby.Probably the most annoying thing is the announcer. I like me my achievements, but when you're getting one every 30 minutes, and having it all but rubbed on your face, its loses anything resembling a feeling of achievement. \"Your first agility orb? Achievement!\" \"You fired a new weapon? Achievement!\" \"You managed to operate a toilet unaided? Achievement!\"Story is where is game runs straight down the tubes. After an opening cut scene, they is nothing in the way of briefings. You have one target, not the normal gang dossiers, and otherwise, one mission: kill stuff in this location, and move to another location. Not surprising, but when you're performing the exact same actions and just changing backgrounds, with nothing backing it up, it starts to feel like quest grinding.Overall, Crackdown 2 is a clone of the original with pieces removed. That alone makes it a massive disappointment. So little effort was put into this to make it almost insulting that it took 3 years to complete. Apparently the thought was that removing story and making virtually every action warrant an achievement would gloss over the fact that all they did was add a multiplayer function, but what comes out it just a time waster. It may be just as much raw fun as the first, running, racing and blowing up stuff to your hearts content, but it feels like a empty husk of something that used to be great.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2010"}

Garrelts","summary":"One of the Finest Titles on the PS3","reviewText":"Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is easily one of the finest titles found on the PS3 and on all current generation systems. Production value is through the roof and the entire game has a high quality polished feel to it.Graphics shine and truly stand out amongst the best any platform has to offer. Environments vary from lush tropics to deserted military bases to ancient ruins. Every step of the way and around every corner you'll find yourself stopping to admire the scenery.The voice acting featured in Uncharted really stands as some of the best found in games period. The character interactions draw you into the story and encourage you to push on to see what's next. Sound effects are carried out well and the musical score is understated but thumps when the action heats up.Gameplay, one area that often thumps the best of developers is tight in Uncharted. The controls are always responsive and the platforming elements are a joy to play because of it.All told the game will take average gamers anywhere from 8-15 hours to finish on it's 'Normal' difficulty setting. There is reason enough to dive back into the game, however, as the developer has included all kinds of unlockable extras. Everything from new character costumes to enemy skins to weapons and making of videos. I really haven't seen a console game offer so much extra content. The addition of trophy support also encourages players to replay the game on higher difficulty levels.Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is a must play for any PS3 owner!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0050SX7BQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Cool Chris \"Cool C\"","summary":"Love the story, but....","reviewText":"This is perhaps one of the better \"Story Telling\" game I've ever played.  To be fair, I want to say this game is excellent made and the graphics are simply astounding.  However, like all games there are always some negatives.As a disclosure, I did not purchase this game because I know it has low \"replayability\".  I rented the game and complete the entire game in under 8 hours.The PlotBasically you play as Jodie who had an entity (soul) who attached to her since she was a little girl.  The entity, Aiden, helped her in many ways to achieve a lot of her goals.  Jodie herself is well trained, but she is not a warrior in anyway.  You play as Jodie from young age (4/5 age) until she is all grown up in her early twenties.  The plot itself is not too bad but the way the story is told similar to \"flashbacks\".  You are being transported from one chapter in her life (late teen) to another chapter in her life when she was 6 years old.  The back and forth between the years could be annoying at times.  The writers of the game try to put the player on several path to complete the storyboard.  The game itself is very linear and there are no deviations.  It is fun in a way, but it does not put the player in any control other than \"do this, then do that.\"The ControlsThe controls are a little bit scratch-in-the-head.  It is unusual to say the least.  Other than using the normal navigation joystick, everything is done with little or no feedback.  The entire game basicall uses quick-time-events.  You can't customize the controls and there is no much feedback if you are doing it correctly other than the cue from the game.  It gets worse halfway down the game when I start to feel cramps on my hand.The GraphicsThis is perhaps the most beautiful sculpted game ever.  The graphics, especially the close-ups on faces are so well done that sometimes I wonder if Jodie is a real person.  WIlhem Dafoe was correctly recreated in digital format.  The environment, especially heavy snow in NYC, was so well done that you could immmerse in its surrounding.The CombatAt the beginning of the game, there is the training on CQB.  Looks easy at first, but during the gameplay, it is confusing.  Some of the combat scene requires Jodie to block.  But the way the slow-mo was presented, you can't tell if Jodie is supposed to evade or assault.  Regardless, the game is linear and there is no way you will die.Now, the BadThere are a few scenes that I find unnecessary.  These are what I called \"fillers.\"  The Navajo chapter is totally a waste of time.  I played the entire chapter and I could not find the connection with the entire game other than closing the portal to the other world.  How did Jodie end up there, clueless.  At the end, she was invited to stay, but I could not find any emotion connection to the two brothers.  The other filler is the homeless chapter.  The heavy snow is eye candy, but the entire sequence is just plain boring.  The worst part is helping to deliver a baby. What?  The dinner chapter is a pure nonsense.  Why would a game ask you to cook for dinner?  At the end of the game, Jodie needs to pick an ending. With no emotional connection to the Navajo or the homeless, picking the ending is already made for you.Worth the Price?Hardly.  I love playing story game such as Uncharted.  This game is fun if you don't mind some of its flaw.  But don't expect that you want to replay this game to see a different outcome.  The game is so linear that once you know the plot, nothing is fun but predictable.  Personally I would not pay $60 to play a movie.  If you can, go and rent it from Red***.  Cost me only $8.  Still, I still give it a 4 stars because it was well-made.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2013"}

When you kill a dragon, you absorb their soul to become more powerful.  Which is perfect timing because the dragons have returned to Skyrim!  Compared to the previous Elder Scrolls games, Skyrim streamlines the combat, offers a gorgeous, large expanse to explore (Skyrim), and presents players with many different play style options and stories to explore.+Mod support - Steam streamlines this with ease using their Steam Workshop mod community.  There are hundreds of mods to choose from, which can be overwhelming at first, but the ability to search for the top rated and look at comments really helps to decide.+Gorgeous graphics (that can be further enhanced with mods).  The ambience is incredible.  Trees swaying, babbling brooks, the mountains off in the distance. The textures are high resolution (with the patch), so if your PC can handle, grab it.  There are mods, as listed above, that further improve the textures to make the game more magnificent.+Deep character customization.  The player is given a wealth of racial choices and can pick hair, face, tweak the way they look and the color palette.  Different weapons and armors further enhance a character and their abilities.+Can be played first person or 3rd person.  The first person is certainly the main way to play, but it's nice to have a 3rd person perspective so the player can see their awesome new armor, or even their new weapon.  With the variety of armors, it is nice to see the character skulking about in dark leather, or rushing at the foe clad in still or ebony.  The player can switch perspectives on the fly with a single button press.+Combat is visceral and killing blow scenes are a nicely done (and can be toggled to occur more or less frequently).  You feel like you connect when you swing at an enemy.  When you are especially deadly, the game will go into a third person camera shot, slow motion and all, of the enemy being destroyed by the player's weapon.+Lots of locations to explore.  It's easy to get off track as you make your way to the next location.  Houses, dungeons, caves, and all sorts of other places to get lost in are scattered about the land.  A player could easily spend a hundred hours trying to explore every location in the game.+The world is inhabited with MANY citizens and enemies that have their own schedules and motives.  Blacksmiths work by day, and by night go inside to eat and sleep.  Enemies guard their hideouts and if they hear suspicious noises they come looking.+Can recruit varying ally characters who will travel with the main character and assist in combat.  There are various allies, with different ability and focuses (like ranged, melee, or magic) that can compliment any player's style of play.  The only drawback is they don't have much of a backstory, and are simply in this world as an aimless adventurer.+Multitude of skill trees to customize the character.  A character can spread their skills out to be a jack of all trades, or specialize and become very powerful.  Most (if not all) skills have several levels as well, allowing the player to invest in upgrading that skill to be more potent.  For instance, the first skill in the archery tree upgrades damage %, starting with 20% and adding 20% each time for a maximum of 5 levels.  Many abilities need a minimum skill level to unlock, so use your favorites as much as possible!+Fast Travel to expedite moving from one place to another (which doesn't have to be utilized of course).  If you don't like fast traveling, you don't have to use it.  Some mods even remove it from the game.  Whether you select a destination and travel on foot, or buy passage on a wagon, you can be sure that you'll get to your destination swiftly.+An interesting story line that pits the player against giant dragons.  The dragonborn have arrived and has to defeat the threat of the dragons that have suddenly reappared in Skyrim.  This will take them all over the land and even into the halls of Sovngarde, the place where heroes go when they die.  If dragons weren't enough, there is a civil war brewing between the Imperials and the Nords.  Which side will you choose?+Tons of side quests and lore to uncover.  Books have a lot of information and even contain stories.  Notes reveal plans, traps, what enemies were doing or looking, and many other tidbits.  Quests reveal backstory on different factions and how everything fits together.+Can purchase houses to store loot, hang trophies, craft, and visit your wife/husband (if you decide to marry).  These can be upgraded to include crafting stations and more storage space.+ Expansion Downloadable Content (DLC) of varying degrees of quality.  Hearthfire is the least popular, with Dragonborn being the best.  Dawnguard rests in the middle, being good but not fantastic.The game is not perfect though.-Shallow guild quests.  Unlike Oblivion which had fantastic guild quests, these do not have much depth and up end being rather bland.-Originally had many bugs, (but most have been eliminated so this isn't really a con).  As long you are patched, you shouldn't experience much trouble.  I've had the game since launch and never encountered any bugs.-Magic is still restrictive compared to Morrowind (there are no fly spells for instance).  Many spells feel or look the same.  They aren't all bad though, and some have very interesting effects.  Note: there are a wealth of mods for Skryim that change or add spells to the game.-Crafting is quite shallow and can be tedious.  The player can advance to max level by crafting the same item over and over again.-A non-modded version of the game scales with the player removing any type of danger from entering a strange crypt because all enemies (and loot) will be of the same level.  The issue I have with this is the sense of danger with exploration is removed.  As always, mods can greatly help alleviate this sense of security.**Review Overview**Story: 3/5, it's good but does nothing exceptionally surprising.  One of my biggest gripes is there is a whole civil war story that doesn't really go anywhere.Quests: The side quests and stories are a 4/5 seeing as how some are spectacular and really give a sense of a living world to the story, though there are some quests that are bland and boring.Exploration: 5/5 - This is the real content of Skyrim, like any Elder Scrolls game, is the action, lore and exploration.  Dungeons, ruins, abandoned houses, towns, crypts, lairs, mountains, forests, etc are all scattered about the game.Graphics: 5/5 - absolutely beautiful and can be further enhanced.Audio: 5/5 - swords clash, arrows wiz by, footsteps can be heard as character rush through forests, streams babble, and a great score helps set the mood.There is no online component, it's a single player experience.Overall, this game is a solid 5/5.  The replayability is nearly infinite with mod support and such a vast land to discover, there is so much to do and it is downright fun to explore and fight through all of Skyrim.**Please note that the installation of Skyrim requires Steam, which forces the user to be online to download and install the game.  Once installed, the game can be played offline.  There is a workaround for those who have bad bandwidths and can install from the disk.  If you have any questions, please leave a comment.**I'm receiving feedback that my review is not helpful.  Please leave a comment with what pieces are not clear or that need further clarification.  I've spent over 200 hours playing, so I'll be happy to answer any questions you have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2013"}

If you love platformers, then I can't see how you wouldn't like this.  And as for the presentation of the game?  Wow.  I can't think of any game that's done it better.  The whole game is presented as if you were at a theatre watching a performance (the red curtains, the stage, the PA announcer, it has everything).  So many little details that just add to the perfection of this game.And again, as for gameplay, it's very fun and very addicting.  The levels stretch both horizontal and vertical, and you gain special powers as you progress.

{"product_name":"B0045FEEAS","description":"","reviewerName":"ITBeast \"ITBeast\"","summary":"My 1st Gaming Console in almost 30 years - A Classic Gamers Journey","reviewText":"My First Video Game Console was almost 30 years ago; it still seems not that long however when I got my very 1st one. It was Christmas Day in 1981, I was 11 years old. My Brother and I received from under our Christmas tree from Santa Clause the item both me and brother had been dreaming about for well over a year, an Atari VCS (Video Computer System, now just called the Atari 2600). With the initial 11 game cartridges we got with it we played that game system all day long until we were to physically impaired to play with it anymore that day. Up to this point the Atari 2600 had ruled the Video Game Roost for well over 4 years and when me and my brother had received the game console it was to be its last year as number#1. Even with its poor arcade ports and original Video Game releases (Pac-Man and E.T. anyone) it was still fun to play with and I still have a working Atari 2600 game unit and I believe 80 game cartridges for it that operate perfectly.My 2nd Video Game Console came the following year again on Christmas Day in 1982; Santa had brought us another gaming system. My brother and I had seen a demo of another Video Game Console that had literally blew our minds. The Graphics of this Game Console were almost identical to its arcade counterparts and far superior to the Atari 2600 (The Atari 2600 used a modified 8-bit processor of the MOS6502 called the 6507; which had fewer pins and, as a result, could address only 8 KB of memory). The Game Console was the Colecovision and the game we had seen that day was Donkey Kong. This was the 1st 8-bit Video Game System ever released that it's Video Game ports along with games designed for the console had the almost arcade quality to it (The ColecoVision used a Zilog Z80A 8 bit processor witch did not have that constraints that the Atari 2600's processor had). For the 1st time it caused direct competition to the Atari's 2600 console and destroyed it's fledging Successor the Atari 5200. It was very much in demand that year and the 1st part of the next. Even by today's standards the games for it still emulate the Arcade Game Consoles of that time period almost perfectly. As with the Atari 2600, I still have a working Colecovision Console and about 45 Games for it.That following year, unbeknownst to me, the Video Game Crash of 1983 (Also sometimes referred as the Video Game Crash of 1984) had come to pass. Largely in part because of Atari and all the cheaply made game cartridges that they had produced and flooded the gaming market with; along with a bunch of small time 3rd party Vendors that was by this time cranking out the poorley made games worse than Atari itself. With the exception of Activision and Imagic, witch had actually produced quality games for the Atari 2600 console. Near the end Atari itself had finally starting producing quality gaming merchandise at this point, But as the saying goes \"To Little, To Late\". This unfortunately effectively ended all the 2nd generation game systems of the time including the Colecovision until the Nintendo NES was released in the US in 1985 starting the 3rd Generation Game Consoles and reviving the Video Gaming Industry.Present Time:Christmas was once again comming around, The Time was now right to buy a Video Game Console for the family (and 28 years later my 3rd), the final 2 contestants that my family had narrowed down to was the Sony PS3 and the Nintendo Wii. While the Sony PS3 is by all rights just as good as the Wii and technically slightly better in a few areas the 2 major areas is why we ended up going with Wii...1 - The current Sony PS3 Move console (Sony's new emulation of the Nintendo Wii's motion controls) was $399 for the initial Game Console Hardware, Not including the almost $70 to $90 a pop for the games, or extra controls. The Higher maintenance cost was one of our Major obstacles for the Sony PS3.2 - The Games for the Sony PS3 are mainly more centralized for the hardcore Gamer; we wanted a well rounded family console that offered games in all categories and age including an emphasis Physical Fitness.What comes with the Wii Game Console (This applies to the Red Console Only):- The Wii Console- 1 Wii Remote w/built in motion plus and knun chuk- 1 set of Nintendo Wii RCA Video-Audio Cables- 2 pack-in games (Wii Sports Resort and Super Mario Wii)- Nintendo Wii Console Instruction ManuelRecommended additional equipment (Unfortunately sold separately)- Additional Wii Remote w/built in motion plus and knun chuk- Nintendo Wii HD Component cables for the full 480p HD- Wii Remote Battery Pack and Charger for each Wii Remote (They do finish normal AA batteries rather quickly)- SD Flash Card for additional Memory, the max size is 32gb (Wii Console only has 512mb built-in)There is additional equipment you can buy, but it is not necessary at this point and can be gotten later. This will be more than enough to get the full fun for now.Game Play:Never thought I say this, coming from the 2nd generation video gaming era but I'm having an awesome time playing the Wii console. At 1st glance the controls look complicated but are not, I was able to master the controls (Of course my kids mastered it faster). It actually works better to play most of the Wii games in a standing position and play into the games. However, there still those Wii games and GameCube Games (Yes if you did not know the Wii is backward compatible with The Nintendo GameCube) that you can still play traditionally Indian style or in your recliner.Console Features:- WI-FI LAN Network Ready: The Wii has a built-in WiFi Network Card that will support encryption up to WPA2 Personal Only (I ended up having to bring my Wireless Network encryption settings down a notch so the Wii could connect into my existing Network). Depending on your Wireless Network Settings you may need to take this into consideration, for most people this may not even be an issue.- Backwards Compatible with Nintendo GameCube Games: The Wii is fully backwards compatible with any of Nintendo's previous game console. However, you will need a GameCube controller in order to play them. The Wii supports up to 4 GameCube controllers including the GameCube Memory stick for any saved games.- 512mb built-in system memory, can be expanded by adding an SD Flash Card (Up to 32gb): I would heavily recommend buying the SD Flash Card upon buying your game system (Even if it's a 4 or 8gb size card), The Built-in System Memory will fill up fast and when you start buying those virtual games, you will definitely want that separate from your system memory. I ended up just biting the bullet and buying the 32gb Flash Card, It was around $50.- Mii Characters: You can make your own Virtual Characters for yourself that can be played with most of the Wii Sports games called Mii's. The can also be shared across the internet.- The Wii Virtual Store: You can download games from Nintendo's previous games consoles (Going all the way back to the NES) by buying points using your Credit Card. For Disaster recovery and space availability I would insure you download directly to your SD Flash Card and Not the Wii's System Memory.*** PLEASE NOTE: there is a catch that you need to be aware of (Please read the next section under \"What the Wii will not do\")***.- Wii Channels: Will display the weather and current news via the Wii menu- Netflix: Your Wii console can now stream any available movie through your TV via the Wii using the Netflix service (You have to sign up for a Netflix account, for basic streaming its about $9 a month).What the Wii does not do:- As I am sure you by now know that the Wii will only display up to 480p HD natively by using the Wii Component Cables. Nor will the Wii plug into a HDMI port natively either. However, there are now 3rd party converters out there that can upscale the picture to 720p and make it possible to plug into a HDMI plug port as well. There are also 3rd party cables available that will plug Wii component cables into HDMI plugs.- The Wii will not plug into your Home Entertainment/Theatre amplifier natively either. However, this can be circumvented as well (I did).- The Wii will only play GameCube formatted Mini-DVD optical discs and Wii formatted DVD optical Discs. The Wii will not play Normal DVD Discs (Movie Media or Data) and does not Support Blu-Ray Discs period.- Does not have Cat5/6 Built-in LAN NIC (Network Interface Card): While this can still be done by buying the USB add-on, it is a real pain to find plus you end up having to pay an extra 20-30 dollars. It would have made my Network setup easier and not have to bring down my Network encryption Level.- Any of your purchased Virtual Console/WiiWare games CANNOT be transfered to a new replacement Wii (Or even a duplicate Wii within your house) on your own (Even if you copied/backed them up on a SD Flash Card separate from the system memory). Nintendo purposely encrypts/tie's in your WiiWare games to the Wii Console you purchased/downloaded them on. Your Wii has to be damaged and Nintendo requests that in order for a transfer to a new Wii to take place you have to send in the broken unit and it has to be under warranty. If you're not covered under a warranty you're out of luck (unless you pay an authorized Nintendo reseller to fix it). So to sum it up, you might end up paying to re download them to a replacement or duplicate Wii console.Technical Review:- Only displays in either 480i or 480p, As long as you buy the Wii component cables and use a HDTV you still get a great picture with vibrant colors. Plus, as mentioned earlier you can buy a 3rd party converter to upscale the picture to 720p if you really need to.- Has 5.1 Stereo Surround Sound that is awesome when playing any of the games. For the full experience insure you plug into your Home Entertainment/Theatre system, while you cannot do it natively it can be done.- The Wii Remotes (especially the ones with the Motion plus Sensors) work awesome and seriously increases the game play.Technical Flaw:- The Wii's Media Rom is not properly shielded to prevent magnetic interference from the Rom while in use and will affect other devices if you place the Wii near them during game play(I.E. TV's, Computers, DVD Players, etc...). In my case it affected the Video Card on my MediaCenter PC. I ended up just moving the Wii to somewhere it would not affect the other equipment.Setup:If you're doing a Basic Setup (Just plugging the console into your TV and setting the Wi-Fi to no or little encryption) you should have it up in no time. However more complicated the entertainment center can increase the chance of more time in the setup.Either way when you have completed setting the system up insure you 1st update the system firmware (See the instruction manual for further guidance). This will insure whatever bugs the system had while sitting in the box will not be your problem when you go to use it.Overall:I would highly recommend this game system to anyone, there are literally hundreds to Thousands of games to choose from (Including the GameCube catalog). However I may put more of an emphasis on the Family model over the straight Gamer personality for this particular Video Game Console System.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2011"}

Well, there has been a generation that probably hasn't stopped playing since their childhood, and that is for most of the past 3-4 decades... it is really therapeutic ...and the DS facilitates a segment of that market by bringing us games such asHotel Dusk or the Phoenix Wright series...it's akin to reading a good book, except that it's interactive and requires some problem solving which is what makes it so stimulating & engaging. The sense of intrigue is successfully infused throughout the game and hangs in the air... With a well-developed storyline, the story not just requires exploration, sleuth-work, some strategic thinking and rather sophisticated interaction with its myriad of very believable characters  - not your average cutesy caricatures in children's stories but real-life worn (some cynical) characters.

I'm not sure if the games really help your eyes, but it uses graphs to make it easy to determine the strengths and weaknessses of your vision.  For example, my eye movement is superb, but my momentary vision isn't so good.  The graghs also show how you have improved and how you've gotten worse.  It also gives you an eye age check.  If you're eye age is the same as your regular age, your vision is normal.  If it's above your age, then you have a lot of room for improvement.  If your eye age is lower, then your vision is good.

There is no reason for any Vita owner to ignore this game; you have to buy it to see what it's all about. Granted, I think Ubisoft should have been a little more bold and addressed some of the understated issues in the game, but I can understand why they were afraid of offending anyone.The game is amazing, the fighting is engage, the missions are to the point and the costume changes are so very cool. Plus, it looks great, and the Vita is an amazing system; perfect for this game.Now I understand that I'll probably need a bigger memory card, but since I only have one game at the moment, I'm not too worried about it. I bought a Light Pink case to cover the important parts, but I am worried about the finger prints. For those that believe it is \"too much\", keep in mind that Day One Vita buyers had to get EVERYTHING separately, so $250 (for Wi-Fi) + $20 for the 4 GB card + $40 for a game. That means we got $60 worth of free stuff. I'm definitely not complaining, >_&lt;I hope more people buy this bundle so that the Vita does better.

In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City.

Similar to Sony's Uncharted Franchise except instead of feeling like you're in a summer blockbuster movie you are a Comic book character trying to resolve the moral dilemmas of your new found \"Super Powers\".A Brief synopsis's of the game: You're a courier by the name of Cole, while delivering a mysterious package to an unknown address the package blows up and literally turns the city you live into a post apocalypse nightmare. Instead of being incinerated by the explosion you somehow survive (after being at ground zero no less) and are nursed back to health by your girlfriend Trish(who happens to be an EMT) and your best friend Zeke. To further complicate things even more the government has decided to put your city in a Bio quarantine status (meaning no one enters or more importantly leaves), the city is similar to New York's Manhattan Island. During your recoperation you learn to master your new found gift's (Cole's Powers are similar to that of Marvel's Electro mixed in with the strength and endurance of Captain America) and eventually set out to find out the truth behind the people who had Cole deliver the mysterious package.Again, what I love most about this game it truly plays out like a Marvel Comic Book meaning that your given a character that most decide to either keep to his moral convictions or spiral down to a much darker path. The game allows you to freely choose between a \"Good\" path or a \"Dark\" path with decisions you will have to make during different areas of the game. While the story is pretty much the same thru out with whatever path you choose it does alter certain aspects of how the game will end once you have completed it. So in the End you will either be labeled as a \"Hero\" or just \"InFamous\".Both me and my son have spent countless hours playing this game and are not even near being done, I will probably pickup the 2nd game once we have completely this one. I would highly recommend this game for anybody who wants countless hours of fun and are big comic book readers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2012"}

Mags, the trucks that drive nice and are basically tanks are really hard to come across but are indeed in the game.and the co-op, oh the co-op, if i went to a game designer i could not have asked for better co-op, every mission and activity can be done co-op, free roaming is co-op, and there's no limit to where you can be. i set up with a sniper rifle on a hill while my friend did street races and i just wasted the other cars in the race. he got credit and i got to blow up cars. win/win. the cheats also work co-op though if a cheater joins your game and uses a cheat code it will void your acheivements unless you reload. which isn't a big deal playing with your friends.to anyone who gave gta a perfect 10, i'd like to introduce you to a better game called saints row 2","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2009"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E1JS","description":"","reviewerName":"dgdbear \"David\"","summary":"MK Back to the Glory Days","reviewText":"BEST FEATURES: A Mortal Kombat game that actually feels like a fighting game. Excellent story. Varied stage design. Ridiculously gory. Good voice acting.WORST FEATURES: Fighting engine could still use some refinement. Online mode requires few tweaks.To me, Mortal Kombat has never been a shining star in the fighting game genre. The series certainly helped put the genre on the map during the early 90s and whipped up a storm of controversy over its unabashed display of blood and brutality but for me...it's never been all \"there\". With each progressive installment, the flaws of the game were made ever clearer. I often say a fighting game must be more than two people just hitting each other, which is a shadow Mortal Kombat has, in my eyes, always been under. So, after nearly 20 years of unflinching opinion, why am I playing this latest installment?Graphics: 9Mortal Kombat is built on the Unreal Engine 3, the same framework that powered the previous MK game, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. Though that game had to scale back its violent content to meet the \"T\" rating, Mortal Kombat pulls no punches and uses the full range of the Unreal Engine 3 to drape the game in crimson. The visible damage the fighters can sustain in this game is nearly disturbing, with large gaping holes of flesh left behind after a vicious battle. Each fighter (or \"kombatant\") also has a full skeletal and muscular system modeled, which is painfully fractured whenever they are hit by an X-Ray attack. The animation is smoother and more natural than any previous MK game (where fighters would stiffly swing their limbs in a chop-socky way that did nothing to resemble a death match between two trained fighters). The finishing moves are more visceral and unsettling than ever, which is the way it should be. All of the environments are ornately designed with a beautiful-yet-intimidating aesthetic that harkens back to the first two titles. My only real qualm with the graphics is the injuries on the fighters does not look as good up close (looking like they were pasted onto the model), but this is only possible when viewing the static model.Sound/Music: 8The crunch of bones and the tearing of flesh...this is definitely Mortal Kombat. The sound effects in this game are harsh but poetic, profoundly conveying the raw unrestrained fury of battle. The voice acting in this game is natural and well-scripted. Netherrealm Studios hired a good batch of actors to fill the personalities behind the cast and it helps with the cinematic storytelling of the Story Mode. The music is very reminiscent of the Mortal Kombat II soundtrack with an Eastern-techno blend that fits the setting of the game well. The music could be a bit more varied (I would have liked more strictly Eastern themes applied to the Mortal Kombat 1-inspired arenas as that game in particular had a very strong kung fu-movie vibe to it and I'd like them to bring that back to the series) but in all it's eclectic and appropriate.Control: 9In previous Mortal Kombat games, I felt the control had been very spotty. Rapidly tapping punch would swing your character's arms back and forth with no semblance of dexterity. In later installments, combos were executed by tapping in pre-scripted series of button commands with no variation possible. In addition, maneuverability felt limited and sluggish (the Run button introduced in the third game was supposed to alleviate this but it merely made the game more rushdown heavy). Concepts like pokes or zoning, staples of the fighting genre, were difficult to apply at best and simply nonexistent at worst. But the arrival of this game finally wipes that slate clean. The controls in this game are tight and smooth. Quick movement is possible and the fighters feel responsive in this installment. The more strategic gameplay, rife with pokes and setups, bring to life epic battles that elevate beyond back-and-forth blocking and striking. Long, player-controlled combos are a large focus of this game and without the smoother controls, they simply wouldn't be possible. This is certainly one of the largest areas of improvement over previous efforts in this series and a major point for anyone looking to try the game.Gameplay: 8The main theme of this installment of Mortal Kombat is \"mending the past\" and to that end, it has succeeded on virtually every front. The main modes of play in Mortal Kombat are the Arcade Ladder, Story Mode, and the Challenge Tower. Arcade Ladder can be played alone or, for the first time, with another character in a tag team 2v2 mode. Challenge Tower presents players with a 300-tier assortment of special-condition fights, minigames, and other tasks. Story Mode, however, is the main attraction of the single-player experience. The story is played similarly to Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe wherein players will use every character, dedicating a chapter to each playable cast member. The Story Mode seamlessly integrates cutscene and gameplay where conversations with characters will move from a full-motion video to in-game rendering and straight into the next battle. The story in Mortal Kombat has always been one of the few attractive aspects of the franchise for me and once again they deliver a solid narrative. Raiden, having been defeated at the end of Mortal Kombat Armageddon, realizes that he must avert the terrible disaster and sends a telepathic message to his past self in order to set things right. The story plays out between the original Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat 3 but with an altered course of events due to Raiden's premonition. The roster features every fighter that participated in these events (though minus Rain or Motaro; Motaro has some brief cameos during Story Mode cutscenes but is absent as a participant) with revamped and expanded movelists. Moving away from the gameplay modes, the in-game experience is likewise tightened down. Unlike the last few series outings, which have been fully 3D games, the fights are firmly rooted in the 2D plane (which is my favorite way to fight). The button layout is no longer High/Low punches and kicks but limb-assigned Front and Back. Rather than \"dial-a-combos\" that can't be broken down into individual hits, characters have unique move strings similar to Tekken that they can freely break to link to other moves. Characters can now dash back and forth, removing the need for a dedicated Run button and allowing for advanced mobility with smarter defense. A major new feature for this game is the Super meter; a three-segmented bar that can power up your fighter in several ways. With one stock, your fighter can exchange it for an enhanced special move that can take on additional properties over the normal version. Two stocks will grant the ability to break out of one combo and three stocks unlock the almighty \"X-Ray\"; a literal bone-shattering attack that does considerable damage while showcasing the internal damage your victim is suffering. The brutal X-Ray attacks were root of this game's notoriety leading up to its release and are both violent and tactical, with no two having the exact same application. Moving into the tag mode introduces partner commands (such as calling in assists) that encourage strategic and effective team-ups with characters who can work well together and accentuate strengths. Mortal Kombat has never felt this deep and I must applaud Netherrealm Studios for paying attention to the \"hardcore\" players when crafting this game. Of course, one of the hallmarks of the series is the violent \"Fatality\" finishing moves and they are more gruesome than ever. Ever since Mortal Kombat 3, I felt the game's cold-blooded and brutal atmosphere has been lost to spectacle and flashiness (something that was even starting to appear as far back as II) but this game has at least returned the harsh brutality to the series. The fighting gameplay isn't without its faults (the flow of the fight favors being defensive due to a lot of attacks having heavy recovery times and a couple moves are difficult to outrun; some combos are overly damaging as well) but the more up-tempo mechanics ensure that Mortal Kombat is no longer just \"that game with the Fatalities\".Replay Value: 8Something Mortal Kombat is known for (aside from its violence) is the vast array of secret and hidden features. From hidden battles to minigames, there is always a reason to put another quarter in the machine if you know what you're looking for. This game has a wealth of extra activities to keep you busy when not working on your technique (which is inevitably the ultimate value for a good fighting game). Story Mode is a good six to eight hour experience with a captivating cinematic experience. The Challenge Tower and its 300 levels will alone provide many hours for dedicated players (with a sexy surprise waiting at the top). Throughout the game you can earn \"Koins\", which are spent in the Krypt for extra content (such as artwork and music). This alone will eat up much of your time as there are miles and miles of unlockable content. If you have a group of friends over, up to four players can participate in 2v2 tag battles. When you're ready to take your skills online, you can participate in ranked and unranked battles. Single and tag matches are available as well as a \"King of the Hill\" mode, which attempts to replicate the experience of being at the arcade with a spectator rating system to boo or cheer the fighters. The online mode could use some improvement (such as being able to see an opponent's connection strength and to decline matches if the connection is not good enough) but the competition has been capable. The game does use an Online Pass system, though, which is something I personally do not agree with (I don't really like anything that might interfere with online play, though it's not a big reason to not purchase this game). In the end, a fighting game's replay value is always best judged by how worthwhile it is to improve your talent and in that regard, Mortal Kombat finally has earned its keep.Overall: 8.5If I was rating the effort the developers put forth in this game, I'd be more than willing to award an 11. There is no way anyone can refute that Netherrealm Studios have taken Mortal Kombat to a new place with this installment. Both in terms of fighting depth and absurd violence, Mortal Kombat not only puts the series back on track but finally has the solid gameplay foundation to go with it. The developers learned what worked and what didn't in previous entries and have refined the formula as a result. They have not yet reached the ceiling yet so I won't call it a \"flawless victory\" but what has been established gives the series a fantastic new beginning. Graphics are sharp, animation is smooth, and most importantly; the control is better than ever. Since the series is now owned by Warner Bros. I expect to see follow-ups in the future and if they can build on what was introduced in this game, there is no doubt that Mortal Kombat will be a heated contender in the fighting genre. I highly recommend looking into Mortal Kombat, provided you aren't put off by the heavy violence. There was a time that I scoffed at the idea a western-developed fighting game could ever run shoulder-to-shoulder with games like Street Fighter or The King of Fighters but the times, they are a changin'.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2011"}

Gordon","summary":"A Good Example of What A Sequel Should Do","reviewText":"There's an unfortunate trend in action games nowadays: dividing content in a game so that it favors either fans of single-player gaming or multiplayer gaming (more so towards the latter in many high-profile franchises), but rarely letting fans of both feel like they're getting the most out of the whole experience.  Often, the multiplayer experience is useless to those who are offline, or is just not that enjoyable for those who don't have the time or lack of interruptions to go through a series of matches without being seen as a quitter or bad team-mate.  The good news is that Gears of War 2 is not one of those games; in fact, each of the 3 core experiences (Campaign, Multiplayer, and Horde Mode) can be enjoyed to some extent either alone or with other players.  Sure, a botmatch will never really have the same level of excitement as an online match against real people, but it still beats not being able to get any enjoyment out of the multiplayer part of the game.For those who aren't familiar with the Gears of War franchise, the first Gears of War was a different take on the kind of testosterone-laced, big-budget action gaming genre dominated by the likes of Halo, Call of Duty, and other such shooters.  Coming out in 2006, it was in effect the big unveiling of Epic Games' Unreal 3 engine.  As opposed to most other shooters, Gears of War eliminated the ability to jump, and instead placed an emphasis on taking cover and third-person gunplay.  You followed a group of ridiculously steroid-enhanced, armor-clad soldiers on a planet where humanity is beseiged by a mutated army (the Locust) rising up from the underground as they try to locate a high-tech bomb over the course of a couple of days, and deploy it against the Locust forces.  While Gears of War wasn't the first game to use the cover and shoot mechanic (see Killswitch or 007: Everything or Nothing), it did popularize it greatly, and attached glossy production values to the gameplay.  The problem was that the game felt more like a tech demo at times, and didn't have the scope of say, the original Halo: Combat Evolved.  The game felt somewhat abbreviated, and attempts to provide variety, such as a lone nighttime vehicular section, or avoiding darkened areas where light-sensitive flying swarms attack, felt somewhat undercooked.Gears of War 2's campaign, on the other hand, feels like a game first, and tech showcase second.  Taking a page from the Call of Duty franchise, GOW 2 moves the player through what seems to be a constantly changing series of events, while still keeping the core gameplay concepts intact.  To this player, the shifts away from the 3rd person, cover-based firefights are much more smoothly integrated into the game, whether they involve riding shotgun on a huge, mobile drill as it advances through mountainous terrain, driving a tank across an ice-covered lake, or flying a monstrous creature in a surprisingly entertaining rail-shooter segment.  Whether fighting it out through delapidated city streets, exploring a snow-covered village, advancing through enormous underground citadels, or attempting to make it out of a creepy, weed-overgrown, Resident Evil-inspired abandoned facility in the middle of a metallic hailstorm, the situations you're placed seem to neither last too short a time, nor overstay their welcome.  In fact, only the very ending battle is a letdown, in that it is too easily won.  While the somewhat clunky speed you move at takes some getting used to, the game is otherwise smoothly executed, with one notable improvement being the ability to grab still-living enemies and use them as shields.  As before, the campaign can be played co-operatively, although this time co-op is more smoothly executed.  While the game is as linear as it gets, there's nothing wrong with that here.  It's an over-the-top, ridiculous thrill ride, that's not meant to wax poetic on the nature of humanity (although there's one surprisingly effective scene that I won't spoil which stands out from the rest of the overly macho gruntfest that characterizes the story).A new addition to the franchise is Horde mode, which lets either a lone player (in Training Ground mode) or a team of players try to survive as long as possible against an onslaught of enemies, while racking up points.  In many ways, this is like a modern, 3D take on Smash TV, but with more organic settings.  The mode was influential enough for Bungie to take notice, and add a similar \"Firefight\" mode to Halo Reach and Halo 3: ODST.  The multiplayer modes, which can be played offline with bots by a single player within the Training Grounds menu, are team-oriented, and include modes such as King of the Hill and Submission (aka \"Meatflag\").If there's a negative about the game, it's that it popularized the use of \"Day 1\" downloadable content; in other words, content that was taken out of the game (in this case, 5 multiplayer/horde maps), and has to be downloaded using a 1-time use code linked to your gamertag.  Ostensibly, this is to create an incentive to buy the game new, which is understandable.  However, as we've seen, this idea has snowballed out of control once other developers started abusing it.  (This overreliance on digital distribution also afflicted the Game of the Year edition, which, unlike the Fallout 3 GOTY edition, doesn't contain the additional content on a disc, but rather requires downloading the new content (around 19 extra maps, also available as the downloadable All Fronts package) using a code.)That being said, Gears of War 2 epitomizes what a linear game sequel should strive for: provide a fuller, longer campaign, add new gameplay mechanics, refine what works, add new modes, and make all aspects of the game worthwhile and playable for both solo and multiplayer oriented gamers.  Sure, it might be laughably gory, and far too \"manly\" for its own good, but it's a damn good time, and you'll get your money's worth.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2010"}

{"product_name":"B003P9C6QY","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"I still don't know why it was called Armageddon","reviewText":"But seriously, I still don't know why it was. A catastrophe opens the game, but it doesn't wipe out all life on Mars, not even close. I guess it was only used for dramatic effect. But I'm just quibbling now.I thought Red Faction: Armageddon was a good game, but I also liked it less than Red Faction: Guerrilla, for one simple reason. RFG takes places above ground, allowing more room to move around and enjoy the view when destroying a building utterly. While destroying things is just as cool in Armageddon, the fact that 90% of the game takes place below-ground really felt limiting in terms of destruction. There are really cool weapons, and the action in the game is very fun, but something felt missing, and I think it was the stifling nature of the subterranean setting.To add to that, I'm still not entirely sure why the game has to take place below ground. In the opening mission, a terraformer is destroyed, meaning that it stops converting the atmosphere into breathable oxygen, forcing everyone below ground. But the problem I have with this is that it seems to me that it would have been easier to just build pressurized habitats above-ground while they try to repair the terraformer, as opposed to just moving everyone underground. Because I imagine they had to use some sort of converter to get breathable air below ground as well. I suppose that they skip over explaining this in order to get the plot going, which has all to do with discovering something deep underground. It probably also has something to do with that this is not a sandbox game like Guerrilla was, and so taking place underground helps with creating the very linear levels in the game.Armageddon is also very polished. I admit that I had problems with the game freezing on me multiple times initially. I believed it to be the fault of the game at first, only to discover that my XBox was to blame. After replacing it though, I had absolutely no problems with glitches or freezing. The weapons are, for the most parts, fun to use, but again, many of them (the explosive ones mainly) would have been so much more fun in an above-ground setting.The story in Armageddon is fairly straightforward, with no real twists, though I give the game credit for not being a fairy tale. It gets rather dark towards the end and I appreciated that.The voice acting was so-so. It's an action game, and the actors very much have action-y dialog. It's pretty forgivable since most of the time you're going to be blowing stuff anyways.The game is shortish. I think I completed the game on the hardest difficulty (which isn't incredibly hard at all) in a day, so it might have taken eight hours or so. I don't really have a problem with that, though, because I have replayed it twice since that first time. If only it was more open and above-ground, I think it would be nearly endless fun. I am still hoping that some downloadable content might fix a bit of that problem, though.Overall I would recommend Red Faction: Armageddon. It's not the greatest game ever, or even the greatest game this year. But it is good enough that you won't be bored or frustrated while playing it, and completely demolishing a building is still as fun as it ever was.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2011"}

I have to admit I simply love the Fire Emblem series.  It's ridiculously hard (since when your character dies that's it, they're gone forever...except for the main character).  This game is similar to the Gamecube game where the controls are not adapted for the Wii but for the Classic control.  That doesn't mean this game isn't any fun as it is still great for those who are into Turn Based RPG games or those who love just about everything RPG (which I am).  Note of warning, this game is no easy game.  Though there is a learning curve which does not take a while to learn, the AI is not stupid as they will target characters who are in serious danger to finish them off.  The length of this game is fairly long (considering it is an RPG) and it can take anywhere from 35-45 hours pending on how skilled you are for this type of game.  Graphics wise it is a bit better than the Gamecube released game but other than that not too notable in the same way like Mario Galaxy.  Music is beautifully composed, and the controls are simple.

I've heard Crysis will be a trilogy series, and Warhead is not part of that trilogy, but more of a separate part. It does coincide with the original story in the fact that it brings the story full circle with Psycho (main character of Warhead) and Nomad (main character of Crysis). The graphics are a lot more intense than the first, and there are many more cut-scenes (these scenes are not pre-rendered, they are real-time, and they are screamingly beautiful on the Geforce 8000 series). I was slightly disappointed in the fact that the gameplay is relatively shorter than the original. The game does include an additional disc called \"Crysis Wars\" where it's online multi-player oriented. I'm not much of an online gamer, so I can't really rate that portion of it. Had I have known this package was more emphasized on multi-player rather than single-player, I would've waited for it's price to drop.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2008"}
{"product_name":"B003VJNPPE","description":"In BriefThe second instalment in the RPG saga about the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, features a thoroughly engrossing, mature storyline defining new standards for thought-provoking, non-linear game narration. In addition to an epic story, the game features an original, brutal combat system that uniquely combines tactical elements with dynamic action. A new, modern game engine, responsible both for beautiful visuals and sophisticated game mechanics puts players in the most lively and believable world ever created in an RPG game. A captivating story, dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much more advanced and sophisticated way.DEVELOPER: CD Projekt REDBrief Story DescriptionAfter helping to stop the rebellion undertaken by the Order of the Flaming Rose and saving King Foltest&rsquo;s life, Geralt became one of the central figures of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Temeria. Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...Key FeaturesA truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options.

An extremely well-rendered world, interesting and believable characters, a good plot line, and fun combat all combine to make for an outstanding experience overall.Having said that, I'll make a few constructive criticisms of the game.First, the game has an issue with difficulty scaling.  In most games, the developers design the difficulty scale such that the difficulty increases over the course of the game, as your character gets more skills, and as the player, as well, gets more skilled at playing the game.  In The Witcher 2, however, it works pretty much in reverse.  That is, the hardest time in the game is beginning -- not just the prologue, which many players seem to struggle with, but also the first act and the boss of the first act.  There are a few reasons for this.  One is that the tutorial system is very bad -- the tutorial notes flash across the screen far too quickly to be read when in the middle of the challenging combat the game immediately throws at the player (this would be okay if the controls were the same as the original game, but given how much combat has changed, it's very much \"not okay\").  Another is that Geralt, your character, simply doesn't have many abilities for most of the prologue and first act, so that he is actually quite weak at that part of the game.  You would expect that, but the odd thing is that as Geralt gets stronger during the course of the game with upgraded abilities, the game gets easier -- that is, the difficulty doesn't seem to scale.  The boss fight in Act I is harder, in my opinion, than the boss fights later in the game because later in the game Geralt has abilities that make the fights much easier (and the first fight is overly scripted, in my opinion, but that's a separate issue).  Overall, the impression is an odd one:  a game that starts off almost frustratingly challenging in terms of combat, but one which, by the time one is playing through the bosses of Acts II and III, gets to be rather very easy.  Almost the reverse of what would be normal difficulty scaling, really, and one which is leading to a lot of player frustration due to the front-loading of the difficulty.Second, the story isn't evenly spread between the three acts.  This is fine in itself, but it's a bit misleading in terms of expectations the player may have about game length.  Specifically, Act III is far, far shorter than either of the other Acts, even taking into account the brief Epilogue. Essentially, the way it breaks down is, roughly, Act I (35%), Act II (45%), Act III (15%), Prologue/Epilogue (5%).  In other words, once you reach Act III, you're basically playing the endgame quest, and it all happens rather quickly from there on in.  This is vastly different from how the other chapters play out, and makes the pacing feel uneven and even a bit jarring.  It may be logical in terms of the storyline arc, but in terms of the player experience, it feels, again, odd.Finally, the interface leaves quite a bit to be desired if you are not a console gamer.  The inventory system is fairly clunky and cumbersome to use, for example.  The map is not very useful at all as it doesn't have a directional north.  The \"slow down to switch signs/bombs\" function is an interesting concept, but also clunky in execution.  In all, I preferred the interface of the first game to this one, really, and I expect many PC game enthusiasts will not care for the interface very much.These issues don't make The Witcher 2 a bad game or not a fun experience -- not at all.  However, nothing is perfect, and, in the case of at least the first issue I mention, some of these are detracting from the fun factor for quite a few players, unfortunately -- something which is very unfortunate given the otherwise overall great nature of the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000I10PY2","description":"","reviewerName":"bixodoido","summary":"A great little handheld","reviewText":"The Nintendo DS lite is Nintendo's 2nd version of the handheld DS system.  The DS lite is, well, lighter, but also less bulky.  Several improvements were made to the system as well, including a brighter screen, some repositioning of controls, and a slot for the stylus on the side of the handheld.System features:  Like it's predecessor, the DS lite features dual screens with touch screen technology on the bottom one.  A stylus is used in many games on the bottom screen as part of the controls.  The DS can be connected to other DS systems wirelessly and can also access the internet through either a wireless router, a Nintendo Wifi adapter, or at a Nintendo Wifi hotspot (many McDonalds restaurants have these).Comparing it to the PSP: Unlike the PSP, the DS does not function as an MP3 player and won't play movies, but for many people that is not a real drawback.  I for one wanted a gaming system and didn't need a handheld to do what my iPod and laptop can already do on the go.  There is an internet browser available but you have to purchase it separately, also unlike the PSP.  What the DS lacks in versatility, however, it more than makes up for in terms of games.Gaming options:  The DS lite plays both DS games and Game Boy Advance games.  Multiplayer games on the DS vary--some of them allow for several players with only one cartridge and some require one cartridge per person.  One of the DS's great strengths at this time is the enormous range of available games.  There are puzzle and brain games (including Sudoku, Crossword puzzles, and other adaptations of \"paper\" games), many roleplaying games, several excellent titles by Nintendo (like Mario Kart DS), many sim-type games, and a whole slew of excellent ports (discussed below).Adaptations/ports of older games: There have been many very successful ports and adaptations of games to the Nintendo DS.  Nintendo released a new version of the original Super Mario Brothers and also an adapted Super Mario 64.  Other popular games, like Theme Park and Age of Empires 2, have also been adapted.  And between the DS and the Game Boy Advance there are a TON of old games that can be injected with new life through play on the DS, including classic Nintendo games (like Super Mario 3) and many Final Fantasy games on the Game Boy Advance.The DS lite features a great control system and offers gaming options for an incredibly wide variety of ages and tastes, gamers and non-gamers alike.  This is the type of system you can picture taking on a family car trip, with children's games for the little ones, an RPG or two for the older kids, and classic games or puzzle games for mom and dad.  And for the price you're getting a ton of gaming options.  Pretty tough to go wrong.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2007"}

I was very excited about it, since the whole Cyborg Ninja concept strongly appealed to me since Gray Fox. I pre-ordered this game from Gamestop so I could get the Gray Fox skin, since in the US that is the only way you can get it. So I have been playing the game, and MAN does it feel like God of War with a Metal Gear Solid theme. My problem with this, is that I hate the God of War series. However since this is a Metal Gear game, I decided to try and stick it out for the story. This game is not subtle. It's based on trying to push heavy over the top action in your face, and do it as often as possible. The story is so bland, and it's just more of the same blah blah blah crap that you've already seen and heard millions of times by now. This game has absolutely no soul what so ever. I have had to force myself to sit there and play it. As a huge fan of the Metal Gear Solid games, I am very disappointed that Konami would release this. If your a huge fan of the God of War series, give it a go, you will enjoy it.

It has the same look, feel, and sound, yet the first game's puzzles seemed to require thought, the new puzzles on this version, however, only require patience and good attention whilst reading. Any other puzzles are almost identical to the first game - draw the shortest path, for example. As an example, some puzzles require that you notice the math results are in a different measurement, inch versus feet, for example, others require you place objects in a way that fits in an area, most others are simply trial and error. The first of the former will only catch those who have been bored by the long delays navigating from screen to screen and clicking on random objects trying to find a puzzle, the other two types, again, simply require you spend minutes trying out different results - rotating and moving things, etc.My advice is that if you haven't played the first, get that one. Even though it has the same -is that vase a puzzle... no? Oh!

{"product_name":"B006NYWLLI","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Fig.","summary":"Fans Rejoice. A Great Remake. NOT A Rushed Port.","reviewText":"Let me start by saying that this game is by no means a rushed port or a port at all IMO, it is a nicely done remake with a refreshing array of added features, so do yourself a favor, read user reviews and decide for yourself. Forget about the \"critics\" and their biased opinions. Here's the scoop from a dude playing the game as we speak...When Ninja Gaiden first came out for the original Xbox, it was one of those games that was insanely hard and frustrating at times, in a good way of course, and it kept me coming back for more; from the awesome combos, to the fluid chopping of limbs, it was  bloody, gore heaven made in a disc.Now the PS Vita version is out and I must say, IT IS GREAT! Don't be fooled by bad reviews accusing the game of being a poor rushed port of an old game, because it isn't. Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus has kept me playing all afternoon and will do so for the rest of the night and probably all week, once I start the hardest mode.Fans of the original will appreciate the fact that the game has kept its insane hard levels, those new to the series or those who are simply trying to have a bit of gore before lunch is over, will be happy to know that this version of the game has an easy mode, that as the word implies, makes the game a breeze to play when you don't have much time to figure out how to save your own butt from a horde of  bad dudes trying to slice your head... Game modes include Hero Mode (easiest), Normal (challenging ), and Hard (shave your head in advance) and Ninja Trials (think of this as Batman's challenge maps)The graphics have been polished and very well done, lighting effects are spot on and I even noticed shadows. But please remember, this game is 8 years old, so don't expect a next generation type of graphics, but they did an exceptional job at it, the game looks amazing. I didn't notice any frame drops, the game, even during heavy battles, kept a nice even flow. The storyline is the same, Ryu is in search of the stolen blade and must avenge his clan's death. You'll fight foes left and right, from samurais, to ninjas to some mystic badass beasts and of course, wicked boss fights.If you played the original, I'm sure you remember how frustrating it was to cycle through items such as Elixirs, well, you'll be glad to know that you can know browse through health and ninpo elixirs by using the D-Pad, side ways you chose, down you use, simple.Another great addition, while using the bow and arrow, you can now simply tap the screen and you aim with either the stick or by moving the vita itself, tap on the enemy to shoot at him...again, a heaven sent feature, I hated the original method, I got my butt kicked while aiming. If you want to simply shoot your arrows without precise aiming, simply press the O button. To zoom in and out, use L/R.Ninpo has also changed, it is activated by pressing two buttons at time (x+o being one), then the screen asks you to tap the rear touch pad of your vita to use the ninpo, which gives your ninpo a \"power up\" option, kinda of a charging option if you must. I personally didn't care for this feature, I like the way it was before, two buttons and away we go. Don't get me wrong though, it is still a nice added feature.My advice to you, specially if you are a fan, GET THIS GAME. Don't be fooled by the so called \"critics\" reviews, this game is as always, fun, challenging and now you can have it in the palm of your hands. Trust me, you will like it. If you are new to the series, get ready for a ride, this game is addictive and you'll be coming back for more. Yes, I admit, the story is the same as the original, but how could it change?. The game has added features that give it a refreshing touch that at least, fans of the series, like myself,truly appreciate. I can't review it anymore than this without spoiling the whole experience, so I will let you enjoy it yourself. Peace.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2012"}

The atmosphere of this game is a far cry from FF8's romantic, adult atmosphere. Everything is more comedic and cartoonish, but the graphics are still up to par with recent RPGs, but not very innovative. (They basically look the same as FF7 or FF8). Anyway, I'll break this review down...Graphics- 9/10 Like I said, they are up to par with games of its time, but are not very innovative. Then again, the Playstation is very limited graphics-wise. But that's what I love about the Playstation one, the games were not all about graphics, unlike the PS2(I am not a fan of PS2 at all, or the recent FF titles.)Anyway, the character designs are a lot more old-school, especially the black mage which looks pretty cool.Sound- 7/10 This is one of the low-points of this game, the sound isn't that amazing. FF4, 6, tactics, 7, and 8 all have amazing soundtracks, not to mention 5 as well, but this one just doesn't amaze me. After playing through this game several times and mastering it several times, I still don't really remember any tracks in the game. FF8's soundtrack blew me away, so I was hoping for the same here. The only highlights for music are on the start screen, and the world music is pretty good, as well as the battle music.Gameplay- 10/10The setup is pretty good, making you choose abilities from items that are equipped and learn them. The junction system in FF8 was in my opinion, one of the most innovative systems ever for a video games. This games isn't very innovative, but it's still a great idea that is fun to do. Also, there's synthesis shops now, where you combine items to make armor. (much like FF8s weapon system, except now you can also buy weapons and armor as well.) Overall, this game has a great system that is a lot of fun. The card game isn't nearly as fun as FF8's in my opinion, though. In ff8, you collected cards and then could card mod them, which was also an amazing idea, but in this game the cards seem to do absolutely nothing for the player, other than giving them knowledge that they completed the game 100%, and achieved the highest card collecting level, which is also pointless. Overall, the card game is just a lame re-hash of FF8's Triad game, so dont expect a blast playing cards here, look to ff8 for that.Controls-10/10 Basically the same controls as in every other ff game. Now there's an exclamation mark which appears over Zidanes head if you are near an item, which was a pretty good idea.Story- 6/10 This is the games biggest weak point. In my opinion, FF9 has the most forgettable story out of any FF game. Sure, it has its high points( The idea of having summons attack the town was a great idea,and was pretty sweet to watch) But other than that, it didn't leave me feeling amazed. FF4, 6, 7, 8, tactics and heck they all had great storylines, but FF9's is pretty lame. You go after some little guy wearing a thong, and thats about it, it isnt deep like the other titles, although at times it may appear that way. It wasnt the worst storyline, but definitely not up to par.Overall- 8/10 I have spent a good deal of my life playing this game, since it took a while to master my characters levels and find all the items, and it was definitely worth it. This is a wonderful game that all RPG fans should play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2005"}

If you have children under 17 or who are impressionable DO NOT let them play this. The game allows the gamers to shoot at innocent civillians. It does not contain intense gore or sexuality though.Aside from the content warning, the game is great. It runs smoothly at 60 frames per second, has an outrageous and insane plot, and lets you play over 30 different weapons at your disposal.After the single player campaign is finished the replay value is essentially limitless due to Special Ops mode where you can play on different difficulties against the computer as well as a multiplayer mode to compete online.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00005YTYJ","description":"WithGrand Theft Auto III, Rockstar proves that not all  developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games.  This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular  predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any  criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the  local population for their money (or weapons), make time with  prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking  more structure can embark on dozens of plot-driven missions or steal  cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and go on vigilante  missions. Grab a cab and play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi.  Take a fire truck and earn money putting out fires. The game just never  gets boring.As in real life, there are consequences for your criminality. As your  random acts of mayhem mount up, the police start hounding you,  eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you  continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily  the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are  packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every  category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump  trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically  when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific  detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic,  pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing.  Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine  different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a  monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages  to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerNote: This review refers to thePlayStation2 versionof  this game.Pros:Offers an enormous world for players to exploit, rendered in  staggering detailEqually fun whether you go on plot-based missions or run around as  a freelance crookCons:Ultraviolence, foul language, and adult situations mean you'll want  to keep this far away from kidsIt takes too long to get from one island to another, making some  missions tedious","reviewerName":"G","summary":"This is going to be great","reviewText":"Probably 70 percent of the people reading this review have played GTA3 on the ps2. Many people enjoyed the game, but I was am a little picky. Basicly, I like graphics, and if a game has good graphics, and it has good gameplay, I will play it (unless if it is like a sim game). I found GTA3's gameplay incredible, but the graphics engine did not take advantage of the PS2's rendering power. GTA and GTA2 have both been better for the pc, and I will not be surprised if GTA3 is a heck of a lot better on the PC than the PS2.Obviously, GTA3 is not for kids, but here is the story, or atleast as most as I know of it. I think it has to do with some sort of a mob, or gang, or mafia or something, and you have to go on these missions for them, and you will be a \"made man\". These missions include jacking a grandma on the street, killing a pimp, or maybe bombing a few buildings. You can never forget to kill people on the street, or blow up 10 police cars, or even get the cheat code for the tank and cause destruction in the city.You've heard my opinion, and you obviously know that I would give GTA3 for the PS2 four stars. I am giving it 5 stars for the pc because it will have the excelent gameplay, along with improved graphics and performance. Hope this helps!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2002"}

The newest entry fixes what I considered to be the weaker points of the franchise and evolves what a GTA gameplay experience can be.  After many hours of straight mission runs and overall experimentation everywhere else this GTA will leave you out of breath.  Just visually appealing enough with rare cross hatching graphics popping out on occasion, IV looks good but requires alot of BRIGHTNESS?CONTRAST manipulation during some of its exceptionaly darker corners and hours of day.  The police pursuits and mayhem factor are much easier to control this time around and you will often find yourself escaping and finishing missions that older games would have had you replaying for days.  The music is a nice varied lot as usual and a high point at moments when it meshes with the voice acting and SFX to perfection.  The detail to player experience and ambiance is unparalled throughout other than the eventual repetition of the media on TV and Radio which is only a testament to how many hours your spending in LC, also no custom ST?  The driving controls feel especially nice on the DUAL SHOCK 3 trigger buttons and the included Six Axis controls for HELICOPTER BIKE BOAT are another PS3 bonus and are tuned just right once you practice.  When are games worth $60? When they are so rich with content and development that almost all those moments in every other game where you said \" I wish I could try that\" are fufilled.*****  I do not have my 60PS3 highspeed ready so I cannot vouch for the quality of the mutliplayer content which looks to outstanding if it runs.My system has run this game perfectly other than one cutscene going mute.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2008"}

If you're into DLC (new characters etc), get the Vita version because that includes everything which adds up in value.  Disgaea is a series you will either love or hate honestly.  It's actually a very simple game to pick up, but has virtually endless depth if grinding, stats and modifying items is your thing.  It makes Final Fantasy Tactics seem like a mere child's game (and Tactics is a good series).  The ability to have a unique sense of humor is a requirement for the series.  I own every Disgaea game (in some cases the same game on multiple platforms). Infinite on the PSP is the only one I don't like.The main thing I'd toss in is that you need an incredible amount of time to experience any Disgaea game properly.  I'm talking at least 150-300 hours of gameplay per game, but you can literally play any of them non stop until you the end of time if you desired. Not for everyone, but possibly the best series to ever get into for so e people.

I also understand that because of that there was limited time to put together much of a story or to dedicate time to anything but the game play itself. However, I probably could have come up with something a bit more attractive with my zero gaming production experience.You run around as Nariko, the girl with the red hair, and sometimes as her little sister, Kai. At first I was struck dumb by the quality of the cut scenes. I swear I could count the pores in everyone's skin. So that was a plus. I also enjoyed the button smashing mayhem that was required when playing as Nariko. Unfortunately, video game graphics and button smashing have never sat well with me. It's the story I'm after, flexibility of characters, side-plot, dynamics! All of which Heavenly Sword pushes to the wayside.So, onwards! We find ourselves in a loosely strung together story that doesn't exactly make me think that I want to save Nariko's people. In fact, if I were Nariko I would have off and smacked those inconsiderate men to kingdom come and back. Either way, Bohan, our evil enemy of the story is attempting to wipe out all of Nariko's people and wishes for nothing but power, power, power. At first I liked him as a character because of his dialogue which was interesting and fun. I would want nothing more than to skewer him for some of the things he says. Of course, that likability fled when I realized he was listening to a giant crow and really had no motivation to kill and destroy except for the act of it. I would have liked to see Flying Fox, one of Bohan's minions, be in Bohan's place. Insanity could, at the very least, been a stand in for a reason! So, the story was...pitiful. Because of this I couldn't really feel for much of the characters. I didn't feel triumphant beating a boss or mildly saddened come the end. Nothing. It was two days of my life in a fog of scantily dressed women with a big sword.As I said before, all you need is the urge to beat the crap out of your controller and you'll get through the game. Ohh, and be wary of some cut scenes or hero sequences when you're killing a boss. They'll throw buttons at you on the screen that you must dutifully push while missing out on the only thing worth playing the game for: the graphics. And for all those graphics why is it that Nariko looks like she has a giant red squid on her head? Irritating.I did, however, enjoy some of the sixaxis' abilities to control cannon balls and Kai's arrows. In fact, I loved little Kai. I wish she was in the game more and had a larger repertoire of abilities. But wishful thinking gets you nowhere.The thing is that the game, as most do, had that potential to be something greater than it was. Sure, it's a game if you want to relax and not tear your hair from your scalp in frustration and only spend a few hours on, but that's not the point. You pay 60 dollars for a game, slightly less if it's used, you expect a bit more than a mildly crazy old man attempting to kill a tribe and you, missy, are the only thing that can stomp him into submission. It's a reiterated tale that is far too old for me to care about anymore. 10 hours.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2010"}

Steam turned out to be a good thing over time.  Get games real cheap these days.As for FNV and all the DLC, the DLC is fun too, more of what you expect.  Some of the areas are pretty hard though.But my biggest complaint is crashes.  I am running windows 7 64bit.  Not sure that has anything to do with it.  But the game crashes every couple of hours guaranteed.  Given that most sales are done for this game, I wonder if Bethesda will put any time into chasing down these crashes.I have also decided that my original estimate of game time is too low if you are going to do all the DLC as it adds just as much new game time to the game.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall the game is excellent.  Here are some highlights:1) it has multiple endings and you are forced to make choices at some point in the game that takes you down one plot leaf and there is no going back.  You have several factions looking for control and you must choose one eventually.  There are thus at least three different endings to the game (might be more, I have not figured that out yet) and you will likely want to see them all (I do).  This is an excellent example of how game makers have improved upon an already good thing.  One of the complaints of Fallout3 was the ending sucked.  Someone put some thought into this problem and this was the result, you must make choices (cool!).2) game mechanics are what we expected to see.  In some respects they are better.  For example travel seems easier most of the time because you have an easier time climbing up hills and such.  There are still some places were you can't climb high enough (OK, so go around).  And gone is the unbelievably difficult subway system of Fallout3 that frustrated many users.  It still pays heavily to use the local and world maps but you won't find yourself spending hours trying to locate some remote area.3) there are 200 to 300 hours of possible gameplay in this one.  Yes you can finish it quick if you want but what is the point of that.  Don't you want to meet all the new characters and see all the diffent places?4) they have addressed several other issues of gameplay by adding a few new abilities.  As one example, you can now make ammunition and convert ammo between differnt types (at a supply cost of course).  This gives you some control over the availability of rare ammo if you have a favorite gun but can't use it because you don't have the right ammo for it.  However, it again still pays to be proficient in a couple types of weapons and to select the right weapon for the right adversary.5) most people don't turn instantly hostile if you fail a steal attempt against them so you have a little more leeway to \"appropriate\" necessary plot items when other means fail you.6) the \"human\" oriented skills play a slightly bigger role in this game.  So if you are looking for a gameplay experience that is not just \"sneak mode head shot = instant death by critical\", then you can feel more confident in investing in those aspects of the game that change dialog options in order to have these options.  Naturally this is all about choosing your game play style so you don't have to do so either.  I must admit however, I have not lost my affinity for the head shot with a laser weapon while crouching from long distance that decapitates somebody, thus letting me watch what the body and what pops off of it, roll all the way down the hill (man I just love NVidia PHYSX).All in all, I have had as much fun with this one as with Fallout3, and more.Still, not all is perfect in the wastelands of the Mojave.1) First, I am still out to lunch regarding Steam.  I can't say I don't like Steam.  Indeed, I think I do.  It gives me another place to go for games and they do in fact have random sales often which are pretty good.  I will likely be picking up a couple of games off Steam because of these sales.  But is pisses me off that when I buy a game, I can only play it if I can connect to the internet.2) I am running Windows 7.  This games works, but the launcer fails often and I may have to try 20 times or more before I am quick enough to push the Play button before the launcher craps out.  I am not sure this is because of Windows 7 or other bugs.  Do I care though?  In the end it won't play when this happens.  I have recently located the actual executable and created a desktop shortcut with compatability set to XP-SP2.  This seems to mitigate the problem significantly.3) I have experienced several crashes so make sure you save often.  It is no way like the first release of Fallout3 that STB all the time.  But it still sucks to have played for a while only to have a crash happen and loose it all, and it is quite possible for you to losse a lot since you will be so tied into the game, that you will forget to save.Overall Obsidian did an excellent job and I can't wait for some DLC (hope they price it fairly (10$ would keep me comming back over and over)).  Now if you will excuse me, I want to try out some new apparel.  Since I picked a female character this time, I have decided to forgo Power Armor as I have decided I much more prefer the view of my character running across the wastes in Naughty-Nightware whilst wielding a scoped Gauss Rifle.Hail Flavius!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005LOXE","description":"The two classic RPGs in this compilation not only represent hours upon hours of story, character, and action, they also present the background for two recent bestselling, critically hailed games:Final Fantasy IXandChrono Cross.With all the different names for the original 1991 release of the first title in this compilation (Final Fantasy IVin Japan,Final Fantasy IIin the U.S.), role-players new to the game may get confused. Make no mistake, though:Final Fantasy Chroniclesmarks the first time this pivotal installment of the cherished game series has ever been available on the PlayStation. InFinal Fantasy IV, players take on the role of Cecil, a loyal captain who questions the orders of his king, and for it is sent to slay a mysterious beast in a nearby valley.InChrono Trigger, Chrono must follow princess Marle's teleportation through time and locate her before an intergalactic parasite arrives to destroy the world. The original game, also on the PlayStation for the first time, was one of the first nonlinear role-playing games. The decisions that players make during the game will point them toward one of more than a dozen possible endings.These new versions retain the authentic Japanese SNES stories and characters while updating their graphics and adding new full-motion video sequences and other features.","reviewerName":"Disintegration","summary":"Classic games...not so classic load times...","reviewText":"Both of these games are some of the greatest RPGs ever released. But unfortunately Square/Enix released this game with the same horrendous loading times that killed the psx release of Final Fantasy 6. I know it sounds ridiculous that I'm complaining about petty loading times, but BELIEVE ME, once you play the ps1 version of Chrono Trigger you will be going nuts from impatience with these load times. If you're fast, you might be able to prepare dinner, or even take a shower while the menu loads up. And when you enter the next screen you might as well leave to use the bathroom. Okay maybe I am overemphasizing it a bit. I found myself looking for the SNES version after i got this just so I could take advantage of quick loading time. Which to me was a collosul waste of money since I paid for the Chronicles already. But now that the game is on Greatest Hits, it is worth it just for the ff4 disk alone. This version of FF4 is just as good (probably even better) than the SNES version. As far as I know it has more monsters and items too, since this version is the japanese one translated into American and not the watered down American version. And since it's only 20 bucks now, it's a great deal for these classic games. Final Fantasy 4 has very fast loading time on this and it really makes me wonder why Square couldn't have made Chrono Trigger faster. It seems as though every time Square releases a double-RPG set one of the games always has horrible loading. But truth be told, the loading times on Chrono Trigger are not as horrible as Final Fantasy 6's, which were by all means the worst loading times Ive ever experienced, and I'd rather pay for a Super Nintendo and the game itself so I could avoid them (and the SNES version is much better for that game anyway). I guess after all it is worth it to pay $20 for these two classic games despite the horrendous patience problems you will endure. Unless you can find it on Greatest Hits, I wouldn't buy it though.overall....about 3.5...but 4 was too good so i rounded down to 3","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2003"}

The new mechanics take some getting used to, but once you do they are solid. I personally like to use the zone hitting method using the buttons, and have been giving the pulse pitching a try. Pulse pitching has been tough for my eyes to adjust to. If you use a bad pitcher it can honestly make you kind of dizzy, but I applaud the developer for making it challenging. Too often in the past you can throw an epic game with a bad pitcher, just because you nailed how to use the timing bar. This is not the case. If you use a bad pitcher, he will inevitably make some bad pitches, which brings realism.I also love the new physics in the game. The curling line drives really add realism to hitting a ball in the field.The game looks like a real baseball game on TV. It's incredble. Jaw dropping. Maybe the best looking game I've ever seen. Seriously.This game takes patience at the plate though. You can jack homers all day in HR Derby mode, or on rookie mode, but if you want a true experience then play All-Star or harder. Hitting a baseball is the hardest thing to do in sports, and it can show in this game. Just have patience and wait for your pitch.I bought both the Vita and PS3 versions. I love both, but the PS3 experience is by far the winner, as it should be. The Vita version is solid, and is a great way to take your game on the road. I highly recommend picking up both if you have the means to do so. The cross saving capability is not a seamless as they advertise, but it's still pretty cool. Overall I recommend both versions.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2012"}
{"product_name":"B008SBZD5U","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"\"EEEE EEEEE OOO OOO AHHH!!!  NOT CLAYTON!!\" -Tarzan","reviewText":"When it first came out in 2003, Kingdom Hearts was a phenomenon. Prior to its release, a lot of people were worried about Squaresoft teaming up with Disney, blending their worlds of Final Fantasy and the Magic Kingdom into an adventure/RPG game. A lot of people have the mindset that anything with Disney on it is automatically \"kiddy\". Luckily for Square, KH was a hit and quickly became one of their biggest titles ever. Years went by and people wanted more, and more they got. A sequel came out after a couple of years, and before and after that, we got an ungodly amount of side games. More new characters, less Disney, it seemed. It took until just a few years ago for fans to finally get sick of this and want their true sequel, Kingdom Hearts 3. Well, it finally got announced not that long ago, and what better way to hype it up than with an HD collection of a few KH games?The Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 ReMix, if you don't know by now, is the first Kingdom Hearts game remastered in HD. It's actually the second Japanese version- Japan got the game first, then the US did with some extra stuff, then Japan got the US version with even more extra stuff. The game looks gorgeous in HD, and you can tell what's been completely redone from scratch as soon as you see it. If I didn't know any better, I'd think that some parts of the game were from an early ps3 title.The plot centers around a young by named Sora, who keeps having weird dreams about flying around his island home, entering a world filled with shadow creatures, and wielding a weapon known as the Keyblade. He lives with his friends Riku and Kairi, and they seem set on exploring the world to see what's beyond the ocean someday. Just when they're about to set sail, a little something happens- the island is caught in a huge storm, and the shadow creatures Sora dreamed about are there. He finds the Keyblade, vanquishes them, and ends up in another world. At the same time, good ol' Donald Duck and Goofy are out looking for Mickey (who's the king of their world), who left on an important mission. Sora meets the two, and they team up, looking for their friends. It turns out that there's a big mess right now, with the shadow creatures, known as the Heartless, interfering with other worlds. It's up to them to seal the world's keyholes using the Keyblade to restore everything.Gameplay consists of a little exploration and a lot of combat. It seems weird at first, at least it did in 2003, to use the analog stick to control Sora while using the d-pad to select from items, magic and special attacks, but you get used to it quickly. You'll get to explore all kinds of memorable Disney worlds like Atlantis, Halloweentown, Tarzan's jungle and more. Characters from well-known Squaresoft games like the Final Fantasy series are thrown in as well. Chances are, if you're a fan of either company, there's something here for you.I enjoyed the game's story when it came out. However, I was also 17 at the time. I know a lot of the game's fans were younger than that when they first played it, which makes them more attached to the series, but I didn't enjoy the plot very much playing through it 12 years later. Too many scenes are played out as being huge, important events...despite only lasting a couple of minutes and never being referenced again. I also completely forgot how underwhelming the boss fights were, save for the new special one that was only in Final Mix. Most of the time, the bosses will stand around, letting you hit them with huge combos, do their big special attack, and the process repeats. Some of the worlds are stupidly small when you look at them now too- Deep Jungle is basically 5-6 screens that you backtrack through several times before taking on the bosses. I also need to mention that I never understood why so many people adore the game's main song- Simple and Clean. It's an autotuned disaster that's overproduced and the vocals are forced....ok it sounds like I hate the game now. I don't. It just has its faults. You can play through Kingdom Hearts in about 20 hours and enjoy it for the most part. Spend a little more time and you can take out the optional bosses. Spend even more time, and you can go crazy trying to collect all the special items. That's one thing that did legitimately bug me- they changed the items needed for the Ultima Weapon. I gave up on it this time around. Given that they changed the strength of certain Keyblades, it wasn't even worth going for when you had say, the Devine Rose. And I'll also throw in that there are some genuinely touching moments here and there, one of which was a surprise since it's in Winnie the Pooh's world.Also included are Chain of Memories and 358/2 Days. To be honest, I didn't care much for Chain of Memories' card-based gameplay. It's not my thing, though many KH fans didn't seem to mind. It's not a terrible game, and does expand on the side-story portions a bit. Plus it's a big visual upgrade from the original version that came out on the GameBoy Advance. Just like with the first game, it looks beautiful in HD.358/2 Days however, is such a waste of time that I don't even understand why it was included, and nearly bumped the score down to 3 stars. Sure, you can argue that it's to reveal a little more about select characters, but all you're doing is watching what feels like hours and hours of clips of Roxas and Axel eating ice cream. I swear, you can have a drinking game to this thing. There's a pattern of this: eating ice cream, something boring and dramatic happens with the Organization, more eating ice cream, text scene where gameplay would have been, more ice cream and more boring drama. Because they couldn't port the whole game onto the disc for various reasons, you never see any of the action from fights, regardless of how big they were. Nope, all you see 80% of the time is Roxas and Axel sitting on the castle, eating ice cream. I stuck through the whole thing, expecting it to get good at some point. It didn't happen. Had I known that in advance, I would've just hit Play and went off to do something else. I didn't care for any of the characters here. Granted, I didn't play Kingdom Hearts 2, but if these collections are being released in a specific order at all, that shouldn't matter. They overcomplicated the KH story for no reason with all these extra characters who are linked to other extra characters who barely have a purpose. I already dread the other games included with KH2 on the next HD collection.The first Kingdom Hearts is a ps2 classic, great for younger gamers, or for people to just relive memories they had with it. It has memorable music, great art design, and it's fun seeing Disney favorites come to life with new material, even if it is limited. It may sound weird, but I had a lot more enjoyment with Disney characters showed up, and much less when the Squaresoft guys were on-screen. The game definitely has some faults that are much more visible now. Still, getting a remastered edition of Final Mix, as well as its sequel, at this price is a pretty good deal. Stay away from 358/2 Days though, and just read a plot summary online somewhere.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00009WAUH","description":"As renowned as theFinal Fantasyseries has become over the years, the release ofCrystal Chroniclesbrings with it an air of unfamiliarity. Although many of its elements tie into the greaterFinal Fantasyuniverse, this is but a faint echo of what you have come to know and love.While it can be argued that this is a new direction for the series, and therefore shouldn't be put on the same level as the other games, fans have come to expect the best fromFinal Fantasy, and with each passing release, Square has delivered.Crystal Chroniclesmay break new ground, but it lacks the creativity and passion of its role-playing brethren.As stylish as the character designs may be, they are completely void of personality. The story is just as ambiguous. Never once did I feel attached to my character, nor did I care what twists or turns the plot would make. TheFinal Fantasygames are renowned for storytelling, but it seems like an afterthought inCrystal Chronicles. Cinematic flair is also noticeably&nbsp;absent.The gameplay is just as careless and jagged. While the quest can be played single-player, it's meant to be tackled by a group of people (preferably four). Since each player utilizes menu screens often, Square and Game Designer's Studio decided that you could only play multiplayer with a Game Boy Advance attached to the GameCube. Hence, all menu management is done on the GBA screen, and the action on the TV is unaffected. In theory, this is a just solution. As it turns out, though, I found it to be more detrimental to the quest than anything.When a player accesses the GBA, their character on the TV cannot be controlled. Not only does this leave them open to attack, it more or less halts any progress that the group can make. So basically, you still find yourself sitting around waiting for your buddy to make preparations, but instead, you're doing it with a controller that has fewer buttons and dying batteries.To make matters worse, players must also keep an eye on a bucket. To prevent characters from scattering and trying to run in different directions, the bucket emits a field of energy that covers roughly 80 percent of the screen. If you go outside of this barrier, you'll take damage. So you basically must stay huddled together as one person carries the bucket throughout a stage. Without question, this is one of the stupidest ideas in the history of video games.When it comes to the basics of gameplay, the combat is respectable, but by no means great. I really like the timing-based combo system that accompanies both magic and general hack n' slash, yet I absolutely despise losing all of my magic with each new area that I enter. Hence, classes are not defined, and you never really get the impression that your character is growing in power.There's little here that truly excites.Crystal Chroniclesplays like an experiment gone awry, and is unfit to bear the sacrosanctFinal Fantasyname.Concept:A hack n' slash with inventive, yet highly aggravating GBA-based multiplayer connectivity, and a worthless bucketGraphics:Stylish character designs, gorgeous particle effects, and awesome boss designsSound:Not the familiarFinal Fantasymelodies, but memorable nonethelessPlayability:Steers away from button mashing with timing-based chains, manual spell aiming, and multi-person combosEntertainment:A cookie cutter adventure with a lackluster story, poor character growth, and frustrating playReplay:Moderately HighRated:7 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Crystal Chroniclesis here to remind us that every so often, Square Enix actually puts out an average game. It seems like for every thingFF: CCdoes right, it does two things wrong. Combining spells with your teammates is awesome, but half the time it's less effective than two individual castings, and you lose all of your magic between areas. The effects and character models are cool, but downtimes really drag and many cutscenes look awfully similar. The worst part, though, is that character advancement is the slowest I've ever seen. Beat a boss and get your choice of +1 to one of your stats! Thrilling. There is certainly some enjoyment to be had here, but it's sprinkled somewhat thinly among all of the lame and boring parts.

For one thing as a single player, i haven't beat the final boss of the game. He's just too strong and it took me 20 years to get my character at his current level (game time that is). The story is great, with slow plot development which allows for continous play in order to figure out what will happen next. Character development is poor, taking a long time in order to level up the character via items and power-ups. Replay value is among the poorest i've seen in a game. Once you beat it, it just goes on the shelf. Maybe because i'm currently a College studnt and i don't have the time but i've been playing video games since 1989 and can tell that this game is HEAVILY geared towards multi-player. I'm at a disadvantage since i'm the only palying it. so as much as the music, plot development and quality, it gets 5 stars but because of its very low replay value and long time to power/level-up your character, it gets 3 stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2004"}

But no pooper-scooper","reviewText":"Game is cute. You start off by picking the dog of your choice. Bring it home and interact with it. My complaints is that the game can become very repetitive. Feeding/bathing a pup every 30 minutes is NOT realistic! The lack of scenery change is also boring. Seen that tree before? Yes. Been to that park before? 1,000 times. Not to mention the championships are the same. Same, same, same. This game would have been better if it had multi-player support(although it has \"bark-mode\") and online support. The most \"realistic\" pet-game that's the best so far, and the graphics aren't bad at all, although with some dog there is glitches (such as seeing the ear inside of the dog's head). Would have been better if there was more scenery change and not the same things. And watching the dog take a pink \"dump\"(hahaha) or potty every block is so yuck. Pups wake up literally \"starving\" for having the game off over-night because it's human owner has to sleep in real life sometime. Oh, and the dog will bite too, the only way to stop it from biting is to shake it. Yes, you have to shake the dog off of your arm/chest/leg because it holds on. Some dogs with certain personalities will protest and bite as well if you try to pet them. It would have been more realistic to discipline the animal for its bad behavior ( Ex. saying \"no\", tap it, etc) and to watch for its reaction. But petting/feeding it when it's growling and wanting to BITE? No Nintendo, no.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2009"}

Great Game!!","reviewText":"I originally purchased this game when it was first released for the Xbox 360. At the time the only games in my household were FPS and I really wanted a FAMILY game. Turned out that I was the only one playing it at the time since everyone thought it was too childish at the time. Seriously who harvested a garden of pinatas? I didn't listen to them and continued playing, I would play once I got home from work and sometimes usually until after midnight. Took me a lot of hours but I was able to get all the pinatas and beat the game 100% and become a level 80 something gardener. Now fast forward almost 5 years later and my 16yr old daughter who is a tried and true Call of Duty fan picked up the game and started playing and also got addicted. My now 7 year old who plays family games saw her playing and wanted to play as well. Thus the reason for another purchase. Since I still have it on my profile I was able to send the kids tons of cash and even seeds and animals to help out with their garden.The game is totally addicting once you start playing. It's a 2 player game but the 2nd player is just a helper and not the main gardener. Its a great family game and I'd recommend you keep this one in your collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2012"}

(so far)","reviewText":"I'm an adult gamer who mostly plays PS3 games, but lately I have been spending all of my time playing the 2 new tennis games and Tiger Woods golf for the Wii. All 3 of those games are 5 star games IMO.I was hesitant about buying Wii Sports Resort (especially after spending money on the other 3), because I've been told that it isn't much fun as a one player game. I haven't gotten past the basketball or bicycling yet, because these 2 minigames are incredible. I usually ride my stationary bike when I play games, such as Wii Sports and Virtua Tennis 2009. The Sports Resort bicycling is an absolute joy to play while riding a stationary bike. It's Wii Fit's running with the hands essentially. Personally, I think Wii Fit's strongest game was running around the island, but now I can bike around the island. The game takes a lot of skill because you must refresh your energy by riding behind other bikers, and once your energy is refreshed you start pedaling as fast as you can until you run out of energy behind the next biker. The island is absolutely breathtaking and is as beautiful as the Wii Fit island.The other game I love is the basketball, and takes a lot of skill because the motion control is 1:1. The only disappointment with Wii Sports Resort is that with most Wii games, and that's an online mode. I would love to pickup a bicycle race and win a trophy against other real human players. I'm not sure there would be much of a market for that, but since this game sold so many copies, I think it might be a real possibility.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00006F7S8","description":"It's hard to believe that creator Will Wright had trouble selling his originalSimCityconcept to publishers. That first game went on to fame, notoriety, and great praise--from critics, gamers, and even educators--and spawned countless imitators, not the least of which include Wright's own smaller-scaleThe Sims, which went on to become a phenomenon in its own right. Now on its fourth edition,SimCityreturns to our hard drives, and would-be city planners everywhere will be busy for a long, long time.SimCity 4functions much like its predecessors. You've got the power to zone land as residential (green), commercial (blue), and industrial (yellow). You control the budget. You decide where to place crucial services like police, fire, medical, and even utilities like power and water. You place schools, parks, roads, water towers, and scenery as you accede to the many demands of your Sim citizens. Do a good job and your city will grow and the money will flow into your coffers. Do a bad job and the people will pack up and move away, leaving your city treasury in horrific debt and landing you what the game cheekily considers to be a far easier job: senator. The game requires a balancing act that takes both planning and a persnickety nature. There are charts to read, reports to watch, and, above all, needs to juggle. It's rewarding when it all comes together, and frustrating when you fail, once again, to build anything worthwhile.That's why I wish the game came with a better manual. The included book glosses over most major information and then neglects important aspects, such as the RCI indicator (which explains zoning needs) and parts of the budget. At the very least, the manual should include tips on handling debt. There are two tutorials which cover the basics, but again, they won't help you get out of trouble once you get in too deep. You can find this information in thestrategy guide, which is sold separately, but you really shouldn't have to go that route.The graphics are amazing, showing a vibrant metropolis with scurrying traffic, wandering Sims, smoking chimneys, and sparkling lights when night falls. Fireworks reward each year of service. And wait until you see the cool disasters you can unleash if the mood strikes you--fire, lightning, tornado, volcano, and giant robot. Oddly, there's a significant performance hit even on fast systems. Thankfully, the stuttery scrolling and slow-to-respond zoom don't hurt the game too much since you can pause it at will or fast forward if you need to wait for your cash reserves to build. The most significant flaw is that the game only offers one save slot, which discourages experimentation.Despite minor imperfectionsSimCity 4is an awesome game. You can build several cities next to each other on the map and make them dependant on each other. (You can build the greater L.A. area, in other words.) You can even import your Sims fromThe Simsto live in your city. Such familiar characters can tell you a lot about what your city needs. Put simply, city planning has never been this fun, this challenging, or this deep.--Andrew S. BubPros:Beautiful graphics and animationDeeper and more realistic than ever beforeCons:Runs slowly on most systemsInadequate manual","reviewerName":"Distant Voyageur \"Nicholas Computer\"","summary":"Amazing leap forward but marred by serious problems","reviewText":"I for one am absolutely thrilled to actually get this game. I for one remember how much I enjoyed playing SimCity 2000 but after losing it to a computer crash and the CD-Rom by unfortunate circumstances, I decided to get &quot;SimCity 4&quot; and I have to say I am absolutely thrill yet disappointed at the same time.By playing style, &quot;SimCity 4&quot; Follows the same patterns in a lot of ways like the SimCity 2000 games. You lay down zones; let it be industrial, commercial, and or residential. You also have to manage the city's fiscal status as well, by making sure your city doesn't fall into the pits of debt, passing ordinances that benefit the city...at a cost, and making it thrive by fighting crime through police stations and jails, fighting fires by building fire stations and dispatching fire engines, and educating your citizens with schools, colleges, and museums along with numerous other things.On a positive note this game is a HUGE quantum leap forward from SimCity 2000 in almost every way. There are two main reasons for this. First, the actual details are stunning! Now buildings, and houses look like real structures and the street systems are much more realistic instead of looking like a hodgepodge of shapes like some of them did on SC 2000 from many years ago. The landscape looks so incredibly amazing too. Now it looks like a real actual landscape whether it be hilly, a peninsula, or plains, it's absolutely amazing! My favorite is elevated plains (I.E. Texas Panhandle) right next to large mountains (Going from Amarillo to around central New Mexico). Absolutely amazing!! The best part of this game too is not only the improvements on the graphics and landscapes but the background music. Although some may write it off as background music but some of the music for this game is so good that I would go the distance to say that it's actually rip-worthy! I never thought computer music would actually sound this good!! It sure sounds light years above the cheap pop fluff that most corporate recording studios seem to throw out like hamburger packaging. The sound effects too are absolute amazing to listen to as well.Unfortunately, \"SimCity 4\" suffers from some serious problems some of which eat away at the ratings I give this. The manual instructions are very inadequate, and only scratch the surface of the scope of this game. Also the game itself runs incredibly slow, even on the more advanced computer systems. The best way to temper this problem is to set the details to &quot;low&quot;. The greatest fault I have with this is how some of the streets actually lay out. For example, It's a real pain trying to get a good street system because of problems trying to make them diagonal. Plus trying to get certain railroad crossings is absolutely a pain in the neck! the other one is the appearance of those much dreaded &quot;No Job&quot; tags that appear over my buildings (Indicated by a suitcase in a red slash circle) and I had to unleash a tornado to wipe them out as oppose to see them go neglected and abandoned. I don't mean to sound like a \"Twisted Metal\" game maniac but I'd rather see a whole neighborhood reduced to total debris from tornadoes or burned down to the ground than to sit there with those exasperating \"No Job\" zots hanging over the structures.The disasters are the usual although there are a couple of new ones. My favorite is the &quot;Robot Attack&quot; where you can send down a ten story alien robot on your unsuspecting Sims when they start getting out of dodge and throwing giant explosive dinner plates. It's especially a riot when the exploding dinner plates actually fly off the edge of the city and crash wwwaaay down below in some unknown dimension!! The other new disaster is the volcano. Hey if you love the 1997 movie &quot;Volcano&quot; you will love this one too!!I have come to really understand the anger that this game has inflamed due to the massive memory requirements for this game to run and let me tell you, this game has had problems even on the most state of the art home computer systems and even a friend who got a brand spanking new computer for this game had problems with the game running at a cold molasses pace even when other programs were dumped off the computer. The same problems are what killed &quot;Civilization III&quot; for me after the dynamite &quot;Civilization II&quot; which I thought was and still think is a really awesome game. I've had the same problems with this game to the extent that I can't help but feel rather disappointed with this because the unacceptably slow pace just takes the fun out what otherwise have been the greatest game in the universe.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2004"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYLRK","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Wright","summary":"A hot mess that's disappointing","reviewText":"Let me start off by saying, I don't get game company strategies. You start out with a somewhat weak game and you improve upon it to the point where it's actually worth playing. This happened with Assassin's Creed (first game) and ended with Revelations (the last before Assassin's Creed 3).  So, Revelations was definitely on the right track. It still had a few flaws, but overall worked and worked well.  The whole island thing and Desmond potentially losing his mind story arc had a lot of promise. Then, in this final installment, it's ruined by being overproduced and overdone.So, here comes Assassin's Creed III.  So, the first thing I notice is that Ubisoft has tossed out the old gaming engine they were using for every previous game and they've now introduced another one.  Presumably, this change was to support both Assassin's Creed III and Assassin's Creed Liberation.  I'll come back to Liberation in a bit. So, by choosing a new gaming engine, they also redesigned Desmond's character model? This is the first of many inconsistencies that just drive me nuts about AC3. Desmond's face is all long and distorted and he just looks wrong. He doesn't look like Desmond. So, what's up with that?StorySo, onto the story. The story is basically an unmitigated mess. You're still playing as Desmond using a rogue Animus. This time, you're in a cave inhabited by a digital being like Minerva from previous AC stories.  Except, we don't know this digital character's motives. Oh, she's speaking and explaining her plight to Desmond, but not really saying a whole lot. Basically, she pontificates a whole lot about trying to save the world by doing this or that, but ultimately failing. So, Desmond is now in the Animus looking for a 'Key'.  In that goal, they have to locate power sources to activate several different panels in this cave so they can get to the 'end'.  Into the Animus Desmond jumps.When in the Animus, you start the game playing as Haytham, a colonial assassin. We get no real back story about Haytham, but he's an adept assassin who has all of the same moves as Altair and Ezio. The Haytham story line progresses for several real playing hours until Haytham meets up with a native American woman and the two have a fling and a kid (which is not a visual). Their offspring is Connor. However, Ubisoft decided to cut out any relationship story between Haytham and his apparent one-night-stand. So, we have no idea what transpired there. Next thing we know, Connor is now a kid as the player character and we are out playing hide-and-seek with a bunch of other native American kids.  So then, Connor's village is burned down (and his mother killed) by some colonial men and Connor vows revenge.So, after 2 hours of playing as Haytham as an extremely long and mostly boring tutorial, you're now starting over again playing as Connor. From here, you go through the long excruciating cut scenes getting Connor to the point where he can even become an Assassin (another several hour stint).  Ok, so here's the first real problem.  The game should have started with Connor from the beginning.  The Haytham segment should have been cut out.  Leading up to the Connor just prior to becoming an assassin, the cut scene should have shown the village being burned and Connor's vision. After that, it should have progressed right into training to become an Assassin.  Meeting Haytham later could have just been the main character he saw burning his village, it didn't need to be his father.There were lots of other parts after you get to Connor that were added that just simply wasted tons of time (i.e., being a ship's captain and the naval canon warfare).  For example, most of the main quest challenges that are so in your face you want to throw a controller at the screen. All of that could have been skipped and not missed.  So, after weeding through Connor's quite long and boring cut scene filled gameplay, you finally get to the key, which Haytham had all along.The key opens 'the final door' and the ending of Desmond's story is, well, not worth waiting for. I won't spoil it here, but suffice it to say that it seemed to have been set up to have a multiple choice ending, yet it didn't happen.  What happens to Desmond and, indeed, the world is just so predictable.  I would have expected a whole lot more to the Desmond story line than what came out of it.  It looked like Ubisoft needed a way to end the story and they tied it all down to the 12-21-2012 date and wrote a story that seemed to fit but ended up predictable.Story ProblemsNeither is Connor nor is Haytham likable. You don't really come to care for them or their plight. These characters are just too two dimensional.  Worse, that Connor chooses to become an Assassin just to kill the people who burned his village seems a bit extreme.  For Altair and Ezio, their stories worked.  For Connor (and Haytham), it fails.  The setup wasn't done well enough.  Basically, Ubisoft needed about two or three more rewrites to this story before ever designing a level. I also personally wouldn't have chosen this era of time to place the story.  1776 is just not really a time most people would want to see of our history within a modern video game.  I would have choosen something far more modern (WWII) or something much more distant past, but after Ezio's time.Cutscene GaloreThis game made one of the biggest mistakes I've seen in a game of this notoriety.  It decided to use cutscenes to not only begin and end quests, it liberally intersperses them into the actual game play driving it to a complete halt.  We don't buy games to watch cut scenes.  We buy games to actually PLAY them.  Unfortunately, this game is so filled with cut scenes, you'll find yourself skipping and skipping and skipping every single one of them at about halfway through the game. I'm amazed that the game director actually let the game go out the door like that.  It's a good thing that this is the final game as I don't think the next game would have near the amount of people buying it.Environment and GraphicsWhile the environments are gorgeous, there are just too many gameplay issues that prevent the game from being truly fun. Although, the wilderness does look amazing. Connor's Assassin outfit, when you finally get it, is top notch.  There are some truly awesome visual design elements in this game.  But, as with movies, visual effects aren't what matter here.  It's the gameplay.Fighting SystemThe fighting system was overhauled, but not for the better. Ubisoft dumbed down the fighting to two buttons, attack and counter. So, when fighting a guard, you have to use one of the two of these buttons. The problem is, when being attacked by a crowd of guards, you cannot focus on one guard and eliminate him.  The game constantly forces you to switch focus to the most recent attacker.  So, if you manage to get a guard to the ground, by the time he's down, the game has changed your focus to the most recent attacker and you can't finish the other guard off.  So, you're constantly trying to kill even just one of the guards.  Unless you can manage to the get the game into 'streak kill' mode, you cannot recover from this constantly switching focus problem.With previous AC3 games, the engine specifically waited until you were done with one guard before having another guard attack you.  In this game, they all attack all at once or by taking turns, but none of them wait for anything to finish before attacking.  Some attacks can take nearly all of your health. Some attackers have a move where they will jump over you and attack you from behind.  You can't counter this attack nor can you even make this move.  If he's supposed to be a skilled assassin, how is it that the guards have more attack skill than Connor?When roaming the wilderness, there is one other fighting mechanism that was introduced in AC3. This is the predator fight system. When you get too close to wolves, elk, bears or mountain lions, they'll posture, growl and then attack.  However, instead of the familiar grab-your-blade and fight them real-time, the game inserts one of those two random timed button attack things.  So, you have to press A then B or X then Y in a certain amount of time.  If you get one correct but not the other, you might have to press B a whole bunch of times to get the mountain lion off you (all the while draining tons of health). Whomever at Ubisoft thought this was a good idea should be ushered out of the building. Timed button attacks have no place in this kind of game. If a mountain lion is to attack, let me take my chances with a sword or a gun. I don't want to have to guess at which button is next or at getting the timing just right.  Thankfully, the animal does give a warning before it starts the attack, so you can whip out a gun or a bow and nail it before that whole thing starts. That's the only redeeming value to this part.HealthUbisoft botched this in AC3.  With previous AC games, there were Doctor's stations where you could heal.  You could also carry around medicine and apply it whenever you needed it. In AC3, this system was removed completely.  No more doctors or medicine. So, the only way to heal yourself is to get out of the fight and run away as you will slowly heal.  This means that to heal, you have to run away.  Worse, while fighting mode is activated, you heal twice or three times more slowly than when it's off.  So, you have to run away to get out of fighting mode just to heal yourself.  This is probably one of Ubisoft's biggest mistakes with AC3 (along with the abysmal story).GameplayYou'd think that Ubisoft would have the game controls down by now. Now, even though Connor is an Assassin, Ubisoft completely botched the stealthy aspect of this.  They did this by making you a trudging klutz and then by filling the roofs with guards about every other building so you now have to roam via street.  Gone are the fair maids you could hire for cover, the mercenaries and the coin flipping roof dwellers.  You are firmly on your own. Second, the fighting has completely changed and not for the better. No longer do you have the many different ways of attacking your opponent that AC1 and AC2 carefully taught you how to do.  No.  These are all gone. Now you have two moves, attack and counter.  Taking out your gun and trying to shoot a guard is way out of the question. That move is just far too slow.  Same for the bow. So, it cannot be done easily.  Worse, if you manage it, it takes far too long to reload to do it again. Yes, I realize it is a musket. Instead, you'll find yourself using desyncronization as a trial and error method to getting out of a fight.  In fact, it's actually faster to descyncronize than it is to attempt to run away and become incognito again.Horses are probably the most worthless means of transportation in the game. If you can manage to keep the horse on tiny narrow trails, then the horse gets tripped up on rocks, water and just about every other little thing that it comes across. The horse will only jump the tiniest of things, so don't expect much with horses.  Even though they are relatively fast, you can't really use them for off road travel.  Expect to run if you want to travel off of roads.Commentary on AC3Ubisoft made a hugely risky and questionable choice at investing in a new game engine this late in the game (pun intended). Frankly, this change was to the detriment of this game. But, I think I understand the reason.  I believe the new engine was introduced so that this game could work on not only the Xbox and PS3, but also the PS Vita for Liberation.  In that game, you play as Avaline De Granpre.  She is an Assassin with basically the same moves as Connor. In fact, I believe the same game engine was used for both AC3 and Liberation.  The difference is that Avaline has personas she can take on (Lady, Assassin, Slave).  In these roles, she gains different levels of access to different quest pieces by taking on different personas.  But, in the end, the game is all about being an Assassin.  For the same reasons that AC3 isn't nearly as good as AC2 or any of the previous AC games, the same can be said of Liberation.Glitchy is definitely the word of the day for Liberation too.  Specifically, when pigs fly.  Yes, in this game Pigs do fly, out of the back of wagons as these wagons trudge through town.  The game is just glitchy enough that even Avaline can fly when wagons roll through. I haven't seen too many glitchy issues yet with Connor, but I've definitely had control problems with both games.  The same problems I've had with all of the previous AC games are still in AC3. This part has not been fixed. The fighting engine was majorly dumbed down and actually Assassinating someone is no longer really that much fun as the controls are too klunky.OverallI thought this game might resolve some of the problems surrounding previous AC games, but instead Ubisoft made it worse by introducing this new game engine, introducing tons more cut-scenes and dumbing down the game play (while adding tons more guards).  When you do attempt to battle the guards, they just come out of everywhere all over the city and you just get ganged by them.  Worse, there are some guard types where you cannot win.  They will counter your counter and block your attacks. Some of them will even jump over you and attack you from behind. Assassin's Creed 3 is by no means a welcome improvement to the game or a fitting conclusion to this franchise.Overall: 2.2 out of 5Graphics: 4.8 out of 5Story: 1.2 out of 5Pros: Closure, looks great, side quests are more fun than main storyCons: Main story boring, X-Y predatory fights annoying, dumbed down fighting, too many cut scenes","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2012"}

Blizzard knew that the Real Time Strategy genre of gaming needed a breath of fresh air, and it gave us one.  Warcraft III is mainly unique in the addition of heroes.  While heroes do not make a lot of difference in a skirmish, in the campaigns they prove both indispensable and a lot of fun to play.In previous games, I preferred skirmishing to campaigning, because you didn't have to worry about an annoying set of goals and you just killed stuff.  But the new Warcraft has changed my mind completely.  The campaigns are more involved, and the characters have their own personalities, which greatly add flavor to your campaign.This game focuses more on strategy in battle and less on army-building.  There is a cap on the size of your army (which I thought would be annoying but turns out to be a good thing), and you are forced to make better use of what you have.  No more gigantic armies that annihilate the opposition.  No, you actually have to work for it.I'm glad that Blizzard added two new races to this game.  This provides essentially double the amount of playing-time.The NPCs (non player characters) in this game are also a welcome addition.  You can battle dragons, trolls, or ogres, and pillage whatever treasure they may have.  You can also buy supplies from a goblin merchant or hire mercenaries.  You just have to be careful not to let your peons stray too far--a dire wolf might nab them.Blizzard's games are traditionally very user-friendly and relatively free of bugs.  Warcraft III is the next chapter in the Blizzard catalog, and a new revolution in RTS gaming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2002"}

And I dont want or need much of a story line, I want to blast aliens and save the planet, galaxy, ship or whatever. Unfortunatly I spend so much time looking for keys and trying to figure out the darn puzzles b4 I can proceed. Also, I just cant get into the dang controls, so mushy and sluggish, the main character is so slow, there is a faster button but why cant it be done with one thumb control? Even the fast button he only trots even when nightmarish creatures are tearing him apart. Its ridiculous how slow he turns when being attacked from the rear. The weapons which are outstanding really get on my nerves, they wont auto select when ur out of ammo, u hav to scroll thru the weapons to select a new one when your out of ammo all the while getting mauled by some demon creature. And whats with all these little store stations to purchase weapon upgrades and ammo and suit upgrades, I really hate that. Im really into the game and having to stop at a store and buy things just ruins it for me. When your out of air U again have to scroll thru the menu,press A to select then again press b to get out of the menu all the while being mauled by, well u get the picture. And all these doors, every 40' theres another one and it takes time to stand there and press open while these demon creatures are ripping your intestines out or your out of air and need to reach the airlock. Its an ordeal trying to do these controls, the main guy Isaac is as slow as, well hes slow. And I wish he wud take off that ignorant space suit. I really want to luv this game, but the controls are so screwed up and mushy, maybe its the 3rd person shooter Im not used to, or maybe its the screwed up camera many times going in dif directions than you want it to. But gears of war had a similar shooter style and i had no trouble with 1 or 2. I praise the guys that put together this visually stunning masterpiece, but I want to strangle the persons responsible for making it a 3rd person shoother with to many buttons to push. A real exercise in aggrevation. However some of the games I hated the most, when they were finished I thought, hey that was a great game, maybe this will fall in that list, but im starting to doubt it. If I can only master these controls. UPdate: I am getting used to the controls and better at shooting the limbs off some really horrible creatures. I have some surround sound optical input headphones, The sounds of whispering screaming, walking, explosions and monsters growling & shooting toxic vomit coming from all directions is seriously scary, can u imagine and old gamer getting the crapola scared out of him? I started telling others about this game and now Dead Space 2 is being released soon, can Issac survive this hellish nightmare? will my heart hold out? Should I let my 7 and 10 yr old kids play it? This has turned into one of the most aggravating games. I hate it, and I luv it. I dont think I will purchase Dead Space 2 Untill I hav seen some reviews and the controls have improved and the main character has learned how to run and move quicker.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2010"}

It's very creative, very unique, it offers no handholding and is relentlessly difficult, but never in a way that feels unfair.It's a wonderful dark fantasy RPG, and anyone with the patience to learn it should give it a spin.In contrast to it's prequel, I think it's up in the air wether it's the better or not. Level-based versus open air, and both were done so well that it's just going to be a matter of preference. Most of the system designs and combat quirks are for the best but the game does struggle a bit compared to Demons Souls in terms of performance and online implementation (though at the end of May 2012, Atlus is shutting down the Demons Souls servers so it wont matter anyway. Shame on them)One thing I never hear much praise for in Dark Souls is the music. The music is STUNNING, it's by a new composer, Motoi Sakaruba, and probably the best work I've heard from him since the original Valkyrie Profile.

{"product_name":"B000JLIXIG","reviewerName":"pennywyze","summary":"PS3's best shooter","reviewText":"I recently bought Resistance Fall of Man for the PS3 after putting this game off for the longest. Something about shooting aliens/creatures in the  1950's did not appeal to me; and it still doesn't appeal to me. But what Resistance lacks in a plausible story more than supplies with gameplay to overshadow this major quirk.Here's my review-Graphics-The graphics are a mixed bag in my opinion. While it lacks color even in comparison to games like Killzone or Call of Duty, somehow, the color scheme's washed out and gritty look really enhances the atmosphere.In Resistance, there's lots of browns, greys and washed out green colors with cream whites and more greys. With that said, the graphics are good for the most part and the frame rate is smooth. (Not Halo or COD smooth, but smooth nonetheless)The game also moves at a fast pace and although you won't get loads of enemies spawning the screen at once, lots of things happen during the campaign that lets you know the game's always on it's toes so to speak.The aliens in game have an interesting design with them sporting six eyes and being twice the height of a normal man complete with gear. But the problem with the enemy design is, they all pretty much look the same, therefore, It would've been much more interesting to see different enemy types RATHER than the same enemies spammed over and over. You do however get a chance to fight some huge mid-bosses/bosses that come in the form of giant mechanical thingies to bigger aliens.The game's physics are also a bit quirky. Shoot a grenade at an enemy and watch them literally fly all the way across the screen; which is cool. But then there are times such as even in the early levels in which you're able to blow up a gas station and somehow the enemies will shrug it off as if nothing happened. I also wasn't too crazy about the lack of destruction physics. For example, you can commandeer tanks and shoot whatever you like, but after shooting a wall, it looks like nothing touched it at all. The set pieces that are explosives are usually explosive cans bunched up or vehicles while trees and buildings seem to be impervious to shell fire. Just a bit weird.The usual graphical quirks rear it's ugly head at times such as minor clipping, but nothing major.For the most part, while you're not getting mind blowing graphics with RFOM, the game does look great and the color scheme has possibly the grittiest look of any FPS (with the exception of Metro 2033 or Metro LL).Score- 8/10Sound-The dialogue in RFOM is excellent even though the story is laughable. The story progresses through narrative stills and light cutscenes here and there. The sound effects are good as well, however, your standard carbine lacks the &#34;oomph&#34; especially after playing games like Battlefield, Bad Company or Killzone. The end result is that the Carbine just sounds like loud bangs rather than having the audio fidelity of a lethal arm.I barely noticed the music much being that I actually turned it down to &#34;40&#34; and just enjoyed the game's sound with limited music. However, based on the score that I did hear, the soundtrack is actually decent. While it certainly doesn't have a &#34;Halo soundtrack&#34; or anything that truly sucks you in; musically speaking, the sound effects and dialogue are again, enough to enhance the gameplay experience. I really dug listening to an all out war going on while my squad groaned and grunted in agony whilst fending off these alien beings. Some aliens make strange sounds that make the game that much better.Explosions sound appropriate as well. I really didn't have an issue with sound other than what I said about the Carbine gun.Score- 9/10Gameplay/Story-Here's where Resistance becomes a mixed bag in my opinion...at least relating to the story.I did not like the story much even though I sort of liked the idea that the main protagonist, Nathan Hale is the lone survivor in a conflict against these alien beings. The problem with the story is that it sucks in my honest opinion. It takes place in 1951 in an alternate reality of the Cold War era in which the army is waging war against &#34;these aliens beings&#34;. (called the Chimera) My problem is, unlike games like Halo, Metro 2033 or Metro Last Light, or heck, even Call of Duty, this story is beyond far fetched as that part of my brain is telling me &#34;this didn't happen&#34; or wasn't feasibly possible. Resistance could've simply been a game about the Cold War replacing six eyed aliens with (insert rival) and it would be an extraordinary game and possibly a game that would've redefined FPS's this gen; period. However, despite it being a game about aliens, it still manages to be an excellent FPS offering this gen.Ignoring the story and playing the game, the atmosphere is so good alongside the game's pacing and huge firefights that it's hard not to be impressed, even for gamers that have played Halo or Battlefield.What Resistance offers that tosses it's ridiculous story out the window and redeems the game would be atmosphere, smooth control (even though when aiming down the sights, the view becomes really obstructed and almo9st looks like you're looking in an entirely different area of the paying field), smooth framerate, a fantastic campaign experience, vehicular combat like Red Faction or Halo and Bad Company, an addition of interesting weapons and attachments that only Insomniac could supply much like they've done in the past with Rachet and Clank, good graphics and fantastic dialogue.On normal difficulty, Resistance gives up a decent challenge and a pretty long campaign. (well over 12 hours or more depending on the difficulty)It also utilizes some light instances of the Sixaxis controller motion functionality in which you'll literally have to shake off Chimera.And in the end, the more I thought about this game and played through it, the more I was forgivable of it's &#34;ridiculous&#34; storyline.Once the campaign's over, there's multiplayer, which I didn't try being that I wouldn't want to play it when Sony's taking down the server for the entire Resistance series this coming March. :(Even so, there's offline co-op multiplayer and campaign. Co-op multiplayer is local split screen with 4 players duking it out (which is lame in my opinion. Seriously, why not a bot mode like Killzone? or at least a Horde Mode)And then there's co-op campaign which lets you play the entire campaign with a friend. (This was cool)For the most part and placing all my eggs in one basket, this game is well worth the money to buy new or used and in my opinion while the PS3 has Killzone 2 and 3, those two games merely pushed graphics whilst slacking up on the gameplay aspect. Resistance is a fast paced, atmospheric thrill with the perfect control. I highly recommend it.Score- 10/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2014"}

For Zack, a cruel and fateful struggle awaits...","reviewerName":"Patricia Laverty","summary":"best thing to come out of Final Fantasy 7 since forever.","reviewText":"Love it or hate it, it's hard to deny that Final Fantasy VII at least moved the long loved series forward on the technical level. Today the blocky 3D figures of Cloud, Tifa and company might not be the easiest on the eyes, but back when it originally released in 1997 it was a sight to behold. From there on out, each subsequent Final Fantasy game managed to push the limits of the hardware for whatever console it was released on, and with Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core, that statement still holds true.Not only is Crisis Core one of the best looking PSP games on the market today, but it also marks the best spin-off Final Fantasy title that has come out of Square's big Final Fantasy VII Compilation effort, easily blowing away such dredge as Dirge of Cerberus. I'd even say this marks the best non-main Final Fantasy title to date, so the big fans of the series shouldn't be disappointed in the least.For those of you that haven't been madly anticipating the title, Crisis Core revolves around the tale of Zack, a character only mentioned thru back-story in Final Fantasy VII. Friend of Cloud, fellow Soldier member, and love interest for Aerith, Crisis Core focuses strictly on Zack. There is no stone left uncovered when it comes to his history with Shinra, Sephiroth, and others.Fans will be happy to see plenty of cameo appearances by other recognizable faces, but Square Enix does a great job of reigning themselves in, and they manage to not contradict the events in later titles, as any good prequel should. Instead they manage to fill in the small holes from what little we already know about Zack, and expand upon that story without being overly heavy handed in both dialogue and plot, a problem that many had with the CGI film Advent Children.There is some beautiful CGI featured in Crisis Core as well, but it manages to actually take a backseat to the story, and outside of a couple scenes Square Enix manages to keep the action as realistic as possible (as real as magic and what not can get). This helps to ground this tragic tale into the hearts of fans that have had an emotional investment in these characters for nearly 10 years.However, while plot and story make up the substance of any good Final Fantasy title, how does the game actually play? Taking away the standard turn based RPG mechanics of most Final Fantasy titles, Crisis Core uses a real time action style similar to the Kingdom Hearts titles by Square Enix. However, while many lament that you can simply \"button mash\" your way thru most of KH, that tactic will get you killed quickly in Crisis Core. Along with your basic attack button you also have a dodge and block (Square and Triangle), and the real trick to most fights is anticipating an attack by watching for a telltale attack animation and dodging at the right time. When it's successful you can even end up behind your opponent, which will allow you to land critical hits until the enemy reorients themselves to face you.Along with your basic attacks you can also equip materia, small stones that played heavily into the magic system of the original title, that allow you access to various spells. All of the standard spells appear here, and you can level up each materia to a maximum of 4 levels. Later in the game you'll gain the ability to create new materia by fusing stones together, and eventually you'll gain the ability to toss items into the mix. On top of this, some materia will contain various bonuses, such as a percentage added to HP or MP along with just the standard magic attack, so you'll want to experiment with as many combinations as possible.You're also given two equipment slots (later expandable to four), and with these you can add on items found throughout the game that can either enhance your HP, MP, and AP, or even block or lessen certain status effects. All together, you can pretty much customize Zack however you see fit, but I found that as I advanced towards the end that I felt a bit overpowered, especially considering how easy it is to hit your HP cap early on using items and materia.The L and R buttons handle cycling thru magic on the battlefield, and while certain fights can feel a bit frantic, you shouldn't have any trouble getting the hang of things. Simply run away from your opponents if you feel you need more time, since most magic attacks have a limited range. The biggest hassle has to be clicking on items and then cycling thru the list of available items just to find a much needed remedy or elixir. However, as you get the hang of combat you should find yourself adapting to everything with ease.All battles are random, and at times a bit too frequent for my tastes. Also, simply running away from a battle is a difficult since you have to look for the exit, especially in side mission areas where everything tends to look the same. Enemies aren't particularly smart or challenging, but if you're not paying attention they can gang up on you quickly, and you'll take quite a beating for it. If you opt to complete some of the harder side missions later in the game you'll come across the cheapness of the spell Death, which always hits you unless you manage to interrupt the spell by attacking the caster. Otherwise, be sure to have plenty of Phoenix Downs on hand, which you need to cast on yourself prior to being killed.The main storyline isn't particularly long (or challenging) but at every save point you're able to access a ton of side missions, laid out in groups depending on the \"story\" involved. There isn't actually a lot of story involved in the quests, and certainly nothing that impacts the main storyline, but they provide bite sized sections of combat perfect for players wanting something quick to run thru on their way to work or while on a lunch break. There are over 300 side quests to make your way thru, and they end up being the best way to gain summons, equipment, and rare materia throughout. At 20 hours on my final play, I had only thirty-eight percent of the side quests finished, so needless to say these missions can keep you busy for quite some time. For the most part they're also fun to play thru, but a bit repetitive. It's not until you run into the \"very hard\" section of quests that you'll find some cheap enemy tactics that might be a bit hard to stomach for most casual players.The soundtrack of Crisis Core is also worth noting. While many can argue the merits of Final Fantasy VII's original tunes by Uematsu until they're blue in the face, it's hard to deny that most of the tracks featured in Crisis Core are solid, if not spectacular. A few of them end up being remixes from the Final Fantasy VII, but they're just as good, if not better, than the originals. In particular the opening theme at the title screen is fantastic, and the remixed melody of Aerith's theme is outstanding as well. Kudos to Takeharu Ishimoto for not simply rehashing that stuff we've heard over and over again, and really breathing new life into some fond memories of these familiar themes, along with introducing some fantastic new tunes.Along with the musical score, Crisis Core's voice over work is pretty well done. I never felt that any one particular voice stood out as something incredible, such as Balthier from Final Fantasy 12, but on the other side of things there wasn't a bad apple in the group. Something to note is that Aerith finally receives a decent voice actor (not Suvari or Moore), and it finally manages to fit her character quite well.I had a few other minor issues with the game that don't fall into any particular category, but here they are. While you can skip the FMV animations for summons, you can't skip them for the limit break attacks, which are nearly as long and far more frequent than your summoning spells. Also, the slot reel system needs a far better explanation, and having it tied into your leveling system is pretty confusing.Basically, the reels are always spinning while in combat, with certain number combos granting you status bonuses, such as no casting cost, limited invincibility, and so on. However, when the faces on the left and right reels match, the slot reel (or DMW) will take over the screen, usually ending up with the middle reel matching the left and right, which will take you into a limit break depending on which character is showing. These can also lead into a separate reel that contains your summons, and if you manage to match faces on that reel you'll perform a summoning attack instead. Along with this, when you manage to hit all 7's on the reels during a limit break / summon situation, Zack will level up. Also, if you manage to hit the same two numbers side by side, you'll level up an equipped materia depending on the order you have them equipped. For instance, if you hit a 5 in the left and middle reel, then you'll level up whatever materia you have equipped in the fifth slot of your inventory.Confused yet? It's actually pretty simple, but the mechanics of getting the DMW to pop up are a pretty big mystery. Above the slot reel you'll have a colored meter that represents your current limit break state. Most of the time this meter will stay normal, however certain events (and even a limit break) can cause it to change, all the way up to Heavenly. At this point you'll encounter more matching faces on the reel, which in turn will cause you to perform more limit breaks or summons. Once you enter that full screen DMW mode, the current level that your limit break meter is at will decrease, and it will eventually fall back to normal. On top of all this is the SP meter, which rests above both of these things. The best I could figure is that SP is basically experience points. Each enemy you kill will give you a certain amount of SP, and I figure this is the way the system keeps track of when you SHOULD be leveling up. There's nothing in the game that tells you when you'll level, but the pace is pretty spot on for the story, so leveling isn't nearly as random as it seems.So outside of my issues with the DMW system, and some minor things like the unskippable animations for limit breaks, Crisis Core stands out as not only a fantastic Final Fantasy title, but one of the best games on the PSP to date. That's saying something in light in the pretty stellar year the system saw in '07, so hopefully you system owners out there will take my word for it and pick this one up. Great action in small bursts, and a fairly level headed storyline that won't leave you scratching your head. Even if your memory of Final Fantasy VII isn't as fond as others, Crisis Core still manages to be a fantastic game worthy of your attention.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2009"}

People are entitled to their opinions, but I feel that BioWare is such an awesome company and deserves more credit. But onto my own review:Storyline: I found it very interesting...it was very intense, very emotional, and very intriguing. And to address the ending...I didn't love it, but only because it was sad. And I can't insult something just because it makes me sad anyway. I can't get into it and this isn't a debate site, but I was still okay with the endings, and I was interested in the story the whole time. I liked the new characters, enjoyed seeing the old. I wish there had been more romantic interactions between my character and her lover but it's not up to me.Music: Oh man, what a treat! The music was so great and thrilling. I would love to have a soundtrack of this game.Multiplayer: I find it very fun. In order to get better characters and guns, you have to play enough games to buy Recruit/Veteran/Spectre packs which may or may not contain something new and good. It's repetitive doing the same type of mission over and over, just with different enemies or maps, but I like it a lot anyway. It's like zombies in COD where you really have to stay alive as not to burden your team mates.Graphics: I have been spoiled by COD games, Halo Reach, and Skyrim, so no the graphics aren't as good as those. However, it is still a stunning, beautiful game.Replayability: Definitely will play this a few times to make different choices.Summary: This is a great game. It's fun, it's interesting, it's emotional, and very well done. I really hope people won't hate the entire series just because of the ending...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2012"}

Herzog","summary":"A wells made FPS, but rather generic","reviewText":"Like most here, I believe the first Resistance was an excellent game, that blended WWII sensibilities with aliens to make something fresh and rather excellent.  The sequel looses those elements and makes a rather generic game. The game itself is well made, the graphics are an upgrade over the previous one, the controls very tight, and some genuinely good boss fights make the experience well constructed.  But there's feeling of something new or fresh, or even the feeling left with the first.  Perhaps the creators thought it would be better to advance the game and make it more like other FPS, but in so doing they lost their special magic.  I didn't like the limitation now placed on holding weapons.  More often than not, I was using the same weapon the whole game to get through it, rather than using whatever weapon may be fun at the time.  The story was more like Halo than the first game, and I was not thrilled with the ending.Overall the game is well made, executed and everything is good on paper.  If you're looking for a FPS in general you won't be disapointed, but if you're looking for an improvement on the original, you'll probably be disapointed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2010"}

I've been watching all of the preview videos, live streams, etc. but now that I finally got my hands on this I'm amazed. The upgrades they've made over Oblivion, the sheer beauty of the graphics engine, the interaction with the people, the fighting system, the leveling system, the quests... just the sheer amount of things to do. What can I say, call me a fan.Enough gushing, right? So what's wrong with the game: the melee combat is better than Oblivion but still not perfect. It would be very hard to nail perfect, but hey, I enjoy it as is. Some weird glitches happen every so often (mainly with NPCs wigging out). There's also texture pop-up and some muddy looking things when you look up really close, but that goes without saying since the whole world is loaded when you walk outside. One last little gripe is when you go from building to building you have to wait for a load time every time, gets kind of annoying when I'm trying to rob people blind by going house to house.That's it.

A little bit combat, a little bit strategy, this provides quick, easy missions and then involving online gameplay.If you've seen mech games before, you know the basic idea. Big, plodding robots with legs, tracks or wheels. Lots of weapons and armor to plunk onto the mech in lego-like fashion. Enemies and buildings to blow up, while staying alive.Where other mech games go for arcadey non-reality, ChromeHounds tries to keep things real. Your mechs don't zip along at 100 miles an hour. They stomp with realistic weight and speed, leaving behind footprints and track marks. The detail on their glistening metal body is quite impressive. With the incredibly huge amount of customization available for your mech, you can spend hours honing the exact perfect mech for your gameplay style, and really care about its survival.The world you inhabit didn't get this same level of loving detail. The missions are all very short and really don't need a plot. You are blowing things up while trying not to be blown up yourself. The environments you stomp through are almost an afterthought. Don't look for waving fields of grain or purple mountains majesty here.As in many modern combat games, the basic mission tree is really all just a training mission for the *real* challenge - facing other human beings. You want to replay the local missions several times, tuning your mech movement skills and your weapon / armor combination to get ready for the team based online gameplay. That is where the real fun and skill-testing begins. Can you coordinate your efforts with your friends to ward off attacks from other skilled players from around the world? You can't just run and blast away - that technique will get you killed quickly. You have to know your mech's limitations and advantages, and then plan joint attacks to achieve that victory. It really is a fun combination of hand-eye coordination and tactical intelligent planning.Well recommended for people who have online gameplay and enjoy that level of thought. For someone just wanting an arcadey fly-fast-and-blow-things-up-locally, you might want to rent this first to see if the realistic mech functioning will keep you happy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00020LZBG","description":"The third installment of the Ratchet & Clank franchise incorporates new elements of gameplay not seen previously in the series, including online and offline multiplayer capabilities that will appeal to a wide variety of players.Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenalreturns gamers to Planet Veldin, the setting of the originalRatchet & Clank, where the duo set off on a gripping new adventure through a multitude of diverse planets to fight for galactic peace. Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.After word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest inRatchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub. The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"Vin Bruce \"7line\"","summary":"BEST WEAPONS!","reviewText":"Better weapons than Jak 3.

Reading the Gaming sites reviews is not a lot of help either, some rate the game horribly, and others rate it good. So it's really coming down to personal opinion if you'll like it or not.The graphics are good enough for the HD generation. But nothing special.The sounds are decent, but some things could have used more polish.Vehicle control is not that great, but I don't think vehicles are a major focus here like in GTA.The camera controls on the character could have used a bit more tweaking. I spend too much time fixing the view while simply running.I do like being able to recruit a crew with specialties to come around with me, but it would have been nice to give the main character at least one skill.The random \"missions\" are plentiful, so there's always something to do. But sadly these are all \"Kill / Hurt this person\", Blow up this place, etc, etc. Good way to build up cash and upgrade characters.I will give EA kudos for having the guts to have half-nude strippers. Many of us are adults, and we want our games more realistic.In summary: for the most part I am enjoying the game, but it wasn't worth the full price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2009"}

This game is designed to be slow pace so you need patience so you can observe your environment, know enemy location and know which target to hit first.  on normal you don't need to worry about wind speed or direction, just gravity, Speed, and Aim Stability.  I got used to sniping so most of the time I won't use the Aim Assist because its more satisfying when I take the shot.  The X-Ray Kill Cam is the best part of the game and the characters breathing makes you feel like your in the game.  Game has Average Graphics,  Easy Controls, Great Sound, Gameplay,  Story is ok. Game also has collectables such as Gold which requires you to search everywhere to find it and Bottles which requires you to carefully observe your environment to find and snipe them.Cons-there's only stealth Melee attacks,  so you can't melee the enemy if he sees you or your in close combat.-Close combat is horrible, if more than 2 enemies come near you, you die, due to lack of bullets and or bullets don't seem to do much damage to the enemy.-once a enemy discover you, no matter where you hide they know your exact location.  its impossible,","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2012"}

But NEVER in my WILDEST dreams did I think GTA would reach the heights that San Andreas has achived. One thing you will never be able to say about Rockstar is that they put out a game just to put one out and run to the bank. With each installment in the GTA series, just when you think they have made a flawless game, they make a better game. Vice City was truly an unparalled game but San Andreas clearly surpasses it in every way. No more cheating your way through missions. Character custimization. A map modeling southern cali. Improved graphics and sound. Soundtrack reflecting 90s west coast rap. More buildings to enter and stronger mini games. Actual fighting system (with increasing levels). Character upgrading (strength (affects fighting), stamina (affects running)) and a helluva lot more I probably forgot to mention.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2004"}

Survival horror as its never been seen before, The House of the Dead: OVERKILL is a pulp-style take on the best selling, classic SEGA light-gun shooter series. Back when the famous Agent G was fresh out of the academy, he teamed up with hard-boiled bad-ass Agent Washington to investigate stories of mysterious disappearances in small-town Louisiana. Little did they know what blood-soaked mutant horror awaited them in the streets and swamps of Bayou City.","reviewerName":"Charles H.","summary":"Short and sweet.","reviewText":"Ah, House of the Dead: Overkill. It's a rail shooter that involves blasting your way through hundreds upon hundreds of zombies. You and a friend can play as the unlikely duo of Detective Isaac Washington and some fed named Agent G. Together, you'll witness a pretty funny storyline that brings to mind various horror and action films of years gone by.The gameplay itself, for what it is, is pretty good. This is a very solid rail shooter. The camera movements are very realistic, the zombies look nice and disgusting, and the storyline is entertaining (even if it is laced with profanity all throughout). There are also boss battles to mix things up a little.One of the games more interesting features is the combo system. Basically, if you can shoot multiple zombies in a row without missing, you'll start to get combos. THere are many in-between, but the highest one you can get is a \"Goregasm\" combo. After that, you get one thousand points per zombie. If you can keep it going, you can rack up a massive score on each level. This also resorts in making more money for beating a given level. The money be used to upgrade your weapons or unlock some of the media on the disc.There are two main problems with Overkill that I see: 1) It's too easy. 2) It's too short. If either problem was reconciled, we'd have a pretty great rail shooter on our hands. These two factors work against each other in a way that compromises the overall quality of the game. You'll probably be able to work through each level on your first attempt. This would be fine if there were twenty or so levels. But with only the five or six that there are, the game could have used some good old fashioned Fake Difficulty extend its longevity.It takes about two hours to beat the Story Mode, at which point you can play a harder version of Story Mode again in Director's Cut mode. So, you've got about a four hour campaign there. There are some reasons to replay the main game after beating it, as you can try to unlock all of the music and remaining weapons, find all of the collectible brains in each level, or maybe just chase after that perfect run through a level. So, some reason to replay the game is there, but personally, I don't find the prospect particularly compelling.Outside of the main game, you've got some mini-games. One mini-game involves withstanding an endless horde of zombies (probably the best one). Another involves protecting civilians from zombies. The third one is just your run of the mill target practice game. They're all decent, but also pretty typical of what you'd find in almost any light gun game.There are some framerate issues. In the later parts of the game in Director's Cut mode, there are tons of zombies coming at you. The Wii just fails to keep up in certain places.One final pet peeve I have with this game: Sometimes, Zombies will strike you when you don't have control of your weapon. I had it happen to me three times. I don't know if it's a glitch or a gameplay feature, but it's decidedly not cool.I would recommend this game, but not if you somehow manage to find it for $50. The current rates on Amazon are pretty fair, though.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2013"}

You switch between the characters of Billy - the young half-Mexican lad, and Ray, his uncle, a gunslinger who is out to kill him.The conflict is that Billy, coming home after several years of roaming, finds his mother and abusive stepfather are dead. Ray thinks Billy has done the deed.  The story then plays out with Billy trying to clear his name and find a fortune, and Ray wanting revenge.The story is extremely linear, as you might expect in this situation. If you're hopping between the two characters and, as Ray, you were able to Kill Bill, the game would be over.  I definitely understand the linear gameplay. Heck, in pretty much any game you want to achieve their end objective, be it  take over the town or destroy all the enemies. Still, it's nice to feel you have some control along the way. Entire roads are blocked because of a plot twist??Also, as much as it is linear, it is very vague. You're told to do something, but then you have to stumble around for a while to figure out what exactly they want you to do in order to progress. It can get frustrating.The graphics aren't that bad on a high def TV - the individual leaves on the trees are visible and the humans are reasonably detailed. We've taken several trips to the western US region and it really is pretty out there. They did a nice job on some of the cut scenes, with small reflections in metal surfaces, the dull rasp of leather, and other details. The clouds aren't solid objects that drift - they actually change shape as they go.The voice work in the game is reasonable enough, but while I liked the soundtrack at the beginning, it got really repetitive REALLY quickly. In some games the soundtrack blends in really nicely and you enjoy it. That's not the case here. It's a shame too, because sometimes it's peaceful as you walk along beneath the drifting clouds, with the grasses slowly waving, the birds singing in the trees.As much as I appreciate the differences of sneaky Billy with his whip vs shooting Ray with his guns, I just didn't like this game as much as some of the other westerns we own. It was too linear, the soundtrack was too maddening, and it was too short. A great game to rent for a week, and that way you can see if you adore it enough to keep it after that.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2007"}

(P.S. Be sure to beat Seraph for the most revealing part of the entire game) 3)It does help one to live the fantasy of actually being in the movie. You can do all the neat things you've seen in the movie and it provides a bit of a rush if you're REALLY into the matrix films.4)The in-game graphics are decent enough and the environments look really cool. 5)The fighting can vary enough so it's not boring, the gun play is wicked cool, and nothing feels finer than destroying an army of military men with your one man/woman army.Now onto the bad, for this game IS very flawed.1)While the cut-scenes are incredible the game graphic cut scenes are a joke, you laugh as they switch from real life to cut scene and how ugly it really looks.2)The Driving car, and logos levels (Especially the final logos level which is unbelievably glitchy and it's impossible to see where you are going, in the Niobe game.) feel rushed and rather than add a vary in the game playing they become tedious and boring levels you wish would end so you can resume having fun again.3)It does feel rushed at times, and the levels (the airport, the sewer, and the powerplant for example) sometimes seem to just go ON AND ON with no end in sight, they easily grow tiresome and you again just wish it to end so you can resume having fun.4)The automatic save feature picks alot of strange places and times to save, while it is convenient so that you don't have to play an entire level again, it seems to happen too frequently and can at times feel slow.This is a split down the middle choice. It is better than 90% of all movie to game translations, but it is in no way perfect. Only get this if you love the matrix movies, and can let go of these  flaws in order to live out the movie. It can be fun alot of the times, and has a great deal of cool moments where you break into fights and they punch out the techno music. Those make it a worth while purchase in the end.P.S. It  ends as abrutly as the film did. Very anti-climactic. Although the Revolutions trailer in the game is far superior to the one playing in theatres.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2003"}

Fortunately for me I haven't owned a Madden game in years and I'd say this is one of the better years for the franchise. So typical Madden as far as the game play goes, but each year they of course add a little flare to it. The graphics are very good, the cover is awesome, the uniform preferences before each game, and the overall ability to control your game more than any Madden before.That said, the flaws are hard to overlook. The game is mostly realistic, but this game can be very challenging against CPU or playing online if you don't play this quite a bit. What can happen is the other team will make a decent pass or run, break a few tackles and all of a sudden they are on the scoreboard. Most of the time there is absolutely no way of catching up to someone. And when your on offense, the passing game can be difficult as well. Field goals past the 40 are impossible as well. It's still realistic in most ways though. One last thing is that even though the expansion/franchise mode is mostly satisfying, the customization of the jerseys is annoying and the logos are terrible. Some problems in here make it seem that they were being lazy on purpose so that they could improve them in the next Madden which is cheap. Also when will there ever be a sports game where the crowd isn't on their feet clapping and cheering the entire game? It's almost 2010 and we still can't improve upon things that they did in the 80's and early 90's. I understand why it's there but it's unrealistic.

For me, it took about 90 hours to finish.  But let me emphasize that those 90 hours were some of the most engrossing that I have ever experienced with a video game.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who does not mind the somewhat below-average graphics.  The game's soundtrack more than compensates for any graphical shortcomings.The battles are random, and perhaps too numerous in quantity for this gamer's preference.  However, most can be quite entertaining.  Some battles are fought while the characters are controlling giant machines called \"Gears\".  Most battles are fought in hand-to-hand combat, with each character having the option to unleash powerful attack combinations.If there is a shortcoming to this game, it has to be the fact that the story was too complicated and too deep to communicate in the manner that they chose.  By the second disk, some of the main characters had to basically sit in a chair and narrate the story to get it moving in the right direction.

{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"Adron Gardner","summary":"Old Snakes Die Hard","reviewText":"If there's a better game than Metal Gears Solid 4 this generation, I still haven't played it.Metal Gear Solid 4 is one of those rare experiences that has deserved every bit of praise heaped on it.  There's control depth, humor, action and great characters.  Beyond all that, it's just a lot of fun to play.  Metal Gears games have become an acquired taste.  Even many fans are snobbish in which games in the series they prefer over others. This one is my favorite, but clearly it isn't for everybody.  If all you like to do is shoot, move along, there are other games for that.  Not that you can't do that here too.  After playing through the game again this week after finishing Uncharted 3, Arkham City and Gears of War 3 last month, I am continually reminded how much influence this series -  and even just this game -  has had on the industry.  Having not played the game since 2009, I fired it back up a few days ago to see what it was like.Though Snake has seen better days, even in 2011, the game still looks great.  There's a few misplaced textures but the level of polish and pure depth of control you have with Snake is unmatched.  Where games like Gears of War stole the cover mechanic, they never really nailed the characters or gameplay like MSG did.  How many games give you so many options to take down enemies as this one?  Uncharted has a much more engaging story and more versatile protagonist, but lacks the depth of movements you have with Old Snake.  Arkham tries to do stealth, but you don't have OctoCamo and you can't crawl on your belly like Snake can do. Even quicktime events take on new meaning toward the end on this one.  But there's more than movement, there's a story too.First off, I am one of the ten people who probably really enjoyed the cutscenes - all nine hours of them.  Even though the story makes no sense, I couldn't care less, they're still fun to watch and play with all the camera angles.  Where in older games you were mostly strung to the dialog screens with a thumbnail picture of Otacon or the other characters, here you are thrown into full cinematic, and often interactive, situations. Like I said, I found the characters engaging enough to follow them through it all in spite of the convoluted and incoherent plot.  In the end, all you really need to know is your name is Snake and it's Escape from New York all over again.Where many games today are laregly linear afairs with rooms of enemies to clear out before moving on, MGS4 is a rich artistic expression of one person's vision. Metal Gear Solid 4 is a unique experience, Kojima's team put more care into a single set piece than many other games have in their entirety.  What other game gives you a bunch of crazy infomercials to flip through and some blank \"Hideo\" channels before the game actually starts?  The boss fights are tons of fun and some require some experimentation to defeat (Vamp) and others an obscene level of patience (Crying Wold).  Sure you can speed run, skipping cutscenes on lower difficulties but why bother? Just play Tetris if that is your thing.  There's so much to poke around and do in Hideo Kojima-san's world, you really don't feel like rushing.  My first play through on Hard was around 20 hours and I literally took a stroll everywhere the game would let me.Metal Gear Solid 4 was the reason I bought a Playstation 3.  Though the game sold like 5 million copies, I guarantee they could sell at least a million more if it was re-released with trophy support.  There would be no regrets or frustrations forking out more as an excuse to play the game again.  Great games are more than pushing buttons or shooting enemies, they leave you with a lasting impression of a total experience with memorable characters.  This is one of those games and here's to hoping Snake, in one form or another, rides again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2008"}

After a near 5 year drought of any command and conquer games (due to the end of westwood studios), Command and Conquer 3 is released. It is set in 2050, where tiberium has decimated 30% of the world(red zones), affected 30%(yellow zones), and left 20% untouched(blue zones). The Global Defense Initiative (GDI) is at a peaceful stage, which is interrupted when the brotherhood of Nod, lead by the yet still alive sociopath Kane, when they nuke their space command center, the philadelphia. The fallout is a war between GDI and Nod, with aliens intervening later in the war.Enough with the story, The three factions of this game are very diverse and fun to use: Scrin uses air power and technology, Nod stealth, flame, and nukes, and GDI uses the classic brute force and heavy armor. The only resource is tiberium crystal (blue is twice the value of green) The game has a great skirmish mode with an acceptable but not outstanding variety of maps. The ability to manipulate scenarios and even CPU personalities (difference not always prominent) is a definite plus to the game. The graphics meet the par of this generation, they are outstanding and the explosions are great. The campaign mode is the best by far. Both the GDI and Nod campaigns are based on unpredictable and exciting plot lines. The missions are fun and have enough diversity. The campaigns are enough to challenge but are not impossible. They are long, but not tedious giving you many hours of gameplay. The campaign has many twists and even unlockables.Now the negatives. Gameplay can be frantic and hard to keep up with for non-experienced RTS (real-time strategy) gamers. Being only an average gamer myself, I do not find it to be too difficult though. Also, tech trees are easy to climb and you often find yourself dueling with elite units early on. Harvesters have pathfinding issues ( one once crossed my protected tiberium field to use an enemy tiberium field). Besides that, bugs are minimal. Now, to recap:Skirmish mode: 8/10, Average maps but good customization featuresMultiplayer: N/A, never used itGraphics: 9/10, what you would expect but not groundbreakingBugs: 10/10, thank goodness there are very fewSystem requirements: 9.5/10, need a good computer but I haven't heard anything of requirements being excessiveCampaign mode: 10/10, very rich storyline, few monotonous campaigns, interesting and non-tedious, unlockable alien campaign along with GDI and Nod campaignsOverall: 9/10, a very good, near perfect game with great story, fun, graphics, factions, challenges, and scenarios.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2007"}

The visuals are stunning, and getting something like this from a portable is just a pleasure by itself.  The lighting, water and grass looks great, short of the PS3 version of the first uncharted but close enough to admire.  The game is eye candy on the go.  The animations are a little stiffer than one would like, but still this is dealing with the limitations of a portable so the animations are more than fine.Gameplaythis is where U:GA shines.  I love how they moved away from the action flicks Uncharted 2 and 3 style.  This game is slower pace, there is more exploration by having more to get than just treasures.  Touch controls are hit and miss, touching the ledges to guide Nate while climbing is a superb feature. Gyroscope for aiming the camera and sniper was one of the better uses of the PS Vita features.  Shooting mechanics could have been a better, but still enjoyable.  The cut scenes are there looking as great as ever.  The Uncharted feeling is there in every turn, even the font of the subtitle is spot on.Having a PS Vita and not getting Uncharted Golden Abyss makes no sense.  This games shows you just how great your new toy can be.  It does everything from great visuals, animations, content, and is bringing console quality as close as possible on the go.Great game, remembers me of Uncharted Drakes Fortune, which was the first game ever i got my plat trophy and it seems like i will plat this one too.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00309XHD0","description":"","reviewerName":"JLeack \"Jleack\"","summary":"Best survival-horror title of the generation","reviewText":"The original Dead Space has remained the most well-received survival-horror game of this generation, and Dead Space 2 continues that in a responsible manner.The story is a bit convoluted, but if you manage to grasp to essential parts of the story, it's mind-evoking and intriguing. The combination of sci-fi elements, aliens, and insanity creates an experience that strays from the conventions of most survival horror titles we've come to love and enjoy (i.e. Resident Evil and Silent Hill).Gameplay is smooth, even more-so than its predecessor. There are a handful of weapons, each of which are satisfying to use, so you'll be flooding online message boards with questions in no-time. The puzzle sequences get a bit annoying, but do help add some variety, although I reckon the game didn't need it due to its amazing atmosphere. There are several key gameplay elements such as Zero G, and alternate fire modes that really give the game life. No qualms here.The presentation is simply outstanding. The graphics are solid, and although textures don't compare to the likes of juggernauts such as Uncharted 2 and Killzone 3, the environmental effects, and shadows are nothing to scoff at. One of the best things about the game is a quality that is shared between both this title and its older brother: the audio. Aural effects are creepy, and create an environment where you never feel safe. Voice acting is executed well, and doesn't hamper the story. Also, the way conversations are presented is particularly unique, and you'll have a sense that you're playing a very special game only minutes into its grasp.This is a game that will last you about 10-12 hours, but there are plenty of reasons to come back including unlocks, lots of trophies, intriguing difficulties, and the overall enjoyment experienced with the title. Also, if you get the PlayStation 3 version, and you luck out and receive a Limited Edition version, then you'll also get Dead Space Extraction. Dead Space Extraction is a great game to play with Move, and one that is fun to play with the friends, and even just to play casually to keep reliving the Dead Space world.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2011"}

I've been holding it, since release, and never opened it. Too busy playing Yoshi's Island DS on my new Ice Blue I imported from [...]But this game uses the stylus to the max!  I really enjoy playing music games, definitely my favorite genre.  I was hoping the soundtrack would be more snazzy and jazzy, and a bit less rock and roll.  But that's okay.  The \"cover bands\" are not too bad, and as I'm a bit older than the young kids playing this type of music, so I don't notice the differences much.  But, the music is not my normal type to listen to.  I enjoy more poppy tunes, and less \"grunge rock.\"I may just have to check out the Japanese version of this game, and see if it uses more \"J-Pop?\"  Maybe somebody who knows could respond to that, in the comments section of this review?I love the use of the stylus and how you can take on the roll of a \"hero\" in this game.

F-Zero X is a stunning achievement in that it's truly the first racing game that runs at a brisk 60 frames per second, even in multiplayer. In fact, more than anything else, it is this feature that is F-Zero X's claim to fame. Does the rest of the game stack up? Well, it depends on what you're looking for.Instead of trying to compare it to its 16-bit counterpart, we'll dissect F-Zero X purely on its own merits. After all, the bar has been raised for racing games in general over the past few years. So what does the game have to offer? Well, first of all, forget any kind of simulation aspects. This is twitch gaming at its best. Although you can tinker with the basics, like acceleration and speed, that's about all you get to do. Everything else is just about driving. Playing like a Wipeout without weapons (which was like playing F-Zero with weapons), F-Zero X's only added enhancements are the inclusion of dash plates located at various points around the track. When you run over one of these plates, you get a severe speed boost that doesn't cost you any energy (after the second lap, you get boost power that you can use at any time, but it takes away some of your energy), enabling you to blast past some of your opponents. However, they too can use these plates.That's not to say that you can't dispose of your opponents though. By using the Z-button or the right shoulder button you can either crash into your opponent making his energy meter drop, causing him to explode if his meter is low enough. Or, you can try to shove him off the track if there is no barrier keeping you in. A number of play modes are available, including practice, death race, time attack, and vs. battle. However, the majority of the racing will be done in the grand prix mode, where the cup levels await. Each cup increases in difficulty, naturally, but with each additional level conquered, more and more racers are made available to you, adding replay incentive. If you make it to the final secret cup, you'll uncover a random track generator that offers you a fresh challenge every time.So what's the problem with F-Zero X? For starters, with up to 30 different racers onscreen at any given point, some sacrifices had to be made in order to keep the insane frame rate so high. Polygon counts on the vehicles are very low, giving them a particularly uninspiring look. The track detail is also very limited, giving the track a spartan feel to it. In its defense, the tracks are cleverly designed, especially the twisty corkscrew tracks that speed by at a blazing pace. One feature that's lacking is a first-person view. If speed was truly supposed to be on display here, a cockpit view would definitely have helped, but alas, there is none to be found. Control is pretty good, although the analog stick can be kind of touchy in places, leading to a few inadvertent fender benders. The sound effects are very good and actually add to the feeling of speed in the game. Unfortunately, the music can be pretty annoying in a cheesy synthesized-metal kind of way and doesn't really add much to the whole experience.As a game, F-Zero X is certainly thorough in its execution; unfortunately, there just seems to be very little in the game to keep you coming back. Sure, Nintendo incorporated all those funky characters to give it... um... character, but the game erases all that good stuff with its overwhelming blandness. Yes, the game can be fun in multiplayer, being supersonic and all that, but the game just lacks those certain intangibles that make a good game great. Practically flawless from a technical standpoint, the biggest thing missing from F-Zero X is that it lacks a soul. It's yet another stunning update to the legendary Nintendo catalog, but it's games like this that make you wonder: Where's Metroid 64 or Donkey Kong 64?

Kill!","reviewText":"Let me just say this. Out of all racing games I've played for the Nintendo 64, only Diddy Kong Racing and Mario Kart 64 are more fun. Okay. With that said, let's explore the various components of gameplay in a random, unorganized order. What I found really compelling is the awe-inspiring cast of characters. 30 racers, each with their own personality and life story, is quite a hefty amount. Another thing this game excelled in was the sense of SPEED! While Star Wars Episode I Racer went just as fast if not faster, that game didn't present you with the sense of speed F-Zero X does! Sometimes it can get overwhelming, and that sends you flying off the track, where (if you're playing multiplayer) allows you play a rather fun slots game in which you can still affect the action on screen. The ability to completely wipe out opposing racers with a slight double press of R or Z really adds great strategy in the single-player mode. And Death Race. Oooh...that is a classic!  Tracks are well-designed. Boosts. You won't win without them. They can get quite annoying, since if you miss one, you're pretty much screwed, at least in multiplayer. Single player AI is pretty dumb.I don't really remember much of the music. Recently, I was able to use VGMusic (great site) to listen to F-Zero X MIDIs, and based on what I heard, it didn't seem very impressive. Perhaps it's because these rock-like guitar riffs don't appeal to me. Give me soft jazz, western, or classic any day! Sound effects stick better in my mind, and they are pretty good. The thing that sticks out the most is probably the wail as you fall...off...the...track...KABOOM! Visually, F-Zero X had been kind of lacking. The textures were bleh, and the backgrounds were just fog or clouds. Even though it's not visually or aurally appealing, F-Zero X is still an extremely fun game to play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2004"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone.

{"product_name":"B007XYBUBE","description":"","reviewerName":"Leohlyon","summary":"What took Sony so long?","reviewText":"The reason I wanted to own PlayStation All-stars is because I'm a HUGE Fat Princess fan! Nah, I'm kidding, I wanted this game because of Super Smash Bros like everyone else lol. I can't believe Sony waited this long to make a game similar to Smash Bros. For the most part, it met my expectations (there was a slight hiccup here and there).Things I liked - You'll be able to choose from 20 vastly different characters, which is more than enough for me. Many reviewers complained that 20 isn't enough, but I don't think it's an issue. Matches go by extremely quickly when playing online! Ranked matches last 3 minutes, which translates to a ton of battles in an hour of time. For those of you that work and have a busy life, you'll be able to get quite of few games in during a short period of time. You won't ever have to deal with ranked online battles taking an eternity to complete *COUGHS c.o.d. games COUGHS* You'll have to excuse the coughing, I must have a touch of that influenza that's going around... My favorite aspect of the game is probably the uniqueness of executing a kill. I'm not going to bore you all with details, just know you can't kill someone by just beating the crap out of them. You have to build up your 'super' meter, and then land the kill shot(s). Overall, it's a very addictive game and experience!Things I didn't like - Sighs... People, people, people. When playing online, you ARE allowed to play as characters NOT named Kratos. The developers made Kratos considerably better than anyone else, so obviously he's going to be a fan favorite online. The single player mode leaves much to be desired. It's very dry and unimaginative. My biggest gripe with the game overall is the horrible stat tracking! Battle points, along with how many times you placed 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th are the only major stats that are tracked. Wait, what about total number of kills? Nope. How about total number of supers attempted/landed? Nope. I'm a stats guy, so one of the main attractions to online gaming is cumulative stats. Without stats, how in the heck can we tell which areas we need to improve upon? My final mini complaint is in regards to the 2 versus 2 online battles. In order to engage in a ranked 2v2, you'll need to invite someone from your friend list. So in other words, you don't have the option of pairing up with a random person online. If you're in the mood for a ranked 2v2 battle, and none of your pals are online, you're S.O.L.Although I enjoy playing the game, I still wish there were a few things that would have been done differently. If you're intrigued by the idea of 4 people fighting on the screen at once, get this! Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon, you're up next!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2013"}

I won&#8217;t be denied.  Not on a day as momentous as this.  Anywho.  I will get one in a few years.  I went with the PS4 at launch.  No big fanboy reason.  It&#8217;s that after 3 RRoD I don&#8217;t trust Microsoft.  I don&#8217;t think that this machine will have the failure rates but I am a woman scorned.  Rationality has no place in my relationship with Microsoft at this point.  Try and win my heart back you cold monster if you dare!First impressions first.  Yep, it looks like a VHS and that&#8217;s not just a cliche.  I too had that first thought pop up in my head when Microsoft did their big reveal.  Big whoop and all but it&#8217;s a story I tell to this day.  Still though who cares what any of these devices look like.  I stick it in the entertainment center and then keep the little glass door shut on it.  It&#8217;s form is to be ignored; that is it&#8217;s true functionality.  As for my impressions of it&#8217;s packaging and all the silly frivolity of unboxing videos I&#8217;ll save those comments for the next iPad gizmo release.As for the Controller.  I dunno.  No need to have an opinion on everything.  From the pictures and varied range of opinings from across the grand vast ocean of the Internet enough black ink has been spilt.  I like the Xbox360 controller.  Heck, I loved it.  But it still wasn&#8217;t the Dreamcast controller and neither is this newest iteration.  But it beats the Atari 2600&#8217;s one button, one joystick set up.  So it has that going for it.The Big Home Theater integration.  Guess I&#8217;d have my heart in the whole endeavor if I had a cable box, surround system, 3D blu ray player, Tivo and a Ouya to plug into the Xbox One to exert it&#8217;s great will over.  But I got an RCA antenna sitting on the floor that catches 11 channels when the screen door is open and the wind blows right.  Me thinks there isn&#8217;t a jack in the back of the Xbox One for it though.  Otherwise my game system is the only component of the Home Theater in my apartment.  And I ain&#8217;t gonna hook up my PS4 into the back of the Xbox One.  Don&#8217;t seem right in fact it seems a tad bit like a cat and dog engaging in unnatural relations.  Probably should be illegal from a certain point of view.Onto the games.  And isn&#8217;t this that should matter.  Yep, the one thing that tugged at my morbidly blackened heart strings to almost nearly quite but not sway me to the Xbox One is Forza 5.  That&#8217;s gonna easily be the pinnacle of the new gen launch games.  Better than DriveClub had that come out in time.  But I&#8217;m putting my money down on the long end game.  I prefer the PS3 exclusives to the Xbox 360s.  Love me some Forza Horizon and Gears of War and Alan Wake but PS3 had games I preferred a weensy tad bit more.  Just an opinion based in nothing more than my personal preferences.  On a side note: about Quantum Dynamics by Remedy.  It ain&#8217;t coming out for 5 years.  They promised the Alan Wake game to be released in the 360 launch window and 5 years later it finally landed.  Learn your lessons people.  See the pattern.But what about the Kinect you may ask.  I for one welcome the intrusion of an all seeing &#8216;EYE&#8217; into my home and yours.  The day is coming so why not embrace it now?  Big Brother isn&#8217;t the apparatus of the government; he&#8217;s pure commerce.  If Big Brother keeps track of what I buy, what I like, what I want then so be it.  Better ads targeted at me.  I don&#8217;t want to be sold stuff I won&#8217;t be buying.  So to Big Brother I say thank you.  And if the Kinect were to be constantly on  and watching me as I wander aimlessly around my apartment in various states of undress I&#8217;ve got nothing to hide.  And if you want to see it be my guest.  Otherwise as for the Kinect&#8217;s use in games and doing what I want I&#8217;m taking a pass.  All them promises Big Tech companies promise us all so many half-fulfilled meandering idealisms of what may happen but we all know won&#8217;t.And that leads to all the other things the Xbox One is supposed to be doing. Fantasy Football integration.  Skyping.  Sharing game videos on Youtube et al.  The vast majority of everybody won&#8217;t be using none of these things.  It&#8217;s pure hype.  Sounds great, works terrible.  But by all means, if you&#8217;re sold on these things than have a blast.For the final humdinger of a rant I gotta say that both PS4 and Xbox One have set a horrible precedent by increasing the friends limit.  Letting me add 2000 friends to my friends list is something I don&#8217;t want.  I&#8217;m not playing video games cause I have a wealth of friends.  I don&#8217;t want to wander into some virtual lobby to play some FPS combat game and then get inundated with a bunch of friends requests.  It&#8217;s gonna be worse than spam or pop up windows back in the glory days of AOL.  It&#8217;s gonna be a major annoyance.  I don&#8217;t want friends on my video game accounts.  More friends just means more people wanting something out of me and my heart is only so big.Final Thoughts.  Isn&#8217;t it rather presumptuous for any of us to write reviews of products on Amazon in the first place.  I think most people that are writing these XBOX One reviews are either showing off that they bought one (and bully for them cause they were either intelligent enough to pre-order one or stood in line while the rest of us work for a living.)  The other people writing it don&#8217;t own one (just like me!) but they want to muddle the shiny pool of gleaming watery hope for the people who do.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

You are literally expected to turn this game on and know exactly what to do out of the box based on the instructions that have been included with this game, which in my personal opinion are truly lacking.The game itself offers very few options to customize your experience and automatically creates an air of frustration without giving much in the ways of defining what your actual mission is other then to shoot an expected number of kills. The problem with this is that while there are indicators to tell you that your prey is coming your way this does not indicate if this is the actual prey you must kill in order to achieve your goals. If the goal here was to leave you as blind as possible as you would be in the actual wild and have never hunted before this being your first time and no one showing you what to do or what prey you are allowed to legally kill, well I guess it succeeds in that area.Frustrations only mount as levels are broken down into two, and while every game should have a challenge the way this game challenges you is that if you mess up one of the missions during the level you are in it ends your game and you are taken back to the start of the level. This would not be a problem except as mentioned the levels themselves are broken up into levels. It's not that the levels are even very long, but without the guidance of understanding what the objectives truly are mistakes are abound and the level of frustrations that come with it take away from any sort of gaming experience that one would enjoy if they had never played a hunting game.Controls are another issue, again without any sort of training mission you are left with relying on the bare bones instructions included and a \"good luck\" figuring it out mentality which just boggles the mind as to why a game maker in this day and age targeting a system such as the 3DS who's main age group is children would leave out such a feature. Even for the hunter who may pick this up to give their kids system a go is going to leave them thinking they should hang up the old firearm and take up another hobby because this game has such poor controls. You use the stylus to move yourself, and your gun and the left trigger to fire. Reloading is a pain as well. Instead of having an easy access to the reload you use the control pad which makes zero sense of placement.In terms of variety of weapons, nope there is a major fail in this area too. Very limited amount of options in terms of available weapons as you progress through the mundane boring missions which offer very little in terms of changing it up, and all feel about the same except for the switch out of environments and occasional kills.For those who are wondering about the online multiplayer, forget about it. I had zero luck even finding one person online to give this a go. That tells me there really is not much more to offer then the single player element.The only thing you will wind up hunting after playing this total waste of plastic and programming is for the nearest trash can and questioning why you spent your hard earned money on a game like this with limited entertainment value at a ridiculous price point. This should have been a download for $3.99, and even that is a stretch considering what you get here in terms of options.PROS:Good use of 3DCONS:Everything else, no just noBOTTOM LINE:A total pass, this game truly is a boring heap of a mess that is not worth your hard earned shekels.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2012"}

My top three all time favorite PC games: Baldur's Gate 2, Fallout 2 and Torment; are all Black Isle games.  Black Isle games have a level of depth and quality that other studios have yet to match in my opinion.  With that in mind, this game was the deciding factor when I bought my PS2.  Granted it was still in the developemental stage, and I knew it would never have the depth of the PC versions, but the Black Isle name and the Baldur's Gate franchise was enough to interest me.I got the Xbox when it first came out, and I honestly thoguht I'd never play another PS2 game that could compete.  Let me tell you, Dark Alliance, holds it's own with any of the Xbox games I own.  Not only that, but it is the best PS2 game I've ever seen.  The graphics are superb, the gameplay is addictive, and for a console RPG it's surprisingly deep.  After playing all those PC games I didn't think I'd ever find a console RPG that could hold my interest.Don't buy this game expecting a sequel to the BG series.  This game is different in several ways, not all of which are bad.  The graphics are far superior, and the stability of the PS2 means no bugs or crashes (something Fallout 2 and Torment, as good as they were are notorious for).  On the down side, you can only choose from three different characters and only get one character per player, without the benefits of rolling your own stats.  On the upside, you can play with a friend, and it takes the game to a whole new level.It's really unfair to compare this game to the original BG games, both of which were over 4 CD's long and took hundreds of hours to complete.  This game never tries to achieve the same things the PC versions do, but instead it is a leap in a new direction.  It has all the high-paced action of Gauntlet, but set in the colorful Forgotten Realms.  If this sounds good to you, you won't be disappointed.  Even fans of the old BG games should keep an open mind and give this a try.  Once you get over the differences, it's a blast to play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2002"}

So here is a separate review for each game.God of WarBeing released in 2004 the does feel a bit old. There are more flaws in this game than the first, but let's start with the good things. Apart from revolutionizing games and the action adventure genre single-handedly the game is amazing and epic. The game is full of huge towering bosses, waves and waves of enemies, a deep dark story full of Greek mythology, a fluid, almost perfect combat system, and boobs. Yes that's right boobs. At the time of release I had never seen a game with so much nudity before, but it shouldn't really shock gamers as much these days. The game also has some very intricate puzzles that wind up being whole levels that you have to solve such as Pandora's Temple. The combat system is pretty fast and fluid on its own.With Kratos whipping his Blades of Chaos around you feel like you have complete control over him. Another combat element that revolutionized games was quick time events. After weakening an enemy enough you pressed the corresponding button (usually circle) over them and a series of buttons flash on-screen. If you don't press it on time the enemy knocks you down and you have to start over. Of course you can just kill them normally if this gets dull for you. The best QTEs, however, are during boss fights. If just feels awesome to plow a mast through a 200 foot tall Hydra. Now you do need to realize that there is magic here as well. You get four different powers throughout the game such as Medusa's Gaze (freeze enemies), Poseidon's Rage (shock), Hade's Army (souls that continuously attack enemies). These, plus your weapons, can be upgraded by collecting red experience orbs. As you upgrade all your items you get new moves, plus increased power. If you're asking about your health and magic your can collect Phoenix Feathers and Gorgon eyes for magic and health respectively. These are all found in hidden chests throughout the game so keep an eye out.The camera is fixed so it frees up the right analog stick for dodging moves, the camera does a perfect job of following the action without any problems. Some times you can scale up walls and even fight there or on ropes. Combat is pretty much anywhere Kratos goes and this keeps things mixed up. The level's traps and puzzles are very well designed and require you to really think or be on your toes.The story is very deep and memorable. We see Kratos as a fallen Spartan leader who gives his life to Ares if he slays he Barbarian leader who is about to behead him. Ares makes Kratos his servant for eternity, but Kratos becomes a raging killer who kills the wrong people. He becomes set on a path to free the nightmares from his mind and kill Ares in the process.If I were to nitpick about what's bad about the game it's that the game looks kind of dated from today. The textures are a bit low-res and blurry, and there are some collision detection problems when jumping around. The game is also extremely difficult even on the normal setting so God mode becomes virtually impossible. The game has a decent length of about 8-10 hours, but other than that the game is great for the first outing. If you finish up the game you get to unlock hidden costumes, Challenge of the Gods, and some other hidden treasures.God of War IIIf you think the first game was epic wait until now. With visuals that surpass the first game twofold, and even more huge epic bosses God of War II became the best game to ever grace the PS2. The story follows just after the events of God of War. Kratos is still sent on a war path to avenge his nightmares and kill Zeus for killing and betraying him. He must find the Sisters of Fate and turn back time to the moment Zeus betrayed him and kill him.The combat system is slightly upgraded, but pretty much the same. It feels a bit more fluid, and we even get some more moves. The controls are a bit more refined, and we get new powers. We get some new secondary weapons such as a hammer and staff that can be upgraded. The puzzles aren't as hard as the first game, but there are a lot more of them this time around. The game also seems to be a bit harder as well with even tougher enemies. We get a new grapple hook for swinging around so this adds a lot to the game play. The game also feels more fluid and has a lot more epic moments than the first game, but most of these come towards the end of the game.While God of War II pretty much is almost like the first all the new content make it an epic and thrilling sequel. The only issues with the game is that it looks a bit dated, the game can be very tough at times as well. The game is about the same length as the first, but the game obviously feels and plays five times better than the first game. There are a great amount of extras as well as a full length making of section on the disc for God of War II.So if you think all this sounds good you can now pick the game up brand new for $30. $15 a piece for two of the best games ever made is a great bargain to me. With a separate set of trophies for each game, HD resolution, and faster FPS this is a huge package that is exploding with awesomeness. God of War Collection is probably one of the best deals to grace consoles since The Orange Box so don't hesitate; every PS3 owner has to have this collection or you aren't a true gamer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

I've been suckered into nearly every high profile RTS ever made.  When I first played Generals, all the dissapointment, the years of frustration with hyped up garbage suddenly didn't matter.This game is a gem.I pay attention to a few key things in an RTS:1.  DiversityIn species or nationalities, units of production, and units of war.  Generals has not only an abundance of diversity, it's managed to very elegantly balance them.  The Americans, the Chinese, and the Terrorists all win (online) at about 1/3rd each.2.  PaceRemember Total Annihilation or Starcraft?  Those games had you sweating it out from the second a game launched.  This appeals to me.  You can play a fast-paced game and not have to devote a night.3.  AnimationUnits with high detail, beautiful lighting, insanely cool looking explosions....this one has it all!  The graphics engine for this game was (at the time of release, and still to my knowledge today) the best on the market by far.You can very easily play this game online, it (now) has a very well developed playmatch system, and as you win, you gain rank (very addictive attribute).I recommend this, and Rise of Nations to anyone who loves RTS.Enjoy...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00309U0M6","description":"","reviewerName":"Annihilatrix1138","summary":"In Space, Nightmares Never End","reviewText":"The firstDEAD SPACEwas simply an amazing game to play through. Much like RESIDENT EVIL 4, it upped the ante for what makes a survival-horror title great. It could've settled for just being terrifying while in space, but it was also very, very good science fiction. Traveling through the USG Ishimura was an immersive experience; with almost no (noticeable) loading screens between decks and other various parts of the ship, along with fantastic level design, there was a sense of cohesion that few games this side ofALAN WAKEhave been able to attain. So, with no loading screens or cutscenes, you really never knew when things were going to attack you, or from which angle.DEAD SPACE 2 could've done all sorts of things for the sequel, but thankfully they opted to take all of the things that made the first game great, expand upon them, and set the bar even higher. This is a much bigger and scarier game than the first, with a story and universe worthy of the hard sci-fi genre it celebrates.The story takes place three years after the events of the first DEAD SPACE, with Isaac Clarke waking up in a psych ward on the Sprawl, a massive, self-contained city built upon a shard of one of Saturn's shattered moons. He has little to no memory of anything that's happened to him in the last few years, but he DOES know that there's a necromorph outbreak sweeping through the Sprawl. Disoriented and without answers, Isaac has to fight his way through a city that's fallen into chaos, all the while trying to figure out how all of this could happen (again).The game lumps on the mystery from the beginning and the answers are slow to arrive, leaving you to wander in ignorance along with Isaac - which I liked. Your only priority is to survive, but the story that eventually takes shape is a good one, which greatly expands upon the already expansive universe built around these games. You'll also get a chance to learn a lot more about the once-silent Isaac Clarke, and how he's still struggling to come to terms with the horrific events of the first game.And one of the major changes you'll notice starting out is the scope of the game. We aren't confined to a single ship anymore; Visceral Games have gone out of their way to make you feel like you're really playing through a vast, cohesive city. Like in DS1, there are no real loading screens or cutscenes (except when you change discs), so attacks or major events can happen when you least expect it. The areas are well designed and very pleasing to the eye. You'll fight through shopping malls, a church, sewers, an apartment complex, and many other places, and nowhere is safe.In the gameplay department, everything's largely unchanged, which might please or disappoint some fans. Aiming and navigation are much more responsive; if something sneaks up on you, it's not as difficult to turn around and start blasting away. The zero gravity sections have benefited from the addition of a thruster pack on Isaac's suit, so you'll be floating through the areas instead of hopping around. New weapons have been added, as well as new suits that retain different attributes. For instance, one suit grants you higher damage with the pulse rifle, while another gives you a discount at the store. This gives you more incentive to explore, but this leads into one of my main criticisms.Like I said, DS2 is bigger, better, and much more stunning visually, but not too much has changed in the way of gameplay. I might be looking at this the wrong way, but fighting off the necromorph horde is on the verge of becoming repetitive. Sure, there are a few new kinds of baddies, but most of them will be familiar, and the game's way of making things more difficult was just to throw more at you. In DS1, managing the horde was a challenge because new types of enemies were gradually introduced, which forced players to adapt. In DS2, you just get swarmed, and I often found myself with very little ammo to fight them off.So, my main criticism is that I feel the DEAD SPACE games are beginning to back themselves into a corner gameplay-wise. I would've been disappointed if MASS EFFECT 2 had forced you to fight more geth in different ways, so I'm slightly disappointed that this happened in DS2. I hope the necromorphs don't necessarily have to be the main focus villain-wise going forward. In all the chaos and corruption on the Sprawl, surely there were other things that were deserving of being shot at with a plasma cutter. It only adds to the story when there's more than one bad guy.But that's something that I don't feel detracts from the game overall, but rather something that detracts from my confidence in the series going forward. Visceral Games sort of shot themselves in the foot by creating this interesting and immersive sci-fi universe that I honestly believe is up there creatively with BioWare's MASS EFFECT series, only to populate it with one kind of enemy. I just see way too much potential there, I guess, so I hope Visceral capitalizes on that in the future.For now, DEAD SPACE 2 is an amazing game, and I'm very positive that fans of the first DEAD SPACE will not be disappointed. In fact, DS2 goes out of its way several times in the story to celebrate what went down on the Ishimura. All in all, it's a terrifying and fantastic continuation of a great survival-horror title.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00309U0M6","description":"","reviewerName":"Rick","summary":"Loved it almost as much as the first one!!","reviewText":"I didn't really expect the second game to meet the standard set by the first, but it came close.  It's not quite as good as the first one, but they did make some improvements.  They took away the in-game map but they added the ability for you to select what you want to be shown the way to when you click the right thumbstick, objectives, save stations, work benches or stores - so the map really is un-necessary & I understand why they didn't bother with it.  And Isaac speaks this time out!!  I also like that they added the ability to actually navigate in zero-g environments.  The entire last level of the game is a fight to the finish that will have you holding your breath - it doesn't let up until the final boss battle.  Don't want to spoil the ending for anyone, but when the credits start rolling don't put the contoller down just yet.  This game does not end the way I expected it would, it totally took me by surprise.  It's not what you might expect from a game of this type.  The story was well crafted, the new enemies and weapons were well done and the eyeball scene near the end made me pretty uncomfortable.  All in all, a great continuation of the series and an excellent game on it's own.  There's even a \"Last time on Dead Space\" selection in the menu where anyone who hasn't played the first one can be brought up to speed.Warning: I noticed a couple of negative reviews where gamers did not like the game because they claimed it was too hard.  If you try and play Dead Space 2 like you would Call of Duty or Halo you're going to get your ass handed to you, even on normal difficulty.  Seriously, it's not that kind of game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2011"}

It is a direct continuation of Assassin's Creed II (see my review).  Although this installment has made some substantial improvements over the previous game, it generally feels like an expansion of it, and as a result, just like its predecessor, it is a very good game with some substantial flaws.Let me get some of the negatives out of the way before I talk about how good this game is (and it is quite good).  I was disappointed that the economic system of the game hasn't been improved, that being, at about the half way point through the game, you already have more money than God.  And when you have all the money that you'll ever need so early in the game, it takes away that money-chasing element that is so fun in the first half of the game, such as looting bodies, finding treasure chests, pickpocketing, and questing for money.  Another thing is the combat system.  Yes, I know this game was touted for its improved combat system, and it IS better this time around, with a nice kill streak system that is reminiscent of the Batman Arkham games.  But still, the combat still feels a bit sluggish and stiff overall, and to me, feels several steps behind most current gen games in this aspect.  Lastly, is that the controls still aren't as accurate as they should be.  Considering all the amazing movement you can execute in these games, it's embarrassing that something such as hopping off of a ledge, or making an accurate jump in a particular direction, can be so troublesome.With that said, Brotherhood is an overall better game than Assassin's Creed II.  Lots of the \"fluff\" of the first game has been cut out, mainly in the side quests, which are fewer and more meaningful and substantial this time around.  A good example of this are the \"DaVinci's Machines\" missions, which send you to different locations around Italy to destroy the war machines invented by Leonardo DiVinci that are being exploited by the Borgia.  Missions to assassinate Templar agents open up new areas of the map.  Courtesan, thief, and assassination missions are fewer, as opposed to the way they were bombarded upon the player in AC II.  The game's setting also continues to be fantastic.  Although lacking the diversity of the Florence/Venice/Tuscan countryside of the first game, the setting of Rome is stunning in its detail, scope, and feel.  Once again, the teams at Ubisoft have proven themselves the masters at making vibrant, historical worlds that not only look and sound great, but also serve to teach the gamer a thing or two about history.  And although the story of Ezio in this game is entertaining, it's generally more of the same.  It's the story of the main protagonist of the series, Desmond Miles, that steals the show here, and propels the narrative of this series to a new high.I have to mention two features of the game that really stood out as my favorite, and really helped make this game a step up from Assassin's Creed II.  The first are the Romulus Lairs, which replace the Templar Lairs from AC II (which were also very enjoyable in their own right).  Unlike the Templar Lairs, which mainly just required precise platforming to complete, the Romulus Lairs are almost self-encompassing game worlds that Ezio has to penetrate in order to decode a mysterious scroll and retrieve the game's ultimate set of armor.  They are extremely diverse, containing elements of platforming, exploring, combat, and chase sequences that really stand apart from the main game.  At times, they give Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood the feel of a dungeon crawler with secrets around every corner and surprises at every turn.  These were stunningly well done, and always a highlight to play.  The other great feature of the game is the ability to build your secret army of assassins.  This is done through a mini game where you recruit citizens to become soldiers in your secret army, and then send them on missions around Europe where they gain experience points, which in turn lets you upgrade their armor and weapons.  Once they have leveled up enough, they become quite powerful and are able to undergo more difficult missions.  But the best part about having this army of assassins is that they are available to come to your aid in battle at almost any time.  You can have them silently take out guards that are out of your reach, or cause a rainstorm of arrows to instantly eliminate huge crowds of enemies.  Having a strong assassin army at your fingertips is just awesome, and best of all, can save you the trouble of having to get into combat scenarios more than you'd like.  It is a great addition to the game that feels very natural and is extremely fun.Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood continues the tradition of this fine series in a very good way.  There is definitely still room for improvement here, and at the rate Ubisoft is releasing games in the series, the opportunity to phase out the flaws and fine tune the high points is there.  In the meantime, if you enjoyed Assassin's Creed II, Brotherhood is definitely worth the purchase and is a superior game overall.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2012"}

The game actually flew under my radar almost entirely, only getting me to finally pre-order it days before its release.Well.After popping the game in, I have to say that I'm impressed. One of the things I loved right off the bat, was that ALL the games included in this collection can be played with just the Wii Remote. You don't need a GameCube controller or a Classic Controller (although you can use those controllers if you own them) -- all you need is a Wii Remote :)The games included are:Kirby's AdventureKirby's DreamlandKirby's Dreamland 2Kirby's Dreamland 3Kirby Super StarKirby 64: The Crystal ShardsPerhaps it's just because I never got to enjoy anything on the aforementioned list except Kirby's Dreamland and Kirby Super Star, or perhaps it's just because these game still hold up today, but regardless I've found the collection to be much harder to put down than Mario All Stars (which I only played a couple times).The games feature a save state-like system. When you return to your Wii menu directly from the game, you can pick up exactly where you left off the next time you play. The only downside I could see, was that in order to return to the main menu in Kirby's Dream Collection you have to reset the software (there's no menu option to quit the games).Regardless.Not only does this collection include 6 awesome Kirby games (more if you consider that Kirby Super Star is like 8 games in 1), but it also includes challenge stages in which you have to master the use of certain copy abilities in order to complete them. The challenge stages are a completely new addition -- along with the museum section of the game (see the history of Kirby along a timeline that includes real life events such as presidential elections and the Olympic games, and view virtual box art and trailers for every Kirby game to date).Despite the fact that the collection is rather small, it's an awesome chance for anyone who didn't get to enjoy these games during their heydays (and for a fraction of the price, too).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2012"}

Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player. In spite of these flaws, the game remains  addictive and fun. It bears repeating that gamers looking for anotherGTA  IIIwill not find it here: this game provides an arcadelike experience  that's excellent, but in a very different way. Parents should note that this  game carries a Mature rating for its blood, violence, and gore.--Raymond M.

{"product_name":"B00319DX4W","description":"Enslavedis a post-apocalyptic retelling of the classic 400-year old novel &lsquo;Journey to the West&rsquo;. Set 150 years from now, the world has been ruined by war and ecological disaster with only a handful of survivors remaining.End Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"Great in some ways, a letdown in others","reviewText":"First off, I REALLY wanted to love Enslaved: Odyssey to the West.  I saw the trailer and the advertisements for it, and it really intrigued me.  Playing it, however, is where one encounters the problems.Graphics are beautiful and the environments are gorgeous, flushed full of color and life.  That said, they're not as polished as, say, God of War 3's or as smooth as Lost Planet 2's (one of my favorite games of last year...don't hate).  I felt the first few chapters were too similar in their environments, and when we started getting somewhere else (ie, the hilariously acrobatic Pigsy and his chapters) it really picked up.The voice acting in Enslaved is topnotch.  The two main characters offer up a great, largely subtle approach that is often missing in action/adventure games (ie, Kratos' over-the-top voice is just hokey in some parts...).  The fact the actors also did their own motion capture says a lot as well, a la Uncharted 1 & 2 (although, albeit, not as entertaining -or sarcastic- as the latter two titles).Gameplay is where I found the game failed.  It was a mess to move sometimes and it wasn't nearly as fluid as I expected it to be.  In a way, if I could describe it, it felt \"mechanical\" and \"robotic\" at times, not smooth; even taking out mechs felt clunky.  I also found little issues took much of the fun out of Enslaved, such as sometimes not sure where to go next (I'm the kind of gamer who wants to get to the next thing, not sit around twiddling my fingers trying to figure out where I'm supposed to head next) and the game mechanics itself can be problematic.  In all honesty, I don't think I've ever screamed this much at my TV before during a game because I kept dying over stupid things that were not a result of my own actions during gameplay.  By the end, I was actually relieved more than anything else, not satisfied as I had been with, say, God of War 3 or Lost Planet 2.  The last boss battle also was EXTREMELY long (in my opinion), at least to stick with taking down only one boss (literally), and when you died (as most surely would since mechs almost assuredly kill you before you can get somewhere new) near the final part you had to start over with taking out the entire creature as it rode on the back end of Pigsy's machine.  Frustrating?  Oh yeah!  In short, gameplay just felt like it wasn't smoothed out enough before release, at least for me.Overall, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a great title.  It has some of the most intriguing voice acting in a game and a story that is more about connecting than killing.  Despite its obvious flaws (most notoriously the game mechanics), it's still a pretty great action/adventure title.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2011"}

NOW you don't have to worry about the high chance of it breaking, and having to wait three weeks to get it back, and another month for it to break again.But is it really worth it?Honestly............no.I'll talk about the good things first.  Gears of War.  I LOVE that game.  It's one of the best games I have ever played on the 360.  Another thing I like is how easy it is to connect with friends over Xbox LIVE.  Even though I don't really care about online gaming as much as I used to, but if you're one of those people that only bought a 360 to play every Call of Duty game with your high school friends, well have fun.  It's also FINALLY reliable, easy to use an iPod for it, can play custom songs on EVERY game, and this model has a nice-sized hard drive.OK, enough of that.  Now for the main reasons why I wouldn't buy one with my own pocket.1.  Xbox LIVE!  I have NEVER met so many immature, rude, stupid people in my entire life in one place.  In the four years I had a 360 before I went with a PS3, I ran across racism, females showing their parts on camera, people screaming inappropriate words at the top of their lungs, young children playing M-rated games when they shouldn't be, on top of complaining about people cheating because they're losing (they're NEVER losing because they lack any skill......), singing lyrics to horrible songs with their horrible voice in your ear......for those that like patience like me, it's not worth it at all.  And this was back in the day when Xbox LIVE cost $50 a year.  Now it's 10 dollars more, for the exact same thing, minus some new features.  Another thing wrong with Xbox LIVE (and not a lot of people know this) is the connectivity to it.  It's all P2P servers.  For example, let's say you have a 10MB connection.  That's very fast for those that have no knowledge when it comes to internet speeds (and very expensive), but you join a gaming lobby with a friend and he's only using 1MB (basically the minimum for online gaming), and you are lagging all over the place.  The reason you are lagging is your friend with the 1MB connection is the host, and since your connection is 10x faster than his, he can't keep up with your ping levels, and with him hosting on a slower connection, you will lag all over the place.  It's not your fault, or his.  It's Microsoft's fault for using P2P servers instead of dedicated servers.  It's amazing how they say \"xxxx game is using dedicated servers\", but still doesn't fix the issue.  Nice job, Microsoft.2.  What games are you going to play?  If you're like me, and don't want to play every Call of Duty game and Halo with little children that shouldn't be there, what else is there for you to play?  Virtually everything on the 360, you can get on your PC, and PS3.  HOWEVER, things you can get on those two consoles are NOT AVAILABLE for the 360.  In other words, the golden days of the Xbox 360 having more exclusive games are over.3.  Even though some call it an opinion, almost everyone agrees.  The D-Pad on that controller is HORRIBLE!  GOD AWFUL!  SERIOUSLY!  I hear they fixed that problem (seems it takes them five years to fix everything), but as far as I'm concerned, I hate that D-Pad.But if none of the above bothers you, then have fun with your Xbox 360.  But if you're like me, buy a PS3, and stay far away from this......unless you like Gears of War 3, but I'm not spending $400 for a Kinect thing I don't care for at all, and just to play one game.**EDIT** I hope you're enjoying only having three new games come out this year, exclusive to the 360....Halo Anniversary, Forza 4, and Gears 3.

The environments, backgrounds, and characters look beyond awesome.But what about the gameplay? It rocks!The fighting and special moves is surprisingly very deep with numerous of throws, combos, blocks, and counters. I have barely even scratched the surface in terms of learning moves...Though i do have a few gripes with this game.1) Money is tough to get. There are tons of custom items and colors for every character and they costs tons of money. After beating story mode with each character the only way to earn quick money is through arcade mode. Arcade mode gives you about $1000 per win but when items cost as much as $500000 it can take a bit of fighting to get that high...2) The mini-game Devil Within is pretty lame. Sure the boss fights were pretty cool but the game is way too long for what it is. You fight the same enemy over and over and fight through identical rooms over and over. It gets boring real quick...Still, in the end this game has tremendous replay value with its 30 characters and will keep you kicking and punching away for a long time... well at least until Soul Calibur 3 is released.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000FRU0NU","reviewerName":"eternal now \"roejoerrer\"","summary":"The Chief is back....","reviewText":"Let's get this out of the way right now....Halo 3 does not revolutionize nor change the face of FPS gaming. There I said it.With that out of the way, Bungie's Halo 3 is an amazingly fun experience that brings the Halo trilogy to a close. Like other \"Space Operas\" of its ilk, the Halo storyline is a very confusing one, especially if you have never been exposed to the previous Halo games, the books or the graphic novels. However this in no way affects the fun factor of Halo 3.Let's start with the graphical department. It is my personal opinion that each Halo offering has had quite amazing graphics. The original Halo: Combat Evolved, stunned gamers on the Xbox. It had some of the best graphics on the Xbox at the time and rivaled every game in terms of graphical beauty on the console market. Halo 2 had upgraded graphics from its predecessor that were equally impressive and garnered a top spot as one of the Xbox's best games graphically.Halo 3 has some amazing graphics, but it is in no way THE best Xbox 360 game in graphical terms. That title still remains with Gears of War.However one cannot ignore the beauty of Halo 3. Water effects are simply stunning; water both reflects and refracts light and objects in real time and reacts when a character or vehicle moves through it. Water crashes up against and flows around rocks and other objects.The flora and fauna of certain levels is simply astounding: the first level has you fighting through a jungle and it looks simply gorgeous. Plants react to gunfire, if you walk over a plant it moves like a plant would if being walked over or brushed. Butterflies and bugs can be visibly seen going about their daily lives.The lighting system is probably one of the best on the 360; light reflects off of vehicles, weapons and other metallic surfaces in just the right way, yet it does not give you that \"over gloss\" shiny effect that so many new games are offering these days (think Perfect Dark Zero). Objects and character models cast shadows in real time, and they look pretty realistic.The alien enemies look absolutely awesome. Their armor is incredibly detailed and light reflects off it and their skin models look really good and believable. Similarly The Flood, which is another enemy in the game, look horrid and exactly what you would expect a parasite to look like.The level designs are equally as impressive. Alien technology has never looked so stunning. Desert levels resemble barren wastelands and the jungle areas, as previously stated, are amazing. The levels also never really get repetitive; a problem of all the previous Halo games.The vehicles, of which there are plenty of in the game, look equally amazing.The cutscenes look simply astounding and are most definitely next generation stuff.The one flaw, and it is a pretty big one, is that the human characters look lifeless and grotesque, and its painfully obvious that Bungie spent much more time on all of the other aspects of the game and neglected the human models. Their faces look rigid and linear, their eyes look downright weird, and their body's look awkward.As far as gameplay goes you can expect a very easy to control FPS. Halo benchmarked the FPS controls for console gaming way back with the original Halo. Bungie made FPS gaming fun. Firefights, depending on which level of difficulty you decide to play on, are downright intense; if you are playing on the Heroic or Legendary difficulty there is a literal downpour of enemies as each wave of them is replenished by enemy drop ships.One of the greatest aspects of the Halo games are the assortment of hidden goodies that Bungie has cleverly placed throughout the game, and Halo 3 has its share of them. The infamous \"skulls\" (there are golden ones and silver ones) that were located in hard to reach places in Halo 2 make their return, and they are found in equally hard to reach and sometimes impossible places (meaning that if you were not looking for them there is probably no way that you would be able to find a good majority of them). These skulls, when activated will alter the game play in some way. For example there is a skull that, when turned on, will award the player with a chorus of children screaming \"yay!\" and confetti if he/she scores a successful head shot. Another skull upgrades all enemies to their highest ranking (military wise), making them tougher. There is also a skull that doubles the amount of health the enemies have, a skull that takes away your HUD( Heads up display) and a skull that makes explosions much more grand.There is even a skull that changes the game in subtle but very enjoyable ways, and this skull is also the hardest skull to get in the game, forcing the player to think outside of the box to attain it.Also, Halo 3 introduces the Meta-game the Halo series, which really adds replay value to the campaign mode. The Meta-game is like an \"arcade mode\"  where you get points for each kill (more points for stylish kills), and when in conjunction with activated skulls a player can really rack up the points. The meta-game is a really cool addition in that it challenges the player to hone and improve their skills, which will help them with the online multiplayer portion of Halo 3.The multiplayer is basically the big attraction for most Halo fans, as the game play is intense, fast paced and features all of the weapons and vehicles of the campaign. There are many different multiplayer games to play as well. The game types range from classic Free For All and team deathmatch to more original team games like Capture the Flag and Oddball.Overall the multiplayer is fun but not the greatest online multiplayer available.For achievement hunters there is much to be found. A good chunk of the achievements are for mutliplayer (kill x amount of players with x weapon), or completing each mission and beating the game on  Normal, Heroic and Legendary. The other achievements are more original. There are achievements for finding the golden skulls and there are achievements for scoring insane amounts of points in the meta-game.I have only covered a small range in this review of what Halo 3 has to offer. There is a lot to do and I cannot see anyone getting bored with this game right away, this is of course unless you are just interested in beating the game, this can easily be accomplished on Easy or Normal with ease. However, if played on Heroic or Legendary a solo player will have quite the time beating the game, as some fights get so intense they will find themselves dying a lot. The skulls, Meta-game and online multiplayer are more than enough to keep Halo 3 in the 360 consoles across America for a long time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2007"}

{"product_name":"B0002MPT6Q","reviewerName":"Andariel Halo \"Disillusioned Smark\"","summary":"Not a perfect game, but can let you make it into one!","reviewText":"Read through all the other reviews to get more in-depth, but I will say that Rome - Total War totally reinvents the RTS genre!Nowhere will you find the typical \"peasant builds a town center, mines gold, cuts wood, build more peasants, build farms, build barracks, build soldiers, go kill all\", for this is a realistic game with two completely different modes of play--strategy map, and battle mapThe campaign begins with the strategy map, which is a map of Europe and parts of Asia and Africa, and several cities under your control.  In these cities, you commission to have buildings built to improve such things as farm harvest, public health, entertainment, law, religion, and warfare, and train units to gather into an army.Once you have an army, you send them off to battle, where you either let the computer auto-resolve the conflict, or you go down to the battlefield to fight it outIt's on the battlefield that the true nature of the game shines its greatest.  Unlike in other games where you have individual soldiers fighting individually, and unlike trashy Hollywood Roman/Greek \"epics\" which have the soldiers behaving as thus (seeking out individual battles) your soldiers fight in formation, and you command the soldiers in units of a certain numbers.  You have to come up with tactics, strategy, and have your units fight in strict formation, or you risk the enemy outflanking or breaking through your lines, and your units routing if the fighting gets too tough (btw, rout means retreat)The complexities and intricacies of each individual unit on each side and their formations makes for infinite playtime if you're sick of one particular faction (you hate legionaries, if you defeat the Greeks, you can play with them and the phalanx!)The complexities of battle are much more historically accurate than most other games, and you pay for your units with money raised either by trade, taxation, or the spoils of war.Alas, it has its own share of problems.  Aside from minor graphical issues and some playability issues, Rome Total War isn't as historically accurate as it could be:- For one, the Egyptians aren't portrayed as the Ptolemaic Empire, but rather more akin to the Egypt you see in documentaries or movies like \"The Mummy\", with chariots and solid gold armor and such.- Some of the Hellenistic factions don't have the proper variety of units.- Advanced formations (such as the triplex acies or the Macedonian Phalanx) aren't available, you if you want to have the traditional Roman triplex acies, you'll have to set it up yourself- Politics aren't as complex (which cannot be faulted) but some things are completely inaccurate such as the Greek city-states being one faction, the Gauls and the Germans and all the other barbarians being only one faction rather than numerous (though in fairness, it would not only be easier to do this, but it would make for easier gameplay to someone trying to play as one of these factions, to start with a whole country like the other factions rather than a single city)- The Romans have been separated and factionalized into the highly fictional military groups distinguished by familiar family names (House of Julii, House of Brutii, House of Scipii, SPQR)- The music is exquisite, but much too tame for a war game- Morale is made way too low for all units, so armies can traditionally break and rout within minutes of an engagement, making for quick and easy victories.- The AI (before patch 1.5) is quite dim and lacking in proper knowledge of tactics or strategy---or as some people claim, totally retardedThese would all be enough to bring the game down at least one star, but the creators of the game are truly brilliant geniuses for this reason:They have made almost all of the game files easily accessible, and easy to modifyThus, with experts in the field of modding, you come out with absolutely brilliant modifications which totally expand and change the nature of the game, from the music to the units and everything listed above, making the game more historically accurate, to expanding the map to nearly DOUBLE its size.The best of the mods out there are definitely Rome - Total Realism, and Europa Barbarorum (in its beta stages), and there are some other minor mods out there such as SPQR, Invasio Barbarorum (for Barbarian Invasion exp pack), etc.With the mods, you can almost completely change the gameplay, for the better, and have a game that is not only sharply historically accurate, but which improved AI and fighting, meaning the battles will no longer be hunting down routers, but a lengthy, tough, gritty battle with your men fighting on to the death if surrounded, and the enemy never backing down in the face of sudden changes or spooksIf you're going to get RTW, I recommend playing it in its entirety just to familiarize yourself with it, then go out and get one of the above mods to TRULY expand the game, and make it absolutely perfect for you!PS, you don't have to be an expert modder to change some aspects of the game, such as the amount of armor or damage a certain unit has or can deal, the cost of the unit, the general nature of a foe, the amount of men in a single unit, etc","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2006"}

The little detailing here and there made you feel like you're a little bit in the game.  Like the 'touch' screen passcode keypads, the real time images you see in the monitors, and the pretty flashlight effect.But as I got to around Alpha labs lvl 3, it dawned on me how repetitious this game actually is.  And that cool flashlight effect became dizzyingly annoying.  Enemies pop out, but as you progress through the game, you can pretty much predict when they'll pop out.  And because the map is so god-awful dark, you really can't see most of the enemies that are attacking you, which means you'll take damage before you can even react!This game is a throwback to the ole of having to memorize some of the monster locations when you reload the game over and over again. And after about 2 hours, the wows of the graphics wears off, and you're left with the gameplay.It was pleasant to see all the doom monsters in glorious 3D graphics.  But the decision to put mood over gameplay left me dissatasified. And the creepy voices and groans and moans...it was spooky the first couple minutes I heard it.  Got annoying by the time I entered delta lab.After I finished the game (end boss was much easier then mid boss), I couldn't help but compare this to Doom 2 (never really played doom 1) and be severely disappointed.

You play as a marine sent on a mission to Mars. You have to investigate some strange happenings that have been occuring there. Soon after you arrive, however, all hell breaks loose. the scientists there accidentally open a portal to hell, and demons invade the facility. Only a few people survive the onslaught, and you're one of them. Now it's up to you to take care of the problem.Adding to the storyline are the various PDA's, emails, and videos you find laying around in the Mars base. All of these things are very well done, and they offer a nice distraction from the action. These things are like journals from different people, and they'll describe how things started to go awry on Mars, and other interesting things. Also, the voice-acting is great and realistic, and all of this gives you the feeling like you're actually on this facility. Also, these emails and video-logs sometimes give you very useful information, like the locations of different weapons and valuables.Like I mentioned earlier, the graphics in this game are some of the best you'll ever find, even if you don't have a great system. The environmental designs are really good, and most of the environments are dark, gloomy, silent metallic corridors that add to the scary atmosphere. The lighting effects are also superb. However, the thing I liked best about the graphics is the monsters' designs. All of the enemies you'll encounter look awesome, scary and realistic. Though almost all of the enemies are from the older Doom games, they look much, much better. These are monsters like zombies, imps, hell knights, revenants, lost souls, cacodemons, and more.Throughout the game, you get 8 different weapons. They are: the pistol, shotgun, machingun, chaingun, plasma rifle, rocket launcher, BFG, and the soul cube. They all act pretty much like their names suggest, so it's pretty self-explanatory, aside from the soul cube. In order to use the soul cube, you must first kill 5 enemies. Then you can use it, and it homes in on the strongest enemy near you, hits him, and his health is transformed to yours. The soul cube is also very important at the end of the game, but I don't want to spoil it for you.All of these aspects of the game are really good, but the thing that makes Doom 3 unique is the atmosphere. This is probably one of the scariest games you'll ever play. Why? Well, not only are the monsters scary, but the environments add to the mood. Like I mentioned, most of the time you'll be in narrow, dark, metallic corridors, so you'll have to make lots of turns, never knowing what's behind the next corner. Also, everything in the game is very dark, so you won't always be able to see your opponents. However, you will get a flashlight, so you'll be able to see through some of the dark, but you'll never be able to hold a gun and the flashlight together at the same time. Fortunately, if you hit the F key on you're keyboard, you'll be able to quickly switch between your last equipped weapon and the flashlight. I found this as a good aspect, because not always being able to see in the dark when there are zombies around is scary, and it added to the atmosphere. It's really scary sometimes then you turn around and there's a zombie in your face, or when you pass through a door and an imp lunges at you. The game is filled with these kind of incidents, and there are also some other really scary moments.Overall, Doom 3 is an awesome game. The thing that sets it aside from other FPS's is it's atmosphere. However, I strongly suggest that people who get scared easily stay away from this game, because they might get really freaked out. No joke. But other than that, it's a really good game with awesome graphics, and if you're a Doom fan, then what are you waiting for? Go pick this one up.P.S. If you really want to know, here is one of the game's many scares. It might ruin the surprise for you, so watch out.MINOR SPOILERThere is one part where you go into a bathroom. If you turn left and look in the mirror, everything suddenly goes red, and you hear a horrible scratching noise. This all happens very suddenly, and also, a monster suddenly jumps at you from behind and attacks you. Expect things like this to happen in the game.END SPOILER","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2006"}

To me both systems have great graphic depending on the game you play. And if you're not a big time gaming freak and are shopping for the 1st time for a gaming system I thought I'd list some facts about Xbox and PS2 that might help in your decision.1. PS2 is thin you can fit it in your briefcase or beach bag when heading on vacation.1.Xbox is rather large and heavy might not fit on some TV stands thin shelves2.PS2 requires a memory card --sold separately--to save your games; big deal they cost $14 and I've had one for 3 years now and it's still not full because you can delete game off it to make run for new one.2.Xbox has a built in memory -Nothing to purchase--to save your games; but it can only hold so much. Where you can buy as many memory cards for PS2 you want.3.PS2 can play DVD, which is great when you're on vacation at a hotel the kid's get the game and you can watch movies at night3.Xbox can not, although I think someone said you can buy an adapter for it but why do that if you already own a DVD player??4.PS2 you can play online as long as you have a broadband connection for FREE4.Xbox you can play online too with a broadband connection but you also you have to pay a monthly fee to play onlineAnd most of all I am very disappointed in the games Xbox offers. I know all the guys who own Xbox are freaking saying \"what are you talking about, you need to play Republic commando and Halo\"  Xbox only games. I have and all those killing games have wonderful graphics but I guess being a women I really do not care for those games.I like games where I have to search for something, not just walk forward and kill anything in front of me. Although Battlefront is really fun which is available on PS2 and Xbox. But my favorite games are Sypro where you have to look for hidden treasure, and figure out mazes. Also I enjoy Kingdom Heart where you get to be Disney world characters (I know sounds girly) but you have to fight villains and it's very challenging you have to use your mind to figure out hidden section.  But those games are ONLY available on Play station 2 you can not play them on Xbox. I have not been able to find any games that are exclusively for Xbox that I like, it seem the majority of Xbox only games are either sports or require you to kill someone great for guys.If you're shopping for the 1st time for a gaming system I strongly suggest looking at the games 1st!!!  If you find a few games that you really like that are only avaliable on Xbox then that is the system you should get, or maybe do like me and just get both PS2 and xbox. But if you can only get one; and if you can guess by my review, I think PS2 is much better.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2006"}

That being said, if you do not like talking and interacting with NPCs, do not buy this game.My main issues with this game are how basic the combat and upgrade systems are in comparison to how elaborate the story/dialouge elements are.Generally speaking, combat is just a basic 3rd person shooter with the ability to call in assists from your 2 AI controlled party members. More complex ways to control your teamates would have been nice. It's fun enough, but nothing special. There are a few levels that have interesting twists to them and those were the levels I liked most.The character upgrades available to you also have a certain vauge feel to them, as it is hard to weigh the real benifit of every upgrade. The reason for this is total lack of stats and numbers in the role playing system.  I think they were trying to make the game accessible to non-rpg players, but in my opinion is really damages the final product.  For example: Upgrade A increases machine guns 10%, upgrade B increases tech damage 5%, upgrade C increases health 5%. So what are those percentages based on?  Just a very loose understanding of your current condition I guess. In the end it just becomes a gut instinct when choosing upgrades as opposed to strategically doing it. I would have liked to see a more thoughtful approach here.Another aspect to upgrading is aquiring mineral resources. This is done through a mining mechanic that becomes tiresome. you basicaly run a cursor around a planet model and choose where to mine based on a meter reading. After you do it for awhile it gets really boring, and you need to do a lot of it.At any rate the game is somthing to behold. I found that once I reduced my focus on the combat/upgrades and began treating it like a casual dialouge adventure I enjoyed it more. RPG hounds might be dissapointed with the character progression/customization depth. Action hounds might be dissapointed with run of the mill combat.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001CWXAP2","description":"","reviewerName":"RJ","summary":"Maybe in a year or two...","reviewText":"Like many people playing this game I have played WOW for many years.  I guess there were two things that finally drove me to quit the game and so far not look back.  One was the upcoming expansion (Pandas?  Whats next - Teletubbies??; combined with that new talent tree that rehashes abilities you had in the last two expansions as top level abilities for the new expansion) and the brutal redundancy of the game.  You do the same fundamental moves, through the same fundamental groups of mobs/bosses/raids/etc. over the span of years and expansions, to make higher and higher numbers and do it all over again.  I have quit several other times, but I finally got to the point where I would log on, and just feel like doing anything else.  I miss the social aspect of the game, my guild was a bunch of pretty cool guys, but the game itself just seemed so... tired.As anyone who has played MMOs for more than a week knows, the concept of play is based around redundancy.  You have to get players to do the same set of things over and over and over and be willing to pay a monthly fee to do so.  That in of itself is great - but you have to get that magical combination of novelty that doesnt wear out over time.  That was the problem with Rift, the trees were cool, the first few zones were cool, but after a month it was just the same rehash, fundamentally nothing new and couldn't see paying a fee for what boiled down to be another wow clone.And that brings me to this game.  You may want to ask - well what the heck were you expecting?  I guess I was expecting what I think of as Star Wars.  Space, with cool ships and mass combat in asteroid belts and blasting the hell outa star destroyers.  Being able to climb in my ship and fly off to wherever I wanted to hunt sith or rebels or whatever.  You may also say for those of you that have played the game that this is in essence provided.  Yes, in a very low key way.  The space portion is like something you would expect from a console game back in 2002 - you get in your ship and pew pew your way down a corridor to hit assorted targets.  It was fun in a way for a bit, but I sure wouldn't pay 15 bucks a month for something you can get for 10 bucks on the back library for your XBox 360 on download.  You also use your ship something akin to Mass Effect where you can access your followers and travel from planet to planet.  How about the rest of the game?  Same fundamentals as wow - same set of moves, over and over, through what seems a depressingly lifeless set of worlds.  I don't think I would even mind that so much if the space side had been implemented from a 5% of the game (mini game) to a 50% of the game full space combat/exploration extravaganza.  I guess was hoping that would be the case (heck they spent, what? 150 mil putting this together?), but its not that way yet.  Well, what about the story!  Its AWESOME!  Eh, maybe.  The story is fine, I rather enjoyed it on several of my toons.  But the problem is its fine for one playthrough and then - its the same few moves over and over and over to get more gear to do the same thing.  This isn't KOTOR 3 - I don't want to pay 15 bucks a month for something that in essence lasts a few days until I have leveled through it then never care to see it again.  In a way I wish they would have spent all that time and effort with cut scenes implementing some originality in the actual gameplay.If you don't mind the fundamentals of any other main MMO and want to use your blaster, light saber or whatever else over and over, and a few more times - hey great, five star game for you.  If your like me and was hoping for something new and exciting in fundamentals combined with a great space MMO, then you probably won't like this much.  I was expecting much more, and alas as it is I just can't see paying 15 bucks a month for something that is in essence wow with blasters.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

{"product_name":"B007UM59L6","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"An excellent action game that functions better as a standalone product as opposed to a successful reboot","reviewText":"Let me start off by saying that I'm a long time Devil May Cry fan. The original game on the PS2 changed the way I look at action games and really became the standard to which I've compared every subsequent action game I've ever played. With that in mind, I completely understand why many long time fans were disappointed with this game.It's a wild departure from the tone of the first four games. The combat feels different, the protagonist Dante feels different, and the game is generally presented in a way that greatly deviates from the way Devil May Cry has been traditionally presented in previous installments. To me, as a long time fan, it didn't feel much like a Devil May Cry game, and I feel that this should be pointed out right away.With that said, DmC: Devil May Cry is an AWESOME game.Developer Ninja Theory's previous titles, Heavenly Sword and Enslaved: An Odyssey to the West, were games that I really enjoyed from a narrative and game design standpoint, but could never really get past the clunky combat that I felt those games were bogged down by. In DmC, this has been eradicated, as developers from Capcom assisted Ninja Theory in designing the excellent combat system. Therefore, what we have here is one of the most visually creative, best-presented action games to come around in a long time. While the story is nothing special, it is presented incredibly well with some excellent cut scenes, animation, and vocal delivery. The level design in DmC is absolutely stellar, and easily the high point of the game. More so than most games I played this past generation, DmC found ways to completely surprise and thrill me throughout the entire experience, delivering astounding levels of creativity in single levels that many games can't achieve in an entire campaign. Ninja Theory has hit a high mark here, and I hope they are given the opportunity to make another game in this franchise.What would a Devil May Cry game be without a great combat system? It would be nothing, and thankfully, DmC: Devil May Cry has a great combat system that, while not feeling much like Devil May Cry games of the past, is still incredibly satisfying, deep, and effective. Dante now has a deeper arsenal that consists of an Angel and a Demon weapons (each mapped to the left and right triggers, respectively) in addition to his standard sword and guns, all with their own move sets. Ridiculous combos can be strung together for large amounts of style points, and new moves can be unlocked via the game's upgrade system. And most importantly, it's extremely fun to play. It is a stylish, loud, in-your-face type of game that blends perfectly with the creative spark that the developers clearly had while making this game.Quite honestly, if you're looking for the successor to Devil May Cry, I highly recommend Bayonetta, which was developed by Platinum Games and directed by Hideki Kamiya, the original creator of Devil May Cry. That game feels much more like the Devil May Cry games of old, with all the modern flair you'd expect. More open-minded Devil May Cry fans, however, should really enjoy this incarnation of the series for what it is, as should most gamers out there who enjoy this genre. It really is a fantastic game that plays well, looks great, and is bursting with creativity. Along with Splinter Cell: Blacklist, this is one of the more overlooked AAA games of 2013, and comes highly recommended by yours truly.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0086V5V8G","description":"","reviewerName":"Elton Lee","summary":"Wow! What A Game.","reviewText":"Honestly I have tried getting into splinter cell series back in the days when the 1st game came out on Xbox but the game didn't really interests me. I find it very slow paced, a lot of talking and more or less stealth to the max. I stopped playing it after only playing the first few missions. I have never touched a splinter cell game anymore till now!Fast forward to 2013 you have got a reboot of the splinter cell franchise which gives players multiple styles of executing the missions. I really enjoyed playing blacklist. This is my first splinter cell that I finished from beginning to end. I have completed 2 walkthroughs on normal mode. I was never a really stealth gamer but a combination of stealth and action is interesting to me. The game kept me glued to the screen. The story was great and the game play is just awesome. Of course playing stealthily is a must to accomplish certain missions however now the game offers 3 different playing styles to gamers.Ghost - Stealth, Panther - Silent kill, Assault - Head On Attack. I find a combination of these 3 play styles is really interesting. Blacklist is actually an action game, the pacing of the game is great, the characters and the story is a great addition to the overall experience of the game.The 16 side missions which comprises from 4 different characters of the game gives Sam the ability to test his skills in different locations. Requiring Sam to gather intel, assassinate high value targets and completing the missions accordingly gives Sam the dollar value to upgrade his weaponry, gadgets, suits and the plane.I have not dived into multiplayer so I cant comment on this aspect of the game but Im sure it is a blast as I have read reviews from other gamers. So if you are a true SC gamer from the beginning you can still play this game with satisfaction. How gamers execute the missions is entire up to them. You can play ghost style through out the game.But still in different sections or missions of the game you still need to play panther and assault style because it was designed that way due to its story. I don't think 100% stealth is required for blacklist but a combination of all 3 styles is more suitable.I do recommend Blacklist. Those who have not play this, get it and start playing. You will enjoy it and have a blast!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2013"}

When Amazon offered this for $40, I purchased it right away.  I was not dissapointed at all and I agree with most of the reviews.  The graphics are stunning and the game play is easy to follow.  I haven't finished playing the game, but I'm sure I will enjoy it all the way to the end.While I give this a five star, there are a few things that are annoying.  One of the controls that I don't understand is you cannot duck or kneel down unless you are close to an object, such as a tree, that you can duck behind.  Another control that baffles me.  You can sneak behind a baddie and press action button to disable his.  However, if you have an item, such as a box, in between you cannot hit the action button to grab the baddie.  When you do that, you actually cause the character to punch, which raised alert from all the bad guys.  Finally, I think the AIs are not that smart.  You can sneak out in the open and disable a bad guy.  The AIs must have a narrow vision.Playing this game reminds me of Tomb Raider, one of my favorite games.

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"The Duck of Indeed","summary":"An Awesome Console","reviewText":"The Nintendo Wii is a very fun console, plus it's cheaper than the PS3 and 360.  The games are also cheaper.  The graphics aren't as good as the other consoles, but they're still pretty good.  What makes the Wii so fun, besides the large number of fun games you can play, is the motion.  Some games don't make very good use of the motion, but some games are just so much different than games in the past.  The \"Super Mario Galaxy\" games are great to play to see what you can do with motion.  \"Okami\" is another great game where you use the Wii remote to draw, and \"Metroid Prime 3\" makes you feel like you're really in the game the way both the remote and nunchuk is used.  Not only are there a lot of fun Wii games, but the Wii can play GameCube games and also can download Nintendo, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, and I think Sega games, as well.  It can't get all of the games, I think, but it probably can get the main ones, at least.  The Wii can also get Netflix, which is convenient.The controllers are wireless, of course, and have sound, too, which I think isn't necessary and probably makes the batteries go out faster.  The batteries last about a month for me, but it could be more or less depending on how much you play.  Some games are played with just the remote and some are played with the remote and the nunchuk, which I think is fun because it makes the games even more different from each other.  You alo can save your Wii games to the Wii, so you don't need a memory card.  (You do still need a GameCube memory card to play GameCube games and an SD card for the downloaded games and for extra storage, though so far, the Wii has had enough storage for all my games.)Now you may have heard about all the people that have thrown the remote into the TV screen and wonder how likely this is to happen to you.  This isn't really that likely if you wear the wrist strap and don't go insane with the remote.  I've never gotten close to this happening (I rarely ever swing in the TV's direction anyway, unless you're playing tennis or something), so if you're concerned about losing your grip on the remote and cracking your TV screen, don't worry.  Just be careful.Anyway, to summarize, the Wii is a very fun console.  There are just so many fun games you can get, even for the older consoles, and the motion makes it even better.  The graphics aren't as good as the competition, but at least the Wii console and games cost less.  There's a reason why the Wii used to be so hard to get.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2011"}

According to many GPU bench marking websites, Metro 2033 is one of the most difficult games to run on full spec. I was happy to see I could easily run it fully maxed out with no less than 60fps. As for the game itself, I enjoyed it more than i thought I would. It was very unique to any of the other first person shooters that I have played and trust me, I have played a lot. I would like to keep this review as spoiler free as possible however, I did like how the makers of the game made it seem more realistic in the fact that money was no longer the currency, the weapons were appropriate given the situation of the game, you have to scavenge around, and the way you have to pump charge your battery from time to time to run your electronic equipment. In a world of nuclear fallout, these little details and more iv'e not mentioned, make the game more believable. Its a game with many cut scenes, and fairly short levels but that shouldn't be a problem for those who enjoy the story side of video games. It also keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's similar to doom 3 in the fact that its creepy. Slipping through dark tunnels and seeing a shadow or hearing an abrupt deep growl or scream behind you is unnerving especially if you have a loud sound system like I do... it will freak you out. The creatures you come across are also unique to other games which was a big plus for me.

{"product_name":"MOGA Mobile Gaming System for Android 2.3+","description":"","reviewerName":"M.D. Edwards \"Avid Aesthete\"","summary":"Well-made, but still too many limitations to compete, for me, with the apps and games I have installed on my Galaxy SIII.","reviewText":"Setting up the MOGA Mobile Gaming System for Android 2.3+ was really very easy to do, and it came with a nicely-made pouch that protects it well for when I drop it into the black hole that I call my purse. Users ARE required to download the MOGA Pivot app in order to fully sync the MOGA system to your Android phone. The instruction sheet is easy enough to follow, and getting it set up is quick and simple. The one thing that I found bothered me, though, with my OCD tendencies (Lol!), was how annoyingly tricky it can be to get the notification off my phone regarding the MOGA Pivot app, and whether it's on or not. Honestly, your average person might not be so annoyed by that, but, well, like I said, OCD tendencies (or CDO, as the letters have to be as orderly as everything else... ; )  ). Really, I don't NEED an app hounding me about turning it on when it's off. I KNOW it's off! Stop bugging me, already! : POutside of the annoyance factor of the app, there just aren't enough free games that come with the system to make it worthwhile for someone like me - a frequent user of Amazon's Free App Of The Day, and one that has over 160 apps that I've either got installed on my system, or in the appropriate Cloud - none of which, as I've seen so far, are compatible with MOGA's gaming system.I did download and play MOGA's free racing game, but I really can't say I enjoyed it. The game was VERY buggy, and had a ridiculous learning curve. The controls on it were just all over the place, enough that I ended up more annoyed after playing the daggone game than I typically have been with just about ANY other game I've played on my phone with just my fingers touching the screen.Really, the limitations that MOGA has placed on this gaming system make what is a GREAT piece of equipment mediocre and near-unusable. My phone, even in its chunkyArmor Kickstand Hybrid Case Hard Gel Cover with Stand for Samsung Galaxy S3 I9300, I747 - Black and Pink(but great!) protective case, fits very well and snugly in the MOGA gaming system, and, even as diminutive as the controls and overall controller itself are, it's very smartly designed, and a very nifty little gadget, but MOGA needs to remove that yoke that's preventing this system from being usable with other apps out there. Once MOGA takes care of that, I'll be fully onboard with this gaming system.Well-made, but the software limitations totally drag this system down. Disappointing, because this is a great little controller, with a great protective pouch to carry it around in, but if the software doesn't allow it to play well with others, well... Not much more to be done with it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2012"}

Choose from a wealth of officially licensed cars and real-world locations, then go careening through gravel, dirt and mud, doing whatever it takes to bring the trophy home.","reviewerName":"bixodoido","summary":"Great racing game--accessible to a wide audience","reviewText":"Dirt is a great racing game that features enough customization to cater to a wide range of fans.  There are 5 difficulty levels on Dirt, each with varying amounts of realism, damage, and AI skill.  Arcade racing fans can set the level on Rookie or Clubman (I believe that's what the 2nd lowest difficulty level is called), while more serious racers can ratchet up the difficulty for a more realistic experience.  Dirt features several types of racing in a few different modes and a total of 46 available vehicles you can collect (along with several paintjobs for each), and for the most part is a pretty good game, though it does have some shortcomings.  The good and the bad:THE GOOD:- Career Mode is great.  There are 11 tiers of competition which expose you to all the various racing types in the game, and you can earn money from career mode to buy more vehicles.- The races are fun and the control is great.  Difficulty can be adjusted to suit your needs and the car can be tweaked if you so desire (but doesn't have to be if you don't want to mess with it).- Several tracks offer quite a bit of variety, and the ability to race different classes of vehicles on most of them provides replay value.- Great graphics, great sound effects when you drive or crash- Upon completing a race your time is uploaded and you're given a worldwide rank based on everyone who has ever run the race.  Nice touch.THE BAD:- Championship Mode is, ultimately, pointless.  Sure, it's a great idea to have Championships of 15 or 30 races (or more if you choose the long option), but when you win a Championship you get no money, no trophy--not even a cutscene of any kind.  Couldn't there be SOME kind of award, even if it was a new skin for the vehicle you won the championship in?- Multiplayer lacks, both on and offline.  First, there's no split screen multiplayer, which is annoying.  But even online play is limited to only 2 kinds of events where you don't actually see your opponents but are only aware of their time relative to yours.  This would be okay (and doesn't bother me that much), but communication between opponents is limited as well.- The frame rate can suffer sometimes, though this doesn't happen often.Dirt is a great game overall, but a few shortcomings keep it from being a spectacular game.  Why not offer money or some kind of prizes in Championship Mode?  And why not allow the XBox mileage achievements to be earned in other modes of play (you can only get the mileage in career), which might encourage more people to play online rather than playing the career over and over again?  Still, if you're a fan of racing at all I highly recommend Dirt since it's few flaws are not enough to keep this game from being a lot of fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2007"}

New special moves and attacks, including the groundbreaking Final Smash. New items and assist trophies.","reviewerName":"Clark Beyer","summary":"Not as good as the first two.","reviewText":"To preface this review: I love the first two smash games.  Also, a 2nd party developer known as HAL Laboratory developed them.  HAL did not, however, develop Brawl; Sora Ltd did.  And I think that's why this game is not as good as the first two.The same thing happens when you hand off Zelda to a Russian company to make games on the CDi, or when you allow another company to make \"Mario is Missing.\"  It gets ugly.  Well that's what happened with Brawl.  Sakurai, the lead developer of HAL, left the company to start his own--Sora Ltd, and they made the game.  Here are the eleven ways that Sora kind of ruined the experience:1. Tripping.  Sometimes, when you try to do a dash, your character will fall flat on his face.  This is--for a lack of better wording--stupid.2. Stickers in versus mode.  Who wants those to appear when you're trying to have an intense battle?3. Trophies from the Zelda series.  Wow...none of them are from the older games, they're all mostly from Wind Waker and Twilight Princess.  Melee had trophies from games old and new.4.  Subspace Emissary is extremely boring, and even though I beat it once, I cannot bring myself to ever play it again.5.  Ledge-grabbing.  Now, you don't even have to be facing a ledge to grab it, nor do you have to be within 6 feet of it.6.  Clones.  Sakurai stated firmly that he wanted no more clones in Brawl because he didn't like them in Melee...well, you got rid of Dr. Mario, but added Wolf, who is a clone of Fox and Falco.  You replace Young Link with Toon Link, who both have the exact same movesets.  You did de-clone Mario and Luigi, however...you made Luigi fall on his noggin after doing Up-B and you replaced Mario's Tornado with FLUDD, which is a useless move.  Uh...good job?7.  Only one file.  In Melee, you could have different save files by having another memory card.  Brawl doesn't do that--it only allows different subspace emissary files, but nothing more.  The SD Card can't even hold another Brawl file.  Essentially, you'd need to buy another Wii to have a separate file, and that would be a big waste.8.  Unlocking characters is far too easy in this game.  You can just play subspace emissary on easy mode and find them as part of the story.  There's no challenge to it whatsoever.9.  Target Test.  There are no longer any unique target test courses for each character--they're all the same for everybody.10.  Unlocking stages.  Like the characters, this has become far too easy.11.  Physics.  All the characters are very \"floaty\" and they run kind of slow.  It's not fast-paced.So it gets only 3 stars despite having all these shortcomings.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2008"}

Enemy intelligence is really good, teamwork is good (which I really like), I like that you can cover behind almost anything (that's cool too)Just seems like all Tom Clancy games I play or own, could always be better. There's always some attention to detail left out, graphics are not always what they could be, game play...etc etc etcMy gripes with the game are small, but still annoy me.Here we go:1) I don't like the fact that there is no health meter, you really have no clue as to your health status. You're hit 2-3 times, and BAM, you're dead. Now, I DO understand that's a bit more realistic, but, it's still nice to know how your health status is.2) No save points...If you die in action, sometimes you have to start pretty far back, depending on where you were killed in each level.3) The graphics COULD have been much better (as with ALL Tom Clancy games)...Now, I am a HUGE SOCOM fan....And I can say with 100% certainty that ALL SOCOM series games have graphics that are at least 10 TIMES BETTER than this game, and they are PS2 game system games! I would have assumed that this game, being on the PS3 format, would be much better....I was wrong.4) This really annoys me: No health packs! What gets me is that you can save your teammates in this game but you can't save yourself??????? That's bogus! This makes absolutely NO SENSE to me!Other than that, it's a fun game, fun to play, but, if the designers had taken a bit more time to just think things through, this game could have been a true 5-STAR game!Am I glad I bought the game?Yeah, I like it enough....It's worth the purchase, but, it could have been a bit better.Am I very picky about my games?YES! Because when I spend $50-$60 bucks per game, I would like them to be of the same caliber (OR BETTER) then a SOCOM game, or even \"Splinter Cell\" games (they're great, too). Overall I think the SOCOM games are the epitome of any military game on any game system. Period!WHY?Because SOCOM games pay attention to every detail. Graphics, status meters, overall game play, weapons, looks/feel/realism, you can hide in bushes, adjust a rifle scope, crawl in tall grass, use stealth as an ally (Now THAT'S REALISM!)...It's things like that, that really get my attention. And, should get YOUR ATTENTION (The consumer) as well!Chris","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00005TNI6","description":"Final Fantasy Xis the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"One of the finer Fantasies.","reviewText":"Yes, this game was amazing and had gorgeous graphics and even a good storyline to boot (no FFVII though.).  The game sheds a lot to be desired such as plenty of side quests, secrets and mini games.  The music is loveable, the characters memorable.  The problem where this game falls short is replay value and gameplay.The game's graphics are truly amazing and are by far some of the best we've seen on the PS2.  The textures and mapping is great, and this is the first Final Fantasy game to be in a completely 3 dimensinal world and I mean entirely!The characters in the game are memorable with great developement and personality.  You have characters with mystery and characters with intrigue. A small love story in there. I feel however that Square didn't focus enough on the love story as much as they did in Final Fantasy VIII.  Not a bad thing, though when the kiss came it was just a couple of hours before the end of the game.The games involement is much better than in ANY other previous FF game.  Raising characters is entirely different from the series.  Now you must make your characters obtain &quot;Sphere Levels&quot;.  This was probably the best idea since the Job System introduced in FFIII or the Materia system in FFVII.  Either way, instead of gaining EXP. like your traditional RPG, you gain ability points to help your sphere level go up. Once it does it starts over and keeps building up. Once you gain a sphere level you have to move on the &quot;Sphere Grid&quot; and actually use that sphere to learn an ability, increase your stats etc.  Not a bad idea though this does bring the difficulty down by a whole lot and makes it successful to beat the game in 25 hours (and there are some who don't even increase their stats they just learn the abilities.)The battle system is different from previous FF games. Since Final Fantasy IV we've all grown used to the ATB battle system. Now you have the CTB system.  This means, Control Turn Based.  Basically its a turn based battle system with a twist.  You can switch characters in and out of battle. You also have a CTB guage that appears in the upper right hand corner of the screen. This'll show you when enemies attack and when your characters attack.  Should you select a spell like &quot;Slow&quot; or &quot;Haste&quot; you'll see what the adjustments do on the CTB guage.  The problem with this is the same as the sphere grid, the game is too easy with this. The ability to switch characters in battle is also a good idea but again, too easy.The game's downfall is the gameplay and replay value.  The game moves at such a slow pace with cinematic scenes in which more than half you're unable to skip. They don't last long but they come every ten minutes or so and that time does add up.  Thus, this makes the game lack for replay value.  The game also has predictable plot twists, but none the less its a good storyline.Also, while the music is lovely, the voice acting isn't too good. It'd have been much better if Square had let us choose whether we want subbed or dubbed.  The voice acting is in deed nothing special.The game cleary doesn't give off too much difficulty and while it is an amazing game, it is by far the most &quot;different&quot; Final Fantasy in the series.  The classic blue background is gone (some people actually DO care about that).  The classic ATB battle system that we've all grown to love is also gone.  Not to mention that as the Final Fantasy series goes on the games get easier and easier.  This one is no exception. Its downright easy.Overall the game is pretty good. It is better than VIII and IX but it isn't better than VII and the ones before.  The series has lost some of its classic edge with this one but that by no means suggest you should degrade it.On the positive side+Smooth lavish graphics+Nice music+Great storyline+New battle system that allows more strategy+The most unique way to raise characters ever+Square finally got some voices+Lots of mini-games and sidequestsBut on the bad side-Not enough replay-Too many scenes of watching rather than playing-VERY easy game-Its actually short compared to today's standards-The voice acting is not the best-Some of the elements that made Final Fantasy &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; are gone...Overall this is one of the better Final Fantasy games. Those who've ben there since FFI may not like this one quite as much but I assure you this is a great game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2003"}

Drifting is possible with All Wheel Drive vehicles like the Mitsubishi EVO but if the car is Rear Wheel Drive, forget it, you'll have to slam on the breaks and make turns at SLOW speeds (despite performance suspension, sway bars and slicks as upgrades to your car). There are about 16 tracks that have a few changes with turns and routes here and there.  There is indeed about 300 available cars there.  The AUDIO is this games only downfall (that and not being able to drift properly to make hairpin turns rather than slamming on the breaks).  After a while, every car albeit muscle, luxury, tuner that is upgraded tend to sound the SAME! You can't tell a Chevy engine between a Shelby because they both sound exactly the same and a Mazda Rotary Engine sounds exactly like a Scion TC's 4-cylinder engine in this game (and gearheads like myself know that is definitely not the case).
