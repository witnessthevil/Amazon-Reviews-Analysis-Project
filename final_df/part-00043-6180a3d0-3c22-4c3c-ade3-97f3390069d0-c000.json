It's been a few years, butFeverandMaddenare once again going head-to-head on the Xbox,  and once againFeverproves itself a serious threat to EA's perennial  football powerhouse. That's not to say thatNFL Fever 2002is a perfect  game, because it isn't, but it does offer great graphics, decent AI, and plenty  of bone-crunching gameplay.NFL Fever 2002features several gameplay modes, including practice,  single game, and season, which itself contains a couple of different options,  including dynasty and fantasy challenge.Fever 2002has a full NFL  license and includes all 31 current NFL teams--and 15 fantasy teams--along with  all the current stadiums. Dynasty mode is where most players will find  themselves, as this mode lets you manage all aspects of your team, including  signing and cutting players, negotiating trades, and making sure that your team  comes in under the salary cap.A great feature in dynasty mode is Dynamic Player Performance, which adjusts  players' ratings (which determine how well they play) based on past game  performances. So if you have a second-string running back who rattles off three  or four great games in a row, his rating will increase, which should keep him  performing at that high level. On the flip side, if a player has several poor  games, his rating will decrease.Because it was designed specifically for the Xbox (unlikeMadden NFL  2002, which was ported to the Xbox from the PlayStation2 version),NFL  Fever 2002looks awesome. Player animations are highly detailed, the  stadiums look fantastic, and the weather effects are topnotch. Beyond the  obvious features, though, there are many subtle details that really add to the  experience: the field will get torn up in wet weather, player uniforms will get  stained with dirt, and the crowd will begin to thin out if the game is a  blowout.In terms of gameplay,Fever 2002delivers a solid experience. The AI is  pretty solid, especially on the defensive side, and if you call a perfect game  it's possible to get a shutout against the computer, even on the higher  difficulty settings. On the downside, the computer rarely runs the ball, even  when it has a high-powered running back like Corey Dillon, and AI play calling  is rather suspect at times.Those complaints aside,Fever 2002is a lot of fun. It offers great  graphics, multiplayer is a blast, and the dynasty mode features a good deal of  depth. If you only want one football game,NFL Fever 2002deserves your  consideration.--William HarmsPros:Dynamic Player PerformanceGreat graphicsSolid defensive AICons:Computer rarely runs the ballGameplay a little arcadelike at times","reviewerName":"K.

{"product_name":"B00BMFIXT2","description":"","reviewerName":"Matthew Erwin","summary":"The Culmination of Assassin's Creed","reviewText":"Great, great game, one of the best of the year and probably the best of the AC series.  For those who have been following from the beginning, each game has gotten a lot right while leaving a lot to be desired.  AC1 with the repetitive nature, AC2 improved the combat and the story but occasionally got a bit thin around the edges.  AC3 was a 5 hour game in a 60 hour package.AC4 has finally figured out the series and what it can be.  The story is good (though not the best of the series).  The combat is tight and varied.  Ship battles are intense and unbelievably cool, far superior to Sid Meier's Pirates (the only recent pirate game worth mentioning).  Best yet there is a lot to do and none of it feels like filler.  It is a more open and living world like recent GTA games in opposition traffic cone style citizenry of past AC games.Overall it is an excellent game and you'll have fun just pirating around without even bothering with the main story.  But this is the best AC yet and has to give everyone hope after the AC3 letdown.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2013"}

With all the hype about the amazing and revolutionary graphics engine and weapon system that id Software (the inventors of first person shooters) has made, you would think they would fall through. The game completely is a 180 of what id said the game would be like. The first thing you will notice are the enormous amount of bugs and game breaking glitches especially for ATI card users. The graphics will literally be completely distorted, or the entire game will be blue. How do you fix this? Extract a file from the graphics driver update and put it in the Rage folder. Or you can fiddle around with Catalyst Control Center, or how about the game not even running right unless you have it open? This is completely absurd and should not be like this upon release. I spend a total of four hours fixing this damn game so I could just play it. So you're probably asking is it worth it?Well the shooting is solid and that's a fact. id knows what they are doing and the guns are great and super fun to use. You can upgrade them at stores in towns, and use various ammo types because the enemies do need different approaches. This is by no means a straight up stand in one area and shoot everything. You will die quickly so use what you have available to your advantage. Guns like the assault rifle use regular steel rounds and feltrite rounds which are more expensive but more powerful. The shotgun can use buckshot, but also pulse rounds and pop rockets which act like explosive shells. You get a rocket launcher, sniper rifle, and a pistol that shoots four different types of ammo. There's a decent amount of guns in the game and you slowly unlock them as the game goes on.Shooting enemies is fun because each weapon packs a punch and feels good to shoot. Enemies have great animations and fight worth a damn so the game isn't too easy. There are even some pretty fun boss fights as well. The enemy variety is pretty low, however, you get maybe five different kinds through the whole game with some just swapping out outfits such as different bandit groups. The whole point of Rage is to run around in the world and explore dungeons to complete various mission types. The dungeons are varied and have a lot of loot in them to engineer items such as bandages, wingstick (boomerangs that are instant kills!), sentry bots, RC cars that explode, ammo, grenades, and a whole slew of things you can build in your menu while your on the field. This can be really fun and encourage exploring every corner for junk to sell or use.Now you're probably wondering how the game is like an open world? While the game has a great art style and feels a lot like Fallout that it is trying to copy it isn't in any way. The game has a nice post-apocalyptic art style and has some great designs and pulls of atmosphere, but it falls short because the game has a false sense of freedom. The outdoor areas must be driven (more on car combat later) and can not be traversed by foot because for one it will take forever, and two the other cars will kill you instantly almost. The world has a lot of \"hallways\" that you can drive in that lead to each dungeon, but by no means is it a free open world like Fallout at all.This tends to be very depressing because you can see all this great open land, but it's barren and closed off by cliffs and walls around you. I mean there are only three towns in the whole game, and they are spread out in two different areas that you have to load between. There is a nice amount of side missions as well as races which involves the over hyped car combat. You drive around your car, which controls very well, and do various races to earn certificates to upgrade your vehicle so you can survive out in the \"wasteland\". The combat is fine and all, but mainly serves as just a way to get to your missions in the \"open world\" because car combat out here is far and few between.I also had a problem connecting to characters because you don't talk to them much and they really just give you missions. I also had a problem connecting to the story because while it has potential, it falls short with a terrible and lame ending, plus it just ends abruptly with a poor final mission with no boss fight. Some of the side missions are probably more interesting than the main missions. Overall you're looking at a 15 hour campaign even if you complete every side mission.  I also have to mention that the graphics look good, but there are better looking games out there thanks to Rage's weird low resolution texture problem, but there are some really nice lighting effects throughout.Overall Rage is a buggy, broken technical mess that most people will just give up on. However, the game has solid shooting, excellent weapon design, and engineering stuff is really fun. The false sense of freedom and so-so car combat really bring the game down to just a mediocre experience that will not leave an imprint like Doom or Quake did all those years ago. Sorry id but try, try again.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Shimkus \"Movie Manji\"","summary":"It's in the wrist. An example of \"Art\" to be considered if video games are to be considered a medium.","reviewText":"What makes this bundle incredible is the golden wand included at a price much cheaper than buying one with motion plus. The new game deserves it. Zelda: Skyward Sword is only complete with the 1:1 control. It wouldn't be the same game if you could switch to regular controls and you would be cheated out of the most exciting moments in the game. From the moment you pull your skyward sword out of stone, not with a button press, but by twisting your hands around its hilt and sliding the steel from mountain stone, you become one with the sword in a way the designer anticipated, and you finally realized. I thought to myself, \"My God Nintendo! This is what you envisioned!\"You'll hear it all if your a critical buyer, and you'll be caught up in some fanboy retribution reviews. But I hope you realize after reading the professional reviews, and then the buyer reviews that make sense and use examples to help you make your decision. In my opinion the game is a masterpiece and you would be missing out in one of the most monumental games of our \"WTF\" generation.This magnificient bundle of zelda goodness also come with a music CD for good reason. The music is a step in the good past, and is a symphonic orchestra of your 8bit music days. The CD would have sold by itself but here you are gifted a present on Zelda's 25th anniversary. The music comes joyful and playful, and other songs are as mysterious as the night in the clouds with princess Zelda. Nintendo works hard on all aspects of this bundle and it makes the toys that other companies package into other gaming franchises look 2nd rate.What can I say about this game other than what the expert reviewers have not all ready said? Go check yourself on Metacritic, a web site that organizes all of the major critics and assigns a powerful score that can immortalize a game or ruin it. I've read over at IGN that a low score there can lower the stock for that games company.It's a beautiful game, yes, beautiful game. No one can force my hand to write a lie. I do not worship Nintendo. I know the difference between Uncharted, where the graphics are state of the art, and Mario 64, which still looks gorgeous today. Skyward Sword has a soft, watercolor palette unique today. If games are to be determined to be art, it sure won't be determined beautiful by how well it was technically accomplished. Jackson Pollock, Pablo Picasso used what was \"ugly\" geometric composition that was very different than the art work that took years to accomplish and otherworld precision such as you see in the old masters. Please have an open mind about pixels and other really mind boggling stuff that such companies like Pixar did, or the impressive Uncharted series, no this isn't those things. But it is very much artistic and visually stimulating.I hope that this beautiful game reaches you. It is written in a story book fashion, and never before have the characters of Zelda been so introduced and been upon the user such a personal experience. After playing this game, and having conquered its worlds with skill and a swordsman's hand, you will have experienced a feeling in games that has never been realized until now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2011"}

Don't get me wrong - this game is a lot of fun.  The storyline is fairly original and intriguing enough to keep your interest.  The landscapes are varied and well designed.  And most of the boss fights are worth the price of admission.  However, given the hype the preceeded this game, there are some glaring flaws.  First, the ending.  Despite the fact that the game only takes 10 hours or so to beat, the ending should be longer than 60 seconds.  Second, some of the sidequests are difficult to find and if you miss them, you don't always get a chance to come back to them later.  Finally, the game is far too easy for an experienced player.  There are a few places where you can fight endlessly and get healed up cheaply.  Spend a few hours in these places and your team will be nearly invincible.Overall, Sudeki is worth it for a rent, and possibly a purchase if you have found games like Diablo 2 and Fable too difficult.

Any fan would also remember what came after that. 3D Cell Shaded graphics with a funny little child link running around a cartoonish world. Some liked the change in direction, some hated it. The thing that both can agree on though is that the game was innovative and fun while staying true to the core nature of a Zelda title. Phantom Hourglass is the continuation of this story and Nintendo is showing it's fans that they can take the title to smaller hardware, throw in new ideas and gameplay and still keep true to the series and the original title.Being one who just recently finished playing my copy of Twlight Princess, I found it to be quite the change to go back to the cartoon'ish appearance. Not to say it was a negetive change, I felt it a refreshing change to see brighter colors again. The colors werent the only changes I was seeing as well. The controls where different as well and they are amazing. They are extremely responsive and well thought out. I am able to set the DS on a table and play it with merely one hand if I wish to and it still works out with little to no issues. The one problem with the controls I do have is it is sometimes hard to make Link roll when you want him to. This in no way shape or form ruins any of the gameplay though.I'll be breif with this. The story is up to par with other Zelda titles. The controls and graphics are just the best you can find on the system and the sound is classic Zelda reborn.

I didn't really get into battlefield 3 for some reason; I think graphically, on the last-ten consoles, it just was too pixelated and low-res for me to enjoy.  On the other hand, the latest entry to Call of Duty (Ghosts) was a total failure.  The campaign (at least in the digital version) was an optional download!  That's how little they cared about the single player mode.  Someone at Infinity Ward was quoted as saying \"only 10% of players play the single player campaign\".  Either they're wrong or I'm in the 10%, but I like a good story and single player campaign, so I'm either in that 10% or there's a lot more people who like single player FPS games (take a look at how well a lot of single player FPSs have sold, and they have sold very well, so this is not something to skip over as they did with COD Ghosts-such a failure).So, hearing really good things about this game, I bought it (digital download).  The definitive edition is definitely the PS4 version, with the superior hardware, higher framerate, and running at 1080P!  And Kudos to these guys for picking up where the older COD games left off (COD Black Ops 2 was quite a thrilling single-player campaign; what a story!).  This game feels more like COD Black Ops 2 in terms of plot/campaign.  It's long, very immersive, you get to do a lot of really cool things.  Jumping out of airplanes, just for one.  Then, all the vehicles!  There are so many ways to accomplish missions, it borderlines on a sneak game like Deus Ex: Human Revolution (and there are definitely sections where you excplicitly have to sneak and use stealth).  There are a ton of ways to conquer each mission; it's all up to you.They did a good job, too, with encouraging exploration.  There are collectables, and the maps are absolutely enormous.Gameplay-wise, it's perfect, the familiar controls are there and you have both your twitch shooting, as well as mounted weapon sections, sniping, everything!  There are also some really neat innovations; using the cyber binoculars to pinpoint enemies, and ordering your squad to attack.  There are a lot of things to manage, and it's really addicting.  There is a *lot* to do.I also give massive credit to the AI in this game.  This is the first game where I've really felt like the enemy combatants were doing what another real-life player would do.  It makes the game harder, but more realistic.  In COD you had guys running in to walls and stuff; none of that here; they will do their best to outsmart you, so it's your job to come up with a way to outsmart them.  Really cool concept; I hope more of this AI is used in the future.And I know I already said it once, but the PS4 version of this REALLY is a next-gen game; when you read the credits there is a whole section devoted to the next-gen team.  I haven't gotten into multiplayer yet, but I'm sure that's where a ton of the action lies; using vehicles and teamwork, and only the next-gen PS4 version allows for 64 players at a time!  Incredible.My last note is, GameTrailers said, to paraphrase, \"Microsoft wouldn't let us show any footage of their version, so we're showing the PS4 version, and we're happy to report that the graphics are indistinguishable from the PC version set to the highest graphics settings, including in multiplayer\".After the tragedy and lies that made up COD Ghosts, being such a huge letdown (a crappy 4 hour campaign and nothing new in multiplayer), it looks like Battlefield has stepped up to the plate and is now the king of mainstream warfare FPS games.  A campaign that took at least 20 times longer to finish than the Ghosts campaign, much more interesting technology, better graphics with a brand new Frostbite engine (especially on the PS4 version running at 1080P,), etc!  Good job, Battlefield Team!  This is the pinnacle of shooters right now.UPDATE:Since getting into multiplayer, I have to say, it is the most complex, insane, deepest multiplayer experience I've ever experienced.  I've only scratched the surface.  But 64 players at 1080P is just incredible.  Players are set up into squads, and there are multiple classes with many unlocks.  I've been playing Killzone: Shadow Fall every day for a while, which is top-notch, and has a 3-class system.  This, on the other hand, is totally different.  Ground vehicles, airplanes, helicopters, squads, and even a quick chat button reminiscent of Tribes 2 (e.g., \"Need a Medic!\").  Time will tell whether I keep with this, as there is a steep learning curve, but I believe that with enough patience there is a great reward to be had here, possibly over every other multiplier FPS out right now (oh, how I miss Tribes 2...  Teamwork is so important!).  My only qualms with this is that it's its difficult to distinguish friendlies from enemies; even with the recon's scope; everyone appears red.  Not like the binoculars in the campaign.  You die a lot and often don't know how that person possibly killed you from that position.  Hopefully it's not hacking, but supposedly the PC version has it.  Time will tell.  Multiplayer on this is definitely a steep, steep learning curve, though.  Still, I'd take it over COD anyway.  Killzone 3 and 4, I think are a bit more streamlined.  Set up turrets, call in air support, etc.  BF4 is almost TOO much, but I'm going to give it time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2014"}

Single player: The single player mode is okay but the AI like everybody said that it is terrible. They just sit there most of the time while you are shooting or fighting zombies or soldiers. Offline is not really good. But if you play co op online single player, pretty sure you have no doubt that your team wont help you. Multiplayer online: Okay now there are ONLY 2 maps to play in. People told me that there will be a DLC coming up next month so they put more missions and more modes. In the game, they only have 4 or 5 modes called Team Attack ( Teamdeathmatch basically) , Biohazard ( Capture the the G-virus and puting back to ur base) , heros ( choose your hero and play with them in teamdeathmatch) , and Survival ( mostly is teamdeathmatch and the game is being time until the helicopter to pick up). All the game modes are just terrible. The game time is short and the spawn locations are very bad. So mostly this game is okay because the graphic kind of save it and the gameplay is okay.

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants.

However, the actual video  dynamics are superb and action-packed...one sequence featuring a huge clash  between Dragoons and Winglies is particularly nice.Music - This is where  the game really, REALLY hurts.  The soundtrack is so bland, boring, and  repetetive that I need to turn the sound off if I've been in any one town  for too long.  Sony also took a chance when they did character voice overs:  after all, the video game industry is infamous for poor character voice  overs.  However, most of them are pretty skillfully done.  Some of the  attack names might have needed work and are very silly when pronounced  (i.e. &quot;die...more and more!&quot; and &quot;hyah!  madness  hero!&quot;).Overall, the game is lacking that finishing touch (many,  many spelling errors, cheesy dialogue, and grammar problems bug the heck  out of me).

The dialogue is consistently this bad throughout the entire game, demeaning the characters, story, and entire game to amateur level.Dungeons are the heart of this game's gameplay, which are long and tedious.  Same areas are used in different locations with at least one battle in each area.  The numerous battles and repetitious dungeons make the gameplay incredibly slow and dry.Supposedly this game is well known for its cool battle quirks.  This is true, almost everything you do in a battle is effected in some way by player performance.  However I did not find this to be enjoyable.  After hundreds of battles I was pleading for the game to automate my attacks.  Repetition of button-timing and button-mashing mini games during battles became tiresome extremely fast.Soundtrack was quite nice though, paralleling Final Fantasy series quality.

I think any studio that doesn't make the most of the numerous myths in the world out there are crazy, like Arthur, Wotan, Beowulf, etc. Of course few studios could do them justice like this one, although Prince Of Persia was well done.

The four main characters of your group also known as bad company have very entertaining quirky personalities Haggard the demolition pyromaniac army nut job who seems to truly enjoy being in the war,  Sweetwater the techno geek who while an able soldier obviously regrets being forced into fighting,  Redford the Sergent and leader of bad company a no nonsense soldier who just wants to keep alive until he can leave the army and go on his fishing trip in the Caribbean and finally your character Marlowe who just joined bad company during this time after your own mishap that landed you in bad company in the first place.  Unlike the soldier characters like in Medal of honor or Call of duty this group of misfits pretty much know where they rank in the their service to their army,  as cannon fodder being the group that's first into the battle and the last to leave.  The gameplay is very enjoyable and the controls are pretty easy to learn what I truly appreciate as a novice first shooter player is that the games easy mode is just that very easy making it hard to kill off your character unless you stupidly charge into enemy gunfire without trying to take cover.  The actors they got to do the voices for these characters is very to notch almost making you feel like your watching a CGI movie with the cutscenes,  the graphics fro the game are very good but with games like Uncharted I've seen better with some of the background and character graphics but that's also to be expected since this game has been out for a few years so no surprise.

Agnew \"rothwyn\"","summary":"Best Star Wars game in years","reviewText":"When I first heard that Knights of the Old Republic was going to be set 4,000 years before the movies, I thought it would be crap. Boy, was I wrong. This game kicks more a** than the last two Star Wars movies combined. Everything from the graphics to the battle system to the story is very well executed. If it weren't for a couple problems, hey, this might have been perfect.The story goes like this; The New Republic has been at war with the Mandalorians, and drove the last of their enemy deep into space, where a Jedi master named Revan and his apprentice, Malak, chased them into the beyond, and returned as Sith lords with a fleet of war ships. Malak betrays his master, and attacks the New Republic with his armada. And here, as the apprentice of the Jedi Bastila, you begin the game. It is your job to find out the mystery behind the end of the Mandalorian war, the Sith Battleships, and Malak, and to either step into the role of a Jedi and stop him, or become one of the Sith.This game just screams Star Wars. The Ebon Hawk is a dead ringer for the Millenium Falcon, but looks different enough to be seen as a forbear, not a clone. The game will take you from Tatooine to Coruscaunt to Kashyyk, Chewbacca's homeworld, and you will even get your own wookies! Ever wondered what C-3P0 would be like if he was a fighting type and didn't whine? I know I did, and Hk-47, your loyal, and homocidal, droid party member, is one of the best characters in the game.The controls may prove something of a problem. There is always difficulty moving a game that was built for a console to the PC. However, these problems are easily bypassed, considering that the entire game can be played with the mouse, or, for thumb candy addicts like me, you can just plug in a game pad. The battle system is real-time turn-based, and it easy to use, especially because of the pause feature, which is a blessing when nature calls in the middle of a major fight.The graphics more than do the job, and in some places, provided you have a good processor and video card, they can be downright astounding. The moving grass and the glow of the lightsabers are incredible. The sound is equally impressive. John William's signature score runs throughout parts of the game, where others have a slower, deeper tone, but all of it runs in the same vein as the movies. The sound effects are all recognizable, from the hum of a saber to roar of a starship's engines. In addition, this game may have the best voice acting of any on the PC market. It's really that great, and there are hours and hours of it thanks to the fully-interactive dialogue system.It's great to have the options to choose between the life of a noble Jedi, or a power-hungry Sith. Sure, the game isn't all that open-ended, but's it sure is long, spanning four disks on the PC. There are lots of side-quests (solving them all in addition to beating the game will take some people upwards of 60 hours), but in the end, this is a story-based RPG, and it is linear. Is that a bad thing? No. We've all seen what happens when Star Wars games are left too open-ended (cough*Galaxies*cough), and this strikes a balance between choice and duty, as it were. Even after beating the game, most will want to play through it again, as the light and dark side endings are different, and both are worth the effort.In addition, the customization of the characters in impressive. Everything from equipment to clothing to your character's appearance (it will change depending on your light side/dark side alignment) to the ability to design your own lightsaber, or lightsabers, is nifty on a level that Star Wars has never seen. Seen your character weild a dual-bladed saber while beating down some bad dudes will make you feel tingly all over.The biggest real problem of this game is that the inventory can be clumsy at time, as you don't have access to all of your items while on the Ebon Hawk. It seems silly to have to land the ship, switch out items, then take off again. In addition, though the dialogue is very well-done, sometimes the loops are repeated or hard to follow. It doesn't show up that often though but it's one of the only things that faults the gameplay.All in all, this is a must have for any fan of computer RPG's in general and Bioware in particular, and any Star Wars fan owes it to themselves to pick this up. A great experience in both gameplay and Star Wars lore, you just can't go wrong with Knights of the Old Republic. Just make sure you have enough space and muscle to run the thing, 'cause it's a monster of a game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2003"}

Either you've seen the movies, played the games or seen one of the umpteen million clones.  The one thing the game does do (with its tradmark humor) is it does explore some of the battles that are hinted at in the movie but never explored. Speaking of the humor in the game, the story is moved forward in silent (no talking) cut scenes that act out what happened in the story, usually with the characters doing something silly (where in the movie it was of course done seriously, proably with a annoying cg character and a lot of explosions)in a mini scene that summarizes what happened before and after the level. This paticular version combines the two previous seperate releases so you get the original movies and the prequel thingies, which means there is plenty material to explore and plenty of secrets to find. So take a look at this not just for kids take on the Star Wars universe and you may find yourself pleasantly suprised and maybe a little addicted.-------Game Play: Basic on the surface, run through the level bash anything that moves, but deep when the player starts trying to collect studs to fill the power meter, the power blocks and various other secrets that require the player to go back to the level and play through again with characters unlocked in later chapters. This game is also one of the rare one's that allow 2 player same xbox / same screen co-op so one can double the fun if they have someone else who wants to play.Graphics: I'm not big on this so to me they are great, the levels are colorful and bright, stuff blows up real good and there is not much slow down. It may just be my TV but when there is a lot of action on the screen I can see the refresh line as the game / xbox tries to keep up.Controls / Camera: The controls for this game are simple. One button attacks, one button jumps, one button uses whatever special ability a character uses. For the most part the characters do what the player tells them and rarely decides to jump into that pit of lava in front of him. I only had a problem with this in the level (return of the sith, pt 6) based around lava and you have to run and jump with the camera facing toward the characters so it's hard to see what is coming up. Speaking of the camera it's the usual fixed, occasionaly wonky deal but it is mostly servicable in this game.m.a.c","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2008"}

I'm aware that things you have to do are pretty much outlined but still Prince moves so freely that the game flows and you don't feel like guided.I don't care if you can't die, I actually liked it because it saves time.  Maybe it's just me but I don't like watching a load screen everytime I die. Besides Prince and Elika make fun of it from time to time when you miss a jump and get saved, nice touch.Repetition is unavoidable I guess but they came up with some imaginative acrobatic puzzles here and there.  Sure you fail in first few tries but then you figure out what to do, then it becomes a breeze.I couldn't care less for fighting mechanics because I'll get God of War 3 for that purpose.  I hit some nice combos but let's face it, it's more fun when Kratos does it, happy happy, joy joy, slash...I got this game more than year later then it's released and Forgotten Sands soon to be released, you may think it's not worth buying but I still recommend it becuse it's colorful and fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002I0GEXM","description":"","reviewerName":"E. David Swan","summary":"A Redefining of the word \"EPIC\" (and not in a good way)","reviewText":"When you call your game `EPIC' Mickey you create certain expectations. I would expect this to be the ULTIMATE Mickey game, possibly an evolutionary step where Mickey Mouse enters the current generation of gaming with a new classic platformer. I've seen video's where the creators appear quite pleased with their finished product. Based on other reviews I expected the camera to be temperamental and the control to be wonky but that is only the start. The entire tone of the game is unpleasant. The game makers went for dark but what they got was bleak, depressing and ugly. These graphics would have looked lousy on Gamecube and the music plays like a funeral dirge. What I was hoping for was to be able to brighten up the world similar to Mario Sunshine but when you leave an area and come back everything resets and generally even brightened up the areas still look depressing. Many of the older forgotten Disney characters are a weird sepia tone which I suppose is meant to imply they're from the black and white era of cartoons but they speak with these creepy hollow grunts. There are robot versions of Goofy, Donald and Daisy that are nothing more than disturbing heads in a box. One of the sidequests is to get all their robot parts to rebuild them but I never managed to complete any of those sidequests along with most of the other sidequests. It wasn't for lack of trying it's just that everything is hidden and it's a tiring task trying to find them all.As critical as the reviews I've read have been this game is worse. The levels are forgettable and poorly designed. The battles are tedious and the whole game seems heavily padded and unfocussed. The first levels are just terrible and have zero Disney feel to them. I expected all sorts of classic references to Mickey history but all I got was a dark muddy mess. Later you get to a hub sort of area that is an improvement in some ways and feels a little more Disneyish but then it starts sending players on hunt quests that get boring REAL fast. I was hoping that Tomorrowland might be fun but it certainly wasn't and ended up being one of the worst yet. There's a lot of tedious quests in the game for instance at one point I needed to find three flowers for Clarabelle in Mean Street (Main Street) and I just couldn't find the bloody things. I almost quit the game at this point.I never finished the game. I got to what I assume was the ending jumping straight into the belly of the embiggoned Shadow Blot. The game was just so ugly and depressing as I popped enormous green boils in a nasty black gooey environment. It wasn't fun. It wasn't pretty and I just decided to quit. I have more memories of levels from Banjo Kazooie on the N64 back in 1998. Super Mario Sunshine on the GameCube was a much prettier game and it came out in 2002. The only thing that kept me going was collecting reels to unlock full Mickey cartoons. It's neat but quite frankly I could pull them up on YouTube if I want at any time so it's a pretty hollow achievement. The story and cutscenes are quite good but it's the game play that kills it. I borrowed this game from a friend and quite frankly even at the reduced price of $22.46 I would consider it too expensive. I really gave this game a chance but my advice is that there are too many better games out there to be wasting time on this one unless you REALLY have a burning desire to play as Mickey Mouse.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2011"}

Gildart","summary":"Adding a star after recent 05/2013 firmware upgrade","reviewText":"My initial review was based on some aggravation involved in setting up this newly released console that shipped needing a giant update that took over an hour tp download.  Even after that upgrade, the software was laggy and buggy, so I wasn't the happiest Nintendo customer ever.  But this week's update has made the console run much MUCH more smoothly, and, for the first time, I am actually using this as the go-to console instead of the old wii.The interaction between the console and the handheld is pretty cool once you get the hang of it, but there is a learning curve, and having to switch back and forth between interacting with the screen and interacting with the handheld takes some getting used to. The Netflix app is awesome. Hulu Plus is awesome. All of the streaming video applications are awesome. Wii U chat is super awesome.The gamepad's touch screen is bright and responsive and does show fingerprints. It's bigger than you think it's going to be. The console, also, is bigger than its predecessor - about the size of one of those giant external cd-rom drives from back in the day.In addition to the games, we've been using the Wii U Chat. I don't think it's going to replace computer chatting for any grown ups, but my son has a friend who moved away, and they do Wii playdates quite often. This has added a nice element for them.TVii is okay - setting that up was not exactly intuitive.  You have to put away the stylus and swipe through the options with your fingers.  The tv remote functions aren't exactly all that helpful if you're hooked up to an entertainment center.We had a usb hard drive available for extra storage, so we saved money by buying the basic console and picking up slightly used copies of a couple of games (Super Mario Bros. U = very cool).  Another unfun surprise about the console was that we were not able to use a 32 gb SD card for storage.  Odd in this day and age, but apparently the SD slot is - at least for now - used only for the data transfer between the Wii and Wii U.My 11 year old loves the console. I think I will learn to love it. But I kind of don't, yet. The question I'm always asking myself when I go to buy a new console is whether the upgrade is worth the money. In this case, my answer is a reluctant yes, probably. Graphics are better. Functionality is much more versatile. I just wish it were a little sleeker and a lot faster.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2012"}

This game is one of the most innovative and unique titles for the 360 platform, and provides an incredibly entertaining adventure for those who aren't afraid of a little R-rated horror.Make no mistake, this is not a game for your children (or grandchildren) but an adult title where you're put in the shoes of an FBI agent hunting a crazed serial killer. And the path to your success is paved with pulse-pounding moments of terror and exciting action.The game starts out at a murder scene, and walks you through using the 360 controller to sample evidence and move about the environment. Although much of the first-person interface is new, the controls are easy to pick up, and you'll quickly find yourself immersed in the world and flawlessly moving through it.Although the entire 10-level game is entirely land based (you don't use vehicles or do anything besides walk around), the maps are well designed and offer interesting variety. Likewise, the story is so robust that you'll be trying to solve the puzzles as your character works each crime scene.If you like to earn all of the \"Achievements\" (or gamerpoints) for a 360 title, this game will deliver. With rewards for completing each level (regardless of difficulty setting), you'll add 150 to your gamerscore just by finishing the game. But the fun (and replayability) comes from unearthing all of the secrets in the game, including dozens of secrets, finding every piece of evidence in your hunt for a serial killer and using every weapon in the game.There is no online or multiplayer component to this game, but there are \"scoreboards\" tracking the amount of time you've spent in the game, your melee kills, etc. Honestly though, you're not playing the game to make it on the scoreboard, you're playing because you'll find yourself hopelessly sucked into the plot...

Contoured perfectly to fit a player's hand,The Wii Nunchuk (left) connects directly to the Wii remote.View larger.the Nunchuk controller builds on the simplicity of the Wii Remote controller. The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Essential For Many Wii Games","reviewText":"The Wii Remote itself is a revolution in gaming.  The nunchuck attachment, which is essential to play many Wii games (Zelda for instance) is something to add on to that revolution.The nunchuck is easy to set up.  Simply plug it into the base of the Wii remote and you're ready to go.  The remote uses sensors.  The nunchuck also uses sensors to perform certain actions in games.  In Red Steel, for instance, you'll need to use the nunchuck to knock over tables.  In The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess you'll need to use it to perform a spinning slash attack.On the other hand, the nunchuck is mostly used in games where you'll find yourself having to move your character around.  The nunchuck has a control stick for this reason.  It also has a C button and Z button that can be used in many games. These buttons, as well as the motion sensor, are very responsive.  The better part?  The nunchuck doesn't take batteries.  However, it should be noted that the nunchuck attachment will drain the batteries in your wii remote faster.There is really only one problem that I have with the nunchuck: It's sold separately from the wii remote.  While not every wii game needs the nunchuck attachment, a great deal of them do.  As of this time, Nintendo is not selling the nunchuck and wii remote in a bundle together.  Instead you'll have to buy them separately, and if you buy an additional remote, you may want to buy a nunchuck to go with it.  This can be costly.Still, the nunchuck is a great attachment, and is actually essential to enjoying all of the interative goodness Nintendo's new gaming system provides to gamers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2006"}
{"product_name":"B000TT4GBG","reviewerName":"kidnugget","summary":"Great for families and couples!","reviewText":"I won't say much here that other reviews haven't said much more comprehensively, but I wanted to add my two cents to the discussion.Rock Band is one of the funnest games I have for the 360.  I never got into guitar hero too much, so I was a bit of a newbie (though we played tons of Karaoke Revolutions...).  Let me list some pros and cons.Pros:1) It is great for families and couples.  My wife always lost her mind with boredom when I'd want to play games.  Now, she loves gaming as much as I do.  We play together all the time, and we formed a band with my sister and brother-in-law and play several times a week.  It's great for kids, couples, roomies, you name it.  Best party game ever!2) Great marketplace.  We must have downloaded dozens of songs by now.  Everything from Nine Inch Nails to Black Sabbath to Boston (and in a couple weeks a whole album by The Who).  They promised that every Tuesday they'd release a song.  In reality, every Tuesday, they release between 3-10 songs.  There is an amazing catalog of downloadable content for every flavor of music and every skill level.3) Skill levels.  The skill levels work very nicely.  If you are an old guitar hero dog and play on expert, but your girlfriend wants to sing and needs to play on easy, no problem.  You each pick your own difficulties and have a great time.4) Nice Instruments.  The instruments are of good quality.  We know a couple of people who broke their kick drum, but I suspect they were spazzing out on it.  Ours is fine!Cons:1) There is no Bass tour mode. You can only play a guitar tour and get money for your character if you play lead guitar.  You can do a solo tour on drums, microphone, or lead.  They just dissed the bass!  I love the bass; it's my favorite instrument.  But I'm the band's stepchild who can only brush up in boring old \"practice mode.\"  They really need to fix this when RB2 comes out in September!!!  (Please guys, read your forums and fix this!!!)2) It is expensive.  But this isn't even too bad a con for.  I haven't had the need to buy any games since I got this thing in early December.  It has probably saved me money since I'd have bought a couple of games I'd have lost interest in by now.3) Not very guitar hero friendly.  Many of the guitars from GH and RB don't work on each others' games.  This really sucks, but I suspect there's no getting around this as the two megacorps battle for supremacy and our dollars.But, those cons don't hardly take it down a star.  This is a great game.  Play it with friends, play it solo, play it online.  It is worth every penny.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2008"}

Granted, a lot of modern FPS games are linear and run on rails, but this felt like I was going through the \"It's a Small World After All\" ride.  Halfway through, I was dying to get off!The multiplayer is much different story.  Fun gun-on-gun action.  And taking the time to throw a frag or call in your streak rewards can earn you a quick bullet in the face.  I find the maps fun, varied, and challenging.  Run and gun is suicide, spray and pray is useless, and hipfiring and quickscoping are comical attempts.  So thinking and being tactical are the keys to winning.  Camping doesn't work either because once you kill someone, you light up like a Christmas tree, even through walls.  This bothered me at first, but it's the perfect anti-camping trick.  So, once you kill someone - MOVE!I find $60 a stiff price for just multiplayer.  $40 is more reasonable.  But already dropping to $50 after just a week or so is the right direction.  I hope more people pick this up and give it a try.  Need a larger community to keep this going!But then again, Halo 4 and Black Ops 2 comes out in the next couple of weeks.

Footprints will be left in mud, for example, but only until it rains and then they will wash away. Lara's shirt will also get wet, and she's more likely to lose her grip if she is standing on a slippery, rain-soaked ledge. When the sun comes out, her shirt will dry and the slippery surfaces regain their friction.In Underworld, Lara also has a lot more flexibility in how she makes her way through a level, as there is often more than one way to get from here to there. She can now climb walls with texture and rocky outcroppings to reach areas she previously wouldn't have been able to access.All of these additions have been made to give the game a non-linear, open feel. Players can interactive with the environment by doing things they find to be intuitive, and the game will respond in an appropriate way. When Lara interacts with trees, for example, she will push aside leaves using either one or two hands depending on whether or not she's holding something. These details give a lifelike, immersive sensation to the game.New Melee Combat SystemUnderworld introduces a new melee combat system that requires players to strategically strike with offensive, defensive, and evasive maneuvers. Lara can now attack enemies with different punches, kicks, knees, and other acrobatic onslaughts. Items lying on the ground, such as poles that were previously walked on, can be picked up and swung at enemies. Players can also perform a greater variety of actions with weapons; for example, Lara can now hold onto a ledge with one hand and fire a gun with the other.Realistic Enemy and Animal AIThe AI in Tomb Raider: Underworld has also taken a big step forward--both enemies and animals now make independent decisions based on their surroundings, employ ambush and squad tactics when fighting, and will retreat if deemed necessary.With updated graphics and a more immersive and realistic gameplay, Tomb Raider: Underworld will have both fans and newcomers excited about the newest installment in this popular video game-pinup franchise.Tomb Raider: Underworld is loaded with a new melee combat system, various weapons, and smarter AI for both enemies and animals.","reviewerName":"Greg Sword \"DETfaninATL\"","summary":"A Flawed But Fun Game That Delivers On What It Promises","reviewText":"Since Action / Adventure games tend to be the types of games I most enjoy, I figured it was high time that I finally played a game from the series that pretty much seems to be a cornerstone of the genre : TOMB RAIDER. With that in mind, I picked up 'TOMB RAIDER : Underworld' on the cheap for only $10 and got to it. Not having really much of an idea what to expect from the game, beyond what little I knew about the iconic main character from movies, comics and hearsay, I can at least say that I had an open mind and a fresh take on the series / game, as I set out to play it. Which, I suppose served me well, because as much as I enjoyed aspects of it and did overall enjoy it more than not, there were definitely some aspects of it that were exceptionally frustrating. So let's get to it....THE GOOD : The first thing that struck me about the game was how beautiful everything was. From the obvious elements like Lara's perfect rack and tightly wardrobed body (which I guess has always been one of the series draws?) to the expansive, lush and exceptionally atmospheric scenery, everything in this game was quite pleasing to the eye, to say the least. I found myself, a good number of times, just stopping to look around at the environment around me. Especially on the jungle levels which seemed to have a great amount of detail and work put into them. Even on the cold weather levels, the environment was done well enough to the point that it felt stark and cold, but never got boring to look at. All in all, the game was quite a feast for the eyes. But in addition to being good on the eyes, the game was also a bit of a challenge for the brain. The puzzles and solutions to them definitely required some thought. Not so much so that it was ridiculously frustrating, but definitely enough to keep you busy and challenging yourself. Sometimes it would involve looking for a specific artifact, sometimes it was simply a matter of figuring out how to get from one point to the next. Whatever the case, it was rarely, if ever, dull. Something else that kept the game from getting dull, and this gets back to the environments, was the diversity of them. From underwater adventures, to jungle treks, to ruined temples, to the arctic, this game definitely had some diversity to it. Even the weapons category, which, for the most part was pretty basic, mixed it up by throwing tranquilizer guns, spear guns and even a special treat : Thor's mystical (and powerful!) hammer Mjolnir, into the mix along with Lara's standard dual pistols and a few other 'standard' guns. None of these weapons had the 'realistic' feel that so many of us are used from playing FPS type games, but then again, that's not what this category of gaming is really about. It's more about the adventure and the challenge it puts you through. Because it's fun to take Lara through these diverse locales, navigating deadly traps and environments and fending off dangerous and sometimes otherworldly creatures of all shapes and sizes. And in this regard, 'TOMB RAIDER : Underworld' gets it right.THE BAD : Unfortunately, 'TOMB RAIDER : Underworld' gets some things wrong too - big things. Those being the camera and controls, which, in ANY game can be a killer and degrade the fun immensely. Especially since games are all about one thing and one thing only : how much fun did you have playing it? I wouldn't say I didn't have fun playing this game, but I can definitely say that after struggling with a camera that seemed to have a mind of it's own, somewhat unresponsive controls and glitchy software that acted oddlly and at times completely froze up, in the end, I didn't have as much fun as I strted out having and was hoping I'd end up having. To break it down a bit, the camera often didn't position itself in the most advantageous spot and as was so often the case, when you'd go to adjust it to where you wanted it, it wouldn't always stay there. At other times, it was near impossible to get the camera to any decent angle at all, such as if you were stuck in a corner or some other tight spot and needed a clearer view of your positioning. Too often this would result in an unnecessary, intentional death just to 'reset' things. Tacking right on to the bad camera (which I understand from reading some reviews now after having played this, that this has been a LONG running problem with this whole series), are the bad controls. All too often Lara wouldn't do what I was punching into the controller for her to do, or going in a direction I wasn't sending her in, etc. This, too, resulted in a lot of unnecessary deaths. Another killer in this game was the glitchy software. At times I experienced Lara getting stuck in a 'pattern' of action that required pressing a completely unrelated action to get her to snap out of it. For example, if Lara was in a tight space such as a corner, I wasn't able at times to just turn her around and jump her over the obstacle. It would just cause her to repetitively jump facing into the corner or whatever. I'd have to do something like shoot the gun to get her to 'snap out of it'. Also, there were simple, standard actions that Lara would execute such as getting on a bike or picking up a treasure that caused her to act like a robot and not anything even close to human. And this was just the game being the game - it wasn't a glitch. 'Face this way, now turn towards object x, now turn sideways, now execute action y' type stuff. Nothing fluid that led you to believe you might be watching a person. There was never a feeling you weren't watching a computer generated avatar executing actions you told it to. At other times, the software caused the game to just straight-up freeze on me causing me to have to eject the disc and reboot the system. This didn't happen a ton, but enough that it's worth mentioning. And all of this was in addition to the screen tearing and disappearing Lara I'd experience every now and then, depending on where I was trying to put the camera. All in all, 'TOMB RAIDER : Underworld' really doesn't have too many bad aspects to it, but the things it does have against it are pretty substantial, though not enough to completely kill the fun - just hamper it a decent bit.THE BOTTOM LINE : It would be too easy to make references to this game being like a very beautiful but fussy and finnicky woman, or some other such reference, so I'll stay away from anything of the sort for fear of coming off as misogynistic. But suffice it to say, that though this game can be fun (especially for the price, if you get it used) and absolutely has its' moments, it also has some pretty glaring weaknesses that definitely can take away from the fun....... Then again, how bad can it really be watching Lara Croft's perfect body in skintight outfits for 8-12 hours? Even when she's only wearing a skimpy wetsuit in freezing arctic water?? Sorry - I had to find a way to work that in. I just found that design choice pretty amusing. I mean, that outfit?? In the arctic?? REALLY?!?!?!? But as I said before, I guess that's always been one of the major appeals of this series so, give the fans what they want, I guess. And really, the bottom line here is that despite its' glaring flaws, this game definitely delivers what it promises and it's done in a beautifully rendered way.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M4","description":"It's often argued that Nintendo makes the best video games in the world,  but one thing the company isn't known for is scary games. If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"The return of brilliance to gaming.","reviewText":"In 1996 I picked up a game made by an unheard of developer called Silicon Knights. The game was the epic Blood Omen: The Legacy of Kain. Since then Silicon Knights have been my developer simply because of the brilliance behind the story, and while Crystal Dynamics have done a decent job with Kain since, none of the current stories light a candle to the original.It has been four years in development, and Eternal Darkness has been well worth the wait. I have only spent a few hours with this game, but what I have played so far is a refreshing experience literally all its own. This game cannot be compared to Resident Evil at all. Walking dead aside this game bares no resemblance to the survival horror genre. Co-developed by Nintendo the game has a Nintendo style of game play that is ingenious, beautiful, smooth, and brilliant.The graphic are not on par with Resident Evil, but yet is still breath taking, and it is one of the better-looking GCN games. But this game was never about graphics anyway. With Silicon Knights it's never about graphics, but an intriguing story line of epic proportions. Despite the low polygon character models the subtlety of the games details is amazing. Small things like a floor filled with screaming faces are both disturbing, and appreciated. Too bad Capcom never thought that one up.The best part of this game is the sound. This is the best sounding game I have ever heard on any game on any console. Resident Evil has the best Graphics; Eternal Darkness has the best sound. The music isn't much to sing songs of praise about, but the ambience of the game, and the way things sound distant when they're in the background... the amazingly realistic sound effects... and dare I mention the voice acting? So far I swear I have heard the voices of Simon Templeman (known for his role as Kain, playing Pias Augustas) Rene Aburjonis (SP?) (Best known as Odo in DS9, but also Janus Aldron in the recent Legacy of Kain games) and possibly Michael Bell (Knows for his role as Raziel). I'm not sure on this because I have not seen the cast, but its nice to hear voices that I know and love behind this game. The voice acting, aside from Alex's fake sounding crying, is on par with Legacy of Kain, probably because of the voice actor's selected for the game. Simply one of the best.The most interesting thing about this game is the packaging. The fact that this game is developed by Silicon Knights is in fine print. Nintendo is making it very clear this very M rated video game is a Nintendo game, and considering that Nintendo themselves co-developed it its a claim that they are entitled to. I was aware that Silicon Knights was a Nintendo Second Party, but from the looks of it, SK may have been made a part of Nintendo, much like EAD, HAL, and R&D;, which would be a brilliant move on Nintendo's part. SK could single handedly target the adult audiences that Nintendo is making an extra effort to obtain. I have a feeling this won't be the last Nintendo made M rated title. I hope it will be the first of a new trend because this game so far was well worth the wait... especially when the weird things start happening.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2002"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","summary":"Compared to other FF games...","reviewText":"The only FF I played was FF7, 8, and 10. That was 10 years ago. When FF13 came out, I hesitated because I heard of bad things like how it was very linear and that they messed up the whole battle and leveling system. How I was wrong... For the first few hours of playing FF13, I quickly realized that it plays out like a movie. Everything you do is in one direction. There was no puzzle and hardly any maze to slow you down. You only side-missions are to kill a certain enemy mob for rewards. Overall, this is not necessarily a bad thing because I realized how all the older FF games had frustrating, pointless puzzles with little guidance. The old FF games were torture. If you missed read a dialog, you ended up running around town and the world map aimlessly, and not knowing where the next objective was. In FF13, there was always a map and guide arrow. On the down side, I wish that there was at least a world map in FF13 to run around in lol. Grand Pulse is the closest thing to a world map, but it is really just a bigger area with monsters to hunt, very visually stunning though. The leveling up system, Crystarium, is like the Sphere system from FF10, except a whole lot less confusion. Although, I still like the FF7 Materia system better.The most important thing in an FF series is the battle system. Despite some other reviews, the battle system is very easy to understand. Most of the time, I just use the auto-attack. Once you figure out how to effectively use the Paradigm shift, there is nothing else useful to learn.You can upgrade your weapons instead of finding better ones, which is stupid. Let be honest, you want to open up a chest and find a better, bigger, more bad-a** looking gunblade instead of upgrading the same weapon which looks the same at every level.The summons were pointless, and since you only control one character in battle, only one summon can be cast. If you want to cast another summon, you have to build up the TP points from battling and switch to controlling another character if you want a different summon. Generally, summons were only good for rejuvenating the party, and building up the stag gauge while staying alive. Summoning was kind of a hassle, I beat the last boss without needing to summon. The other abilities were kind of pointless too, like Quake which didn't do much damage. I didn't summon that much because I was trying to save the TP points for harder battles, which I ended up not summoning at all.For most of the game, I complaint about the hard difficulty compared to older FF games. Well, there is a reason. When you die, you are no longer thrown back to the Intro screen and forced to reload the save file. I'm suprise it took them so long to fix this dumb problem. Instead you just reset right back to the point before you enter the battle. Since you can see the enemy, you can also avoid battles. This is so much better than those annoy random battles in the old FF games. Also, Gils are very hard to find, but that's ok because everytime you enter a battle, you have full HP and no \"diseases\". There is no need to refresh your party with sleep and tents at save points, none of that non-sense in FF13. And thankfully there is a save-point every 15ish minute you play, and all the cut-scenese can be skipped, even summons. All this makes the game a hell lot less annoying to play.Too beat ANY enemy, all you need to know is when to use the Paradigm shift to buff, heal, stagger, and inflict. Sadly, the rest is auto-attack. I do miss those legacy spells like Ultima which only the boss can cast in FF13. On the other hand, the battle system lets you chain combos, like Thunder, Fire, Blizzard in one attack, which is pretty cool. Sometimes I wonder why they couldn't let you control all three character if all you going to do is hit the auto-attack most of the time. The actual fighting is far better than any FF game before it. You can throw Monsters into the air while the other characters cast different spells on them. Your party members are constantly jumping, flipping, and moving around the area. Weapons enchanting spells look really cool like a slash of fire, lighting, or ice. The FF13 battle system is a good modern approach to the old FF games which is outdated, old and boring compared to modern games. I say, it is a better battle system compared to older FF games, but then it could have been much better.The story-telling is another important aspect in FF. FF13 is extremely confusing. They use weird and unconventional  names like L'cie, Fal'cie, Pulse, Focus, Cocoon, Orphan, etc. On top of that, they don't clearly define what the name actually mean, where they came from, and what their purpose is. In FF7 when they say the Shinra corporation develops Mako-power, you know exactly what they are talking about. After I beat FF13, I had to find a Youtube video to explain the whole story. The overall story, when I understood it, was just okay. FF13 story is not as good as FF7 though, but at least the ending in FF13 was intense and the CGI was topnotch. There are also a lot of text data in FF13 that explains everything from the spells and abilities, to the story itself, but who has time to sit down and read all that.FF13-2 and Lightning Return was already released and reviewed when I beat FF13. I played a bit of FF13-2, and watched reviews of Lightning Returns. Sadly, the 13 series seems to be going down the drain. When I play FF13-2 and watch the review for Lightning Returns, they look like beta versions of FF13 =/I recommend FF13, but it is really pushing for that 5-star since. 5-stars because I am an old FF fan, and FF13 is not all that bad. Despite the flaws, you still should appricate the limitless artwork, CGI, music, and sound-track that they put together. Unfortunately, I will probably skip the other two follow up games in the 13 series due to the degraded game quality, and continue playing where I last left off in The Last of Us which I have been putting on hold because of FF13.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2014"}

This is without a doubt, THE best comic book/ superhero video game I have played yet. Batman has been done right finally and I might as well say the same for all superheroes because after this release, all developers of future superhero game releases will have quite a bar to jump over and I'm positive that we are going to see some stellar titles from here on out.This is a title done right. The gameplay is absolutely solid, the story is faithful to the source and overall, it's a complete blast that caters to all kinds of gamers and their playing styles. You want stealth play? Check. You want to run in, fists and feet flying? Check. You want to run around solving puzzles and collect stuff scattered about for no good reason other than to shut the Riddler up? Check.I have to say, I am absolutely impressed with everything about this game. The controls are spot on and fighting a crowd of goons is akin to watching a balletic display of brute grace. The level of violence in this game is pretty surprising as well. You're not going to see brains getting splattered across a wall but a punch to the face never looked as painful as it does here. Same said for a kick to the side of the head or a punch to the kidneys. Batman beats his foes bad and you'll love being in charge of the whuppings he administers.You get to play with a decent amount of Bat-gadgetry and the game takes on a Metroid-ish quality when you revisit certain areas to access new ones you couldn't get to before because you've got a new toy that'll help get you there. The graphics are beautiful and Arkham Asylum itself is a big, nasty place that will make your skin crawl from time to time. The story definitely takes on a horror element and manages to achieve a sense of claustrophobia and dread as you walk down Arkham's rotted halls. The surround sound adds another layer of immersion and helps in locating anything from one of the Joker's henchmen to a pair of chattery teeth you might have to destroy. There's a lot more to the game I'd love to tell you about but I think you should go into it as fresh as possible just so you could experience it the way I did. The game travels to some dark places at times and it's in these moments where I felt the developers really showed their stuff and gave it all they had.If you love Batman and the mythology, I think it's safe to say that you'll love this game. Just about every major villain appears or is at least referenced to in some manner. The voice work is flawless and getting Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill to voice Batman and the Joker respectively is just another detail to put a grin on your face. It's very dense and even the most astute Batman fan might find a new thing or two to discover about the Batman universe.I'm done. This game is pretty much a must-own or at the very least, a must-play if you couldn't already tell from the dry humping I did of this game in the earlier paragraphs. It's a game that'll keep you busy for a good while and is a hell of a lot of fun. Lastly, I'm thankful to see that game studios (some at least) still care enough to create something that is faithful to its source and not just a cash-in. It would be great if games that were movie tie-ins could also be this polished.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2009"}

Gordon","summary":"Bionic Theft Mercenaries, or \"How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love Chaos\"","reviewText":"The first Just Cause was a somewhat ambitious, but rather flawed open-world game, with a military theme.  Essentially, you played as Rico Rodriguez, a rather obvious parody of an Antonio Banderas-style gunslinger character, given the mission of bringing down the government of a banana republic.  The game was built around the conceit of engaging in crazy stunts, liberating towns and bases, and generally shooting things up in the largest open-world environment in an action game to date.  However, the game was brought down by some glaring issues, not the least of which was that the huge world (essentially an entire island nation) was not only somewhat visually repetitive, but was also a major pain to get around.  Driving from one location to the other using the floaty-feeling vehicles was tough enough, but if you got stranded on foot in the middle of nowhere, things got worse, with near vertical hillsides everywhere blocking your route (not to mention the vast bays and inlets).That being said, I knew the franchise had potential and ambition to spare.  While early rumors indicated the sequel would take place in an oversized version of your typical open-world city environment, these thankfully proved to be unfounded as early development pictures leaked out.  The hype grew and grew in my mind, and as videos were parsed out over time, this looked like it could have been the military action title I had always wanted.  While it didn't turn out quite as perfect as I had dreamed (and that's at least partly my fault due to my unrealistic expectations), the game is truly a major leap in terms of sandbox gaming due to what are the major cornerstones of this game: control, chaos, and scope.  Just Cause 2 does not care about having \"character depth\" and \"compelling story\" bullet-points; rather, the focus is on delivering an over-the-top, unpredictable, adrenaline filled experience, geared towards old-school arcade values, mixed with modern technology and accessibility.What story there is revolves around Rico heading into the island dictatorship of Panau, somewhere in the Asian Pacific, with the mission of finding Tom Sheldon (your boss from the first game), who is suspected of \"going rogue\", after falling out of contact with the Agency.  Of course, things aren't going to be that easy, given that the country's dictator, Baby Panay, doesn't particularly like armed foreigners prancing around the place.  To that end, you have been given new tools: a Bionic Commando-inspired grappling hook \"gauntlet\", that you can deploy at any time with the bress of a button (without having to switch over to it), combined with an infinitely re-deployable parachute.  This combination turns out to be pure genius, as once you get the hang of it, you can essentially keep mobile constantly, by using such techniques as the \"grapple-catapult\" to get yourself airborned, while also using the improved \"stunt\" skills, such as being able to hang onto the front of an occupied jeep (or even an airborne helicopter!), and shoot around the side, as further means to keep the action going.  The vehicles themselves still control a bit rough, but finally have enough weight and feel to them to not be just a \"necessary evil\".All this control comes in handy, as a means to create \"Chaos\", which is the stat that unlocks missions and new weapons.  There are 3 shady \"factions\" for you to work for, and much of the game's mission content involves missions for those factions.  Sadly, the required Agency missions are far too few in number, and as a result, the Faction missions are too essential to the game's content to be considered \"side missions\".  While some of the Faction missions are very simple \"blow this up\" or \"kill that guy\", there are some real standouts, including a mission involving stopping Panau's military space program, a mission located in a base straight out of \"Goldeneye\", and a very bizarre mission on an isolated, storm-wracked island. However, much of the fun in the game simply comes from the constant stream of chaotic destruction that occurs.  Your grapple can link together 2 vehicles, pull enemy soldiers off of high catwalks, or even shoot a line between two soldiers, causing them to get pulled into each other.  Aside from missions, you can cause chaos by \"completing\" settlements by destroying government property and stealing \"upgrade\" boxes (you can gain vehicle, weapons, and armor upgrade points), or by assassinating well-guarded colonels, and there are races for earning cash as well.All of this takes place in a ridiculously huge, and surprisingly varied environment.  There are hundreds of settlements, military bases, and other locations to discover, and to keep things from getting dull, Avalanche made Panau more varied than San Esperito from the last game.  You'll find jungles, deserts, snow-covered mountains, beaches, mangrove deltas, oil rigs, villages, ancient ruins, and a huge metropolis large enough that it sprawls across several small islands.  The graphics are ridiculously colorful, and the lighting can be often described as stupendous.  While things are a bit cartoony, given the huge environment (much bigger than all the Grand Theft Auto games combined, but still smaller than Fuel), I'm more than happy with the way it looks.  Wisely, the developers give you a \"quick trip\" option to any of the named locales on the map you have discovered, although it doesn't open up until you've done a couple of the Faction missions.  And speaking of map issues, unlike San Esperito's endless and confusing sea of green, blue, and brown, Panau is designed in such a way that you'll have a much easier time keeping your bearings, as there's usually a distinctive landmark or vista nearby.As good as the game is, I still have some gripes.  While you can hijack jets and tank-like vehicles, enemy fighter pilots are apparently unable to work the weapons systems, and army drivers don't know how to drive the tanks either (sometimes they'll jump into the gunner's seat of a parked APC at a base, but not much more than that).  For a game centered around military action, this is kind of a major letdown.  In addition, the game could've used more missions, and for whatever reason, Avalanche has decided not to bother with mission expansions via DLC (and even though I generally don't like DLC, I'd pay for a solid, major mission pack for JC2).  There are also still a number of odd bugs floating around the game (such as the infamous \"no civilians\" bug).  Another downer is the overall sparse population of the game environment, although I can see why in terms of cutting down on performance issues.  Finally, to truly displace Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, the game would need much more variety in terms of additional \"side missions\" and ownership of property/vehicles.But overall, this game, while not the \"uber-game\" I was hoping it would be, is still EXTREMELY entertaining.  This takes the \"chaos-creation\" element from the GTA series to a new level, combines it with a military theme, and provides you with the level of control needed to keep things constantly moving.  On the other hand, the game environment is enchanting enough that a mellow, relatively violence-free trip through Panau is worthwhile.  I've put in well over 100 hours into this game, and still feel the need to revisit it.  Hopefully, Just Cause 3 will keep all the good elements, and tweak the weak spots.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2011"}

{"product_name":"B007TYC8MI","description":"","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"Not the best in the series, but still a solid God of War title","reviewText":"God of War: Ascension is a very good game, let's just get that out of the way. If you've never played a God of War game before, Ascension is a good starting point to get a feel for the series in a current generation console. Plus, this is probably the best looking game of the series, right up there with the incredibly vivid graphics showcased in God of War III. However, if you've played the other games in the series, then you'll find little in Ascension that hasn't been done before, and done somewhat better. For those who don't already know, the events in this game predate all the previous games (including Chains of Olympus), taking place not too long after Kratos accidentally whacks his family. The game opens with the white-skinned warrior being enchained and tortured by the Furies, supernatural beings tasked with the duty of ensuring that those who break their oaths to the gods of Olympus receive their just punishments. It's not long before Kratos breaks himself free and begins slaughtering larger than life enemies in the even larger prison he finds himself in, which happens to be built in and on an enormous, multi-armed giant. Putting it simply, this game doesn't skimp on the epic scale and grandiose backdrops so popular in the God of War series (and yes, Gaia is still the narrator).Another thing this game does well was showing Kratos in a more sympathetic light instead of as the purely murderous psycho he was in the other games. While Kratos still has no qualms about ripping his enemies apart into bloody chunks, he's not yet consumed by vengeance and simply wants to free himself from the torment of the Furies. I was afraid this new side of Kratos would prove to be too daunting and unbelievable of a change for our favorite Spartan, but it was all pulled off well and it matches with the story on how and why Kratos becomes the god-killing warrior he eventually turns into. So, don't expect Kratos to be braiding people's hair or twirling around with his arms spread out on grassy hills: he's still the Kratos we all know and love who does away with every enemy who dares to challenge him. On the other hand, the combat isn't quite as satisfying as it was in the previous games. Don't get me wrong, a lot of that classic dismembering goodness so ingrained in the series remains in Ascension, it's just not as varied as I would have liked, and some of the changes feel more like tacked on gimmicks than necessary improvements.Kratos of course still wields his original chained blades, the Blades of Chaos, and while they work pretty much the same as always, there are some new tweaks added to their move sets. First, there's the ability for Kratos to tether/grapple enemies near or far with his blades and from there he can throw smaller enemies around or classically dismember weakened enemies. Then there are the new magic abilities. Instead of acquiring other different kinds of upgradeable weapons and magical abilities to wield alongside his blades, Kratos gains elemental abilities that he channels directly into his blades that slightly change his attack combos and affect enemies in different ways. The elemental abilities are the Fire of Ares, Ice of Poseidon, Lightning of Zeus, and Soul of Hades. These powers work well and certain ones prove more useful against certain enemies. Personally though, I found this setup of almost exclusively using the Blades of Chaos to make combat less varied and just the slightest bit repetitive. I miss the large collections of upgradeable weapons and different types of magic abilities that were in the previous games. A Rage Meter which fills up as Kratos damages enemies and empties when he takes damage temporarily gives him access to more powerful attacks and combos when it's full.Kratos can parry attacks similarly to how he did them in the older games, but in Ascension the parrying is more nuanced and requires much better timing to pull off correctly. Also, Kratos can perform physical attacks (punches, kicks, and ground slams) with the circle button which can sometimes disarm enemies of their weapons, allowing Kratos to temporarily wield and attack with them. He can use swords, spears, shields, clubs, and slings as secondary weapons for a certain amount of time. Sometimes they can be helpful when surrounded by many enemies, but they do have limits to their usefulness. There are also some special items that can be used both in combat and in the game's many puzzle and platforming sections. The Amulet of Uroborus lets Kratos decay or heal certain aspects of the environment that have been previously destroyed such as bridges, giant chains, and platforms in order to advance. Some of the puzzles that revolve around using the amulet can prove rather challenging, but they're doable. The amulet can also be used to target enemies and temporarily suspend them in a state of slow motion. The Oath Stone of Orkos lets Kratos temporarily create a clone/double of himself that can attack enemies, but its chief purpose is to let Kratos be in two places at once so he can go to where he needs to go while simultaneously activating switches and levers that he would not be able to maintain his hold on by himself. Finally, the Eyes of Truth let Kratos remove certain barriers that may be impeding his progress.Platforming has been improved compared to the way it was done in previous God of War games; more specifically, Kratos can climb sheer surfaces much more fluidly just with a few flicks of the left stick. There are also several set-pieces where Kratos uses his blades to slide down cliffs and slopes and you have to keep him from falling or crashing into obstacles. They're basically much more epic and involved versions of the cliff-sliding moments seen in the previous game Ghost of Sparta. As much as I liked the puzzles and platforming in Ascension, I feel there was a little too much emphasis on them. In other words, there were many parts in this game where the combat was somewhat overwhelmed by the much larger amount of puzzles and platforming sections, especially during the first half of the game. Due to this, Ascension's pacing was a little off compared to the older games and I found myself growing a little bored at times with all the jumping around, pulling of levers, and pushing of statues, whereas the previous games had stronger senses of urgency to them and really made you want to keep going (especially God of War II and III). As for the enemies and bosses, there were both pros and cons. Some old enemies like cyclopses, gorgons, chimeras, sirens, Cerberi, goatmen, and moving statues with clubs return to get torn apart by Kratos, but we've also got scorpion-tailed dragons, people possessed by parasitic bugs, and half-human/half-elephant Juggernauts. Again, compared to the previous games, enemy variety is slightly lacking and the challenge level doesn't really ramp up until the last quarter of the game. There are 5 boss fights and while the first three weren't all that challenging, the last two boss fights prove to be quite fun and supremely epic.Quick time events make a return when Kratos kills his enemies or navigates his way through the different environments. As usual, they are done well with just the right combination of challenge and accessibility, although a couple of the prompts appear rather unclear at times, but those are rare. However, I'm curious as to why they did away with the sex mini-games. While I wouldn't call them necessary, they were included in all the previous God of War games, so it's kind of weird to see such a staple of the series suddenly removed from this game. And yes, there is multiplayer in God of War: Ascension, but it's the good kind that doesn't interfere with the single player campaign at all. When you first start the multiplayer with your God of War avatar, you choose which god of Olympus to align yourself with in order to govern your preferred play-style: Ares (warrior), Hades (assassin), Zeus (battle mage), and Poseidon (support). You can battle against other players in several different game modes or you can do co-op or single player matches against A.I. enemies to gain experience and upgrade your abilities, weapons, and armor (and you can change your godly allegiance anytime from the main lobby). You can even customize your avatar's appearance with different colors for your armor and even with different tattoos.I'm not normally that into multiplayer, but what's on offer here is actually pretty interesting and can be a fun distraction if you just want some simple pick-up and play gaming. Still, the single player is clearly the main focus of Ascension. Overall, I enjoyed this game, despite the somewhat more simplified combat and toned down pacing. I should also mention that the story is somewhat less interesting and slightly disjointed since it flashes backwards and forwards a couple of times in the span of 3 weeks, but it still gets your attention. So, if you were hoping for a God of War title that could top God of War III, then you might want to wait until a price drop before getting this game or maybe just rent it to get a feel for it. But, if you love all things God of War or just enjoy the hack and slash genre, then God of War: Ascension is definitely worth looking into.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2013"}

I felt it necessary to perhaps review these titles for all to see.Final Fantasy Tactics was the first world (to my knowledge) where we were introduced to the world of Ivalice. A world that undergoes cataclysm after cataclysm remaking itself in a vicious cycle of doom.The story, I didn't know that games could have stories half as well made as this story was back when I first began playing it. Let alone this well done. The story is a timeless masterpiece that can still take on the best of them and walk away with pride and victory in it's bruised hands. There's almost nothing about the story that makes me say \"Wha?\" (in the sense of spotting a plot hole)The character development (ie the characters that matter) is very well executed, and it's really hard to believe after playing this, that this is a Final Fantasy, so used to the bad plots and characters from that series I am post 6. (9 aside...)The most fun part about the gameplay of course is the tactical aspects. And if you don't like thinking tactically this game is not for you. (Sorry FF7 rabids. You need a brain for this. You just can't spam and expect to come out ontop every time) for me, this is what most Rpgs that are turn based should be going for.Graphically, the game has aged very well, (sprites for the win) which is not all that surprising given the art style.Controls, you open a menu click a button select a square and it's done. Nuff said.If there's one failing of this game that I like to pick on. It's the scaling encounters. First off I dislike random encounters. They ruin immersion for me. Second, I like leveling up to actually you know. Matter. The idea that out there in this world monsters magically become better as I do (the same monsters) is just ubsurd.Bravery and Faith, were stupid but at least the concept \"works\" (sorta) but again, just like random encounters I hate random stats.The menus can get a bit much, as well but they don't detract from the game as much as some people like to whine about (these people are the ones that think characters that can do everything is a good thing so they can just spam ultima or what have you and gg the bbeg).The game with those three faults is still a five star product in my eyes and seeing how long it has been since it was released in my opinion that says alot about the quality put into this game.Damn square, why can't you put out products like this anymore?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"Cute Chihuahua","summary":"GREAT GAME FOR KIDS","reviewText":"This game is a classic.

Stanley \"Viper_29\"","summary":"A great game...but annoying glitches","reviewText":"Well, I have to say that I think this is a amazing game. While no one game out there will please everyone, I think this one will please the majority.To start with, the visual graphics are just simply beautiful. The visual distance is amazing, especially from the scenic view points spread throughout the game. The gameplay is nice for me...I really enjoy the climbing. You can practically climb anything that has a handhole on it.The game plot and storyline are incredible. This is a very deep storyline that helps pull you into the universe of the game.The only reason I didn't feel this game warranted 5 stars was due to the annoying freezes that happen far too often with this game. I have had 4 occasions where it froze, with one freeze happening during the loading screen where you can move your character around with the blue background. I could move him no problem, it is just that the game level never loaded.There are great reviews on here that go into further detail but just be warned that until the update comes out to fix the glitches, this game is great but could be better. After that update, it will no doubt be a must have title for the PS3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00005NZ1J","description":"This super-slick driving game lets players strap into more than 20 licensed cars and compete on more than 300 circuits in cities around the world. In addition, the game boasts 100-plus individual and wheel-to-wheel challenges, an arcade mode, and a four-person multiplayer option. You may want to put your seat back--this could be a long drive. In a unique twist, players are rewarded with a ratings system that scores their style, dexterity, and placement. Throw on the flare, boast your driving skills, and prove your daring side and you'll be rewarded.UnlikeCrazy Taxi's reward scheme,Project Gotham Racingis a true-to-life racing simulation (no bounding from rooftops here). The tracks--located in global centers such as London, Tokyo, New York, and San Francisco--are incredibly detailed, adding a thick layer of realism to the course. The cars are just as nicely rendered, each shining with the gloss of a fresh paint job and driving with the appropriate responses for its particular style.

Sure the story and characters weren't great but the excellent controls, pitch-perfect pacing and outstanding graphics gave you a level of immersion you just don't see in FPS games. Killzone 3 is an even more polished experience that will more than satisfy fans!As with other Killzone games Killzone 3's story is NOT a high point, but it's not bad. The remaining ISA forces (the good guys) from KZ2 are marooned on the Helghast (the bad guys) homeworld and are trying to survive as the Helghast are having their own conflict amongst themselves. The dialogue is a bit better this time around (not as many F-bombs) and it's nice to get some of the Helghst points of view (however bland) but I would've preferred just sticking with Sev and Rico's struggle to survive and save their ISA comrades. As with Killzone 2 the scenes switching between first and third person perspectives during gameplay to cutscenes are well-staged.The gameplay and game-pacing in Killzone 3 is what really shines and makes this game a must play! I wasn't sure I was going to like the smoothed out controls as I felt the heavier feeling ones from Killzone 2 really added to the excitment of the game. Of course I was wrong and the smoother controls strike an excellent balance between heavy and responsive. The vehicles and especially the jetpacks also strike the same balance and make you really feel like a person on the front-lines. The one-button melee kill is also a welcome addition (though is sometimes hard to time with the button prompts). The level-pacing is just as perfect as it was in Killzone 2 with some slower (sometimes stealth) bits building up the tension to some wild and fun-as-hell firefights.The graphics in Killzone 3 are the best I've seen in a PS3 game. Every environmental detail is perfectly animated and responsive and the diversity of environments this time around keeps things interesting as you play.The one and only big draw-back for Killzone 3 is it's campaign length. Killzone 2 had an excellent campaign that lasted between eight and ten hours on the standard difficulty. I beat Killzone 3 in less than six. I realize the multiplayer crowd will get a lot more than that but for us single-player gamers this is a let-down.Killzone 3 is a terrific game that will easily satisfy Killzone and FPS fans. The short length of the campaign is disappointing when compared to Killzone 2 but the levels are fun enough you'll enjoy playing through them again on higher difficulties. This maybe just a rental for some people but any shooter fans will be entertained from beginning to end.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001PKHRUK","reviewerName":"DryvBy","summary":"Uncaged, but caged after you're done playing.","reviewText":"For Wolverine's first stand alone game in a long time, Wolverine holds nothing back. It's action packed, gory, and full of generic Wolverine humor. It almost feels like a God of War or Devil May Cry clone, but falls short in few factors.If you're followed the movie, you'll pretty much know the story. Wolverine has a dark past set in Africa, where his crew of United States mutant marines are looking for \"something\". The game follows close to the movie, enough where it borrows part of the script word-for-word. You'll even run into the same boss fights Wolverine encounters in the film. Does it work? Overall, yeah, it works pretty well. Does it make it a good story? Not really.The game play is very similar to God of War. Wolverine runs into waves of enemies, most with their own abilities, and you mash button combos to kill them in a fury of blood and limbs. The gore is pretty outrageous, too. You can cut off limbs, heads, and actually pick people up to rip them in half. Wolverine himself runs into a gory mess too. As bullets or machete's slice into him, you'll see battle damage appear, and slowly heal over time. If you're into that sort of thing, it's pretty gritty, even if it's the same thing over and over again.Wolverine has three basic attacks: light, heavy, and grab attacks. His claws are his only weapon for all of these attacks, unless you count the use of select pieces of environment. You'll also receive upgrades through XP received from killing enemies, completing quest, or finding hidden secrets. These upgrades range from upgrading your maximum health to doing more damage with a special attack. With a special attack, you drain a rage meter located directly under your health bar. While in rage mode, you'll have access to a couple of special attacks such as a spin attack or berserker mode for extra damage and health regeneration. Another mode would be Wolverine's feral vision, which allows you to see where to go next and spot the breakable items or enemies.The types of enemies are limited. You'll fight off several tribesmen, several special marines, and then a few other characters. It's a bit unrealistic in this age to think there would be more than you're typical hack-and-slash action game. The few characters that got old really fast were the bosses. They just lacked variety, and they were really easy. They just took a bit too long to kill. Some of them lead to cheap deaths, especially the final boss. You'll fall off the map more than once, thanks to several glitches.The game features a host of glitches. The most annoying glitch is one that prevents you from loading the game because you have a download in the background. This causes the game to crash, resulting in a lost signal to your television. To fix it, you just need to pause or cancel the downloads, then load the game. The other glitches may cause you to die in the game, but mostly they're graphically faults.If it doesn't bother you that the game is repetitive, then you'll be happy to know the game is fairly lengthy with several enemies to kill throughout. The levels aren't too badly designed, but they'll get tiresome since some require a bit of back traveling. The game isn't overall horrible, and for a game based on a movie, it's not half bad. But towards the end, you'll crave for the ending more than a chance for a second playthrough.+ Loads of gore.+  Decent gameplay.- Very repetitive.-  Glitches, glitches, glitches.Recommendation: Rent","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2011"}

This game adds absolutely nothing to the Silent Hill series, not to mention is definitely inferior to the original Playstation Silent Hill.  Why this game was even created is a mystery to me.  Why the developers thought Origins was fun enough to actually play the way it currently is, is another big mystery.  Silent Hill Origins is definitely NOT a fun game to play.This game has no atmosphere whatsoever.  So what, you're running around dark rooms and hallways most of the time.  Where's the creepy soundtrack that makes your hair stand up on the back of your neck?  It's there *sometimes* but not nearly as much as other SH games.The main character has an ability to punch enemies to death.  It's fun, and probably the only reason to come back to this game.The storyline is decent too, so the game isn't completely horrible.  A huge part of the gameplay is finding these mirrors where you can switch dimensions between the \"oddly uncomfortable\" environments to the \"deadly and terrifying\" otherworld.  It's a fun idea at first but gets old in a hurry once you realize you're doing it so often that it starts becoming a chore more than an interesting surprise.This game is just sooooo boring compared to the original Silent Hill.  THAT game had interesting environments, exciting enemies to fight, the creepiest locations of the series, and a noticeably more suspenseful soundtrack.Silent Hill Origins doesn't feature most of the things that made Silent Hill so good many years ago, and this is just a terrible game as far as gameplay is concerned.  I can walk around my basement not fighting anything in the dark too.  Doesn't mean it's fun, and doesn't mean it's scary.

There were many elements in the 3rd one that left me feeling disappointed.**SPOILER ALERTS!**First off, had I have known that the co-op option was only available for users with a paid Live! membership, I would've purchased the PS3 version instead. I think it would have been fun to try the co-op mode.The graphic engine is unreal like no other; the environments, the character modeling, the breaths of air, everything is superb. The audio for it was well done too, and it was totally rocking with a 5.1 soundbar system.The new weapon upgrade system that was implemented had potential, but I found it to be rather clunky for the original purpose. Instead of designing multiple weapons, I stuck with 2 frames that were able to essentially allow me to carry 4 weapons simultaneously. Once you acquire 2 heavy elite frames, you can do just the same. You can swap out the weapons in the frame without having to lose the parts - they're salvageable continuously. The tips for each weapon contained within the frame are what change its behavior, and the upgrade chips help a lot.The salvage bots that you can use in conjunction with the workbench were a hit and miss. You slowly will acquire up to 3 bots in the gameplay, and obtaining materials is very scarce, causing you to use your ammo wisely. There were times where I had to run around with the electric hammer because I ran out of ammo, or even just flat out ran past mobs.When mobs were triggered by events in the game, it became very frustrating rather quickly. Instead of being attacked by 1-3 necromorphs, I'd get attacked by 6-10 simultaneously. This became rather tedious considering that my weapons were not up to par at various points, and I had to set the difficulty to easy just to make it past them. I detested the fights with necromorphs that were indestructible - it reminded me of the undead elites that were in various Resident Evil games. It was hard to enjoy the horror element of the game because it felt overly emphasized by the amount of necromorphs that spawned each time. There were certain chapters that really portrayed the horror part of the game rather well, by they were few and far in between. It didn't feel like a horror game overall, but more of a shooter frenzy game like Resident Evil became.The love story between Isaac and Ellie was dreadful. After 2, they dated, and then broke up. Ellie moves on and starts dating this other guy, and Isaac just seems like a soulless corpse chasing after this woman that has fallen in love with another man. Isaac acts like a puppet, and follows the commands of whoever is over the commlink. It was disappointing to not see any traces of Isaac's memory of Nicole, especially since the marker taunted him with her memories in 1 & 2. I wish Ellie would have died early in the game, at least it would've given Isaac motivation for doing what he was enduring. I mean, if my girlfriend broke up with me, and moved on with another man, why would I go out of my way to save her? It felt overly forced and cliche.The story involving the marker, the aliens, and the brother moon was ok. The ending leads me to believe that there will be a 4th one, if not 5 and 6 to follow as well. I'm afraid that EA will take it to the next step and repeat Capcom's mistake with Resident Evil by making countless sequels when it should have ended with the 3rd. If a 4th release of Dead Space is released, I'll highly consider borrowing it from a friend rather than purchasing it. I'm the kind of gamer that plays a game because I enjoy feeling a connection with the main character and his influence within the game, and this one missed the mark for the me.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2013"}

Strong voice acting and direction, but a shallow exploration of any of the key players. It's well told via player-driven progression and cutscenes, and is certainly enjoyable, just incredibly short. Which leads me to my next bullet point....(+/-) Several side missions are included for padding. They're fun to play through and can be tackled in a variety of ways. However, and egregiously, they're not unlocked until after you have completed the main story. Why the designers chose to gate this content behind the requirement to first complete the core narrative is beyond me. They should have spent extra time to somehow cook these into the game - if that meant expanding the size of the sandbox, fine, whatever. All together there's about 6-7 hours of content here, less if you rush or ignore the PlayStation exclusive operation. A bit more for completionists aiming to complete every challenge. In my opinion restricting immediate access to the side missions was a terrible decision because....Game Play(+) The first open world setting for a Metal Gear game, and it doesn't disappoint. You're free to roam the military base setting as you please, hurting or helping, investigating clues, discovering secrets, eavesdropping on guards, calling in helicopter extractions, or just enjoying the view. This would have improved the first-playthrough enjoyment of the game considerably if the side missions were not gated(+/-) The controls are tight, the interface top notch, and the stealth mechanics are still some of the best in the genre. Unfortunately it's all hampered by occasionally wonky AI and forced animations. I found myself lining up shots and firing sleeping darts into guards' faces - only to watch as they proceeded through lengthy animations and dialogs. Once they finished, often around 5 seconds later, they would fall over asleep while miraculously alerting the base of my presence. Soldiers arriving on a scene after a fire fight would stop and exclaim (\"HUH!??!\") at every single body or sleeping guard they happened upon. Though rare, hitches like this do make the game feel messy and lazy at times, taking you right out of any immersion the open world helped buildPresentation(+) Excellent presentation value. the overall art design from Metal Gear Solid 4 is clearly influential here. Vivid 1080p visuals with overall high res textures and character models - all running at a fluid and eye pleasing 60 FPS. Great audio with clever use of surround sound. Good (not great) environmental effects. All that said, one can still tell it's clearly a cross generational game. While it makes fair use of the PS4's power, being greater visually than PS3 or 360 titles, no one would accuse it of being bleeding edgeThis was really close to a 3 star rating for me. If we could give partial ratings I'd have gone with a 3 1/2. I decided to go with 4 stars because despite its length it is a lot of fun, I enjoyed the story telling, and though much of the content is gated it does add to replayability.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2014"}

Hoover \"chicagojosh\"","summary":"Great Game With Tons of Future Potential","reviewText":"It took my having to read a half dozen gaming reviews before I decided to buy this game. I'm not in any way disappointed.The entire plot device for each of the four cases is text based, but the humor and anime inspired graphics support a style of gampeplay that can grab your attention and keep it.There is some mental adjustment you might need to make. The first case is meant to help you understand the gameplay, and the difficulty doesn't truly get to full steam until about 1/4 of the way through the second case.Once you've adjusted, you're in for a treat. Every clue you come across, every name mentioned, and every minute detail presented will make you want to store it in your long-term memory in case it turns into a vital clue during the court proceedings.There were times where I would get frustrated with how the \"legal process\" played out, with the overly submissive judge and backhanded actions of the prosecution, but this just speaks to how impressive the script writing is. I never felt they were just being lazy, it was just a part of the Phoenix Wright world.You are able to quick save, with only a few points where you are not allowed. I would find myself randomly saving, since you are unable to speed through dialogue the first time you are presented it. Therefore, if you lose your case near the end of the proceedings and are forced to go back to the beginning, you're looking at a lot of time being forced to sit and wait for dialogue to finish scrolling. While this can indeed be cumbersome, it makes you learn to take your time and think through everything instead of just randomly guessing at what the key piece of evidence is.While the four cases will take up plenty of your time, the re-playability is definitely limited. I would love to see future installments have some way of actually downloading new cases, either through Wii24Connect or even going to a local download point.Phoenix Wright shows just how amazing a game can be without having to worry about high octane graphics or seeing how many enemies the developers can fling at you. I fully plan on going out and buying the first Phoenix Wright game after I complete this one. As far as I'm concerned, this is a DS must have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2007"}

{"product_name":"B001IK1BWC","reviewerName":"Steven","summary":"A very important game for this genre. A tactical RPG at its finest!","reviewText":"[--- If you have never played Baldur's Gate (PC version, not console it's completely different), Baldur's Gate 2 or Icewind Dale please read this review ---]First, I'll review this game, then I will explain the annoying tag above.Dragon Age: Origins is a very important game in a couple respects. First, publisher EA has taken a lot of flack recently for publishing and producing repetitive shovelware, employing annoying DRM schemes and absorbing competition. EA did a good thing publishing this game and just allowing Bioware to do what they do best - develop amazing RPGs. This is also an important game because Bioware is giving their best effort to pull out the defibrillators and save the life of the tactical RPG genre.When I first heard about this game I remember Bioware saying that this game was going to be the spiritual successor to the Baldurs Gate series. My first thought was 'yeah right!'. There just hasn't been anything amazing in the way of tactical RPGs lately. After playing this game I take back what I thought earlier - this is exactly that. If you enjoyed games like Planescape, Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale, etc then you are the target audience. Dragon Age is a modern version of this genre done right. If you are new to this genre then Dragon Age is an excellent start. It's great for the veterans of the genre but it's also good about holding your hand in case you are new to tactical RPGs.Bioware really has a winning formula here. You get great pause, plot, play action just like Baldurs Gate, you get very interesting and refreshing dialog with a dark sense of humor like Planescape, you also get an epic story and the sense of real emotion just like Mass Effect.Instead of digging into the story I'll leave that for you to discover. However, I will say that the story in Dragon Age is very dynamic and engaging!The production values of this game are through the roof. Excellent voice work, excellent music and excellent atmosphere. I've seen some nit-pickers complain about graphics but these guys are really missing something here. There are more to graphics then just textures - I'm far more interested in atmosphere and as far as atmosphere is concerned Dragon Age hits a grand slam.Dragon Age reminds me of Planescape in a big way. I think it's the way this game just bleeds personality.This game is to Tactical RPGs what World of Warcraft is to MMORPGs (No, I'm not comparing these games, just development strategy). Love it or hate it WoW is so successful because they took all the best aspects of the MMORPG genre and implemented them while ditching everything else that just didn't work. Dragon Age did the same - for example - Baldurs Gate is an amazing game but one of it's biggest strengths came with annoyances. Micromanaging your troops is fun but in Baldurs Gate it became annoying at times. Dragon Age helps rid this problem by keeping your party size more manageable (4) and having a very intuitive \"Tactic\" system that lets you define how each character reacts in a battle situation.I HIGHLY recommend learning how to use the tactics interface in this game, it really adds a new layer.Although D&D; has its place, it's just not accessible for the more casual player. Dragon Age uses a much more simplified ruleset that is focused on pure fun. It is easy enough for the more casual RPG player to get into yet deep enough to keep the hardcore players satisfied. This is another example of Bioware simplifying things for the better. In short, the whole game is focused on having fun, not on a niche market like D&D.; This was a brilliant move on Biowares end.My views towards EA haven't been so great lately but if they continue to produce ground-breaking titles like Dragon Age then those views very well could change. Dragon Age is certainly a step in the right direction! In some ways I like it better then the old classics!I never thought Bioware could create an epic that equals or surpasses their own Mass Effect and yet somehow they did. I also never thought there would be a tactical RPG that comes even close to Baldurs Gate and now there is. I've been waiting for this day for many years!I really hope this game catches on so we see more titles like this in the future. If this game doesn't succeed then no tactical RPG ever will. That's why this game is so important.----So, what makes this genre so great? I just want to explain the idea behind this genre because it's often misunderstood. I'll keep this short...When you play this game at first it seems as though the pause-command-unpause idea is just a gimmick that slows down gameplay. This is usually when people will think games like this suck. a lot of times players at first will just randomly charge after enemies one-by-one, die a bunch (which is why a patch was released to tame normal), get frustrated and think this game sucks.Really, this game is more like a game of chess (especially on nightmare difficulty) and less of a hack-n-slash Diablo style RPG with a party. You really have to learn to analyze the battlefield and learn to come up with a strategy for the situation at hand. Maybe you could have your ranger sit back and pick of enemies while a mage and supporting warrior engage a few bad guys on a left flank while you move another warrior to the right flank. This is just a lame scenario - there are many more interesting scenarios and strategies in the real game. Soon enough you will be managing your characters effortlessly - commanding them around the battlefield, employing different strategies for each battle that lies ahead. Don't just attack everything as a group - learn to move around the field and play it to your advantage. Once you learn how to do this you will understand why games like this are so darn fun!Over time you will fly through hot-keys and control a battlefield effortlessly - you will learn how to control your characters as individuals, as teams, as groups of 3 or 4. Each battle becomes another puzzle and there are many ways to handle each one! Have fun discovering how to control your group! I've seen too many people give up before the fun really starts, and thus the source of a lot of poor reviews on here and the reason why tactical RPGs of are often misunderstood.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2009"}

There are other fun things trying all these games out - seeing the difference between some of the earlier genesis games to the later ones.  Just look at the graphics with phantasy star 2 compared to phantasy star 4, for example.If you do not like spending the time and energy on RPGs, that is something to consider before buying this.  But, there is still plenty to enjoy ignoring the phantasy star collection, especially for a retail price of 20 bucks.Overall, the graphics and gameplay have held up well - these are mostly 16 bit games, so a jump ahead from NES fare.

But, there were a lot of great exclusive, and reworked genesis games that made the segs cs worth owning..games such as THE TERMINATOR, FINAL FIGHT CD, SONIC CD, ANDROID ASSULT,  made this a winner.  combined with huge genesis library as well as the cd games...it made the genesis a powerhouse.  however sega neglected, and poorly promoted its  superior add on, and made way for the sega saturn system..which ws a great system in its own right.the sega cd, was never given a real chance..it deserved better.  its still popular with game collectors today.  i got my front loading model last year  at a classic gaming store for 40 dollars mint.  and its worth it.in the age of the Playstation 3, Xbox360 , and even the wii  sega games are still fun and sction packed.  i have all the next gen systems and sometimes i find that playing the genesis or any other classic are more fun. why?  because the empathsis was on fun and quality games period.still love the old sega tagline..GENESIS DOES WHAT NINTENDO'NT","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2009"}

Complaints including overheating, disc scratching, lack of consoles, etc. All these can be expected with any console launch. Has anyone forgotten the PS2 launch?? So I've finally gotten my 360 and I must say, it's well worth the $400 price tag.The games I've played so far definitely look noticeably better than the previous generation even on my standard non-HD TV. All the games I've played so far pretty much make Halo 2 (one of the best looking games of the previous generation) look pretty dated. The wireless controllers are very nice and as you'll often hear are probably the best designed video game controllers ever. The system design is great and the white actually looks quite nice. But the true meat of the system and what I truly love and I'm sure everyone else as well is the Xbox Live. The entire Xbox Live system is simply fantastic. The integration, the features, the ease of use and everything else. Everything is just so perfectly integrated. It's also so easy to just go download the latest demos or videos and immediately try before you buy (which can either help you save or spend a lot of money). The one gripe I have with the system is the noise, but it's expected due to the required cooling and you pretty much get used to it. This is truly the next generation and it's here now.

I've been resisting buying a 360 for a while (mostly because of hardware reliability concerns) but recently purchased the elite console.  Now that I've done it I can't believe I waited this long--I'm enjoying gaming immensely, have barely scratched the surface of Xbox live, and have linked the console to my Windows Media Center PC and am messing around with the many capabilities there as well.  I own (and love) a Wii and have nothing against Sony, but I'm very impressed with the XBox 360.FIRST, THE CONSOLE: The XBox 360 features amazing graphics and an enormous library of games that, as of the time of this writing, dwarfs those of the PS3 and Wii.  Initially I was concerned that the PS3 would perform better, but from what I've read and seen it seems the framerate and graphical capability of the XBox is at least equal to the PS3, though I have no desire to argue the point because I think they're both great machines.  My reason for choosing the XBox had more to do with game selection, really, and in that the XBox excels.GAMES:  The XBox's library of games is unparalleled right now.  There are many incredible XBox exclusive titles, from the obvious Halo 3 to games like Bioshock, Forza 2, and Gears of War (and this is a very small sampling of what's actually out there).  I'm not impressed with the PS3's game library, and while I couldn't live without my Nintendo franchises like Zelda, Mario, and Metroid I'm finding myself craving more games beyond the party type games (which the Wii is great for) and Nintendo's own titles.XBOX LIVE:  The Xbox's online community is second to none right now, and while I can see promise for both Sony and Nintendo in this area neither system offers as much as the XBox does at the time of this writing.  Aside from the enormous and well-established community, the XBox live marketplace offers classic games, TV shows, and movies for download, as well as game trailers and demos and a whole lotta other stuff.  I love being able to download so many demos of games I might like to try--it saves on some rental fees for sure--and I'm looking forward to picking up some classic games like Contra and the incredible Castlevania: Symphony of the Night soon.  I wouldn't say the classic game library rivals Nintendo's Virtual Console yet (not even close, really), but there are some great games nonetheless.THE HARDWARE:  The XBox elite is black, which I personally prefer to the white.  It has an HDMI port and comes with a cord, so it's capable of full 1080p HD.  I also love the 120 GB hard drive--though I've never been one to fill a game console's hard drive it's nice to know I have the space, and with all the game demos and other things I've been downloading it may become a possibility.  The Elite also functions as a DVD player with upconverting capability, and the quality I get from playing a DVD on my XBox is incredible, so much so that I'm not using my old DVD player anymore for regular DVDs.Hardware reliability has been a concern, and was something that really held me back for a while.  Following were a couple of my major concerns and this is how the Xbox 360 has handled them:-Noise.  My 360 is much quieter than many reviews led me to believe.  My wife doesn't know its on unless she's in the same room.-Heat.  This was a big one for me.  I don't have space to keep the console upright--it has to be on its side--and I've heard horror stories of overheating after very little play.  The console has about 18 inches behind it for ventilation and seems to run just fine, though I haven't had it on for more than about 3 hours at a time.  There's a lot of heat coming out the back of it but the console itself doesn't seem to heat up much.  When it's really hot outside I keep an upright fan blowing the general direction of my TV (where the Xbox is) and plan on getting a cooling system just to be safe, but so far heat has not really been an issue for me.-Ruining discs - I've heard of the console scratching discs beyond playability and also of cracking.  My console lays on its side and I don't move it while a disc is playing, and so far I've had no issues, though I haven't used it enough to say it will never happen.-Red Ring of Death - Again, no problems yet.  The 3 year warranty helps, though the prospect of not having the thing for a couple months while they fix it brings my blood almost to a boil just thinking about it.Overall I'm tremendously happy with my XBox 360, and my only real concern with it is the potential for hardware failure.  Still, this is a great machine, and definitely worth the price tag for me.  I'm disappointed that wireless capability was not included in the console (it's a pretty expensive add-on), since both the Wii and the PS3 have that built in.  Since I have an HD TV I'd love to have a built in HD-DVD player, but I think it was a wise choice not to force it upon people who don't want it by building it into the machine.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2007"}

Functions as it should and have not had an issue.The base unit looks dumb, it's 2 wires wrapped around a wire binder of sorts with a USB stick just jutting straight up, however that said it keeps the wires tidy and has a good amount of cable to do the job so function over looks and it wins.I have a large head, very large head apparently as my hat fits on other peoples heads with room for several sets of fingers- and this thing fits no problem, it's comfy.I cannot comment on my ear size but the headset doesn't bother me even during decently long gaming sessions, if you need to take the headset off or give your ears a rest the cups will rest on your shoulders down so it's less like a neck brace and the mic folds up completing the comfortable feel.Battery life and range:I've only had it a week but I can say the batt life seems solid, I think one time I was surprised it was already dead but likely had to do with me using it most of the day and not realizing it. How so? Well I was listening to music while doing some work, then household chores 3-4 rooms away and not only was  there not any kind of disconnect issues but I was easily able to adjust the volume for when a louder song came on instead of having to run back to my room  to change a setting on my PC.Perhaps I'm easily impressed with this because I'm new to wireless headsets but I cannot deny the quality of sound, the comfort and the ease of use even when not sat at the computer. The headset is simply brilliant and if you want one for gaming, for music about the house, this thing will do the job and do it damn well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0065NP39E","description":"","reviewerName":"Kristin","summary":"A Great Game if You Love Fallout!","reviewText":"I really really like this game. According to Steam, I played it for 194 hours on one play through. I'm sure I could have played through again if I wanted.I got it because I tried Fallout 3 and really enjoyed it. Sure there were some drawbacks and negatives, but overall it was a good experience. This game plays a lot like Fallout 3, as in pretty much exactly the same. All the old familiar stuff is there, the Pipboy, the interface, etc. There's a companion wheel this time around which makes things slightly more convenient.My complaints about Fallout 3, that being a limited number of types of foes and the fact that most of your foes seem to have a limited number of faces so they kind of mostly look the same. What I really liked was a nice big map, lots of quests, lots to do. Sure you can run through and do the main quest, but I took my time getting to that and instead ran around outside New Vegas hitting a lot of the side quests.Another cool thing is they have all these different factions. Powder Gangers, Boomers, Fiends, Great Khans, Kings, NCR, Brotherhood of Steel, Caesar's Legion just to name a few. They range on a scale of pretty darn evil to good with flaws. There's no real black and white with any of the groups though, its just good people who do bad things or bad people who do things for what they think are good reasons, etc. You can try and juggle all of them, you can alienate all of them, or you can form alliances, break alliances and do whatever you want. They have a reputation feature which is a new thing and it affects how a given group perceives and behaves toward you. Whether they love you, tolerate you or open fire the moment they see you. A nice way around that (sometimes) is that you can dress up as a member of the other faction and possibly fool them in case they aren't very happy with you.One thing I had to get used to was the fact that on any single run through, you can NOT do all the quests because choosing one path may cancel out an entire tree of quests while exposing you to a different one. This is especially true for the end in which you have to make choices about how you want for things to go down. This is nice not only because it really adds weight to the choices you make as you play, but if you are so inclined to play through a different way next time, you may find yourself being exposed to a few quests that you didnt see the other time.Its a nice big open world that you can explore however you want which I love. The graphics are not terrible, not exactly cutting edge either, they worked for me. I would highly recommend this game though. I think I paid less than $20 and for the amount of gameplay it gave me just on the 1 run through, it was more than worth it.There's a few little bugs here and there that I encountered, but nothing major. Overall the game is a big winner and I highly recommend it, especially if you like open world games or are a fan of previous Fallout games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2012"}

Discover the true origins of Dracula and the Belmont family in this exciting first episode of the saga.","reviewerName":"T. Sparks","summary":"One of the best Castlevanias yet","reviewText":"\"Lament of Innocence\" is one of those games you have to get into.  When I first started playing it, I was disappointed; the weapon/magic systems just aren't as deep and complex as Symphony of the Night, or even Aria of Sorrow.  Once I accepted that the game WASN'T going to be another Symphony, though, I learned to love it on its own merits.This game isn't so much about exploration as it is combat.  That being said, let me explain:Combat is easy to pick up and combos easy to string together.  If there's one thing I hate about fighting/melee games, it's the complex combo systems, but Lament of Innocence keeps it simple and to the point.  The sub-weapon system works equally well, but my only complaint is that the pink orb/Cross combo is too effective.  I found myself relying on it way too much and scarcely looked at the other orb/weapon combinations.Leon Belmont is easy to manuever about, and he also has some nifty dodge attacks.  My only complaint about movement/weapon selection is the real-time menu; it's stupid that you can't select your weapons on the pause menu.  This means that you'll be struggling to heal yourself in the middle of combat if you don't have the menus set up exactly as you want them.  A pain, to be sure.  The fixed camera rarely gets in the way, but you'll occassionally find yourself striking blindly at enemies that you've driven into the corner.The graphics and the atmosphere are perfect for the game; several times, I just stopped to look around, especially in the House of Sacred Remains and Ghostly Theater.  Level design gets repetitive, but remember, the game is all about combat.  The enemy design is also somewhat repetitive (there's about three differnt types of Cyclopses, etc.).  Some of the enemies are spectacular, though; the Forgotten One absolutely amazed me.  Music is deep and engaging throughout the entire game; I wish that I could get my hands on the soundtrack.However, the main thing that drives a game for me is the story.  I'm willing to overlook some gameplay considerations of I think that the story is good, and this is where Castlevania really succeeds.  My revealing only a little of the overall story at a time, the game successfully kept me hooked.  And the scene where Leon and Sara are reunited and the events that follow--I personally think that's one of the best scenes in video gaming history.  I won't say anymore, you'll have to play for yourself.Basically, don't rank this game as a follow-up to Symphony of the Night, because it's not.  Don't dismiss it as a Devil May Cry rip-off, either; I, personally, liked it much better than Capcom's horror title.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2003"}

It was the beginning of a new era- the Cold War.October 16, 1962. The President of the United States received word   that the Soviet Union had deployed nuclear missiles in Cuba. The world    trembled in fear as the prospect of nuclear war loomed ever closer.   After days of tense negotiations, the Soviets finally agreed on the 28th   to withdraw their missiles from Cuban soil. With the resolution of this   incident, later to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it    seemed that humanity had survived yet another threat to its existence.However, there was a secret condition in the deal that put an end to   the crisis. Nokolai Stepanovich Sokolov, a Soviet scientist who had   defected    to the West, was to be sent back to the Soviet Union. The U.S.   government agreed to this stipulation, and returned Sokolov back to his   native    land. Little did they know that Sokolov was to be the designer of a   nightmarish weapon. Now, with Sokolov back in their hands, the Soviets    are ready to resume its development. If this weapon is completed, it   will mark the beginning of a new age of fear.August 1964. Realizing at last the urgency of the situation, the CIA   forms a plan to recapture Sokolov. They dispatch the covert FOX unit    to Sokolov's research facility, located to the south of the great   Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero,   FOX is a    next-generation special-forces unit that operates both as a   specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit.

The next-generation of fighting has been built exclusively for the PlayStation 4 and XBOX ONE by the team behind the critically-acclaimed Fight Night franchise.Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology,EA SPORTS UFCbrings the action, emotion and intensity inside the Octagon to life in ways that were never before possible. The next-generation of True Player Motion not only showcases the diverse, powerful and fluid of attacks of elite mixed martial artists through Precision Movement, Dynamic Striking and Strategic Submission Battles, but also brings the combatants to life with Full Body Deformation and Real-Time Exertion. The simulation of Human Intelligence takes leaps forward with the strategic and adaptive MMAi system and is expressed through the most realistic characters ever created in a sports game.Feel the Fight &ndash; Gameplay FeaturesStep into the Octagon with the most realistic take on fighting ever achieved. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology, every fighter, strike, takedown and submission will make you feel the fight.&bull;MMAi&ndash; A mixed martial artist&rsquo;s mind is as important as his heart. Every licensed fighter in the game will have changing goals and fight plans, based on their real-life tendencies and each fight situation. Stop their Plan A, and they will adapt to Plan B or C. Down on the scorecards, look for the AI to end the fight with a knockout or a submission. A smarter opponent equals a more challenging and unpredictable fight.&bull;Full Body Deformation&ndash; Until now, simulation of physical contact between fighters was limited to bodies that barely made contact with each other; as a result, they looked and behaved like action figures made of plastic rather than elite athletes. The team that revolutionized sports by bringing authentic physics to the Fight Night franchise changes the game again with an all-new, full-body deformation system that moves and displaces the fighter&rsquo;s flesh in real time. For the first time, the strength of every submission and power of every strike will truly make an impression.&bull;Real-Time Exertion&ndash; A UFC bout is one of the most physically demanding sports on the planet requiring mixed martial artists to give it their all with every movement. Real-Time Exertion brings each moment of that action to life in your gameplay experience. Through real-time vein popping, skin discoloration, muscle flex, as well as signs of fatigue setting in through the course of each round, you will witness the effort it takes to be one of the best fighters in the world.&bull;Fighter Likeness and Facial Animations&ndash; EA SPORTS UFC will set a new bar for character likeness and emotion in gaming. For the first time in an EA SPORTS game, every single licensed athlete in the game has been created from high resolution 3D head and body scans to deliver revolutionary character likeness and authenticity. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, new facial animation technology delivers more expression, emotion and will communicate greater sense of awareness and intelligence in the Octagon.&bull;Precision Movement&ndash; MMA is a sport of inches, where every step counts and every movement matters.  Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, the Precision Movement locomotion system grounds the fighters, eliminating unrealistic slipping and sliding across the canvas. More realistic physics-driven movement delivers more realistic action as the overall transfer of energy from the ground up delivers more impactful and believable strikes and takedowns.&bull; Dynamic Striking&ndash; A mixed martial artist uses the environment to his advantage and for the first time in a UFC game, you can too. A dynamic environment allows you to pull off jaw-dropping moves using the Octagon, including roundhouse kicks, superman punches and much more. Combine those abilities with the best striking technology in the industry and that one perfect strike could change the fight.&bull;Strategic Submission Battles&ndash; To own the belt, you have to be dominant on your feet and on the mat.  EA SPORTS UFC re-invents the ground game to create a battle for position and control that captures the strategy of a submission battle. Like the real sport, in EA SPORTS UFC fighters will work through multiple stages as they work to advance or escape from a fight-ending submission.&bull;Real Damage&ndash; Every fighter knows that one good shot can ruin your day.  EA SPORTS UFC introduces a non-linear damage system which can result in big damage coming from a single strike. The system produces a greater variety of cuts and contusions that is true-to-life and has never been possible in a simulation fighting game.","reviewerName":"If_is_good_can't_b_bad \"Raul\"","summary":"The Bruce lee code was sent to your email amazon account","reviewText":"For those of you that can not find the Bruce Lee code look on your amazon email account, they sent you the code in a previous email.

InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"C.

The levels are the best seen recently in a game, and the towns look very realistic! The enemy soldiers have cool reaction just as in Allied Assault. They play cards, get drunk, and have fights over each other. Quite an experience to see! The only problem with the game is the floppy controls, and for a while any junkie of Allied Assault will be confused until they learn. The missions are very fun, and they have great replay value!

I was hoping for more of the same from FNV and it pretty much delivered. While much is the same there have been some changes. The graphics have apparently been improved, although I didn&#8217;t really notice any difference (it looks a bit creaky by today&#8217;s standards, but is better than some from the same period). But the main changes relate to gameplay. F3 managed a perfect balance between RPG and shooter. For me, FNV leans a little too far in favour of the role-playing elements. There&#8217;s less combat and what combat there is isn&#8217;t quite as much fun as it was in F3. Also the main story is less engaging, with emphasis placed on the alliances you forge with the various factions along the way. I enjoyed this aspect of the game but would&#8217;ve liked more meat on the main storyline. That having been said all the elements that made F3 so good are still here. The Mohave Desert is another huge open world waiting to be explored. There are numerous quests to be enjoyed, and all the immersive qualities are still there.A quick note about bugs: F3 was a bit buggy but FNV takes the cake on this score. In the 120 hours I spent playing the game it must have crashed 50 times or more. Save games fail to load as do maps on occasion. I even had a couple of NPCs go missing, one of which was a quest-giver (a side quest luckily). So be forewarned: it can be frustrating at times.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2013"}

In fact, it was nifty enough for me to pick this up out of the bargain bin and take it home.Thats when I played the game, and instantly regretted the $10 I had just lost. Truth is there is no way the developers looked at the final product and went, \"Yes. This is exactly what we envisioned. It's Perfect And Without Flaw.\"Now, the game is technically playable. But realistically it is so broken that it's just not worth your time and/or money.The biggest issue is not the halfway-there stage layouts which are chock full o' pointless and distant dead ends, the terrible dialogue, and the \"Well, We Tried\" PS2 worthy graphics. It's the fact that the enemy AI is literally retarded. Enemies walk into walls, run around in circles, fire sporadically, sometimes notice you while you're a mile a way and can't see them and sometimes are blissfully unaware that you are right in front of them. If you get a car thrown at you, you have a 50/50 chance that it will kill you instantly or not hurt you at all regardless of whether it actually hits you or not. Most of your time spent playing this game will have you wondering \"What The Hell Is Going On?\" Not to worry. The game doesn't know either.Sure there's nfity gun upgrades, and some \"somewhat useful\" magic (that is a huge pain to use), which helps the game be fun for like 5 minutes... or until you realize that it's not going to get any better.It's sort of a shame because you can definitely see a really cool game that just needed a little bit of extra attention to live up to it's potential. Sadly, it's just not there, dooming this game to a life in the \"Bargain Bin.\" Which is where it should stay...","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0001NBNGG","description":"The creepy tale of a possessed Japanese village (Hanuda) told through the eyes of ten playable characters in combination with some impressively innovative gameplay&nbsp;features should totally make my day&nbsp;&#8211; but playing Siren turns out to be sadly different than I was expecting.The game's two big features: sightjacking (where you see through the eyes of other characters) and the Link Navigator (which manages the plot's order of events) sadly don't add to the player's experience enough to justify their problematic existence.Sightjacking is more fun to mess around with than it is helpful to the player. Watching the paths of roaming enemies can offer useful information, but the stealth mechanic is so simplistic that the data is rarely necessary. In many situations, being seen by enemies is something that you can't avoid or recover from &#8211; they will find you, and they will kill you. This is fine by me, but when the only stealth-orientated skill that is offered is a painfully slow crawl (and a distracting yell, which had little to no effect that I could perceive), it doesn't make me want to be all that sneaky. There isn't a sound meter, no real way to know if enemies can see you or not (like a vision cone or shadow meter), and very little chance of distracting them with diversions. It is more fun and more efficient to just run through levels and see what happens than to use the sightjacking feature to suss out a plan of attack.Which leads to discussion of the game's other big feature, the Link Navigator. Siren's storytelling plan sounds like a survival horror Real World season: Pick 10 characters to escape the apocalypse and find out what happens over 3 days through 78 missions &#8211; you could call it Siren: Hanuda. The complication is that the order of events is jumbled and the Link Navigator is supposed to help you keep track. What this means, from a player's point of view, is that the game's story doesn't really get its hook into you &#8211; not even in the first few hours. The tales are too disjointed, the characters too many, and the plot too slow in getting going.The more conventional aspects of this game like sound design and graphics are also something that people will have mixed feelings about. The creatures' insane, maniacal laughs are honestly unnerving, and therefore good for this game. The graphics look to be actual pictures of the characters' faces and lend a realistic, but still skewed version of each person &#8211; they're detailed, but strangely flat. I think that this is a nice subtle touch, but others may disagree.I really, really wanted to like Siren, but in the end, I just didn't have much fun or feel like the innovative parts of the game were used to their advantage. It has good ideas, and I'm glad to see experimentation in survival horror, but this should be chalked up as a failed test in the genre.Concept:Navigate a horrific village as ten different charactersGraphics:Muddy and jerky&#xC2;&#xA0;&#8211; but it fits with the disjointed feel of the gameplaySound:The best part of this game, the sound effects are creepy and (for lack of a better word) ickyPlayability:The context-sensitive menu system is&#xC2;&#xA0;counter-intuitive and the stealth mechanics are pretty archaic and basicEntertainment:I really need a reason to care in a game this cerebral and slow-paced, and Siren doesn't give it to meReplay:ModerateRated:6.25 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonIssue:May 20042nd Opinion:From a conceptual standpoint, Siren is chock-full of ingenuity, and is a soaring success when it comes to the delivery of unusual ideas. Forming a mental bond with your attackers so that you see the surroundings from their perspective is a great idea that leads to some unnerving situations. This gimmick only goes so far, however. I found its functionality, and the entire gameplay package for that matter, to be clunky, and above all, frustrating. I grew so disenchanted with trying to pick up enemy sight that I avoided using this technique whenever I could. I love the episodic approach to storytelling &#8211; but the execution of gameplay bothered me to no end.Rated:5.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Matthew Warner","summary":"Beautiful Disaster","reviewText":"Remote Japanese Villages.If you're a survivor of All God's Village from the game Fatal Frame II, you're probably aware that these are the last places on earth you want to go, particularly ones with legends concerning evil rituals (check), horrific consequences if said ritual should go wrong (usually a given), and anything involving young girls whatsoever, particularly if they are loners with some kind of physical disability (yep, we got that too.)So, at first glance, one wonders why Siren has not one playable character to traipse through a hellish village of questionable religious practices, but TEN, and that's not counting the people they bring with them. Hanuda, the village in question, not only has that hallmark \"ritual on night X or bad thing Y happens\" practice going on, but the last time this event misfired wasn't even all that long ago: 27 years.As the game explains it, this is actually the reason for all the protagonists the game throws at you. They're either in the village to begin with and are now stuck there, or they're actually there to investigate said bizarre occurrence in the first place.It's here that Siren gets it's hooks in you, and they come with a wicked barb. The game is told non-chronologically. That is, at the beginning of each stage the player is presented with three pieces of information: Who they are playing as, what they have to do, and what time is in the three-day chronology of the game. This allows for some fantastic storytelling, as the game will drop hints, clues, red-herrings, and all manner of little teases in your path and then make you sit tight to find out of you were right or not.The game turns the screw like no other in this regard, and the payoff, while incredibly bizarre, is actually sensical at the same time, and makes as much sense as anything else in the game. It works, plot wise, because by the time you get to the finale, there have been so many twists and turns in regards to the whys, whereas, and hows of what is going on in this town that the player is pretty much willing to accept anything, and it has the added bonus of being unpredictable.If this sounds incredibly vague, it's like that intentionally. Siren, like the best stories, NEEDS to be played \"blind\". The less you know about the plot of this game (which is ideally \"nothing\") the stronger the impact it will have, and subsequently the more fun you'll get out of it. And, as you'll see, you're going to want to squeeze this game for all it's worth, because while the good parts of this game are really, really good, the bad parts are really, really bad. Read on...Siren was a game that I, like just about anyone who enjoys the Survival Horror genre, was eagerly looking foreward to. By all accounts, the plot and storytelling were second to none, and the few reviews that trickled in from the Japanese version of the game were glowing. It had \"character\" like no other horror game.In fact, the only complaints I could find about it (and these concerned the European version) were in regards to the supposedly god-awful translations into the western languages. Imagine my surprise about three hours into the game when I came to the conclusion that the dub was absolutely the least of my worries with this game. The dub is transparent once you get used to the British accents and slightly bewildered line readings. It does it's job. It's the only aspect of the game that does, really.It's safe to say that those few import reviews I managed to read beforehand had, erm, \"glossed over\" a few key points. Things like this game having the worst controls since the first Resident Evil game, a staggeringly fun-sucking level of difficulty, and ridiculous puzzles that make absolutely no sense, even in the context of an admittedly strange game. So, I'm supposed to break into a house in this town, get a towel, bring it somewhere else, soak it in a sink, and then put it in a freezer so that, a day later, another character can use it for another bizarre, who-thinks-of-that-except-for-videogame-puzzle-designers purpose? All this with no indication that it's even necessary until I'm forced to replay the level hours down the road? Sure.Siren falls flat on it's face in the gameplay department, no other way to put it. This game is a chore to play, and a vast majority of the time the player's death is because of poor development, not any lack of skill or thinking. Because of the plot, most playable characters are unarmed, but the enemies of the game wield human weapons, and they seem to have no problem scrounging up plenty of rifles and pistols. Hmm. While the game's story is enough to redeem it, it's only because the story is so outstandingly cool that you're willing to suffer through the game to see it.Here's my advice with this game: Buy a GameShark to cheat your way through. This turns the game into what amounts to an old-school PC adventure game with extremely high production values.This is the only time I'll ever say this, but this game is far more fun when you can't die, and it's worth cheating to do. Normally cheating would take the fun out of the gameplay, but that's a moot point here, so you may as well get straight to the plot and not let the horrific gameplay get in the way of it.Provided you've got either an endless supply of patience or somewhat loose gaming morals, Siren has a phenominal kick that's unlike anything else out in gaming today. Unfortunatlely, the completely frustrating, broken gameplay will stop most people from ever seeing it through to completion","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2004"}

The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4.

A leak of one of their viruses in Raccoon City caused most of the citizens to turn into zombies. Leon S. Kennedy was driving into Raccoon for his first day as a cop when it was all starting. The rookie cop barely managed to get out alive. Four years later, Umbrella has fallen apart after their crimes were exposed, but the world still has its problems. The daughter of the president of the United States has disappeared somewhere in Spain. Leon, no longer a rookie, is sent in to investigate. This is where you start off in the game.Resident Evil has lost much of what made it Resident Evil. You no longer face zombies, but instead, you fight parasite-infected Spaniards, called Ganados. They're faster and smarter than the zombies. Also, you no longer have fixed camera angles and clunky controls. You now have an over-the-shoulder view, so that you can just turn your character around and look up, down, left, right - wherever you need to. You hold the R button to raise your weapon, then aim and shoot. So, gamers who didn't like RE before because of the gameplay will now find a whole new game to try. This may make fans of non-fans, although some people may miss Umbrella and their zombies.But, the monsters in this game aren't lacking. Mostly, you'll face mobs of Ganados. Many carry sickles or knives, but some of them have more dangerous weapons, like dynamite or a chainsaw. The chainsaw will kill you instantly, so you have to make sure they don't get close enough to use it. There are enemies beside Ganados, too. There is El Gigante, a giant ogre-type thing with a parasite in its back, and the Regenerator, a creature that can keep coming after you blow off body parts, due to its fast healing abilities.I don't think RE4 is as scary as the other games. It's definitely exciting and challenging, but the atmosphere and the enemies aren't quite as frightening. An enemy like a giant fish isn't creative or scary, although that boss battle is made more interesting by the fact that you're in a boat and you have to fight with a harpoon. The only enemy that really freaked me out was the Regenerator. It twitches, makes strange sounds, and it's hard to kill. Plus, it has its own spooky music.The variety of weapons in this game is good. You start out with a handgun, and you can find or buy a shotgun, a sniper rifle, a mine launcher, and other weapons. Once you get a weapon, you can upgrade it in areas of ammo capacity, power, firing speed, and reload speed. Or you can buy a new gun of that type, like a more powerful type of magnum. There are also three types of grenades (regular, incendiary, and flash). You can even throw eggs at enemies.You can get some items from the environment. Chickens will lay eggs that can heal you if you eat it (or, like I said, you can throw them). You can also get eggs from snakes, money from crows, or you can kill a fish and take that to eat. There are treasures hidden around, too. There are jewels embedded in cavern walls, or ammo in bird nests in trees. If you spot them, you can shoot them down. There are bigger treasures for those who explore and try different paths, too. The jewels and treasures can be sold for Spanish money, so you can buy more weapons or increase the size of your inventory. All these transactions are made with a mysterious armsdealer in a trenchcoat, whom you meet pretty early in the game.This RE is much more fast-paced than before. Besides being able to move more freely (not having to rotate in the direction you want to go) and shoot faster, you have tests of reflex. There are scenes where you might have to press a certain button to avoid death. For example, you might start walking down a descending path that has cliff walls on either side, when a couple of Ganados push a boulder down from the top. You have to press the A button as fast as you can to outrun the boulder, then suddenly press the B button to dodge the boulder when you get to the bottom of the path. Things like that make sure that you don't relax, even during a cutscene or when no enemies are in sight. But, if you aren't quick enough, these reflex sequences might keep you from progressing in the game until you become faster.The graphics in this game are quite good. There is a lot of detail on each character's face and body, and in the environment. You almost feel like you're really there, in the dark tunnel, the hedge maze, or the castle interior. The sound is good, too. The voice-acting is done well and the sounds suit the weapons, animals, or enemies that are making them. The music can create a feeling of unease or danger at the appropriate moments.The story and the characters in this game could have been better. The story doesn't leave much food for thought, like some of the other games have. There aren't many intriguing tidbits in the files, and the new characters aren't very interesting. The president's daughter is a pretty blonde with a whiney voice and an annoying personality. The bad guys are crazy and evil. The hero is tough and sexy, but says cheesy, predictable lines. There's really no depth in these characters.But, the game makes up for this because of very fun gameplay. You can harm the Ganados in several ways, like bringing them to their knees and slamming their heads into the ground, blinding them and kicking them, or knocking them off heights to their deaths. I've played through the game a few times because I just enjoy killing those Ganados so much.The replay value is good for other reasons, too. You can unlock three new types of weapons - a machine gun with infinite ammo, a rocket launcher with infinite ammo, and the Handcannon, a very powerful magnum that will kill almost anything in one shot that you can upgrade for infinite ammo. There are two minigames to unlock, too. There's Assignment Ada, where you play a female agent who is collecting samples of the parasite. And there's Mercenaries, where you play in four different areas to score as many points as possible, by killing Ganados in succession. You can unlock four special characters to play in Mercenaries by racking up enough points, and you get the Handcannon by earning even more points.I thoroughly enjoyed this game, although I wasn't left with that special feeling that I get from a really good story. But there are few flaws, so buy it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2005"}

Make no mistake, though:Final Fantasy Chroniclesmarks the first time this pivotal installment of the cherished game series has ever been available on the PlayStation. InFinal Fantasy IV, players take on the role of Cecil, a loyal captain who questions the orders of his king, and for it is sent to slay a mysterious beast in a nearby valley.InChrono Trigger, Chrono must follow princess Marle's teleportation through time and locate her before an intergalactic parasite arrives to destroy the world. The original game, also on the PlayStation for the first time, was one of the first nonlinear role-playing games. The decisions that players make during the game will point them toward one of more than a dozen possible endings.These new versions retain the authentic Japanese SNES stories and characters while updating their graphics and adding new full-motion video sequences and other features.","reviewerName":"Travis J.

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"CJC","summary":"Work's great on the Wii","reviewText":"I purchased this game when I bought the Wii and it works really well especially with a Gamecube controller.  The plot of the game is that you (Mario) are visiting a distant land, when you are confronted by the citizens who accuse you of polluting their countryside.  Mario is sentenced to using a water cannon to go around and clean everything that was ruined.  You soon find out that there is a Mario lookalike (sort of a blue, watery looking Mario) running around with a paintbrush polluting everything.  Your water pack has the ability to be a fire hose, jet pack, rocket pack and motorboat.Now that the description is out of the way \"Here we go!\".  The graphics are good for a game of its time.  It has the overall feeling of Mario 64 but doesn't quite live up to the rep of a Mario game.  The puzzles have the potential to be fun, but also incredibly frustrating.  The variety of game play is also pretty abundant.  However, this game has the absolute worst camera angles of any game I've ever played.  Add that to the poor shadowing and you have a formula for a game where the player will constantly have to restart missions and climb sequences from falling off cliffs, not making the jump, falling into the water, falling from not being able to gauge distances, missing landings while using the je pack option, etc.  Even Devil May Cry had better camera angles than this game and you can't control the cameras in that game.  I even find it pretty annoying that I can't adjust camera controls, I'm very used to non inverted controls and this game is all about control inversion.Anyway, that is my overall of the game.  I'm not sure if this game is worth the $17 or $18 you'll pay in total from Amazon.  But if you are a dedicated Mario fan go for it.  I say just spend the money on Mario 64 and Super Mario World downloads for the Wii and play those.  I think you'll derive much more enjoyment and the less frustration playing those games.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2008"}

Featuring a completely new and innovative combat system, detailed character design, and clever gameplay,The Mark of Kriaims to breathe new life into the action-adventure genre.","reviewerName":"Mithlas","summary":"Hype Didn't Help","reviewText":"An ancient evil stirs; an impatient adventurer sets out from an insular village that has no other warriors (at least none that ever appear or help you) but is mysteriously well-equipped for training them. The story is the best part about this game after the graphics, but there's nothing here you haven't seen better before. Most of it is forgettable, but acceptable to get you from point A to point B provided the gameplay or graphics don't put you off.Story: 6/10The game went with a relatively painted sort of cell-shaded style, watching the scenes \"written into being\" as the game's equivalent of cinematics is mildly interesting but loses interest. Some people will automatically dislike the apparently cutesy graphics, others will be off-put by the limb-hewing and spurting blood. I didn't think they worked well together, but look up gameplay videos on Youtube to decide for yourself, this is one case where what you see is what you'll get and you may either like or dislike it.Graphics: 6/10There are some cries of anger, pain, and ambient noises that all seemed fitting. There weren't spectacular effects or voicing (more than a few of the lines are corny), but I thought that it fit the general tone and theme.Sound: 7/10The background music is rather bland, not especially annoying but a pale shadow of what video game music can be.Music: 5/10Gameplay is where this game really falls apart. Moving and trying to get the camera to cooperate was clunky and uncooperative. The combat felt rather awkward and unpolished, I had the distinct impression that it was rushed because there was a variety of \"combo attacks\", but none of them were really more effective than mashing the attack buttons and if you're fighting multiple opponents most moves won't be available anyway. Lack of effective smart targeting or good lock-on didn't help, and if you'd been mashing away at one enemy and they fell Rau was liable to continue hacking in that direction while three more soldiers bear down on him from other directions. I believe one word describes every stage of this game, including combat and \"platforming\": clunky.Gameplay: 3/10There are little rewards and minor easter eggs you can unlock by accomplishing sub-missions within areas, such as utilizing certain combos, but none of them really helped gameplay and nothing felt worth the time and hassle of going back.Replayability: 1/10For all of the \"our game is unique\" hoopla, I wish they would've spent some more time refining the play and areas. It looks like a cartoon, spurts blood like a survival horror, and will probably annoy you like a screaming baby. It definitely doesn't flow or captivate. Definitely rent before you buy, and if you can't try it first I would recommend seeking other games first, there's nothing here that isn't done better elsewhere.Overall: 4/10","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2010"}

As in the previous games, your actions determine your look and the look of the world around you.You start out as a lad in a village, doing random quests for your village. You can choose to do those quests nicely or cruelly, changing your reputation as you go. The townspeople react to your new reputation. The village is soon torched by bandits and you go off to a guild hall to become a Hero, to get revenge.The game is very open ended, letting you choose which quests you wish, roam around slaying beasts, hang out in the pubs playing pub games, getting drunk. You can get married, get divorced and slay people. As you set your course in life, and choose clothing and armor, people react to you with pleasure, fear, appreciation, laughter, and more.The graphics are stellar in this game. Trees have leaves of different types. Smoke rises from the glowing forge, the game cycles from day to night as you adventure. Your character can wear hairstyles and tattoos, changing clothes to suit the occasion. The sounds are great as well. You hear hoot-owls at night, sparrows during the day. People sleep and snore at night, while kids arond during the day. Amongst it all, a gentle classical musical score puts you into the medieval frame of mind.There are the traditional elements of an RPG here - you slay creatures, solve quests, earn money and reputation. You use experience to build up the skills in the area you enjoy - magic, ranged weapons, hand to hand combat. If you choose good things to do, the people love you and your look and atmosphere is one of joy. If you choose evil things, the townspeople run in fear, you sprout horns and even get a bug-swarm near you.But the true joy of this game is where it lets you pretty much do whatever you want. You can marry a girl - then kill her off for her inheritance. Or kill off her parents. Or divorce her and marry another one. The choices are pretty much endless, and since every person in the game related to each other one and to you, you never know what the various combinations will cause to happen.This is NOT a quick game to win. It will take you some time to get through the intro / tutorial areas and really learn the basics. Once you do, the gameplay itself can easily take weeks to months to try out everything, if it is even possible to try everything. You'll want to create several characters to be able to try the world as good, evil and everything in between.Also note this is a MATURE title and lists in its \"things you've done\" items like \"getting drunk\" and \"having sex\" and so on. You run into situations with cheating husbands, cheating wives, etc. This isn't meant for the younger set. Still, for adults it can be great fun.Highly recommended, 10/10!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2004"}

In 2002, this great game was released for the Game Boy Advance to the delight of many fans of the franchise and was a smash hit. So for those lucky enough to buy it at the time like me, it was great to play from start to finish.Metroid Fusion continues from the classic SNES game in which Samus Aran assists in a mission to eradicate Metroids in a planet she previously visited. Things go horribly wrong when she is attacked by a parasite that poisons and ulitmately threatens to kill her. She pulls through after receiving a vaccine but not before she had parts of her suit removed because of the infestation, thereby losing her trademark abilities. And things get worse as the space station she is staying at gets attacked by the same parasite that almost kills her and looks just like her and possesses all of her abilities. You take control of Samus Aran once again, stripped of all her abilities and this is where the game starts.The story is now different because you are constantly hunted by the parasite disguised as you so you are always on the move. Along the way, you can pick up various items to make you powerful. You will also be aided by a super computer, guiding you on your mission as well as sending you to \"data rooms\" to download new abilities. For those who have played Metroid games, then you are used to the exploration that is accustomed to games of this nature. There is a main world followed by 6 elavators that take you to sub worlds.The PROS: This game is huge but it is fun as well. The presentation is typical Metroid fashion so it's great. The graphics and sounds are as good as it gets while the music sets the mood, changing often depending on where you are in the game. The controls are easy to get into and get used to so you won't have any problems controlling Samus. What's also good about this game is that Nintendo shakes things up a bit: Samus is now the one that's hunted and normal abilities like the Screw Attack, Varia Suit and etc. are now attained when you beat the bosses that inhabit each world (you absorb them instead of getting a special item.) And getting the 100% item completion means you will be kept busy trying to locate every single item by using all of your abilities. Lastly, after you beat the game, you can connect the GBA and Gamecube (Metroid Prime) to unlock bonus content.The CONS: None whatsoever. I can't possibly think of anything that hinders the game at all.There is a reason why this game commands such a high price for those who want a brand new copy. If you are somewhat interested in this game or are a long time Metroid fan, there is no reason to not have this game. Get this used since it will be easier to purchase and see what you've been missing. Metroid Fusion is a great game for the GBA and belongs in your game collection as soon as possible. *****HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*****","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2011"}

If you include the bonus games included as extras, the amount of games included in this collection jumps to 49. That's 49 games for 1/2 the price of most new PS3/360 games. You can't beat it.Well, that is, unless you don't like playing old school 16 bit games.Every game is perfectly emulated, and one option many will appreciate is the ability to adjust the aspect ratio. You can set the games to be in their original 4:3 aspect ratios or take them all the way out to 16:9 so they fill your widescreen TV. Since you can dynamically size each game, you can also use any aspect ratio in between.The emulation is perfect, however the game menu, where you choose the game you wish to play, is not. The interface seems clunky and the music and sounds are obnoxiously LOUD for some reason.As much as I would have enjoyed seeing Jurassic Park included in the collection, some games just can't be ported due to licensing restrictions; JP is likely one of these.The nostalgia this collection bestows is priceless. These games take you back to a time when games could be brutally difficult and made no apologies for it. Want to finish the original Sonic The Hedgehog? You better know how to collect extra lives! (unless of course you know the cheat codes; which, by the way, if a game had a cheat code on the Genesis, it is included in this collection. So if a game is too difficult for you, don't despair completely, there may be some reprieve available. Search GameFaqs or similar cheat code sites and check it out)For me, Space Harrier alone, perfectly emulated, is worth more than the price of admission here.

As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels.

While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction.

The game starts slowly, and builds and builds ... and builds ... and builds ... until, when the little guy finally defeats the Big Hands in the Tower of the Gods ... and you enter the strange, black and white eeriness in the Castle beneath the Sea ... and you realize you've only just BEGUN to play this game, when at THAT point you realize you've been spending so much time in front of your TV and your GameCube because THAT world is so immeasurably more fascinating than THIS world, it strikes you:  What Nintendo has done defines magic.  Shakespeare at his finest could do this for an evening; Nintendo does it for days, weeks, and even longer.  Ok, that's hyperventilating, so enuff said.  But still!  Unless you have a deficient attention span or a prehuman intolerance for puzzles and mystery, PLAY THIS GAME.  Allow me to add, parts of Wind Waker are not specifically aimed at kids.  The final showdown with the Big Poe was both hilarious and immensely satisfactory, philosophically speaking.  I found myself thinking of schizophrenia, Dante's Inferno and the Stapuft Marshmallow Man simultaneously.  Mostly droll, occasionally satirical, Wind Waker sometimes walks a fine and perceptive line between storytelling and proscenium-bending sarcasm.  Example:  Why does the Nintendo Gallery sculptor hate Link's pictograph of Lenzo and his lady friend?  Because Link (i.e, you, dear gamer) acquired it by stealth!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2004"}

Yet, while it is an entertaining RPG, The Third Age has several flaws that make it an RPG that's just as easy to forget afterwards as many RPGs on the shelves these day. These flaws involve character development(there isn't any, basically) and the fact that your group isn't making history alongside the fellowship(Personally, I feel it would've been way better if you played as fellowship itself). These two things, alone, make this game feel more like a second rate retelling of the story. Even so, it's still a great game. It's definitely a very competent RPG that's played much like a FF game.

Buzz Quiz TV is a fun game, with loads of questions from many different topics. Although the characters and animation are pretty hilarious at first, they do seem to get a bit tiring after you've played a while. But, that doesn't take away from how much fun this game actually is. I was impressed with the number of questions, and their scope. You will see some questions that a first grader could answer, as well as some very difficult questions that you honestly have never heard of. I'm not sure how fun the game is when playing with kids, so you might need to choose specific categories to be fair to them! The graphics are smooth, the audio is clear, and getting everything ready to play takes only a minute or two. I was suprised at how little the big button gets used. If you're thinking this game is like Jeopardy, you will be disappointed. Most of the time, you simply select a color button indicating one of the four choices. At first you may have to look at the controller, but once you get the hang of it, you just \"know\" which button is the color you need. They do make this easier by showing the multiple choice answers in the same order as your buttons. So, no worries about playing in the dark, at least once you are used to it. You will want to play this game with four people for maximum fun, or go online for even more. The game also has an option to turn off mature questions, though to be honest, I haven't seen any of them anyway, so I'm not sure of the extent of the questions. You have the option of getting new questions from the Playstation Network, so the replay value of Buzz Quiz TV should be good as well.Negatives: The only negatives are the repetition of the characters and the limited game modes. Though these are negatives, they do not have a major effect on how much fun the game is, thus I gave it 5 stars for fun and 4 for overall.Bottom Line: If you enjoy quiz games and your family or friends do as well, Buzz Quiz TV is something you will want to own.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00DC7G0GG","description":"","reviewerName":"hwrose379","summary":"Super Mario 3D World is, simply put, a masterpiece!","reviewText":"I can remember back to the day at E3 when Super Mario 3D World was revealed. My initial reaction was one of disappointment...sure, it looked fun, but it seemed too similar to it's predecessor, Super Mario 3D Land, to stand on its own as a great game. As time went on, and, after coming close to beating the game 100%, I can attest that Super Mario 3D World is well worth your time and money and has become, dare I say, my new favorite Mario game.*STORY*3D World does introduce a new story. Instead of kidnapping Peach, Bowser invades the Sprixie Kingdom, a brand-new Kingdom led by Sprixies (adorable fairy creatures), and kidnaps the seven princesses in order to take their treasure. The only way to access the Sprixie Kingdom is through a clear pipe (a new mechanic I'll talk about later), and Mario and Co. follow Bowser into this new land to save the princesses. As far as the story goes, that's about it. There really isn't any story advancements as the game progresses. But then again, Mario games have never really been about the story. It seems like the story is there to simply launch the adventure.*GAMEPLAY*3D World is practically bursting with new gameplay mechanics. One such mechanic is the clear pipes that I mentioned above. These clear pipes offer a mode of transportation within the game, as they connect the various worlds and they help you reach areas of a level that would not be accessible otherwise. Nintendo has expertly placed items in the pipes, such as enemies, green stars (which replace star coins), and other collectibles. Other new gameplay ideas include a level that makes use of shadows to help you judge distance (it even includes a section played entirely in the shadows), top-down perspective levels similar to the 2D Zelda games, a mad dash to the finish Super Mario Kart-style level (it even includes the original music!), a level where stepping in the spotlight triggers a barrage of Bullet Bills to attack you, and much, much more. Another notable new gameplay mechanic is the Captain Toad levels. In these puzzle-based levels, you play as Captain Toad from Galaxy's Toad Brigade, and you must collect five green stars without being able to jump. All in all, Super Mario 3D World is filled to the brim with new gameplay mechanics, making the adventure seem fresh with every level.In addition to these outstanding new gameplay mechanics, there's also the fact that each playable character has their own unique control scheme, a la Super Mario Bros. 2. Mario is the average character we've all come to know and love. Luigi can jump higher and has a flutter kick similar to Yoshi, but he has less traction and is prone to being a slippery character. Peach can hover in the air for a second or two after jumping, making her ideal for beginners, but she is the slowest character of them all. Toad is the fastest of the bunch, and he is great for speed runs, but he doesn't gain very much height at all when he's jumping. Then, of course, there's the secret unlockable fifth character, but I'm going to stop here to prevent spoilers.*LEVEL DESIGN*Unlike 3D Land, 3D World's levels all seem widely unique from one another and no two levels seem exactly alike. The levels make expert use of the game's new gameplay mechanics, and many levels were built around a specific mechanic. Green stars and stamps (used to put pre-drawn pictures in your Miiverse posts) are expertly hidden, and most will take a keen eye to discover or will force you to take a leap of faith to try and grab it without dying. The levels of the first two worlds aren't difficult at all, but the difficulty definitely starts to ramp up at around World 3/World 4. The later worlds, specifically the special worlds, provide an excellent challenge for the skilled Mario players. Nintendo finally got the difficulty balance right, something they have been struggling with for a long time. Each new level practically breathes creativity, and I just can't get enough of it!*POWER-UPS*The cat suit, as ridiculous as it seems at first glance, is actually extremely useful and fun to use. It gives your character a whole new move-set, such as a scratch attack, an airiel attack, and the ability to climb walls (for a limited time before your character tires out). The double cherry, which gives you a clone of your character, is absolutely chaotic and hilariously fun to use. All of your clones move in unison, so it does have a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it it's lots of fun to use. The cannon box is useful, but I wish that the cannonballs wouldn't fire automatically. There's also a light box that appears in a few levels. It acts similarly to a flashlight, and it allows you to kill ghosts. Of course, there's lots of returning power-ups, such as the Tanooki suit, the Fire Flower, the Mega Mushroom (making it's first 3D Mario appearance), and much more, so 3D World offers a wide variety in that department.*SINGLE PLAYER*3D World offers a solid single player adventure. While there are some levels that look like they were created with the intention of being played in multiplayer, Nintendo never forgets the soloists and will always leave a Double Cherry lying around in these levels. Unlike some Mario games, single player never gets tedious, mainly because, as I mentioned above, each level feels widely unique.*MULTIPLAYER*After playing through the first few worlds in two player co-op with my brother, I can attest that this is the most fun I've had with multiplayer in a long time. A problem with the NSMB series was that there was never enough room to move around and you're always bumping into one another. 3D World solves these problems, and co-op is as fun as ever. Multiplayer can either be cooperative or competitive - at the end of each level, you get ranked based on how many points you collect. The winner then gets a crown to wear in the next level. The crown serves absolutely no purpose - but it is cause for some hilarious brawling, because it can be stolen. I've only experienced two player co-op, but it was immensely enjoyable. If there is one criticism I can make, it's that the button you use to pick other people up is also the run button. It's rarely a problem but it can get in the way.*GRAPHICS AND SOUND*Super Mario 3D World has absolutely beautiful graphics. Each level is bursting with vibrant colors and amazing atmosphere, again attesting to the fact that each level feels unique. The raining levels were particularly memorable, since the rain was very convincing. Your character would have a wet look to him/her and the camera would even be splattered with rain drops. To top everything off, the game runs gorgeously at 720p (upscaled to 1080p) @ 60fps. The music is also fantastic, using an expert mix of orchestral and big band tracks. The big band direction really breathes some new life into the Mario series, as jazz suits the series reall well (as was first proven in Paper Mario: Sticker Star). Galaxy composers Mahito Yokota helms the soundtrack, with Toru Minegishi, Yasuaki Iwata, and (of course), Koji Kondo helping in the effort. There's so much new music here, and, after the rather disappointing soundtracks of the NSMB series, it feels completely original. The soundtrack is very unique from past Mario games, and it may feature one of the best Mario soundtracks to date.*VERDICT*Super Mario 3D World is an absolute joy to play. It was crafted to perfection and demonstrates that Nintendo still knows how to make quality gaming experiences. Like its predecessor, it masterfully mixes the benefits of 2D and 3D Mario games and wonderfully creates a blend of old and new. This is, without a doubt, the best game the Wii U has to offer and it is a must-have for any Wii U owner.STORY: 7/10GAMEPLAY: 10/10LEVEL DESIGN: 10/10POWER-UPS: 10/10SINGLE PLAYER: 10/10MULTIPLAYER: 9/10GRAPHICS & SOUND: 10/10OVERALL (not an average): 10/10 (or 5/5)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}

It's just that it pales in comparison to its predecessors (Crysis and Crysis: Warhead).  This is not a graphical benchmark anymore, and the story isn't even a true sequel to the first game.  What really annoys me is that the game basically tells you what to do from section to section.  Speed and Jump are constantly on, which is kind of annoying (and they don't feel that powerful).  Textures aren't that detailed anymore and character models aren't either.  Dynamic lighting looks pretty good most of the time, but you aren't going to see lots of great draw distance.

{"product_name":"B00503EAG2","description":"eli","reviewerName":"genocidal_maniac","summary":"First Person Extreme Sports","reviewText":"COD is a shooter game but I like to think of it as an first person extreme sports simulation. There's a lot of jumping, a lot of crashing, a lot of shooting. The story is basically Tom Clancy. I liked that stuff when I was a kid. Then I grew up. So it is kind of stupid, but it is the execution that matters, and the execution is tremendously good. It actually reminds me quite a bit of Uncharted, in the impressiveness of the events your character goes through.Now, there are guns in this game. A big part of me is uneasy with the glorification of gun culture, still, in the series. but like Uncharted, the guns are there to give you a sense of danger and purpose while barreling through the levels. They are improved over the previous games quite a bit. The biggest improvement I find is the sound. You hear all the little squeaks and clicks of the guns as you reload and fire them. It's a reminder that these are intricate clock-like mechanical machines. I personally find the game most rewarding playing with an iron-sights AK47, M16, or MP5. There's also a weird new Russian gun called the PP90 that reloads using a tube.As a side note, I had feared that this game's quality wouldn't be quite up to snuff after reading about some of the drama at Infinity Ward following MW2. Apparently, Activision had fired the two founders because the CEO was paranoid about them defecting to a rival publisher and taking employees with them. A very ham-fisted move it looks like to me, and the developer was decimated as like half the team left anyways following the Activision CEO's move. This is a case study on how not to treat talent and was completely unnecessary. It does seem that subtly this game is missing some of the creative risks that the first two Modern Warfare games took. There are more standardish-levels, fewer \"No Russian\" levels and more \"Red Dawn\"-esque levels.Another little thing I find interesting is that this game is deep down based on a very old Quake engine, the Quake 3 Arena engine from way back in the 1990's. They've grafted on various little improvements to the engine since then, and it's a great looking game, but you can still detect subtly how the movement feels like a Quake game from like how your mouselook accelerates when moving around to how collision detection works and moving up ladders.I also would like to say that this is one superb piece of entertainment, even for those who aren't into video games that much. You don't have to think too much, which is actually a relief because I prefer to think about like astrophysics and not about how to beat some dumb RPG game element. It offers you just enough control so that you feel like you're in the game world more than you would a movie, but it also moves events along for you, which enables some of the more impressive extreme sports moments in the game. That it's all done in first person and not in cutscenes is what makes this series special.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2013"}

Yet it didn't have those huge sales it should've got, it only got \"fairly successful\" sales. Coming on no less than 4 systems(I think there was a PC version too), it allowed anyone owning a game console to play it no matter what you have.Story: The Prince of Persia(I don't think you catch his name) finds the mysterious Dagger of Time. Tricked by an evil Vizier to opening this huge hourglass, it turns the entire populace into sand mummy things except for the Vizier, the Prince and a stranger named Farah.Music/Sound: The Prince has a british accent which works quite well. He tends to talk to himself a bit during the game which makes things lighthearted. What little music there is as an obvious Egyptian feel with bit of rock elements like the fighting scenes.Graphics: Coooool. The world here is quite detailed and the parts where you turn on the Dagger is so neat. When the camera gets stuck at time, there's a slight blur effect which kind of got annoying.Gameplay: Normally I like fighting in games but the platforming was a lot more funner than the fighting. The Prince has an almost superhuman ability to run across walls(yes I said across). If you run at the wall from the side, you can actually run along for a slight time. There's some puzzle solving but nothing too difficult.The ability to rewind saves yourself from certain deaths although I have one complaint: sometimes, rewinding you're not allowed to block or dodge an attack as soon as the rewind stops(a few seconds) he might get hit right away which negates the use of rewinding. One area where you have to rescue Farah and fight off big baddies just got really frustrating.I beat the Gamecube version and didn't notice anything like lots of slowdown or framerate, the rest of the versions may vary but you should definately pick this up before the upcoming Warrior Within","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2004"}

Discover simple touch screen controls as well as strategic depth with different tennis swings, both which propel the tennis experience into an ever-intensifying crescendo of fun as the volleys go on.","reviewerName":"MisterMusicFan","summary":"Fun, but noticeably flawed","reviewText":"Mario Tennis Open, the latest installment in Mario's sports spinoff series, is modeled very closely after its GameCube predecessor (which had a Wii rerelease), Mario Power Tennis, but its straightforward, skill-based gameplay recalls the original Mario Tennis 64. It's overall a strong addition to the series, and it makes the intelligent move of offering an online multiplayer mode, which provides a replayability factor never before seen in any Mario sports title aside from Mario Strikers Charged. Unfortunately, however, a handful of substantial setbacks will make many players yearn for what could (and should) have been.If you've played any previous Mario Tennis title, chances are you'll be familiar with how everything works: you select your favorite Mario character and take him or her out on the court, with the intention of defeating one or two opponents at a match of tennis. You can perform a variety of different types of shots depending on the button you press or panel you tap on the touchscreen; the longer you hold the button or touchscreen panel before releasing, the more of a charge your shot will gain (i.e. it will travel farther and faster). Be cautious when charging, however, because you'll have limited mobility, although you can cancel a charge with the L Button. There are a total of six different shot types (including topspin, slice, lob, and more), each of which have different speeds, spins and bounces. You'll also have the option of pressing the X Button to make a \"Simple Shot,\" which automatically chooses the best shot for you, albeit with weakened power. Just like in real tennis, you'll want to aim and choose your shots wisely to get the ball past your opponent.You can move your character around the court and aim your shots with the Circle Pad, although a somewhat bizarre new control scheme allows for gyroscope controls in which you get a first-person view and aim the ball by tilting your 3DS in the desired direction (your character moves toward the ball automatically in this mode, which makes for cheap advantages in certain situations but an awkward sense of focus in others). The 3D features automatically shut off for this mode, and the game in fact detects the angle you're holding the 3DS and automatically switches between these two control schemes/angles depending on whether you're holding it downwards or upright; this is honestly obnoxious and highly distracting if you end up making any kind of major movements while playing, but luckily you can shut this feature off in settings.Throughout each match you'll notice Chance Shot panels, which are circular, multicolored spots that light up in specific areas on the court. Each one represents an opportunity to make a powered-up version of a certain type of shot. Red Fire Flower panels light the ball on fire, making the ball travel extremely quick and push your opponent backward a great deal if they receive it; you'll have to be standing within the panel and input the proper shot command to use these, meaning pressing A in a Fire Flower panel makes for this powered-up topspin. Blue Blooper panels allow for superpowered slices that have a wicked curve, while purple Star panels allow for high-speed flat shots. You'll definitely want to utilize the Chance Shots as often as possible, as they're frequently a key factor in winning matches. Additionally, they are great tools for taking foes by surprise; the panel will light up more brightly as you charge the accompanying shot, which your opponent will likely be preparing for by then. This does not mean, however, that you can't change shots at the last minute and throw them off, which can make for a suspenseful guessing game to keep foes on their toes. Little opportunities for strategic moves like this are a nice touch.Most of these spinoffs shamelessly abuse the opportunity to highlight the sheer wackiness of Mario's universe; i.e., whether you're swinging a bat, driving a go-kart, or kicking a ball around, if it's happening in a Mario game, you expect that the real focus will be on the random chaos of airborne Koopa shells, lightning bolts, invincibility-granting Stars and other wild items and abilities. Unexpectedly, however, Mario Tennis Open heavily downplays these elements, choosing instead to focus more on pretty simplistic bouts of mostly ordinary tennis. While this does oftentimes allow for a greater implementation of strategy, there's something disappointing about the lack of character-specific individuality or any opportunities to spice things up Mario-style on the court. Mario Power Tennis's Power Shots were occasionally overpowered and came with somewhat distracting cutscene animations, but they gave some great pizzazz and additional reasons to choose specific characters. I was personally hoping they'd return in this installment, but sadly they don't.This isn't to say the characters all play identically, however; each character has a specific skill set, or more accurately a dominant \"trait\" that defines their play style. Yoshi and Diddy Kong are based in \"Speed,\" meaning they can swiftly move around the court at a moment's notice, while Donkey Kong and Bowser are \"Power\" characters, meaning their shots are fast, powerful and slightly more difficult to receive. There are a variety of other traits featuring different strengths, including \"Tricky,\" \"Defense,\" and more. The roster is appreciatively large, featuring pretty much all of Mario's finest, and there are even a good handful of unlockable hidden characters, most of whom are very welcome additions (spoiler: Luma becomes a playable character for the first time!). You also have the option of playing as your own Mii, whose stats become customizable depending on the gear you equip them with (more on that later).Mario Tennis Open offers a decent variety of modes to explore, although some are better than others and sadly there is no RPG-themed 1-Player mode; instead we get a fairly straightforward Tournament mode in which you play against AI opponents in a series of cups, a la Mario Kart. The Tournaments are alright, but pretty simplistic; you have the option of playing either Singles or Doubles, the latter of which requires you to team up with an AI partner and take on two opponents instead of one in each match. The CPU opponents become progressively more competitive without ever reaching outrageous levels of cheapness; the final cup should give you a real run for your money, but it won't have you pulling your hair out like certain other rage-inducing Mario spinoffs (Strikers, cough). When you beat an Open's final cup, your character will become a Star Character, awarding them a slight boost in power (you'll want to take only Star Characters into highly competitive online matches, FYI).There's also a series of quirky mini-games in which you play matches under certain conditions or gimmickry. In Ring Shot, you score points by whacking the ball through a series of golden rings that appear sporadically throughout the court, while Ink Showdown pits you up against a single opponent while ink-spitting Piranha Plants distract you in the background. A particularly nice novelty is that presented by Super Mario Tennis, in which you \"play\" through levels of the original Super Mario Bros. using the ball to smash enemies and collect coins or power-ups. Most difficult of all is Galaxy Rally, in which you must hit the ball to certain spots on the court as portions of it vanish. These games are pretty nifty, but it's unfortunate that they are the only way to unlock most of the hidden goodies. If you're interested in any of the hidden characters or want to collect coins to purchase Mii accessories, the only way to do so is by playing through these mini-games.The aforementioned accessories include rackets, wristbands, and a variety of other goodies that you can use to deck out your playable Mii character, and its stats will change depending on what you have it wear. There is admittedly a very nice variety of suits, rackets and more to make for pretty nifty customization (I personally favor the Superstar racket and Ice Flower wristbands). Unfortunately, however, the accessories are useless if you're not planning on playing as your Mii, and it's very difficult to understand how exactly the equipment will change your stats, because the information is presented in a series of awkwardly designed pie charts.The online mode is likely the game's biggest draw and what will keep you coming back for more; you can play either with friends or against random people in a \"quick\" match or extended series of sets. Unfortunately the developers of Mario Tennis Open did not learn from Kid Icarus Uprising's mistake, as you still cannot play with both friends and random people. The online mode is still pretty addictive, although be warned, the level of competitiveness varies wildly. You'll be able to see monthly leaderboards of the best players, as well as your own Rating, which increases or depletes depending on whether you win or lose matches (you'll also get a medal featuring your opponent's Mii if you beat them).Overall, the game certainly offers addictive, simple fun, shining particularly in its online and multiplayer modes. The mini-games and customizable accessories are also a very nice touch. Unfortunately, however, the straightforward gameplay can wear thin, particularly throughout the progressively tedious Tournament mode, and the series of small missteps really add up as a whole package. It does ultimately serve its core purpose as a nice handheld version of Mario Tennis featuring a solid online multiplayer, but for some it may end up being little more than a placeholder while we wait on Paper Mario and New Super Mario Bros. 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2012"}

I played Resident evil 2 and beat it in rookie mode with the Gatling gun. I started playing the B part of it, but never finished. I also started resident evil 1, but only made it somewhere near plant 42. Suffice it to say that I loved the story, but the awkward gameplay and scare factor always kept me away, although I am interested in trying resident evil 4, which has a new gameplay as I understand it. Anyway, then this game came out, which gave me the prefect option to try something new. It was as much as I expected, no more or less.Gameplay: The game is a rail/ light gun shooter. For those of you who are not aware of what that means, this is the type of shooting game you might find in an arcade. Area 51, Time Crisis, and house of the dead series are examples of this. Only house of the dead has been ported to the new functionality of the wii, making this title one of only 2 rail shooters available on a wii. If you love these kind of games, which suck up quarters in the arcade, then this is a great, and even money saving, game to purchase. Rail shooters follow a linear path, you point at the screen, shoot, reload, and shoot some more, occasionally tossing a grenade to shake things up. That is all the game has, so if the repetitive nature of this game overwhelms the fun of just shutting of your brain for a few hours, then this game is not for you, and you will not enjoy it. period.Graphics: Graphically, I felt the game was lacking. To me, the graphics were as bad as House of the Dead 2, and not even as good as 3, which is pretty poor considering the House of the Dead is many years old. It was pretty much crap, the environment was not nearly as changeable as one would like, and it was simply lacking.Story: The story, and the main reason to get the game, is that it pretty much summarizes resident evil 0, 1, and 3. The game has several scenarios you can follow. The first one is resident evil 0, you follow through the game as the characters from that game, fighting the same bosses and visiting the same areas in order, with a rough on the go story that summarizes more than explains. Then you follow the original, then 3, and there is an extra story too. So those of you like me, who were too scared to get through them, might find this game a bit better, after all, it drags your along the rail whether you are scared to open the next door or not. Personally I did not find it scary, I don't think it is, but that is really your call. On top of that, it has numerous unlockable subplots, which give you the story of the some of the other characters and their respective plot holes. Such as what happened with rebecca chambers between the end of resident evil 0 and her appearance in resident evil 1, or what wesker was doing during most of the games.Features: The game had many unique features, and while there are many times where I could swear I was playing House of the Dead, there were plenty of times I did not. Differences between this and your basic shooter, you can switch between weapons, which are numerous, which do hold ammo, only hand guns are infinite. Reloading, rather than shooting off screen, requires you to jerk the remote awkwardly. Picking up weapons, avoiding certain scripted hits, and grenades require the A button, changing weapons require the up down arrows. You can \"pan\" left and right with the nunchuck, but that changes your view a little to the left and right. It may be useful for getting a better view of an enemy or item, but is pretty much useless. Plus, with your hand over the remote so you can change weapons or pick up stuff constantly, the ability to use the nunchuck is pretty much not there. I don't even plug the nunchuck in and I play fine. Mind you, I have the perfectshot gun for this game. While this is a great gun that adds to the experience of the game, I found that the game would probably play easier without it, which would allow you to control everything with one hand.Overall: I found the game to be great, mindless fun, that still allows you to have a resident evil experience even if you are the type of person who can play a survival horror game. It can be frustrating at times. At certain times, headshots and bullets in general don't land where they're shoot, in two person mode, the receptacles do not do a good job of separating themselves in shape/color well, so you can get confused easy as to who is pointed where. The game will keep your interest for a couple hours of fun every once in a while, but don't expect to get sucked in by the greatness of gameplay or incredible graphics. The upgradables give you a little incentive to play, and desire to increase your score might get you a little replayablity, but don't expect much more than that. Own it if you LOVE rail shooters, or really want at least one in your wii library, otherwise, rent it for a trip down memory lane and nothing more.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2009"}

Unless they've been living under a rock they'd know this game's an RPG first and foremost, and that Bethesda has been touting the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system and VATS for months before the game's release.The VATS is an innovation which is surely to be imitated, just as bullet-time was.  I have to admit I initially thought VATS would end up being a useless gimmick, but I never get tired of seeing my enemies' heads blown off in cinematic style.  The VATS also allows me to conserve ammo because I'm not just pouring out bullets at the enemy; my character fires in controlled bursts even when using an automatic weapon.The game's visuals go a long way in immersing me in the nuked-out, dead world where everyone is concerned only with living long enough to see the sun rise the next day.  Sure, there are jagged edges to some building textures, and clipping and flickering, but they occur infrequently enough that I could for the most part pretend I didn't see them.  Some people complain about the \"dated\" graphics but I found them to be perfectly adequate in conveying the depressing world I'm forced to survive in.  The level of detail in the bombed out buildings, ruined roads, rusted cars, filthy clothes that people wear, and husks of houses choked out with weeds is stunning.  I usually don't put much stock in graphics (for good OR bad) but the visuals in this game are that important to drawing me in.I found it much more atmospheric and moody - and therefore more immersive - to play with the radio off, and let the minimalist ambient background music play.  The score is haunting and carries just a touch of sadness, and perfectly appropriate.  When an enemy approaches, the score switches seamlessly to a frantic, fightin' theme that gets the blood pumping.  By contrast, the corny 40s music found on the radio seemed out of place with a game of this type and just ended up being a distraction, although I do enjoy hearing Three Dog reporting on my feats.But I do have my share of complaints.  First, the character creation: all the male characters I create end up looking like they're in their late 30s, despite the fact I'm supposed to be 19.  On the other hand, all the female characters look like pre-teen boys!  Disturbing!  This is actually a step back from Oblivion where it was relatively easy to make my character look how I wanted.  Here, all my characters end up looking butt-ugly no matter how hard I try.  Everyone in the game has exquisite detail in their facial textures, but I end up looking like a creepy porcelain doll.  I remember in Mass Effect, my character looked like he/she actually belonged in that world because he/she had the same level of detail as everyone else, but not here.Second, the game has freezing issues: sometimes the game will just plain lock up, and other times the next spoken line in a conversation won't load, and the game doesn't know what to do.  This problem can be abated somewhat by saving often.  In fact, I recommend all players keep several save files at once just in case they make a decision they regret, i.e. accidentally attacking a friendly NPC.Third, Dogmeat is all but useless.  He gets killed way too easily, and when he's dead, that's it, he's gone for good.  This would not be such a major annoyance if he were a bit sturdier; maybe some DLC would be forthcoming that would beef him up some and actually make him a useful partner during combat.  Or maybe the game could have given me the option to revive Dogmeat: for example, when Dogmeat gets \"killed,\" the game could have given me a window of a few seconds to inject him with medication before he's permanently lost.  But as things stand he's just a hindrance, and I'm constantly babysitting him.  Finally I resorted to leaving him at Vault 101 and never looking back; as annoying as he is, I am attached to my pooch and don't want him dead.Fourth, the level cap at 20!  I don't understand this at all.  At the pace I'm going, I'll max out loooooong before I see everything in the game.  And once I'm maxed out, there will certainly be less of an incentive to keep exploring, keep killing enemies, and keep taking quests.  I could understand capping at 50 maybe, but 20?  Again, I'm hoping for a downloadable patch to address this.So there it is: aside from a few minor gripes I'm very happy with this game.  I can totally see myself investing 200 hours into this game like I did with Oblivion.  Bethesda has crafted another winner.[Edit 6/1/09]:  The problem I have with Dogmeat getting killed too easily has been abated with the \"Puppies\" perk I got after buying Broken Steel.  So I can FINALLY have my trusty pooch with me at all times.  Thank you Bethesda!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2008"}

The game has a story and conquest mode. The story covers the 501st Legion of the Empire. The story follows them from their first mission to the supression of the Jedi. After that they deviate from the offical story line. To win the game, requires the Empire to win!! That means all facts and story lines will not be canon after the Jedi Temple. The game play is similar. A great deal of the issues in Battlefront 1 was fixed in Battlefront 2. They added a space battle situation and rearranged some of the controls. The troop commands are now limited to follow me or move out. You have to purchase items depending on the amount of money you make in battle. There are some annoying bugs in the game mainly in the Conquest mode. Hero Han Solo has a laser pistol and once you earn bonus pistol thats when the bug kicks in. If you switch to cutter to repair something you can't switch back to pistol to fight. Any bonus weapons you earn must be load manually by switching from rifle to pistol then back to rifle each time you start a new game or respawn. Another bug is the suicide shuttle pilot. Once you land on an enemy ship and disembark, one of your guys reboards the ship, takes off and crashes into the bulk head. Space marines aren't very useful because I've never been boarded so some of the bonus items are useless like turrets in space battle. Flying a vehicle could cause you to lose the game if you spend too much time flying aroung in dogfights.The AI are still dum. They're smarter then their predessesors. Don't let them pilot spaceships with you as a gunner. You'll just die when the ship crashes into something. The turrets in the space battles are no good against other ships. Another bug is the Cantina music in Jabba's palace or Mos Isley. The music overpowers the sound and voice and plays throughout that stage of the game. It's an obvious bug that does effect game play in both story and coquest mode. The screen credits showed they had 28 QC and QA testers and inspectors looking at the game and yet I found these bugs in only a few hours of game play. The game play is good and even on the highest level, I made General very easily. That's the other issue I have with the battlefront series. They are too easy to win. I win 98% of the time on the most difficult level. I even opt out of using bonuses and still win. I sometimes lose due to bordom. My points so far after purchasing this game opening day: Games: 2036 Points: 175859  Rank: General Kills: 78985 Ratio 9.18  All my medals are Legendary. Finally, there are very little movie scenes in Battlefront 2 (5-7 seconds) and the loading screens are just pictorials unlike battlefront 1 with its animation. The graphics are par or a little below that. The figures look somewhat haze. The map details a par and the space battle are ok. I love Star Wars but I won't be rushing to buy first day releases after 3 title purchases that although great didn't push the enveloped and could have used more time in quality control to eliminate the bugs. Favorite trick: Place a mine on an empty enemy vehicle. As soon as they board it, they go BOOM!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2006"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYXSW","description":"","reviewerName":"S. H. Wells","summary":"Stylistic Western Shooter with Some Laughs","reviewText":"Some games are meant to be serious, others do not take themselves very seriously.  Gunstringer is definitely in the latter category.  The game is wrapped in a meta-narrative about a marionette puppet seeking vengeance.  You are the puppeteer.Gunstringer is the first non-sports game I have really enjoyed for Kinect. It works because it is funny and because the controls have a beautiful simplicity to them.  As many people have observed it is hard to \"get into\" a game when you're worried about kicking the coffee table or crushing your chihuahua when you trip.  As a puppeteer your hands and arms form the basis of the controls (for those who want to, you can even sit to play). Your left arm controls the puppets movements: raise your arm and he jumps, move your left arm right or left and the gunstringer moves across the screen.  The right arm aims and fires your gun (though there are several rounds where you use both arms to shoot rushing enemies with six-shooters in both hands).If this sounds easy, in some ways you're right.  The controls work because they are not overly complex.  However, dodging with the left arm and aiming with right requires a bit of coordination (think patting your head while rubbing your belly at the same time).  So there is a learning curve that makes the game have a fun level of challenge.Mechanics aside the level of styling makes Gunstringer a hilarious game to play.  You're fighting highly stylized western bandits, over-sized toy obstacles (with the occasional hand of an enemy pupetteer reaching down to set boulders rolling at you).  And of course, the enemy wavy-tube man that is a staple of used car lots across the mid-west.  These stylistic features create a fun environment to play in.The main detractor for Gunstringer, for me, is that you can never really escape the \"on rails\" experience for kinect.  Only during scripted fight scenes can you duck and cover and fully take the time to fight.  The rest of the time you're barrelling through the scenerey trying to catch as many bad guys with your right hand as you can before you run past them.  But this is a small factor me (if you generally dislike \"on rails\" gameplay you won't like Gunstringer).  So a 4-star game: I liked it.As a small plus (that probably could add a full star to the overall package) is that you get Fruit Ninja for free (DLC Code).  I hadn't bought fruit ninja when it was released on xbox live, figuring it was an 'eh' game.  I won't pretend that Fruit Ninja is deeper than it is: but if you play it, I would be willing to put money on it that you'll play more than one round.  It is fun to chop flying fruit... if you let yourself get into it, you can practice all your taekwondo that you learned as a kid (chihuahuas beware).  Fruit Ninja is, I promise, more fun than you think it is.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2011"}

Who would have ever thought that a red plummer with a big M on his hat would become one of the biggest (if not THE biggest) video game franchise of all time. The game is truly a masterpeice, not only does the controls (which I thought would suck) feel natural and tight but the movements of Mario in this game is the smoothest and has the most realistic physics a Mario game or any Platformer has. This really is a very ingenius game and I can't believe how much fun it is.The game is almost perfect but there are flaws. The PROS are the Graphics, this game is one big rainbow basically has every color possible and from everything from the star particle effects to the water splashes this game has one of the most incredible graphics around and really pushes the Wii to the limit. The controls are very tight and they also added a pointer to collect something called star bits and while this is a nice addition to the game, it could be a beat distracting especially for those who like to collect everything possible. The Sound could not be better, Mario is still basically mute just making noises but not any words, amazingly there is a lil voice acting but the creatures like Bowser and the Lumas just make the same sounds over and over. This game has a lot of replay value, you can beat the main game with 60 stars but there are mainly 120 stars in the game and there is no order to get the stars, you can get them whenever you want and even after you beat the main game there are plenty of stars to collect to kill your precious time and life. This game is a lot of fun also, each level (galaxy) is new there never really anything that is used twice in this game but technically they are used twiced just in different forms.There are a couple of flaws from being THE perfect platformer tho, first is the camera, the cmaera isn't that bad but you don't really have control of the camera and there are some spots you wish you did. Swimming with mario still sucks, I had swimming in every game it is slow and hard to control. The game is not as easy as some people say it is, there are some hard levels and the game can become a bit frustrating at times. Last is not a big of a deal, but although the controls are great sometimes the controls don't really respond to what your  doing, like when your doing a spin attack, the spin ended up being a lil late at times but maybe it was just me.Super Mario Galaxy is the best game for the Wii right now and if u don't believe me look at the other reviews, they will say the same exact same thing so go out and buy this and beleive me when I say it is the greatest Platformer so far (until another Mario game comes out).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"SB","summary":"Rises above its shortcomings","reviewText":"This game is a lot better than the sum of its parts.  That's because this game has what other games lack: an emotionally gripping story that makes you feel like the lead character in a gigantic feature film.  You really become the character and get swept up into the emotions and drama of an epic space opera.  Individual elements from other games might be better, and there are plenty of glitches, and lame aspects of the game.  But in the end you plow through all the downsides and let your imagination take flight, identifying with the character and living the story in your mind.I do have some major gripes that I hope the company resolves in future releases.  There's WAY too much running around empty corridors and standing around in empty elevators.  The interiors of all the various colonies, outposts, and settlements (aside from the those that feature in the main plot) are all the same.  Literally, there are like, 5 architectural models used over and over again.There is a maddening amount of driving around endless rocky landscapes in a stupid APC.  The landscapes of all the planets is practically identical.  Sometimes you can drive around one of these awful landscapes, agonizingly scaling mountains with your big car, in pursuit of a mystery blip on your map, finally locate the \"crashed escape pod\" and uncover...a cache of some grenades you already have a zillion of!  Arrgggghh.  Stupid!A lot of the combat, especially the combat you engage in during the side quests, is repetitive.  Many of the side quests are completely lame and stupid.  The NPC interaction with your crewmembers is a little shallow--for example, in KOTOR you had much deeper relationships with the various companions you picked up along the way.  You could even coach some of them into becoming Jedi!  Hell, back in Baldur's Gate II you could have a romance!The money system, and the buying and selling, are useless.  The only reason to even go to a merchant is to unload your excess inventory.  You can get through the whole game on the total overabundance of free stuff you find in all the lockers, compartments, crashed probes, etc., etc.But there are some major, major things to love here, as well.  I like that the combat is more \"hands on\" and visceral than in KOTOR, but that there's still a tactical element to it.  I really enjoy the combination of the tactics involved with leveling up, customizing weapons, choosing the appropriate weapon for the particular fight, pausing the combat to consider the various powers and weapon choices, choosing your companions and getting to do all the same for them.  I like the fact that you can heavily manage the squad or let the AI do the work.  (I wish sometimes you could leave the squad behind on the ship, though.  Sometimes I just command them to wait way back while I do all the fighting myself...)The voice acting is marvelous, including the work of the famous names like Lance Henrikson, Seth Green, Marina Sirtis, etc.  I played a female, and her voice was just exceptional.  The way the characters are animated, including facial expressions, is amazing.  You really find yourself identifying with your character's facial expressions!By the time I got to the end, I was really engrossed in this game.  I played through every side quest and visited/surveyed/landed on just about every planet possible.  Even though I found myself annoyed and frustrated by all the trudging around, whether on foot or in that stupid tank, and had to reload a bunch of times due to glitching and getting stuck on objects, I truly loved this game and am looking forward anxiously to the sequel.  That being said, if I were to play this through a second time, I'd be really tempted to skip most of the side quests and stick to the main plot, even though that would mean missing out on a lot of leveling up.One thought for everyone out there though: would you rather have this game, or would you just rather have had them \"remaster\", refresh, and update KOTOR I and II for this next gen console???  Or better yet, would you rather have them re-create a Baldur's Gate game for the XB360?  Think about it...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2009"}

Game's like: Grand Theft Auto, God of War, Mario, and Halo. which are mostly about fun gameplay. Then there's game like: Heavy Rain, Silent Hill 2 and Rule of Rose which are more about story or to make you feel like you're playing a movie, less about the actual gameplay. Both types of games are fun but I usually prefer the later. Bioshock Infinite on the other hand manages to be both. The only other game I know of that doe's this is the original Bioshock but Infinite improves the experience. The gameplay is fun and unique. Because of the huge arsenal of weapons, Vigors(plasmids) skyline, and the NPC Elizabeth can help a lot. The story is one of the best I've ever seen in a game. It has a \"I didn't see that coming\" ending. After I beat the game I had to rewatch the ending on youtube, but once I realized what happened I was blow away! I also loved that it was still political like the original. Really the only problem I had with Infinite is that you can only hold two weapons at a time, which is nitpicking really.

{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

It has two settings but the first is really poorly lit.  This is the older model, not the SP. These were lit from the front somehow, I was told, not backlit.  It is much less desirable then the newer ones I am about to describe.  I bought it out of sentimentality because it was in beautiful condition.This model later came in colors either gunmetal(dark gray), or pale blue or pale pink and id referred to as SP. The improved backlighting that lets you do either a normal or a brighter viewing is truly wonderful and presents beautiful games that look like the Sunday comics colors in the funnies of many years ago.The detail of the games is remarkably superior to the earlier ones that were made in red, black, or bright silver as the one mentioned. The newer ones were totally improved  These newer ones in pink, blue or gunmetal are the best that - in my opinion- were invented.  While improvements continue to be made in an ever-changing and updating market, there is nothing like these compact, pocket-sized Game Boy Advance SP handy and beautiful game players.They last forever (so it seems) and recharge quickly, lasting quite a while before needing recharging again. The have a volume control.  The Warioland 4, Zelda, Mario Pinball, Castlevania, Collapse II, Tetris and certain other games that stack and fling a completed row...you probably known what I mean..are really wonderful on this type of compact.While the exquisitely-made smaller (miniature) machines are truly works of art, they are harder to manipulate and strain the eyes a bit.  They do not have the choice of a bright or brighter screen but are also the more modern backlit kind.  They have less volume.  I would worry about eyetrain in a youngster, the same as too much time for young eyes viewing any computer screen but the difference is that today's computer screens often allow an enlargement of whatever material is to be viewed.As I mentioned, The one we are talking about, the Game Boy Advance SP(ecial) is portable ...absolutely perfect to fit in a pocket.The games are two dimensional and some of the games can be preserved so that you can turn the thing back on and  return to the same place where you stopped.Some can be played till you get everything you need to then advance to the next level.These games and the units themselves, are treasures.  The power cord/charger unit is still available...online if nowhere else., Some games don't let  you store the achievements and allow turning off the unit, but the Game Boy Advance SP does this., depending on when they were created, pretty much.I bought a bunch of the earlier games that were very primitive, just out of fascination for them and to appreciate where a game like Warioland 4 Super Hard Level is about.Not many people even know about this last one.  Kids would not know how to pursue it to this high level an  not probably have the patience or wisdom to figure it out.  Not to put down kids because they are creative and fantastic little buzzards....I could learn a lot.  I am 75 and at was 73, when starting on this adventure, had to figure out every single move by trial and error.  What a thrill to find the place in the wall that allowed Wario entry, for example, and how to avoid and overpower this and that.  Beautifully created and devised.  Some day it would be fun to tell the people who created these beauties what a contribution to the world of art and electronics they have given.I wish I could say that I was as good at the other games.  But if you are coming up to my age, and a woman, and never had anything like this as a child....get started with Warioland 4 and eventually Mario Pinball.  Just  don't bother with the gladiator on the end of that game.  The trip is great but the designers dropped the ball with the ending.  I have won it twice.  It is not worth the adrenalin it takes.

I have a 12year old son and a 6year old son that both have had the QUAD/ATV experience in the hills in and around Pennsylvania.  We take them there from Nj once in a while so they can use kid size atv's with the proper gear.I saw this item come up on the Vine and I was a bit hesitant to get another Video Game...but I figured eh, what the hay.....lets try it.The game was in our XBOX 360 the night we received it and it was played for an hour or two.  These two had gotten control of the game and they were modifying their own ATV's and doing things which I dont think they could do in real life.  Every aspect of the ATV can be modified, which makes the game a bit more fun and exciting.The usual run for a video game in our home is about 2 days and then the interest dies off....well not this time.  So far we are at about 5 days and I have seen hours of play on this thing with game saves.  They used it all weekend and really tweaked their 'ride' so they could do stunts and get the points for so called 'AIR'.  All terms that I was taught in the past two days.My older son was a little miffed about the actions of the game when one rider hits another...some hand gestures...but its a punch gesture and so he got over it when he saw it clearly.  :-)The game is fast paced and great for my 6 year old as well as my 12 year old.

You know that a strike from the top right to the bottom left will do it.  A simple, swift stroke will pretty much get the job done.  But alas, you get a side swipe instead, and you die?That is Skyward Sword in a Nutshell.  The game's enemies are easy, the controls are notoriously bad.  Imagine if you are playing the original Mario Brothers, and the A button worked 70% of the time.  You'd just give up after a while.  That what this game was.Now, I'm a Zelda fan.  If you check out my previous review of Twilight Princess (for the Gamecube), I really enjoyed it (4 stars).  I finished the first Zelda, Zelda for the SNES, Ocarani of Time, and Twilight Princess.  I enjoyed them all and finished each one.  But alas, I can't finish this one because the controls.  For example, you are suppose to point the sword straight up to gain some power.  Now, the control doesn't tell you want straight up is.  Sometimes it's straight up, sometimes you have to jab at a 15 degree angle left, sometimes a slight push 5 degrees behind.  It's really arbitrary, and really frustrating since it changes by the minute.  When you have to do two in quick succession, it's basically a crapshoot.The Wii is not made for true gaming.  It is not responsive.  There was some poor control choices made for this game.  If they gave us the option to just turn it around and use the non motion controls, I'd be a happy man.  If they let us use the Gamecube controller, I'd be happy.Some of the controls work right.  Controlling the Beetle (a flying projectile you can control).  The nun-chuck movement is good.  But the sword and shield play suffer dramatically.Behind the control scheme is a fun game filled with great puzzles.  I didn't mind the control problems that much, because up until the end of the first temple, it wasn't that big of a impediment.  However, once I reached the first boss, I knew it was beyond playable.Maybe my Wii is messed up.  I don't know.  But I found myself playing against the controls instead of the game.  And it is a shame, because so far, it was an amazing game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00BI83EVU","description":"","reviewerName":"D. K. Malone","summary":"Fantastic game with one big flaw, or: How not to do driving in a video game","reviewText":"I haven't finished the game yet, but so far it's proving itself to be every bit as fun and engrossing as I'd hoped it would be ever since they unveiled it two years ago. This game's take on Chicago is up there with the last two GTAs' doppelgangers of NYC and Los Angeles. The city is usually teeming with life and things to do. I'm finding it quite difficult to make progress through the story line, because there is a constant stream of side activities popping up at all times, and generally speaking it's all fun. There was a lot of fear that this game would be a \"typical Ubisoft game\" i.e. the same handful of mini-missions and mini-games being repeated over and over and over. To some degree that's true, but there's a lot more than a handful so it takes a very long time any sense of repetition to set in. Personally I'm not interested in the \"multiplayer\" aspect of other players randomly invading my game to \"hack\" me, but it's only happened a few times and I don't mind it so much. I believe the more you opt to invade other players' games, the more often you will be selected to be a target for other players. I think I've gotten myself on the \"no fly\" list.I was disappointed last March when the \"Story Trailer\" was released and made it very clear that the game wouldn't be living up to the graphical splendor of the first demo footage shown at E3 2012. I'm happy to find that the finished product comes reasonably close. Digital Foundry's analysis has shown that, at least for now, the PS4 version is superior to the PC version in some ways, which is incredibly surprising. That's very good to know as someone who basically had to turn in their \"PC gamer\" membership card years ago (the last time I upgraded my machine was to get ready for Doom 3 and Half Life 2, yipes.) This game generally looks great. I haven't seen anything as wonky as was indicated by the trailer in March.Now that the game is out, it's no secret that a lot of people think the driving is terrible. I tried to be optimistic about it- one of the biggest and most common complaints about GTA 4 was its \"horrible driving,\" which I found to be the most sublime driving in any video game in history (including GTA 5)- but no, unfortunately the driving in Watch Dogs is just plain bad. Sloppy. Stiff and unresponsive. Worse than the driving in any Saints Row or Sleeping Dogs. It only took me a couple of hours to go from \"My god, this is virtually unplayable\" to \"Eh, I can work with this I suppose,\" and I'm sure I'll be pretty comfortable with it by the time I finish the game. The development team leader has said publicly something like \"We worked very hard on the driving, we took all of the time and effort necessary to make it as good as it could be. We think we really nailed it.\" Puh-lease. Ubisoft, you really need to do your homework for the inevitable sequel... which I'm sure is already in development. Back to the drawing board, s'il vous plait.EDIT a few days later: Another note on the driving issue- As you progress through the game, you gradually gain access to more and more cars. There's a wide variety in how they handle, with the sports and \"performance\" cars naturally being better than the others. Paired with getting better with practice, the lousy driving does become a bit of a non-issue after a while. Still would like to see a lot of improvement in future WD games. What I really came to appreciate in this game is the stealth and combat. Top shelf stuff.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00019HNNM","description":"The close of a trilogy is a touchy thing. Miramax's slasher pic Scream 3 highlighted the role of each part: Chapter one sets the rules. Chapter two bends the rules. And chapter three throws them all out the window in favor of taking the story full circle.Which brings us to the third part of the Onimusha trilogy, subtly titled Demon Siege. In the first of many switches from the franchise's usual MO, there are three playable characters &#8211; Jean Reno's Jaques, the first Onimusha's Samanosuke, and Parisian military woman Michelle. Each offers wildly different play mechanics, and this coupled with the game's time warp storyline (more on that later) offers needed variety to a survival horror franchise that was never really know for its fear factor.Each character will upgrade their weapons and skills through the course of the game (much less so for Michelle, as she's playable for far less of the game than the other two) in the usual fashion&nbsp;&#8211; collecting souls. Without a combo-laden combat system, Demon Siege relies heavily on timing and strategy to master each of the three warriors. This mechanic is very reminiscent of Enter the Matrix for two reasons: minimal button presses result in onscreen action that looks very, very cool. Two, the timing of action is far more crucial than combos. The difference is that Demon Siege is just a much better game &#8211; the enemies offer more variety, the control is more precise, and the elemental weaponry is extremely varied.While some action hardcores will likely fault the game for its simple control scheme, most will appreciate it for the satisfaction it brings to the screen. Kicking a demon away so you have better range with the Ball and Chain of Doom (my name for it, not the game's) is quite cool, after all. Just keep in mind that plot and combat play equal roles in the Onimusha universe, and each are doled out fairly.On the story side of things, Demon Siege has that dual time period hook. How well is the idea executed? Well, Paris really looks like Paris; and without being able to experience feudal Japan firsthand, all I can say is that it looks beautiful in the game. The plot unfolds at a lightning pace and requires players to use one character (in one time period) to do something, which has an effect on the other character (in the other time period). Switching frequently, the game's pace is so well crafted that there are few places that seem to be a pause &#8211; you'll always want to do that next thing.What I really like about this game is that I always felt like I was getting a new weapon, going to a new area, or fighting a new boss (most of which are ferociously tough, by the way). There was no drag for me. That, and kicking Genma butt made me look badass. Personally, I wouldn't want anything else for my favorite samurai/horror sendoff.Concept:Craft a compelling, edge-of-your seat action game to conclude the Onimusha seriesGraphics:3D backgrounds don't mean that players have camera control, but it does mean that everything looks really greaSound:The score alternates between totally inspired and super cheesy &#8211; but it does fit the gamePlayability:Timing is the key to success and I rarely felt robbed, so it did what it was supposed toEntertainment:Demon Siege is one of the most cinematic games to date, and I soaked up every second gratefullyReplay:HighRated:9 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:The final chapter of the Onimusha trilogy radiates excitement and is the very definition of epic. The opening CG cinematic is so detailed and explosive that I wouldn't be surprised if George Lucas started handing out pink slips to the ILM crew. I know this clip is only a few minutes in length, but it is worth the price of admission alone. Further justifying that you absolutely need to add this title to your library, the gameplay is equally exquisite and is brimming with non-stop intensity. The methods with which you dispose of your assailants remain simplistic and true to the series. Plus, the battles are much larger in scope, the pacing of levels is relentless, and the visuals that you breathe in are all the more majestic. This truly is game development at its finest. While I would have liked to see more interaction in the environments, and depth in the combat, I really couldn't ask for a better conclusion to one of the PlayStation 2's finest series.Rated:9.25 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Forza Catracha \"jcva13\"","summary":"Best Onimusha","reviewText":"This game truly lives up to its hype. The opening cinematics and the cutscenes are great, one of the best I've seen in PS2. I really liked the game play and as in previous Onimusha games, bosses are challenging, and if you die a certain amount of times it gives you the choice of continue play in easy mode. They took away the friends side quest of Onimusha 2 that was boring. Although Jaques has diferent weapons and moves it's easy to pick up. ANOTHER GREAT IMPROVEMENT ARE CONTROL SCHEME, not like Resident Evil or Atari 2600's Combat. You might question the fixed camera, but you can ignore that with such artistic environments, specially the Arc De Triumph, and cutscenes. This is at least a MUST PLAY game. Even if you are not familiar with Onimusha, you will really enjoy this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2004"}

The software team at Blizzard has outdone themselves once again, bringing us yet another great Role-play stategy masterpiece.  Frozen Throne gives us more Warcraft 3, chock full of great new units, diverse new heroes, and 26 new levels in the campaign/story of Azeroth.  Frozen Throne is full of new items, creeps, and multiplayer options and levels.  I really can't think of anything worth complaining about concerning this release.  I myself found Warcraft 3 to be a little difficult; even after playing for months and honing my skills.  Fortuneatly, if you have a hard time with Frozen Throne and get tired of punching the monitor in aggravation, you can now adjust the difficulty of your opponent.  Three settings: Easy, Normal, and Insane.  There is also a nifty Handicap option in the setup screen that can make computer controlled players a bit weaker.  So aside from the cool new units and heroes, this game brings more balance to the Warcraft experience.  Blizzard has done a great job adjusting and modifying units, hit points, and build times from the previous game.  For instance:  Some buildings now build faster, certain units cost less food points, and the total food cap is now raised. - Adversely, some buildings now take longer to upgrade, heroes gain experience slower after a time, and particular items are now more expensive etc..  The list goes on.  Though I am glad to report that just about all of the changes are good.  The game is better balanced and a bit more fun now.  The new units and maps (even has weather effects now -/snow/ rain) breathe new life into the Warcraft world.  This is definitely a better offering than the original Warcraft 3.  -Hardcore RTS/RPS gamers and newcomers alike would be foolish to pass up a seat on The Frozen Throne.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2003"}

I was wrong of course, but instead it features a slew of copied fighters from Tekken (Playstation game), pro wrestling (There is a wrestler that looks exactly like Hulk Hogan) and Ninja Gaiden (very old Nintendo game). The game itself is much like Tekken and the graphics are astonishing, with incredibly detailed fighting arenas that interact with the fighters, such as electric fences, which do more damage and areas with deep snow where you can run through the snow and the snow stays matted. The fighters themselves are very lifelike, but the graphics alone cannot hold up this game can they? The gameplay is at best, quite different, there is a punch, kick, fierce punch, fierce kick, tag, and grapple buttons. The grapple button is used to perform unique takedowns, suplexes and or throws. The moves are quite simple to pull off, whether pushing a punch button or holding back and pushing a punch button to perform a different move. Because the moves are simple to pull off that makes for a quick learning curve, but a quick boredom curve because you will be performing the same moves constantly. There are great modes, such as a story mode, tag battle mode with good double team moves, survivor mode, which pits you against fighters until you are defeated, a watch mode to see the computer fight the computer, a training mode and a practice mode. In all, the game does not offer much to the fighting plate to make it different from the rest of the fighting games, other than its graphics, so skip this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2001"}

Had my first one on the legendary n64.  Anyway it felt like more of the same.  Had the genuine mario kart feel characters and stages.  Surprisingly enough the graphics didnt look like much of a change to me.  Guess its just me.The steering wheel adds a new feel to the game.  Makes it feel like you have more control of whats going on that with a simple controller. Being able to shake it up and down to perform tricks is a nice bonus for the kiddies so they dont have to use complex button combinations to perform tricks.  With the steering wheel the game just feels pretty fuild and well done.Difficulty ranges from beginner to basically experienced players.  The unlockables are all done through stages and seem to get pretty tedious over time.  Some unlockables require you to finish a circuit in first place to unlock.  This can be difficult and very time consuming for some.Lots of stages though once you unlock them all.  Some classics lots of new ones.  Typical forward and reverse corses.  Traps to set items to use to increase or decrease your odds of winning.  Battle is pretty fun with the new maps.Overall i give this game a 3 star rating.  Playability is lacking for me.  Graphics are ok.  Gameplay can be too challenging at times for its everyone rating.  Kids will be throwing their remotes at the tv!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2009"}

Other developers need to use this engine, because it runs flawlessly and looks great.I will add the caveat that the gameplay can be a little redundant, and the sliding mechanics are awful (I hate motion controls), but the good parts of the game fully offset these nitpicks, and it remains a five-star game in my mind.

In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong.

It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles.

I figured I then only paid 47$ for the system itself adding in the bundle. (I really wanted the metroid 2 echoes game too) I chose the metallic \"platinum\" color over the ugly plain jane black one. For me nintendo has far too many kiddie games and just a couple I'd be interested in, but my wife and kid like all the kiddie stuff and I already own an XBOX & PS2 that have more games for the teen/adult gamer. The 3 systems will entertain our family until the hype ends over the upcoming \"next-gen\" systems (Revolution, 360, & PS3)and they have price drops into 100-150$ each and have 20$ games available as well. If you get a gamecube I'd suggest adding the 1019 memory card for it(30$) and also an S-Video cable from monster cable. I really like the compact size of the gamecube, but I don't really care for the akward styling of it's controller very much, the N64's controller was pretty weird too w/ it's \"3rd leg\". It's also nice to see nintendo finally using discs instead of old-school cartridges. I was considering a Nintendo DS, but I couldn't justify spending more for a portable system w/ less powerful graphics than a highly rated home console like the gamecube. Maybe the DS will have a price drop down to what the advantage costs now(80$). The PSP is way too overpriced for me to even consider it and it's weak battery life and fragile LCD are major drawbacks to me.

HAH!!! i still did not give a hoot. my mind was fixed on nintendo. every night till the day it came out i was dreaming of how luigis mansion and mostly super smash bros melee would be like. the more i though the more i was filled with joy. who cares if x box has beter graphics who cares if ps2 has vice city. nintendo always has something no one else has. a special gift no other system besides nintendo can ever touch!! nintendo had the ability to make vice city but they did not. because gamecube has the power to make these lovable caracters that make u fill up with joy when u play them. the speacial feeling of the games r great in a way. either having a 4 player frenzy with ur buds or helping mario beat bowser gamecube will always bring fans closer in a way.every game of nintendo is colorful and fun because its all about gameplay. look at x box good graphics but not many good games. gamecube has good enough graphics but while having the best games ever!! every game for this system is fun and challenging at same time. its also small so u can fit it easily and carry it around!! best part is once again it is 4 playable and a good controller. ps2 is good controller but no multipayer with 4 people with out a multi ytap. x box 4 player but horrific controller at times!!! nintendo has been around awhile and stay because fans want more of these caracters. looking at gamecube it looks babyish but behold a dark side to the system. while so called \"baby games\" that adults still like are supposedly for kids they have M rated games. eternal darness, resident evil series(bloody game like this proves its not babyish), a new perfect dark, turok evolution, bmx xxx, and much more. game cube releases speacial fun games such as super smash bros melee, legend of zelda, mario part series, animal crossing, wario world and stuff like that so u can stick ur tongue out at other system owners. also they wish they had rsident evil tooo. so go ahead and stick ur tongue out again at the gore fans and the ones who call this system babyish. also gamecube does not actually have bad graphics it can push the system when it needs to. look at splinter cell and resident evil gamecube pushed the graphics so good it looks like x box!!! nintendo came out great but then it started going down. i knew this would happen. now gamecube is in 3rd place which is last but i trust nintendo i know that some where there is a energy locked up that will be used. i dont know when but it is released gamecube is #1 again!!! i trust them so much that i sold my ps2 . although i never played it a lot i had it for a couple of games. but then it struck me y should i get ps2 for a couple games when nintndo has all the games!!! trusting nintendo then and now i sold my ps2. and with the power of online and the games of game cube this system will be the best system for online!! the fist system i ever played was super nintendo when nintendo 64 came i bough it when it was exactly new. i bought it for 300 dollars. all my friends said i was stupid when they came to my house and played they started coming everyday. since then i buy every nintendo system without a doubt. so the bottom line is  its not that game cube that isnt rocking its the haters and players  that arent. stick with gamecube. if i can trust them so can u. and its cheap price tooo!!!! c i love gamecube so much i wrote too much!!!

Those who side with good will get to follow Frodo's journey through Middle-Earth, playing in battles inspired by both the books and the movies. Or join evil to find out what may have happened if Frodo had failed to destroy the One Ring, as you fight your way with Sauron back across the map in an attempt to destroy Rivendell, the Shire, and all that is good in the world.You can play as a warrior, scout, mage or archer.View larger.The online multiplayer mode allows for massive battles with up to 16 of your friends.View larger.Building off the model Pandemic used with Star Wars: Battlefront, Lord of the Rings: Conquest provides you with a first and/or third person shooter style of game that not only lets you command strategy, but also lets you control the players in the center of the action. Participate in the Battle of Isengard as an Ent or fight Saruman at Orthanc as Gandalf himself. Take on the Nazgul as Aragorn while still protecting Frodo, or battle at Pelennor as a Rohirrim cavalry soldier. And that is just for the good guys!In Conquest you will have to play many different characters in order to win. And it isn't always such a balanced match, as you will find yourself destroying towering siege engines and taking on hulking oliphaunts with your companions. You can choose to play all the heroes you love, or fight as a Nazgul tasked with killing Frodo and stretch your powerful wings as the Balrog himself in your battle for Moria.Pick Your Own Style of PlayIn the game, you'll be able to play as one of four different character classes. Choose the melee-based Warrior or Scout for up-close action, or pick the Archer or Mage to perform devastating ranged attacks. There is also talk of a 'special' class called the Guardian to give gamers a third choice. But don't worry about getting locked in, as you can actually change which character class you're playing on the fly, in the middle of the game's various objective-based missions.Each class of characters has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique special abilities. Playable units range from grunt soldiers, which are the weakest, to captains, which are the strongest AI units in the game other than the heroes. You also get to order in air strikes using either eagles or fellbeasts. Even better, players will be able to mount the occasional horse, unless they've chosen evil, in which case they will have to master the skill of riding a fearsome warg.Multiple Modes for Endless FunAs in Battlefront, Lord of the Rings: Conquest has enormous competitive multiplayer modes, including Conquest, Capture the Flag, and Hero Deathmatch. In addition to these classics, Conquest adds a Ring Bearer mode, in which one player tries to stay alive as Frodo against a host of ringwraiths, and Stronghold in which you fight on various maps in a Risk-style battle for territories. Fortunately, you won't be limited to roaming around with only your teammates, however, as battles occur in large scale with non-player combatants joining in the fray.Conquest allows online play with up to 16 players for massive battles with all your friends, or in two-player cooperative mode. Players can also play locally with up to four players competitively, or two-player co-op on a split screen. When in the game itself, fans will get the thrill of hearing Howard Shore's score for the films accompanying the action, and both good and evil campaigns are narrated by Hugo Weaving, who played Elrond in the movies.You can choose to play either good or evil, each with different endings.","reviewerName":"Deimos \".\"","summary":"Awesome game!","reviewText":"Have all the epic battles from Lord Of The Rings, play as hero's, or your own characters.

Also i think they should have updated the welcome screen to today's standards. So for any of those Mario fanatics or anyone that would love to visit there childhood this is a great package; but for anyone looking for more bang for there buck or something new this might not be the best product for you.This brought back so many memories for me when I was a child.

{"product_name":"B007VFHGZ4","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"This is how you do a reboot right, nearly perfect","reviewText":"The Good: The new Lara is memorable and more human, the gun play and exploring mechanics are tight and cinematic, lots of fun collectibles to find, interesting and engaging story, outstanding graphics and soundThe Bad: Boring multiplayer, not enough tombs to exploreThis is exactly how you do a game series reboot right. I wish I could end my review on that, but I need to tell you why. Tomb Raider suffered through a few mediocre games during the first run of the series during the late 90&#8242;s-early 2000&#8242;s. The first reboot did well for the series by maturing Lara and giving us better controls and a more cinematic experience. Now comes Tomb Raider in 2013, a fantastic game that shows the more human side of Lara. The game starts out with you and a science crew on a ship on the way to an achealogical site, but things go awry when Lara decides to head to the Dragon's Triangle off the coast of Japan. A mysterious storm destroys the boat and Lara and team are stranded on this island. There is a mysterious cult trying to sacrifice people to a sun goddess to end these storms. Lara has to deal with this if she wants off course.What makes Tomb Raider so memorable is the struggle she goes through while surviving. She is nearly raped, suffers tremendous injuries and has to cope with herself in dealing with the fact that she has to kill to survive. She is not comfortable with this at first and really struggles to pull the trigger. This adds layers of depth to her character that weren't seen before. Not only is her personality more memorable, but her looks have changed. No longer is Lara wearing the short shorts and tight shirt with her huge bust. She has been knocked down a few cup sizes and is much younger, straight out of college in fact. It's hard to really describe her more than this, you have to play the game to really connect.The gameplay in Tomb Raider has completely changed, but yes there is platforming and gun play. Both are tight and very well crafted. Gun play consists of using scraps to create a pistol, bow, machine gun, and shotgun. That's it. As you progress and find salvage in crates and dead bodies you can upgrade these to look like and feel like better weapons. There are many upgrades that increase damage and accuracy as well as adding new ammo types. Lara's animations are very well done and realistic and this falls into combat. She scrambles around and ducks behind cover, the guns feel great to shoot and you can see how inexperienced Lara is, she's not a Navy SEAL or commando. Unlike other games like this her stumbling animations don't interfere with the game at all. You can still move around, you can dodge, and there's even some melee thrown in. As you upgrade your skills (done at various campfires throughout the game) you can dodge and through quick time events can do some pretty gruesome kills.While gun play is tight and fun, exploring is just as important. This island is massive and you can go anywhere, there's no limits. Fast traveling via camps really helps, but there's a reason for moving around everywhere: collecting hidden items. These range from relics, GPS caches, documents etc. There are hidden tombs found throughout the game that hold area maps for these items. These tombs consist of cleverly made physics puzzles that are really fun to complete. You get rewards like art and 3D models to view. The whole game just has an amazing atmosphere and is just so much fun to explore.On top of all the climbing around you get a climbing axe which is an important tool for climbing and combat. Your bow is used for shooting ropes across valleys and canyons to pull items to solve puzzles, break doors, and access to new areas. The whole exploring ideal in this game is just fantastic and really fun. I did have to think about how to get to new areas and actually try to navigate and experiment, that' good game design. There is a Survival Instinct ability that highlights map markers, objectives, and when you unlock the skill, you can see items through walls.The story itself is a bit confusing, the whole spirtual thing is a bit unbelievable in such a realistic world like this, but that is what Tomb Raider is known for. Lara is the main character here and what she goes through was the main story for me. I loved every second of the story. The voice acting is awesome and the graphics look amazing, some of the best on PC yet. The new DirectX 11 features like Tessellation and the new TressFX technology applied to Lara's hair look nice, but there were a lot of bugs and glitches for Nvidia users during launch (they are now fixed). You will need a monster rig to play this game on highest settings.The multiplayer was tacked on late in development and is pretty boring. The combat was designed for cinematic game play, not multiplayer. It feels just like it does in the story, but it just doesn't suit multiplayer well. I played all of three rounds and got bored of the game. Some people may like it, but there are better multiplayer shooters out there.Overall, Tomb Raider is one of my favorite games of all time and is really memorable. The voice acting is solid, and Lara's new personality makes her more human and more relatable. The graphics are outstanding and the gun play and exploring mechanics are fun and very cinematic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXFKE","description":"","reviewerName":"MHoss","summary":"Not sure why this has 4 stars","reviewText":"I'm very confused on why people are giving this 4-5 star reviews. The only explanation would be that this was the first game they picked up from the story because this was, by far, the worst AC game I've played. EVEN WORSE THAN THE FIRST ONE.Where to begin:1. Game play - Obviously they were thinking, I don't know what the hell they were thinking. The combat mode was horrible, it took many, many steps backwards. They should find out the combat mode from Batman and use that because this was inferior. Also, there were many times that the buttons wouldn't pick up a weapon or the cities would be moving very slowly.2. The story - went to complete crap, I was very disappointed in what happened. When the second game came out you were sucked into the story, you felt that it was talking to you and you could be sucked into it. With this, it seems to be contradicting and boring. You start out the game as one player, playing it for a half the game, then you get transitioned into a different player as the game goes on .3. SHORT - This game is so short it should be have been set as a map pack. I should have foreseen this as Revelations was so short that this was going to be the same. The potential has been lost, I'm done with the games.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2013"}

The evil wizard Gargamel has created the Naughties, who kidnap Smurfette from Smurfs Village and imprison her in Paris. It's now up to the Smurfs to travel from the Enchanted Forest, through the busy streets of New York, into Paris, and everywhere in between to save the day and bring Smurfette home safe!","reviewerName":"T. Paslay","summary":"Maybe TOO childish, even for kids.","reviewText":"Let me begin this review by saying, I'm in my thirties and understand that this game is tailored towards those less than a third my age. That being said, I've been gaming since the NES was released and never felt that a game had to be rated T or M to be good. I still love Zelda, Mario, Rayman, Sonic, etc. You can make a game that is appropriate for children but still fun for adults. Apparently Ubisoft forgot that with The Smurfs 2.I was at least a little excited to get a crack at this title. I mean, I have fond memories of Saturday mornings in front of the big cabinet TV in the basement, eating cereal and watching Gargamel and Azrael terrorize the poor little blue Smurfs. I thought there would be some nostalgia and, if nothing else, some fun gameplay. Nope, this game is a platformer that's lackluster even by NES standards.The story starts out in the Smurfing Smurf village with all the Smurfs Smurfing a birthday cake for Smurfette because she's the only girl and they all Smurf her. (In that instance Smurf clearly meant love, grow up.) But Gargamel is up to something and they all start to freak out. I don't know how they know that he's up to something. Whether it's because he's always up to something or because they can hear the narrator, it doesn't say. Then as they're running around outside, a shadowy smurf figure kidnaps Smurfette and drags her into the forest. All the smurfs then run away, but then they're back because Papa Smurf gets bumped into and his magic crystals (we're treading a little too far into Breaking Bad territory here) fly out of his hands and land in all the Smurfs mouths. (Yeah, I dunno) and when they swallow, the magic crystals open up portals all over town. (Uhhhh...) The Smurfs know that these portals will eventually lead them to Smurfette. (Because why wouldn't they?) Oh, and due to Gargamel's magic all the forest creatures are freaking out and now they're evil which is really just a thinly veiled plot mechanic to let your five year old feel better about killing beetles and humming birds. I know the story is aimed at children, but they're kids, not idiots. Let's give them a little credit and try harder.Gameplay is pretty simple. You select a smurf from about 5 to start, you will unlock more as the game progresses. Each Smurf has a unique ability that coincides with their personality. Papa throws methanph... I mean, magic beakers, Grouchy stomps his feet to break blocks, one of them floats for whatever reason. You select which Smurf you want at the beginning of the stage and each stage can be replayed so you can utilize different Smurf abilities to collect all the special Smurf coins to unlock more playable Smurfs. You collect Smurf berries along the way to get better scores. If you get hit by an enemy, you lose all your berries. When you kill an enemy you get blue Smurf juice (don't ask) and when you get enough to fill up your vile you get double berries for like 5 seconds. It's ridiculously short. You can extend the time by killing more enemies and adding the Smurf juice to your vile before it's empty. It's all 2D platforming and is overly simplified and boring, even for a kids game.Graphically it's quite pretty but lacking. Everything is rendered nicely and animated backgrounds are included but most of the level design is so simplistic, it's underwhelming overall.Lastly, I know it's a kid's game, but I don't even know that kids would enjoy it very much. I think Ubisoft made the mistake of underestimating the children of today. The story is overly simple and weird. The gameplay and graphics are both lackluster. I think there are plenty of titles out their currently that you child would find much more stimulating.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2013"}

(Carrying your own personal turret that works for you is great fun later in the game.)If you do a save before hacking you can always go back and try again till you get it. (Hack everything!)and if its too hard use the hacking augmentation that reduces the likelihood of detection for each node.)A few of the Boss fights are seriously difficult and I strongly recommend you DO NOT GET the biochip upgrade you will be informed of half way through the game. (I did get it and if it weren't for my friendly little turret in the doorway I'd still be there). In the same vein the revolver (especially with the exploding ammo upgrade is a really good item to have for Boss fights.)Another thought is that the Laser rifle will be a great friend when you need it (Hydra at the end), so when you see a battery for it pick it up and when you get the chance to get the Laser rifle grab it and just lug it around till the end. (Augment your carrying capacity to max).These hints will make the game more fun it is a deep and satisfying game with plenty of shooting opportunities which permit good weapon control although I wish head shots were one shot kills. (Aimed mode does create more damage and increases effective range and they don't tell you that).I'm a fighter / killer, but you still have to use a lot of stealth just to survive and the game can be played almost entirely with stealth or at least non-lethal weapons, although to me non-lethal munitions seem to be severely lacking compared with lethal options. Doing it non-lethally would probably take a lot longer and doing it entirely by stealth may require more than one real lifetime.Great story, great game.If you get the DLC, Near the end there is a timed sequence and you can save both involved parties, but you only have 10 minutes from the time Keitner dies to pull it off, good luck.DLC was excellent too, but not quite as much value for money as main game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2012"}

It took him a minute to get over his shyness, even though it was just family, but once he did he had a great time.  The songs on here are easily recognizable, a few of our favorites are \"Whip My hair,\" \"Shake Your Groove Thing,\" and \"Burnin Up.\"I am not well versed on all the mechanics to the Kinect, but once you put the game in it is very user friendly.  Since this is a dancing game for younger kids, I liked  that the moves are slower and repetitive, but not so boring that we didn't enjoy playing with the boys.  I can even see our older kids (17, 16 and 12) playing around with their little brothers for a laugh.Once you pick a song, there are three dancers on your TV (all these kids can dance, and they look like they are having fun without being goofy OR cheesy), and you are told to follow the middle dancer.  (We have a Nickelodean Just Dance game as well, and you follow the same instructions, so I am assuming that is the case for all \"just Dance\" games.)  I would guesstimate that you do each move four or five times, so that even the younger kids can take a moment to get the hang of a certain move.Another thing I liked is the song selection.  My younger son enjoys listening to nursery rhymes and they had a number of those on here, while my 7 year old likes pop music, again a number of those choices as well.I think this game is easily worth the money.  It got my kids up and moving and we all had a good laugh.  Great family game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003O6G47U","description":"","reviewerName":"pennywyze","summary":"Better than I thought","reviewText":"I recently bought SH- Downpour for the Xbox360 via Amazon; and I want to smack myself in the head for not getting this game sooner.Being that Gamespot gave this game such a terrible review, I wasn't sure what to expect and being that I buy so many games from Amazon that I'm tirelessly working on to finish while balancing work and such- This game fell off my radar for a short while.Anyway, this is SH- downpour, a 2012 release and the newest SH entry to the series. Unfortunately, if you're looking for traditional SH, I'll be more than bold enough to tell you that you'll find some elements of SH within this game; but I thought more along the lines of Alan Wake rather than SH. (Which isn't a bad thing at all)The exception to the comparison ends being that SH-Downpour requires alot of thinking and you'll spend time hunting keys, household items, wires, weapons, etc etc etc.Onto the review-Graphics-SH- Downpour looks fantastic. I could compare this game against the likes of Alan Wake, but to be honest, Alan Wake had a bit more; graphically speaking. Still, I can tell much time was spent on this game on detail alone. The game has a vast appearance to it in which looking around reveals the sky, clouds, mountains, trees and intricate details like fallen logs, lights in the distant that vaguely peek through fog and so on.The character you use also looks fantastic. His hair looks like actual hair, his clothes wrinkle or tighten and loosen as he walks. His clothes are able to get wet or soaked or ripped or burned or stained.SH- Downpour also makes great use of light effects with the character's flashlight; which will come in handy being that this game is really dark.While I really don't have anything negative to say about the graphics in SH-Downpour, I will say that a few things bothered me which are minor gripes at best.First, the lip syncing is really poor. It looks average at best. Once you've seen games like LA Noire and such realistic facial detail, this game looks remarkably dull in that aspect.The other issue would be that when the game auto-saves, for some reason the frame rate can slow down to a halt or an annoying stutter comparable to lag. Thankfully, it doesn't happen often enough for it to have gotten on my nerves but it is notable.Other than these minor gripes, SH- Downpour looks excellent. It could easily pass for an exclusive title and is one of the better looking games to be released this year.Sound-This is the area of SH- Downpour that I wasn't exactly crazy about. To make a long story short, the sound effects are pretty good, but the music isn't exactly ideal whatsoever. Further, the game barely has music but once it does, it can be a bit overbearing and I found it to be \"too loud\" and not even with the effects. The worst part is, you're not able to customize sound whatsoever. So what you hear is what you get. The voice acting is excellent (IMO) but some scenes with music actually drowns out the voice acting altogether. It can be a tad annoying.Game play-SH- Downpour's game play is like Alan Wake meets Silent Hill. You take control of Murphy Pendelton, a convict in which you've the slightest clue why he's been incarcerated, In fact, the game opens in a rather satisfying way in which you'll brutally kill Pendelton's neighbor who accused him of whatever. This is as far as I'll get in the story. You're also given choices at times that will affect the story via button prompt.Throughout SH- Downpour, you'll have to use a lot of thinking; and doing so you're awarded the simple things in which this game takes from you. A foggy night outside is far better than being trapped in a dark house using just a lighter to see or perhaps it isn't.Downpour also requires that you make use of weapons in the guise of everyday items you'd normally pass by. Items such as a plank of wood, a brick or a rake can dictate the difference between a fighting chance or a failed attempt at combat. Of course, you're given the ability to fight with your bare hands which may work against smaller enemies; but not against larger enemies.The enemies range from wildly flailing their arms to scratch chunks of flesh off Murphy to a well organized group of baddies in which your best option is to run from them altogether.I found the combat to be satisfying and much better than previous Silent Hill titles being that the control is responsive.X is attack, A is activate/pick up item, Y is block, B is dropping items or putting your flashlight in your hand (however, you'll drop any weapon equipped)Click the Left Stick will toggle your flashlight on or off, the right stick is used for camera control and clicking it will zoom in. Left trigger aims a gun or an object you're able to throw and Right trigger is used to shoot or throw. The right bumper is used for running when held down. The d-pad controls med-paks, inventory or secondary items.In a nutshell, the control is solid.SH- Downpour is also a huge game and lacks a HUD, so getting lost is easy, but along the way you'll find maps which make life a little easier. Your character offers very brief hints at times, but the items you'll find lightens the game's slow pace considerably.Overall.I highly recommend buying SH- Downpour based off the following-The game's length.The graphics.If you like Silent Hill and Alan Wake.Customizable difficulty with gameplay and puzzles.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2012"}

On the 9th iteration of the Call of Duty is pretty much a shell of its former self.  What was once an exciting and innovate campaign, has become a slog of regurgitated ideas, uninspired level design, and painfully boring firefights.  Nowhere will you find anything as exciting as &#34;Death from Above&#34; or &#34;All Ghillied Up.&#34;  I don't necessarily lay all the blame at the foot of IW or Raven or any of the developers involved with the game.  I blame the consumer just as much, if not more (including myself).Let's talk about the campaign.  Yes, on the PS4, Call of Duty: Ghosts looks pretty good.  It's nowhere near AC IV or Killzone: Shadow Fall, but it's fine all the same.  My complaint is that there isn't a single mission in Ghosts that you haven't played before.  As each level came to a close, I could say, &#34;yep, did that in MW or Black Ops or MW3.&#34;  As the campaign came to a close, I couldn't think of a single mission I wanted to replay.  I was kind of like, &#34;that's it?&#34;  I was disappointed.I didn't find the story particularly compelling, even though it was written by a legitimate Hollywood screenwriter with a cabinet full of awards.  Though maybe that's the problem.  As is usually the case, the dialogue is mostly ham-fisted and delivered with all the enthusiasm of rectal exam.  It sounds like the voice actors are sitting in a studio reading lines.  Maybe they aren't, but i suspect they are.  Compare that to Naughty Dog games where they do motion capture with the voice actors actually acting our their parts.  The difference is night and day.I don't know if Call of Duty can be saved.  I suppose it doesn't really matter. People will buy it regardless.  But, with the billions each release makes, I'd like to hope they'd fine new ways to innovate and improve.  Unfortunately, Activision seems content to rest on its laurels and release a new game every year with nothing more than a fresh coat of paint.Vote with your wallets and don't buy another Call of Duty game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2013"}

Kinect seriously needs another year in development so I don't have to say things 20 times.Good: the controller is still great, but the PS4 Dualshock 4 really closed the gap here and now it is a toss-up in a category Microsoft used to win hands down since the OG XBOX.

{"product_name":"B0000503MO","description":"The third title of the Gran Turismo series takes full advantage of the new PlayStation2 game engine, which is capable of rendering about 20 million polygons per second--roughly 10 times the number of total polygons of the series' previous installment,Gran Turismo 2. Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course. They don't drive perfectly, either; some will spin out and make other mistakes over the course of a race.","reviewerName":"David Nakamura","summary":"WOOOOOOO HOOOOOOOOO  This is one great sim!","reviewText":"(NEW REVIEW)&gt;  Ok I'm updating my review now the game is out and I have tried it.  Here it is: Ok ok, sure there may not be as many cars as before but of course theirs a reason. Time. Each car is built of around 4,000 polys and takes 2 weeks to complete. In Gran Turismo 2 it took very little time to complete each car. GT3 had already been delayed around 4 times so would you want to wait any longer? I think that 160 cars is a damn fine amount.Ok first Graphics. What can I say? They are wonderful. This game has the most realistic lighting and reflecting I have ever seen in a PS2 game, or PC game. The cars near photo realism. Trees and other objects reflect off of your car in real time! No more pre-done reflections. The sun can affect your driving too, just like in real life. Its blinding. In rally modes, dust from the other car billows off the road, coming from all four tires. The dust doesnt dissapear right away, or stay coming up only a certain distance away from the car, it stays floating there for a while, like in real life. If you drive through the dust, dont expect to see much.Now the game play. Very good aswell! Set aside some time for this game because it will take some time to beat. Many many many races to complete, and secret cars to earn. Custom up your cars to make them faster and perform better. Wash your car to improve aerodynamics, change the oil to make it run better. Buy new suspension, turbos, intercoolers, brakes, gearboxes, wheels, weight reduction and more! But cars from, Honda, Toyota, Nissan, VW, Audi, RUF, Ford, BMW, Jaguar, Pagani and much more. Secret cars include a Diablo GT, F094/H F1 car, F688/S F1 car and a F094/S F1 car.Some cool extras in the game include I.Link racing, 3 screen view 1 player racing and the ability to use a steering wheel. The soundtrack is fairly good as well with music from Goldfinger and Snoop Dogg.This is the current must have for PS2.(OLD REVIEW)&gt; I don't see how ANYBODY could hate this game! I dont own it but I got to see it being played when a employee from Game Spy brought it in to an Electronics Boutique I was at. The opening starting. I was thinking that the filming of this car was great. That is, untill the employee told us that this is rendered footage. I said &quot;Whoah. It is? Its so shiny!&quot; Then the car drove out and I could see that it was in game footage. I was blown away. The man who was lucky enough to play it started the level and started driving. Wooo hoo it was a thrill just to watch! The graphics were so good it made me crap my pants. Actually not really, but it was still really cool! This game is the most realistic sim out there. The employee said that he knows a man who races cars and he tested this game out with a wheel and said that it was extremely realistic. Polyphony Digital also gave the game some cool extras, like the ability to use 3 tvs and 3 ps2s. you hook them up with i.link. One in front, one on the right and one on the left. THAS COOl. Each car is made up of 2000 to 4000 polys and they are very detailed. &quot;Working mirrors and move brake calipers.&quot; -PSM This game will be the must by of the year. The reason why they did not make more cars is becuase in GT2 they could make car models in VERY VERY little time. In GT3 it took around a week or so to make each car model.Another thing...I think that to acheive best picture quality possible you should buy either a monster 200 regular av cable or a monster 300 s-video cable OR a monster 400 component video cable.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2001"}

It had great graphics and sound and a terrific variety of gameplay. While 'Assassin's Creed Brotherhood' may not be a true sequel to the franchise it's a bigger and more polished upgrade to 'Assassin's Creed 2' with even MORE gameplay thrown in!'Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood' picks up right where AC2 left off: Ezio has defeated the pope and got a trippy apocolyptic message and must fight his way out of Rome and into another revenge/conspiracy story involving the Borgia family. Meanwhile Desmond and the gang are also on the run and must explore Ezio's old hideout (now in a modern setting) for the artifact everyone is after. While the story itself is more straight forward than AC2's, it manages to perfectly balance the gameplay between Ezio and Desmond's story. I actually enjoyed exploring modern Italy as Desmond and am now getting more comfortable with his crew as characters. All the voice actors return and give the same knock-out performances as last time, especially Roger Craig Smith who's aging Ezio nicely.The basic gameplay in 'Assasin's Creed Brotherhood' is pretty much the same as AC 2's but is a lot more polished and refined. You can now take the offensive in combat and string together moves and instant kills (much like Batman Arkham Asylum's free-flow combat). Also you can now purchase property in Rome and take control of different 'Guilds' (Thieves, Mercenary's, brothels) and actually explore inside these structures and take part in side-quests and mini-missions. Even shops this time around have side-quests you can complete to get special weapons and armor!Along with the basic gameplay being amped up you can now recruit different people in Rome as assassin's, train them and customize and level them up. It's not a HUGE addition to the game but a fun one that gives you a sense of power over a group of people.One thing I want to make clear again: While 'Assassin's Creed Brotherhood' is a full game (took me around 20 hours doing some side quests) it's very much a EXPANSION of 'Assassin's Creed 2', NOT a sequel. If you didn't like 'Assassin's Creed 2' or did but are looking for the next step-up in gameplay, you should definitly save your money and wait for Assassin's Creed 3.I love 'Assassin's Creed 2' so I love 'Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'. It features the same excellent gameplay and gives you a chance to spend more time with these characters and setting. 'Assassin's Creed 2' fans: this is a MUST play!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2010"}

The platforming is slightly more improved over 2, and all of the systems that made 2 a great game remain in place here.I wasn't honestly expecting much out of the story in this game.  Still, they did a nice job adding to the story of 2, and building on that universe.  It's not quite as refreshing as the story in 2, but I was happy to be in this setting again.Graphically, it's good, but not great.  The PS3 version has a lot of screen tearing, but it's tolerable.  The frame rate, outside of that, is solid.  I didn't experience any game ending glitches.The one thing that was disappointing this time around was the \"full sync\" system.  Half the time I didn't know what the objectives were for full sync.  What really got me though, was there was no easy way to restart at a checkpoint to do the mission over if you failed a full sync.  Instead you have to start the ENTIRE mission over...which some missions can last an hour.  That system was frustrating and not an improvement.Where they REALLY made things better was the combat.  No longer is it just a game of counters.  Now you have to kick, shove, and counter.  I still found myself countering the majority of the time, but once I learned how to use the kick move, I found it to be a very effective way to do combat, and it made that portion of the game less one dimensional.This game can be had for very cheap now, and I highly recommend it.

{"product_name":"B0050SVNZ8","description":"","reviewerName":"D_Strasse \"D_Strasse\"","summary":"Oddly large","reviewText":"This is a very basic case for the Nintendo 3DS.  Here are the pros and cons of the case as I see them:Pros:* Affordable: Reasonabley priced for a simple product.* Amazon friendly packaging.  Arrived in a sturdy and perfectly sized cardboard box.  No wasted plastic clamshell and oversized box to accommodate it.* Sturdy zipper. Zipper should last as long as you need it.Cons:* Zero padding.  Hard neoprene case and micro fiber lining, with a flap for game storage is all there is.* Oversized. The case is about a 1/2 of an inch oversized on each edge.  This means the case could be an inch smaller in every dimension?  I'm not sure why the case is so big.* Securing the 3DS.  The case includes 2 elastic straps to keep the 3DS in place (another 2 are provided to secure something under the handheld. Instructions, extra stylii?).  Because of this and the fact the case is so large, the 3DS and slip around inside the case.Debatable:* Room for 3 games. Not a big deal for me, but if you're rotating through a bunch of games it could be.* No instructions.  Admittedly this is not the most complicated product - I simply mention this for thoroughness.  A card of \"other availble accessories\" is all that is included.Summary:I can see this being a great compact 3DS case IF it was indeed compact.  Sturdy case and storage for 3 games would be ideal for me but this case is just too large for me personally without the benefit of extra padding or security for the 3DS, which in my humble is a weird mix.  For me that means I'm still looking for the perfect 3DS case.Edit:This is a universal case, meaning it is intended to fit ALL DS models.  Considering that the DS XL is so large compared to other DS models this, we have the reason it is so large.  In my opinion then, this case is only really suitable for the DS XL and all other models, will simply swim in it needlessly, like my DS and 3DS does.  Extra space is used with really no benefit.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2011"}

I have had the Xbox 360 give me the \"Red Ring of Death\" just from doing an update. I had to go out and buy another console and that one also eventually had the \"Red Ring of Death\". As an aside, I have been reading that people have been getting the \"Red Ring of Death\" from connecting the Kinect to their Xbox 360s. I bought this version and now I cannot use my old Xbox 360 hard drive. One of Microsoft's ploys to sell you more of their hardware. Why should I have to buy a new hard drive when I already have one? Then they want you to cough up sixty bucks to play online for 12 months. On the Playstation Network you do not have to pay this ridiculous fee to play. If Sony can do it, why can't Microsoft offer it free, too? On Xbox Live Gold I found all these ridiculous commercials/ads which annoyed me. The first thing I see when logging in is a commercial for a car. I was fed up with Microsoft's greed. So I went out and bought me a Playstation 3 and have never gone back to Xbox 360 since. I have played the game, Call of Duty World at War on both consoles and have found that there is negligible difference between the two in terms of graphics and online play. Further, I discovered that Playstation Network has a virtual world where you can meet other people and go to places like the arcade and play pool, bowling or even stand up arcade games (all for free). Does Xbox Live gold offer this feature? No. Also, you can use your cell phone's bluetooth with the Playstation 3 to communicate online. You don't have to go out and buy a special Microsoft headset (which I do have and find to be cheaply made and uncomfortable). You can even use your computer's keyboard with the Playstation 3. Try that with the Xbox 360. If I want to upgrade the Playstation hard drive (which I won't due to the already large hard drive), I can use any 3.5 laptop hard drive. Further, you have to buy a special memory card for the Xbox 360 while you can use just about any USB flash drive with the Playstation 3. Finally, you can log on to your profile anywhere on another Playstation 3 without bringing a memory card when playing on the Playstation Network. With Xbox Live you have to carry around this silly memory card just to log on to your profile and saves. You cannot even back up your profile on the Xbox 360 while you can on the Playstation 3 (which you don't need to anyway because it is automatically backed up online). Why do they do this? So that you cannot share your Xbox Live Gold account with anyone else. Each Xbox Live Gold account is tied to a profile. So if your family wants to play with you online on their Xbox 360 you have to purchase one for each member. So if you have family members who want to play online, too, then you will have to cough up even more money. How's that for greed? So here's a breakdown why Playstation 3 beats out Xbox 360:1. Free online play.2. Can use just about any bluetooth headset/headphones.3. Can upgrade with laptop hard drive.4. Has wireless card already built in.5. Does not have a history of \"Red Ring of Death\".6. Can use any flash drive to transfer data from one console to another. You have to buy a Microsoft Xbox 360 memory card to do this function.7. You can log on to your profile and saves online from any Playstation 3 anywhere. With the Xbox Live you have to carry around their proprietary memory card in order to log on to your profile and saves. If you lose your memory card, you are out of luck.As a result, my Xbox 360 is gathering dust in my entertainment center and my Xbox Live Gold was a total waste of money. My Playstation 3, on the other hand, gets a lot of use. Had I known all of this I would not have purchased an Xbox 360 or the Xbox Live Gold. I hope that my review will help someone else make the right decision when choosing a next-generation console.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000JLIXI6","reviewerName":"Good Morning America","summary":"At $4.99 it's great! Anything more, it's utter crapola...1 Star","reviewText":"First, anyone who gave this game less than three stars...I understand. I picked this up used for $4.99 in 2012 on impulse (I was buying some other \"real\" games) but I played the original PS2 version and the fond memories and price made me make the purchase.This review is from a 2012 perspective, so if I'm hard on something, say...cough...the graphics please note, yes I know this is a launch title, but I am holding it against today's games, I don't want someone to read all the rave reviews on the graphics and feel snookered because they don't realize the reviews are years old. I'll make it short and sweet:Graphics - by today's standards - 7/10 textures are often flat and character designs are uninspired. It often looks a little murky or muted, like a PS2.5 - not quite next gen, but - Ninja Gaiden on the PS2 looked much better. the problem is, especially for anyone who played the first Genji, is that the graphics are really the show case for these titles.Game play - I read some reviews who compared the game to Ninja Gaiden. No. No, that is so false. This is a hack and slash title, nothing more. If you know that going in, and enjoy those games (I do, they can be a guilty pleasure) then yes you can have a great deal of fun. This is a run to area, fight a group of baddies, run to next area, rinse, repeat.Camera - 0/10 - It's broken. Not only can you not adjust it (which isn't a deal breaker, God of War made it work) it's just broken, there will be many, many, many times were there will be 5 or 6 enemies off screen but well within attack range. The controls are a bit sluggish making for many frustratingly cheap encounters. What makes everything worse is that the the right analog stick (the one we've been conditioned for the past 10 or so years to think of as the camera) is dodge - you will constantly find yourself going to that right stick to adjust the camera because it's so out of wack, and you'll end up dodging in the direction you're trying to move the camera.Story - MEH...with a game like this who cares.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you paid full price, heck, if you paid more than 10 dollars for this game, you son, got rrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiped off. But now adays you can find this game for cheap, So if you're curious pick it up, but seriously, go to gamestop, see if you can find a $4.99 copy, I did, and I'm happy with the game at that price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2012"}

It's so refreshing to see a game that not only holds stellar production values and plays well, but even better.....it requires thinking and problem solving skills to progress.  Valve does not take their customers for idiots.  All of this, combined with the incredible Source engine and Valve's hilarious and more than adept writing and presentation makes it a game not to miss.  The level design is incredibly ingenious and well thought out, and gives a great feeling of accomplishment after experimenting and finally succeding.  ESPECIALLY in co-op mode.  I haven't enjoying playing with another person so much in a long time.The only complaints I have are that this really has no replay value whatsoever once you know what to do so it's difficult for me to recommend plunking down $60+ for it.  If you can, I'd advise waiting for a price drop or rent it.  The frequency of loading borders on the ridiculous as well (10 second loads after every puzzle), which is curious as they're tiny rooms with redundant textures, not a Crysis sized island with a variety of hi-res ones.  I know it's running on the 360, but so was the first and I don't remember it being nearly this bad.Overall though, the good far, FAR outweighs the bad.  The reason I'm giving it four stars is mostly due to the replay value.  Honestly though, they're really just small smudges on solid gold.  If you've played the original, then you know what you're in for here, but more of it done better.  If not, you're in for a real treat...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2011"}

If you didn't find the gameplay in JGR compelling, or were overly annoyed with its camera, the sequel will more likely than not not change your mind.That said, JSRF is one of the most visually interesting games to come around in recent memory, and it takes the cel-shading technique pioneered in JGR to new heights. The individual levels are enormous, and the sheer amount of detail is impossible to take in immediately. From a Shinkansen among the skyscrapers in the Shibuya terminal, to the intertwined rollercoasters of Sky Dinosaurian Hill, JSRF is a distinct generation leap in technology forward from anything else out there.The controls have been refined and simplified somewhat, from JGR - gone are the directional arrow markers for graffiti (and it's not an omission that detracts from the game at *ALL*), and the camera and graffiti buttons have been separated (easily, the best control tweak made). Rails are easier to grind on, but the control scheme can be a little frustrating at times. Halfpipe controls are still quirky, and you'll sometimes find yourself going the wrong way on a rail, and be &quot;stuck&quot;, unable to get off it safely.Still, the minor control issues and finicky camera don't detract from the *experience* of the game much - JSRF is still a fantastic world to explore. The soundtrack is *fabulous* as well, largely done by The Latch Brothers and Wavemaster's own Hideki Naganuma (who should be releasing albums of music independent of videogames, dangit).Again, the bottom line: If you liked JGR, it's everything taken to the next level. If you didn't like JGR, JSRF isn't going to change you mind.Personally, I *LOVED* it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2002"}

Mario and his brother Luigi must as always has to save the day.In 1988 in Japan, Nintendo has created a highly acclaimed sequel to the legendary \"Super Mario Brothers\" and was one of the biggest selling games in Japan ever. In 1989 when they announced that SM 3 will be coming to the US/Canada in 1990, gamers were excited including myself after reading about it in Nintendo power and i was anticipating for this game as i loved the first 2 despite part 2 not actually being a REAL Mario game as any Mario fan would know, during that year in December of 1989 many kids of the 80s including me when i was 8 saw The Wizard in theaters which was produced by Nintendo and at the climax of that filmed showed the awesome sneak preview footage of this game during the challenge which had every kid drooling for the game. On Feburary of 1990 after 2 months of anticipation the game finally came and it delivered. I remembered getting this for my 9th birthday back in June that year and i was playing it nearly all summer for it became my fave NES game ever and even had the merchandise to eating the food products and watching the toon.After \"Super Mario Brothers 2\" which was great but very different from the first game since SMB 2 was the REAL SMB 2 but actually just another game with Mario characters, SMB 3 returned to the classic formula and with new improvements so far. Not only did this game became a best-seller since then but also a game that defined childhoods including mine! this game offered new stuff like power-ups, new moves, new features and 8 rich worlds with many levels to explore. It pushed the limits of 8-bit games at the time as it boosted enough chips to power it, it even introduced the map system with mini-games thrown in. In this game you get a new thing called silly suits ranging from a Raccoon which when you touch the magic leaf you turn into a half raccoon person and can fly which has became famous since then to the Hammer Brothers suit which you can throw hammers at enemies to even hide in the shell.The graphics and sound are very good but the All-Stars remake and Gameboy Advanced versions are even better despite this game does have it's charms with the chunky pixel 8-bit look and the controls are excellent as well.

You take out bad guys in slow motion with your uzis or twin berettas, watching bullets whiz past you while your shots find their home.  The shots that miss hit the wall, producing splinters, or they hit bottles or mirrors, shattering them to pieces.  Bullet time is the highlight of the game.  It never gets old.But that's where the \"greatness\" ends.  The storyline is mediocre.  You just mow down the bosses lackeys, moving progressively on up the food chain until you kill the \"big boss\" at the end.  The game has good action but it has nothing besides that. There is only one way to solve every problem and most rooms have only one exit.  Go to room A, clear out the bad guys.  Go to room B, clear out the bad guys, etc, etc, etc.  There is no stealth whatsoever in this game.  The enemy AI has one setting -- \"always aware\".Worst of all, this is one of the shortest games that I have ever played - 12 hours, tops.  Replayability is almost nonexistent.

{"product_name":"B000FRU0NU","reviewerName":"Gearhead Mania","summary":"Great game for its time, not as good as Reach IMHO","reviewText":"Halo 3As someone that played Halo, Halo 2, and Halo Reach, I felt it was obvious that I needed to try Halo 3 and Halo 3 ODST. Since Halo 3 was released years ago, there's not much more new info I can say on the game. The single-player campaign story made no sense to me. Doing further research, the story begins where the comic book ends. I felt it would have been better to make the game Halo 3 pick up right after where the game Halo 2 concluded, not every gamer will follow the comics or novels. Speaking of the single player campaign, the transitions between missions were poorly done. It's as if someone just skipped several cutscenes and throws you into something new. Keyes's death made no sense either, she could have gone in with more support and perhaps some body armor.The interruptions from Cortana and Gravemind were a big nuisance throughout the game. The vehicle controls are still pretty much the same as they were in Halo (and Halo Reach) which I feel are very outdated. The physics don't feel right, and it would have made sense to use controls similar to that of other Xbox driving games.The game also takes eons to load the campaign if you decide to play another game other than Halo 3 because it flushes the cache. The Halo \"ring\" takes several minutes to load when it does this. If you shut off the Xbox after playing Halo 3, and return to play Halo 3 (and not another game/demo), the \"ring\" loads super fast. They need to work on this in the future because I recall some issues with Halo Reach, although not as frequent.Not much more can be said about Halo 3. The only things I'd recommend for Halo 4 are faster load times, more modern physics/controls for the vehicles (perhaps a helmet view or cockpit view ala Forza), and a better single player campaign.I started playing Halo 3: ODST and noticed many differences from Halo 3, namely that the achievements are more similar to Halo Reach which is a good thing. They are more oriented towards single player mode which makes it more fun. The VISR mode in ODST is similar to the night vision mode in Halo Reach. All in all, I'd say that while Halo 3 was ok, I felt Halo 3 ODST and Halo Reach were better.Overall: 3/5 stars","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2011"}

Or maybe it would be time to get more staff to make sure reviews are posted...........Enough of that, this product is a must get case that anybody should get.  The case feels more durable that any square metal case (such as the disastorus safe case made by schlock company Intec), plus it's made with the best materials, it's plastic, but it's as hard as rock inside (try pushing against the inside, and it feels like a solid wall.  The case leaves holes for the L/R buttons, the headphone jack, amd the charge portal, as well as the wi-fi switch and power switch.  It's very durable (like I mentioned), and it's a very sleek case.  Your psp will feel alot more protected in this case, and this case is a great case to protect your PSP in, it really works!  It's the best case for your PSP, it will protect it and it also doubles as a stand.  Just fold the two parts the other way and stand it up, and BLAM! you have a nice a stand.  To top it off, the upper part also serves as a visor somewhat, so at least a little less sun is shining on the PSP. And of course, you can play it right while it's in the case, so you don't have to store the case somewhere else.  The only minir downside is that you can't play the PSP when it's really sleek, and it adds more bulk to your PSP, but it really dosen't matter in my opinion. You probally don't worry about using the case at home, so you can play the PSP and feel the PSP's sleekness.  This case is simply THE best way to protect your PSP when you take it with you. ANd the handstrap is exposed to.I can't think of anything wrong with this case. If you have a PSP and you don't have this yet, you should buy it.  It's worth the dow.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2006"}

A must have to any MGS fan who owns the Vita. I had buyers remorse prior to receiving this since i own the original games and bought the PS3 HD collection version as well, it's hard to justify buying them YET AGAIN, but once you start playing and realize you've got this masterpiece games in the palms of your hands, it's a done deal... no more regrets. It would have been proper if they'd have been able to give us the HD version of Peace Walker, but I already have the PSP version on my Vita... so, oh well. The games look and play great in these quasi-HD upgrades, almost indistinguishable from the PS3 version relative to the screen size etc.EDIT: duh figured out how to aim now... it's more complex than the typical console versions. You can toggle aim via DOWN on the D-pad, i just didn't get it at first, you go into aim third person, then hit RIGHT SHOULDER button to get first per on or from the hip aiming via UP D-pad, it's kind of confusing at first so I've readjusted my rating back to 5/5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"potato_salad \"Marqus\"","summary":"Only got 5 stars cause you can't give it 10","reviewText":"This is probably STILL and will ALWAYS be the best game on gamecube.

It has more characters, more weapons, more levels, and has a tremendous replay value because it has about 300+ trophies to collect. The action is nonstop and frantic. Each match is different because all the characters are pretty well balanced. One may be lightning quick but weak(pichu) while another may be a plodding brute(gannandorf). No matter what Nintendo game you like, it will probably have a character from that game. Best multiplayer game of all time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2005"}

Some minor pain was involved when I was setting it up due to having to transfer licenses and buying a $20 kit to transfer over save info. But once I did those things, (well almost,) I was up and running. The fan is much quieter than my old one, though not quite silent. This Xbox has a port in back for connecting the Kinect unit without needing a power adapter. My coffee table makes having Kinect impossible, as I'm not rearranging my house for a video game console, but still it's nice to have the option. The power button and the eject button are touch now instead of being physical buttons, they do make a sound when you touch them though; ejecting the drive seems a little faster now, could be my imagination. The console is now black, with the 4GB being matte and the 250GB glossy. I got the 250GB, even though I hate gloss, because I don't plan on touching it much.

Why acquire all the expertise, if the bosses can only be killed by pushing one button when told then another when told and so on.Another flaw was the map system can only be zoomed all the way in or all the way out.  No in between.Another is the fast travel can only be initiated from bases and then only from certain ones to other certain ones.The enemies would have been more realistic if they could not locate you when you are hidden every time and shoot at you with pinpoint accuracy as you move even when they can't possibly see you.  They threw grenades with the same accuracy.  The grenades would land perfectly into any hiding spot and never miss.  The grenade launcher you are provided with was anything but accurate.I never could figure out what the &#34;model&#34; rewards were for.Also Lara can not run which can look and feel pretty dumb and be frustrating when she is slowly walking from danger.But again kudos to the programmers for not putting out poorly programmed mechanics.  All the stuff that was included, works. Even if they didn't always make the best or most complete choices.I could not justify buying any DLC due to the deficiencies being so frustrating.Unfortunately the few flawless games like Resistance have too short of a single player campaign.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2013"}

The third Forza this generation, better graphics, more cars, and better physics were promised in this iteration of Turn 10's Driving sim. Did they deliver?Oh god yes.-----------This review will have a few sections, this table of contents will help.(enter in ctrl +f dialog box to search)**1** Game mechanics---Graphics---Damage---Menus---Career---Community--------Auction House--------Storefront---Autovista---Freeplay---Marketplace---Driving**2** Online**3** Customization**4** Difficulty & A.I.**5** Sounds**6** Cars**7** Wrap Up**1**Game Mechanics:---Graphics:Great, they do occasionally look surreal, but the gloss textures are excellent, the drive by graphics are decent and the cars themselves are great. The lighting in this game is what really sells the realism, the cars interact with the environment and look like they are supposed to be there. Comparing this feature to the occasionally underwhelming tracks in GT5 and Forza 3 where sometimes the car was better animated than the track, the cars in Forza 4 look right in place on the pavement. Graphical hangups are nonexistent, and animations are fluid. In a word, Forza 4is beautiful.---Damage:Damage returns more or less exactly as Forza 3 had it. The car has prescripted crumple zones and damage is animated cosmetically if you set it, but also internally and performance robbing if you set it as well. The cosmetic damage leaves a lot to be desired, but with see-able damage on 500 + cars i can't complain. Though the damage is weak, it is better than it was in Forza 3. Bumpers and other components cave in and warp much more, and the damage zones are more plentiful allowing the damage to be more localized when hit. T-boning an opponent will leave a few dents in his doors along with much of the paint being stripped on the area hit. Its nothing like Dirt 3 or Grid's damage model though. Choosing to allow damage to performance is much more detrimental, hitting a wall can literally ruin your race, causing damage to the engine, transmission, gear box, brakes, suspension, driveshaft,and body will all cause power, handling, or aerodynamic performance damage. All of this causes lowering of top speed, shift times, braking distance, and a multitude of other issues. This is where Forza leaps into the big leagues as a sim, race clean, or don't finish 1st.---Menus:Forza is set up in a very simplistic manner, with a few main tabs to pick from that open to other tabs, the five main are Career, Community, AutoVista, Free Play, and Marketplace.---Career:Career works here much differently than Forza 3, there is actually a completion of career, and its guided by the announcer. The longer you play, the higher you'll level, the more races you can participate in, and the more places you have access to race. You start as an amateur and progress to the big leagues. after about 1.5 hours I'm 1.2% Should give you a good idea at the length. (300+ events in event list)In this tab, you can do all of the stuff you'd expect, buy sell cars, tune cars, upgrade cars, and see your stats.---Community:Play online with people around the world here.You can also make car clubs (like guilds for you Rpg people) to race with, check your rivals and leaderboards,  and use the auction house and the storefront here.For new players:--------Auction house:Exactly what it sounds like, a bidding place to purchase cars other players are selling. Usually you can turn good profit on nice cars here. Ironically you can usually save money buying here as well.--------Storefront:A player's place to sell their custom content like pictures, liveries, tunes, and custom vinyl work.---Autovista:Kinect featured but usable with a controller, Autovista is a first person look at some of the coolest cars in the game, and probably the closest thing to sitting in a Ferrari 458 Italia as you'll ever get. With voice over and 100% view-ability of components of the car. Its awesome for any gear head who wants to see these exotics close up.---Free Play:Basically an arcade mode, go race where you want using a car. Use this mode to test drive cars you want to buy buy can't afford yet.---Marketplace:One of the best Xbox live integrations for DLC I've seen, actually shows you what you're buying and what it is. Nice addition for those inevitable car and track packs you might not like.---Driving:For the most important part of a racing experience, this has to be spot on. It is, this is the first time I've seen a competitor really give GT a run for its money in the physics dept. High powered cars behave uncontrollably and require a knowing and practiced touch around corners, while underpowered cars must be mastered in the corners as well, as their weak powered engines depend on cornering to get fast lap times. The cars behave predictably and correctly in almost every way, and each one handles differently. Tuning works the way it should, and is intuitive and speaks to both gearheads and newbs alike. Driving is also fully customizable, allowing the user to put as much or as little burden of sim on themselves as they wish. The more assists you take off, the more money you earn in career.Forza does a great job as a simulator, but does fall flat in the rollover physics as one particular glaring flaw, as occasionally the car will just up and flip for no good reason if you hit a wall hard enough. Bit as often as you'll flip, I don't think this is enough to remove the game's physics engine realism.**2** Online:The multiplayer from 3 returns, but with one distinction. an extra gleaming gold tab on the find race tab. \"User-Created Races\" Basically, this is the room from forza 2 we missed so much, the ability to do whatever we want as a host. Sure we can't choose who the host is, but now options can be tweaked again. Thank you turn 10 for listening to us and giving us our player lobbies back. The best of forza 3's seek and play server usage combined with the option to play like forza 2. If this was holding you back, be scared no more.**3** Customization:Forza returns with its massive set of internal and external customization options, from engine swaps to body kits and spoilers, if you can do it in real life, you pretty much can do it here. Also comes with the best livery editor ever put in a racing game. over 1000 usable shape spots on most surfaces of your car means some awesome, detailed liveries, and some of the coolest things you've ever seen on a car. Your old stuff from Forza 3 is also importable to 4, downloaded a lot of custom vinyls? You won't lose them. Finally, a fully customizable and spectrumed paint creator is right there at your fingertips to paint your car any color you want. Forza has all of the tools for infinite possibilities for personalization, meaning no 2 users can easily make the same car. The best part? Upload your creations to your storefront to make money if they're good enough. If there is a market for your stuff, people will buy and you'll become known on the leaderboards as a tuner, creator, photographer or replay capturer. In addition, performing on the track will net you achievements and driving bonuses such as doing 20 perfect passes. Do these challenges and you unlock names and avatars for your forza playercard. Players can look at this and see what kind of driver you are or how far you've played in your career. All there for even more customization.**4** Difficulty and A.I.As a whole this game can can be really hard, but you have to set the difficulty to be hard yourself. So if you're really good, up your challenges and remove the assists for a challenging experience, or add some assists or lower the AI difficulty if you're having trouble. The game will reward better drivers with more cash and EXP though. So its in your best interest to try to get better to remove your training wheels.The AI is okay, its could be better, but its got a lot more life than the likes of GT where cars pretty much never fall out of line or differentiate from the best line. Cars here will get spooked, screw up corners and avoid traffic and you, and also will take aggressive action to keep position on occasion. It depends on the driver, as each is different. (able to be looked up in the opponents tab in my profile)**5** SoundsSounds are great, the soundtrack is good and upbeat and contains a good set of racing music, mostly as ambiance rather than sing along music, the menu music is nice, lower key music that's still just tense enough to not be annoying or grating on your ears.Engines and ambient sounds are well done and modified depending on car stats and mods, as you upgrade turbos, intakes and exhausts and other components the exhaust notes and engine sounds change. Engines also sound different (ford v8 vs a chevy v8) I used a Corvette Z06 06' and a Mustang Shelby GT500 10' to test this. Both sound good, and have their distinctive roars, without being the same.**6** Carsover 500 with the install disc and more planned for November etc. Every type of racing archetype is there, Muscle cars (in abundance!) Tuners, exotics, trucks, SUV's, Nascar (stock car shells), GT1, 2, 3,and Prototype racers are available. There is something for anyone. The Performance Index or P.I. also makes a return, rating cars from the cream of the crap to the cream of the crop on a scale from 100 to 999 with the index being split into F, E, D, C, B, A, S, R3, R2, and R1. I'm Unsure if the X class makes a return. The class often determines whether or not your car qualifies for an event, if it does, often similar cars will be racing with you and races will be more challenging, if you overclass, or underclass for an event if it is allowed, the race will be much easier/harder respectably.*side note* the average run of the mill car can be used in many, many events rather than just a few like in GT, often one car can be used in 10+ events stock and even more if customized to different specs or classes.**7** Wrap upForza is a way better game in every way than 3 was, more races, more events, the return of public custom lobbies, as well as the usability of the server system like that of Forza 3, with ability to play with only friends in customizable private races as well. With solid driving physics, graphics, car selection, and sound, a better interface, and massive customizability, its hard not to make a recommendation to any racing fan, If you're unsure there is a free demo on X-Box Live, give it a whirl to test it out. Otherwise, its a lot of game for $60.UPDATE 11/03/11:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Turn 10 has released some DLC:The November Speed Pack, including these cars:1957 Chevy Bel Air1992 GMC Typhoon2013 Ford Focus ST2011 VW Scirocco R2011 Audi RS3 Sportback2012 Dodge Charger SRT82012 Aston Martin Virage2012 Lamborghini Aventador LP700-42011 Ferrari #62 Risi Competizione F458 Italia2011 Audi #2 Audi Sport Team Joest R15++ TDIMore thoughts: I missed this on my review, but, Porsche is not licensed in this game despite the cars being created for it. Also, the cars past R3 when tuned from normal cars become a MASSIVE challenge to drive without assists. I've got a RWD BMW M3 pushing 700 horses with the new M5 engine in it. and it MOVES, but its so hard to keep her under control. In short, despite its readily increasing and sometimes frustrating challenge, Forza remains playable and awesome. I do intend to give the DLC packs as addendum to this review. as I have done. Game on.UPDATE 12/16/11:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------More cars:2011 Suzuki #1 Monster Sport SX42011 Mazda RX-8 R32011 Ford F-150 SVT Raptor1967 Chevrolet Chevelle SS-3961977 Ford Escort RS18001981 Volkswagen Scirocco S1986 Alfa Romeo Spider Quadrifoglio Verde1988 Pontiac Fiero GT2010 Maserati GranTurismo MC GT41957 Maserati 300 SMore updates: This game is stupendously long.

Forza will have porches sometime in may, as a whole, the DLC have added 60 new cars, some awesome, some eh. But as a whole has added more to the community and the car packs are more than adequately worth the price. I'm still playing this game, and I'm only at a 47% completion rating. I can't justify this purchase enough. Thank you Turn 10, for this game, for something to do in the wee hours in the morning and above all for doing every car fanatic well. This game, is the best racing game I've ever purchased. Its long, expands over decades, and even has the golden years of racing highlighted. (60's) This game is for racing and car lovers, and can be played by anyone with the willingness to learn it. With that, its DLC set is done. See you again, post Porsche pack.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2011"}

Developed by Rockstar Games, developers of theGrand Theft Autoseries, it is packed with an incredible selection of muscle cars, tuners, exotics, motorcycles, luxury cars and an incredible selection of after-market performance parts and custom kits. Enter the ultimate world of Illegal street racing with no track, no load times, no rules: Welcome back to the Midnight Club.Ready to roll at 245 mph?Roll in muscle cars, exotics or tuners.View larger.Or dust them all aboard a rice rocket.View larger.Race past accurate LA landmarks.View larger.Reach out and touch startling detail.View larger.Check out multiple in-game angles.View larger.Remember to keep an eye open for cops.View larger.A Wide-open LA Like You've Never ImaginedMidnight Club Los Angelesdrops players into a painstakingly recreated version of world-famous Tinseltown. Broken down into five distinct open-world gameplay areas, linked on the game map, cumulatively these areas comprise a massive area, much larger than anything ever seen in previousMidnight Clubreleases and possibly larger than any existing racer to date. Within these areas, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Hollywood, Mulholland Drive and Downtown LA, players are free to engage in mission play driving them to attain and customize a wide range of authentic world-class street racing vehicles, or to simply explore the city, taking on all comers in a variety of race types as they wish. Regardless, along the way they will experience not only the visual realism of the iconic boulevards, freeways, and landmarks made famous in TV and movies, but also the realism of the living breathing LA urban experience. Here traffic backs up then clears as people go to and leave work for the day, weather systems come and go and day turns to night, then back again. All the while the race goes on. It's all part of the living, breathing LA. It's all part of theMidnight Club.The CarsMidnight Club: Los Angeleswill feature an astounding selection of vehicles in the Muscle Car, Exotics, Tuners, Motorcycle and Luxury car categories. At the time of publishing only a fraction of the total list has been announced, but a good sampling of what players can expect at launch can be seen below. Click the links in each category to see screen shots of the cars:Muscle Cars&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saleen S302 Extreme&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chevrolet Corvette Z06&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dodge Challenger Concept CarBikes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kawasaki Ninja ZX14Exotics&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aston Martin V8 Vantage Roadster&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford GT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamborghini Gallardo SpyderTuners&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volkswagen R32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pontiac Solstice&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse GSXExtreme CustomizationMidnight Club Los Angelescontinues the tradition of offering some of the deepest vehicle customization you will find in any video game. The hottest licensed cars and bikes in the world are at your disposal - kit them out, supe them up, and personalize them down to the last detail to make them all your own. Visitthe Club'sin-game garages located in Hollywood and Santa Monica and let your imagination run wild - tweaking and fine tuning through the following three different types of vehicle modifications:Performance &amp; Handling- To become a street legend, you're going to have to tune your vehicle for maximum performance. The garage offers three levels of upgrades for virtually every component on your vehicle, but it's up to you to craft the winning combination that will give you the edge on the competition.Exterior- For the Midnight Club, stunting is a habit and its clandestine Los Angeles garages have all the toys needed to ensure heads turn in this jaded town. From making sure your car is dripping in candy paint, to adding unique body kits and jaw dropping extras, the garage offers practically limitless possibilities to personalize your vehicle with aftermarket accessories and customizable options.Interior- Don't embarrass yourself by pulling up with an outrageously kitted-up car that has a 'me-too' factory interior. Not a good look! You're going to be spending a lot of time behind the wheel, so renovate and make yourself feel comfortable.Beware or Befriend the Local CompetitionThe street racing scene ofMidnight Clubis tough, but tight, meaning that everyone that you meet in expansiveLos Angelescould just as easily be an ally as an enemy. One thing is for certain though, they are all willing to throw down at the drop of a hat. Just a few of the faces you'll encounter out on the streets are:Karol, Age 45- A veteran of Moscow's underground street racing circuit, Karol moved to LA in the 1990's after the collapse of the Soviet Union. If you're looking for cars, he's your man. He owns two successful garages and claims to be able to get hold of any vehicle, no questions asked. He also sees himself as a philosopher and will bend your ear if you left him. He mostly races around Hollywood and the Beaches and his rides include a 1975 Datsun 280Z, 1969 Boss Mustang 302, 2006 Dodge Challenger and a 1971 Lamborghini Miura SV.Annie, Age 31- Annie has a rep as one of the fiercest drivers in the city. She detests posers and wannabes, is intelligent and sharp-tongued and pulls no punches when it comes to cutting the competition down to size. She has been spotted in everything from a 1983 VW Golf GTI, 2006 Pontiac Solstice, 2008 Chrysler 300C SRT-8, 2008 Audi RS4 and a 2004 Ford Shelby Cobra Concept and can usually be found hanging out near Pink's Hotdog Stand in Hollywood along with her crew.Rockstar Games Social Club: Join the CommunityBeing a Rockstar gameMidnight Club: Los Angelescomes with a huge commitment to the gaming community.
