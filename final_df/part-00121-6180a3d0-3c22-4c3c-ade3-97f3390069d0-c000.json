{"product_name":"B0050SVGU0","description":"Mario Party 9","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"One of the best in the series so far","reviewText":"The Good: Great graphics, fun board games, keeping people together makes things more challenging, a lot of fun and well made mini-gamesThe Bad: Not enough board items, not enough boards or content, it would be nice to split players up some times, no online playI can't believe this series had gone on for this long. It was a super fun game back on the Nintendo 64 and continues to be so. The great thing about Mario Party is that it doesn't fix what's not broken. People love this game for the competitive nature and the super fun mini-games. Mario Party 9&#8242;s mini-games are pretty solid and some of the best yet, it just lacks content.The game consists of about 7 boards, but instead of everyone moving around individually you're all stuck in a vehicle. This makes things fun because you are all heading in the same direction and one person can decide everyone's fate. The boards are fun and offer a lot of variety. Bowser's Space Station has a jackpot and jackpot spaces. If you land on a mini-star space it adds to the jackpot. If the jackpot reaches 20 mini-stars a mini-game is thrown at you to determine who gets them. There are mini-bosses in each level, traps, hazards, and other fun things on each board. Blooper Beach has two islands that consist of negative stars and mini-stars. You are stuck on this 6 space island until someone lands on the space to get out. Everyone loses stars or gains them until that happens. This is what I mean about one person can decide someone's fate. It's like going on an adventure together and you have to stick together.However, I wish there were some other boards that allowed individual movement. You can unlock new vehicles with points in the museum, but there's just not enough variety here. The great thing about having so few boards is that when you memorize them things get challenging and you can get really good and have an advantage over your player. With everyone staying together the person's whose turn it is is captain. There are captain event spaces where that person gets to choose who moves during the board mini-game. It's really a lot like Monopoly where one person will be way ahead, and then suddenly lose at the end. That's so great about everyone sticking together, but it does have down sides.The mini-games are the best part about Mario Party and there are a lot here. They all use the Wiimote in a unique way and each are different and a blast. Unlike other Mario Party mini-games very few are unbalanced here. Everyone has a fair advantage and most require actual skill thanks to the Wiimote's design. Some games have you tapping buttons really fast, shaking, pinching and grabbing stuff, carefully tilting things around, and many others. Some Bowser boss fights get really fun and challenging where everyone has to work together some times, then against each other during other times. One mini-game has Bowser throwing dice onto the platform. Each side has a player's face, but one side has Bowser's. You want your face to show up the most, but not Bowser's. You have to decide to work together or against each other in order to get the most attack points.A real big let down is that there's no online play. This game is really only fun with other people, and is completely boring by yourself. It's great to relax with, but the AI is usually cheap and not fun to play mini-games against. I also wish there were other characters, boards, and more extras for the $50 price tag. The graphics look great, there's just a lot of aliasing which is to expect with the ancient Wii hardware. If you have a lot of friends who you play games with at home, this is a must have.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2013"}

NEVERMIND. It does not matter.What matters is that the game is fun. It has REALLY good action, REALLY good controls, and REALLY interesting level design. THis come from the same guy who made Devil May Cry, and it showes. The combat is nearly identical, the combos are almost word-for-word the same, and it is a good thing. Also, you are playing a long-legged woman wearing tight clothes that almost completely dissapear when she uses her boss-sized hair demons.Stop drooling.The game has EVIDENT sex appeal, the creators blatantly admitting that they tried to make the character more attractive to men. Hey, if it sells games, right?Other than the sexism, the game is really good. I could see a woman playing this if she has a relaxed view on genders. If a girl can see this a a strong woman comfortable being sexual around guy characters then thumbs up for her.

If anywhere near the 3 it will be great.But watching the trailers and how the programming and software was made and used in the game, Battlefield 4 will be a far better game in play and appearance than ANY other game on the market so far.Will see in the next few days, will come back when I can and update this reviewUpdate 11/17/2013Have been playing this game a little. I do not play online so can not comment on that avenue of this game. But in single player the graphics are great and the game play is intense. My issue is uncertainty of what to do where to go information. there is no ( unless i am missing it )good instructions, which can make it very frustrating at times.Attacking the tanks, sure get explosives and blow it up and then the second tank hounds your every move and gets you killed many times even through buildings, that's frustrating.Then the Sea Battle. After getting on the ship getting the intell and then being attacked, and obtain a rocket  launcher to blow up Helicopters that when you shoot them it bounces off ? Some one yelling give me targets ? and then no helicopters show up and suddenly they are behind you dropped from a Heli you never saw ? get beyond that in an intense battle and being shot from a ship that you can do nothing about and no matter where you hide or what your behind it still shoots you ? That is frustrating to say the least.The weird thing was after getting on a boat to get back to your Ship, your being attacked by other boats and there you are going to that ship and it took forever...It for me was almost an hour, I am serious. And one time there a warning came up saying you lost power and the boat stopped and then i was blown up ? Finally after several tries and not being able to catch up to Ship, I set out to destroy every boat I saw and when they were gone I still could not catch up to the Ship...and they kept yelling about a Helicopter...I finally set out to get it and Finally after chasing after it and destroying it I was allowed to catch up to the Ship...absolutely horrible situation with No instructions , all it said was, \"get to the Valkyrie\", that was our Ship.....never said but first destroy a couple dozen boats and then a Heli then it will allow you to catch the Ship....???After that another scenario being on a boat to reach shore which i was blown up in the water a few times for some odd reason from an enemy I never saw? Finally after a few times got to shore and was in a battle got behind a tank that kept yelling about giving it targets when they were all around it ? Frustrating so often with no information.Finally i was in a tank, used it to destroy a few tanks and then there was no where to go....had to get out and run around still not knowing where to go...on an occasion an arrow would appear on a direction map, but it was not always there? Glitch maybe ? Who knows...anyway after that can get in enemy tanks but None of them have shells to fight other tanks...so here I am trying to get to an airport and attacked by multiple tanks and you can not destroy them .I had anti-tank rocket launchers that would not do anything. I shot at one that when it hit the tank it killed me...seriously. Not the tank my own rocket.Like a battle earlier you had to put bombs on it and hit a switch to blow it up, these are so close together you can't get behind any of them they actually follow your every move. And they kill you even on other sides of walls....there is no where to hide and nothing you can get behind for cover.Again very frustrating battle scenarios and horrible camera angles at times. The graphics are great, the game play and instructions are vague and frustrating the battles are intense. But as a gamer the frustration causes me to have to lay it aside before i can continue it...so it maybe some time before I go any further with this game.But this is a review from an old man who plays games on occasion, I am not a everyday, stay up for days player and I never play online so take this review with a grain of salt.But i have played video games since they were invented, so that should tell you i have played video games for a long time. The graphics on these games get better and better however so many times the design gets flat on the story line and the directions and leaves the gamer often just trying to figure out what to do and why, which leads to allot of frustration and makes these games fall short of what they could and should be.Great graphics ..yes....story line...falls short...and instructions fall flat....leaves one frustrated at times, and way more than they should be.I am not to far along in this game, will move along when I get over this frustration, and can play again. Sometimes that can take awhile, while I go to other games that are better and I move along in them more and less frustration....so when i can move on in this game I will update this review, until then...I am stuck with a frustration in this game.From some other reviews I see i am not the only one who has a few issues with the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2013"}

With the easy-to-use PlayStation Move motion controller and PlayStation Eye anyone can crush, spike and smoke the competition in six challenging events that delivers the ultimate sports showdown.","reviewerName":"austin_Larry","summary":"You've got to move it move it","reviewText":"First off, is sports champions worth getting as more than just because it is one of the first move games available? an emphatic yes. Second does it show that move is worth the hype? absolutely. This game shows how incredible move can be and how move doesn't just surpass the Wii, it smashes Wii into instant obsolescence.You get 6 games all of which are worth playing. I will briefly describe my experience with each. First bocce is just flat out fun. Probably the one with the least exercise but the physics and creativity are great. The move captures your arm movement perfectly and can account for if you are spinning shots or not and how much arc you are putting on each. It also has bocce courts but then also bocce in different settings like playgrounds where trash cans and other obstacles come into play. Simple yet very enjoyable. Great for a family as it is the easiest one to do well in.Disc golf: FUN. Nice graphics, inventive courses. The move really takes into account your arm movement, where you release the disc, if you're throwing flat or at an angle, etc. As bocce does with the ball the physics are great here. The disc behaves like a real disc in the air and on the ground.Gladiator: I thought I would like this the most and it is fun, but as all the games are very enjoyable so it doesn't stand out. To Sony's credit, they didn't scrimp on any of the 6. The movements do not seem to be captured as well as some of the other games, but still swinging swords..can not complain. In the champions cup mode (this is the mode for all games where you compete against the CPU in various challenges) you get to have a more arcade like experience where you do a sequence of movements like the killing boss sequences in God of War or the Force Unleashed. Good workout. 2 controllers gives you a shield with one and your sword or mace for the other. BTW for you lefties out there like me, no worries, ALL the games ask if you are left or right handed and you can play everything leftie.Archery, also pure fun. With two controllers and one becomes the bow and the other the string. In champions cup  there are constantly changing inventive game modes. You start out with unlimited time, then you go to timed, then you go to both players shooting at the same target and only the first one to hit it gets a point and so on.Table tennis again shows how vastly superior move is to Wii. Arm speed counts, how you are holding the paddle (flat or curved) really counts, spin, when you hit the shot, where you follow through is aimed, etc. This one was the hardest one for me to get good at.Volleyball, perhaps my favorite and the most physically demanding. In fact as I write this I just got done with a few matches and my arms are physically aching. Sony did a great job here. All the movements of volleyball are re-created here, spiking, blocking, overhead serve (need two controllers or at least much easier with two), digging, setting. Incredible fun. 2 controllers makes all the movements more life like.I will make a few last points. Since move just was released as I write this, probably some people are wondering should I get this now or wait for more games, is this just a 'demo' packet or a solid game on its own. Probably especially wondering this if you already have an EYE like I did and hence are buying this as a stand alone purchase. I can resoundingly say that this is an excellent pick and I would expect this will hold true a year from now as well. The games are flat out fun. As an example, I have had my PS3 for around 2 years. My wife used it more this weekend with me than the previous 2 years combined.I already told my friends over the past 2 years the PS3 was the best entertainment system available. Worth every penny. Move just cements this and frankly leaves the Wii and from what I hear about the kinect, the 360 in the dust. The potential with Move is only limited by designers' creativity. My wife even said so when are you going to be using Move as a lightsaber? I replied it can only be a matter of time.I give sports champions 5 stars because each of the 6 games was enjoyable. Like buying a music CD and finding you like every track. Each one was well thought out. Each game is well developed with creative single player challenges and fun play options with other people. My last advice is this, order at least 2 move controllers. Not only for the games that use 2 controllers but for playing with other people. I've little doubt I am probably going to end up with 3 or 4 controllers soon.If you have a PS3 you are going to absolutely love this. If you are reading this and haven't bought a PS3 yet, lucky you. The 320gb move bundle is a steal and will provide countless hundreds of hours of move fun, fantastic RPG, adventure games, shooter games, family games (whatever your bag is), and still one of the best blu-rays on the market. I rarely say this, but Sony deserves a 5plus for this effort and for what I hope MOVE has in store for PS3 owners into the future.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00000DMAX","description":"Mario Kart 64, one of the first games released for the Nintendo 64  platform, is an updated translation of the very popularSuper Mario Kartfor the  Super NES (SNES). And while the game clearly takes full advantage of the graphics  power and speed of the N64, a few components that made the original so compelling  have been left out of this release.Still, Nintendo's expertise at sucking players into the game world is strongly evident, andMario Kart 64offers enough challenges to keep players (especially casual  gamers) entertained. Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a  sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race  computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks.  Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting  power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels.  Grabbing and using on-track items is the heart of the game's fun: a strategically-placed  banana peel sends the unlucky victim into a spin, nailing an opponent with a turtle shell  launches their vehicle skyward, and a rocket provides a quick boost to near-breakneck  speeds, if only for a moment.The multiplayer mode provides enormously chaotic fun for up to four players--flip it on  at a party and watch the guests congregate around the screen.--Eric TwelkerPros:Well-designed tracksSimple controlsStrong multiplayer appealCons:Computerized opponents sometimes pull off questionable feats","reviewerName":"theboombody","summary":"Easy","reviewText":"This game is pretty darn easy.  I beat most of the tracks with only a rental.  It's not near as tough as the SNES version.  Heck, the SNES version of Rainbow Road had no walls around the track and the track was thin to boot.  Rainbow Road is a cakewalk on this one.  Wide the whole way with walls all around.  Too darn easy.  However, there is a monster shortcut that's very dangerous to go for if you want to make things interesting.Even though it was too easy, I bought the game anyway.  It's fun to beat the heck out of these computer controlled suckers.  Plus I really like the game's ending.There is one hard level, the one with all of the traffic in the extra mode.  It can be very frustrating if you make a mistake, because you get run over again and again and again.  It usually takes away any hope of recovery.The most significant improvement over the SNES version is the time trial mode.  You can race a ghost of yourself after you've already completed the course.  The ghost is only a recording of your previous performance, but it gives you a lot more motivation to beat your old time, I assure you.I've never been into multiplayer modes, but if you're into that kind of thing, you'll REALLY love this game.  Some multiplayer matches can go on for a LONG time, since the levels are so well-designed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2005"}

Even being the huge Zelda fan that I am, Mario has still plopped into my head first; Mario, like Sonic is for Sega, is still a pop culture icon that seemingly doesn't age... and it all started because of this game.  Super Mario Brothers.THE GOODOddly enough, this game stands the test of time, even with later games (not all of them, mind you) that have seemingly better graphics and color schemes.  It has this otherworldly fun factor that somehow exceeds most games (kind of like Tetris).  The music may be old, but the soundtrack to this game grabs you by the cojones and forces you to like it.  Everything about this game, in fact, inherently grabs you like no other game could.THE BADPerhaps the only bad thing about it that I can say is probably the fact that I've gone through so many \"You found the Princess!  EHHHH! She's in another house, GO AWAY!\" scenes that it got annoying (for those of you who are going \"You got the phrase wrong,\" it came from a song).  But oh well... I suppose it adds to the charm of the game.OVERALLA classic game.  This should never be ignored.  In fact, I think game developers should test play this game and use it as a template for how games are made.  Not just as a platform aspect, but its blend of fun and difficulty is uncanny.  It's very saddening to see today's gamers not liking it because \"it has bad graphics\" or other such drivel.  I don't know what the mentality is, but back in the day, I guess us old gamers appreciated it more for what it was, rather than just a part of the game.  *Sigh*  Anyways, It's pretty common to find in game stores, so it's not like it's going to run out or anything; it's Mario, and he's here to stay.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2003"}
{"product_name":"B0085L2T14","description":"","reviewerName":"Andariel Halo \"Disillusioned Smark\"","summary":"A title for this video game review (Edited)","reviewText":"Go to bottom for my updateThis is my first WWE game since Smackdown vs Raw 2010.  Technically, 2009 was the last one I got; I bought 2010 in 2012 and it didn't last long for me.WWE 12 excited me primarily because it re-introduced the only thing that mattered to be throughout the yearly monotonous releases; being able to break up moves in progress, something highly controversial and oodles of fun in the WWE games on Gamecube; a Giant Swing in a Royal Rumble match would floor everyone else.But I never sprang for WWE 12, due in large part to highly mixed reviews and Randy Orton on the cover.  Plus by the time the price was down enough for me to consider it, WWE 13 was about to come out.  So I sprang and got this on release day.This being my first entry into the Predator engine of the new series, it's a mixed bag, but not in a bad way; more like a bag of candies with different kinds of chocolate bars, including that one disgusting chocolate you really hate and pass over.  It's mostly the same as Smackdown vs Raw series, but you get to break up moves.Also the controls are very much new.  Even nearly a year since I last played the SvR games, I'm still reacting in-game as if it were a SvR, using the right wiggly-stick to grapple, or the left bumper button to run.  The new grapple system feels unstable for me, and it's almost impossible to keep track of the multiple variant moves available from the 4 or 6 different grapple types, not even including the body targetting grapples.  I still hold the grapple button down sometimes thinking about Heavy Grapples.Something about the action makes it feel more condensed; as if the ring were half the size and there wasn't much space or stamina to run around, but this could likely just be the camera angle and being unaccustomed to the new button placement for running.Lots of fun customization for custom characters, including being able to pick their strength stats (though it lets you rank them at 100 from the start), weakpoints on their bodies, announced names (with several words instead of singular names), and a name for the commentators to use when mocking and deriding you for being an ugly monstrosity incapable of overcoming the unstoppable barrage of Hunico because all your reversals are Too Fast due to years of lightning-fast button mashing of the reversal buttons going back even to WWF Wrestlemania 2000.I haven't gotten to the story modes yet, but have played a few \"missions\" in the much advertised and vaunted ATTITUDE MODE storyline.  It appears to have no real story being told other than through matches, which include objectives (win) and bonus objectives (do it the way it happened in real history), shiny unlockables, and copy-pasted lines of commentary taken from the actual matches, with 80% of the lines blending in seamlessly and not having sharp variances in volume or pitch.Unlike previous years, you cannot skip songs in the game menus anymore, so it gets annoying.  The options for creating an entrance are retained from previous years, with movement styles labelled \"Superstar 01 - 9000\", \"Diva 01 - 02\", \"Legend 01 - 13\", and so on, and being rendered without your consent, so that it takes several seconds to preview each motion one after the other.Most of the ATTITUDE ERA stars are locked by default, so I am hoping Attitude Era heavyweight movers and shakers like Headbanger Thrasher, Headbanger Mosh, Steve Blackman, and SAVIO VEGA! are there waiting to be unlocked.  I also look forward to the chapter in the Attitude storyline covering Kaientai, from \"I CHOPPY YOU PEE PEE\" to the Jerry Lawler hilarity of laughing and making vaguely racist remarks when Taka Michinoku was eliminated from Royal Rumble 2000.  It sounds wacky and stupid like I'm joking but I'm not; I really would love to see those sorts of moronic things in the ATTITUDE ERA.EDIT:I'm genuinely impressed by some of the sharp attentions to detail with the Attitude Era mode.  It's not just a matter of commentary re-used from actual events (or re-recorded sometimes) but the detail they put into choreographing certain cutscenes or setups to look just like they did in real life, and most of all, the music.It's not just a matter of including \"Undertaker gong theme\" and \"Undertaker Ministry theme\" but everything in between, and chronologically accurate---Undertaker at King of the Ring 98 has his proper gong theme, and later in the year, has that electric guitar theme featured on WWF The Music Vol. 3, and has the entirely different Ministry version in 1999.  Similarly, Mankind from 96-98 has his sad string music, and in December 98, has that same version with a drumbeat over it.UPDATE:I never played WWE 12, but I do remember it being advertised that you would be able to break up moves in progress in that game, much like in games like WWE Day of Reckoning, though presumably smarter and with better collision detection.For some reason I assumed this would be the same in WWE 13, but it's not.  It's back to stagnant mediocrity, and no moves can be interrupted in progress.That was pretty much the only reason I even bought this game; for the ability to have multi-man matches play out realistically, instead of each competitor pairing off to have their own private 1v1 contests in different corners of the ring.Then, there's WWE Universe mode.  A more uninvolving piece of garbage mode I have not seen since WWF Wrestlemania 2000's \"Road to Wrestlemania\" mode no one ever used.  It's pretty much exactly the same thing, too; matches are set up, and you either play them or skip them.WWE Universe mode seems to be the complete opposite of the GM mode that was in Smackdown vs Raw games several years ago; you have NO control over the match setups, you have NO control over rivalries, feuds, drafts, or stories, you have NO control over championship matches, you have NO control over anything but superficially creating your own shows and pay per view events.The WWE Universe mode CLAIMS to have stories involved, but if they are there, they are kept away from you; you only get storyline updates in the NEWS section, where events unfold completely divorced from your involvment; Zack Ryder turns his back on the audience.  Why?  You'll never know.  How?  You'll never know.  So unimportant is your role that you can literally skip MONTHS AND MONTHS of shows and PPV events just to get to certain events, and it will have absolutely no effect on the game and supposed \"stories\" unfolding.With Attitude Era mode done, this game is done.UPDATEUPDATE:Apparently, moves CAN be broken up in progress.  It is simply nowhere near as effective as in the old TNA Impact game, nor as wildly chaotic (and fun) as the Day of Reckoning series and the like.  And the moves can only be broken up at certain points, and I've never been able to figure out the proper timing for these moments.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2012"}

The result is not without flaws, but functions adequately enough.The first and most obvious benefit of the Pro Elite is that it's been designed to mimic the Xbox360 controller's layout.  This comes as a boon to those of us who spend most of our time on Xbox, but crave the occasional PS3 exclusive.  The Pro Elite layout is close enough to the Xbox that I felt right at home with it, and didn't encounter any of the usual disorientation that comes with picking up a DualShock3.  And, speaking of Sony's flagship controller, the Pro Elite has both rumble and Sixaxis features that perform as they should.  Add in a slightly cheaper price tag for the Pro Elite and you have yourself a decent package.Before opening up your wallet, though, there are a few concerns to point out.  For reasons unknown to me, Power A chose to include non-standard features such as textured grip and backlit buttons.  At first I found the grip to be a good thing, keeping the controller tight in my hands.  However, I soon discovered that the grips were a little too pointy and led to discomfort during even the most modestly extended play sessions.  As for the button backlighting, I found it more distracting than helpful.  After all, as a serious gamer I really can't recall the last time I needed to look down at a controller to find the right button.  The lighting also bled badly around the \"Guide/PS\" button, suggesting cheap build quality and making it very difficult to distinguish between players.While attempting to innovate with new features, Power A missed a couple of obvious opportunities to improve upon the standard Sony controller.  Rather than increasing the weight to be more consistent with an Xbox controller, the Pro Elite feels too light.  And, instead of creating a user-changeable battery pack a la the Xbox360 controller, the Pro Elite stayed with Sony's design, forcing you to plug in the controller to top off the juice.The biggest offender, though, was the decision to connect the controller via a wireless USB dongle as opposed to built-in Bluetooth.  I'm sure this design element saved a few bucks, but the dongle is rather large and unsightly when plugged into the front of the PS3.  Furthermore, the range is fairly poor and suffers from frequent interference.  The dongle approach also precludes being able to turn on the system with the controller, which is simply asinine.Although frustrating, the flaws are not deal-breakers.  The lower price tag and ability to switch seamlessly between Xbox and PS3 is valuable enough that I can overlook a few minor gripes.  On the whole the Pro Elite does its job adequately and has replaced the DualShock3 on my coffee table, at least until something better comes along.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2012"}

Wind","summary":"Very happy Xbox 360 to PS3 migration","reviewText":"Okay, look... I had a PS1 when they first hit stores. I had several PS2s throughout the life of the system. i am familiar with the Playstation controller, and I used to really like it... Until I got my Xbox 360 at launch. I'm sorry, but the Xbox 360 controller is one of the best ever made, and I've had every console available in North America since Pong.So when I migrated to PS3 from my Xbox 360, I was underwhelmed by the Dual Shock 2 controller. While the motion control is kind of neat, the controller is too small, too light, and now I feel like the sticks are in the wrong places. Over the years, the D-pad has become little more than another set of buttons for most games, and having it placed where it is on the Dual Shock just feels... wrong. Sorry, Sony, but Microsoft did ONE thing better with the Xbox 360, and that one thing they did MUCH better. I even use an Xbox controller for my PC gaming.I found my enjoyment of games like Red Dead Redemption and Skyrim to be dwindling with the Playstation controller. I just couldn't get into it... So I was thrilled when I found one of these Pro Elite wireless controllers in my local game store. I had credit to spend, and I figured this was a good thing to take a chance on.Of course, third party controllers are often junk. I was prepared for the worst, but I was pleasantly surprised. This feels like an Xbox 360 controller, except that it's a bit lighter and doesn't have the true triggers of a 360 controller. Still, the triggers are meatier and better than the light, fluffy ones on the Dual Shock, and that helped my gaming immensely.So here's the pro-con list:PRO:Feels like an Xbox 360 controller.Buttons light up so you can tell Square from Circle or Triangle from X (I'm used to ABXY!)Rechargeable, and comes with the necessary cable.Has its own receiver dongle. Doesn't require Bluetooth channel.Analog sticks have thumb-divets instead of being rounded like the Dual Shock.Rubberized grip is a nice bonus.CON:Rechargeable battery makes it lighter than Xbox 360 controller and limits lifespan of controller.Wireless dongle takes up a USB port and replaces it with a mini-USB pass-through port.Triggers are more like Dual Shock than Xbox 360.Battery is dead when you first get it. Must be charged before use.D-Pad is a bit stiff, and may not be great for Street Fighter combos if you're into that.Playstation 3 doesn't tell you battery level on this controller.So there you go. Lots of good. Some bad depending on what you're looking for. I love mine, but I'm not a typical gamer. I don't get into twitch games or fighting games (anymore) and so for my casual sandbox gaming this is just what I needed and wanted. As long as the rechargeable battery holds out, I'll be happy.Final verdict: If you're an Xbox 360 gamer who migrated to PS3, you may want to grab this. If you're a Sony loyalist, then this will probably feel like some sort of betrayal to the Sony plan for your life.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2012"}

The game was intended to be \"friendly\" to all types of gamers.  Indeed, it might have made a mistake there.  I wouldnt have minded some sort of selectable difficulty option for combat.But the games wowed me in other ways:  The graphics are always impressively artful. And there's some technical wizardry that allows for crisp-looking graphics with real-time shadowing on the entire landscape.  Strictly from a graphical perspective, this game puts to shame GTA4 or Mass Effect.There's a decidedly UK sense of humor thruout the game that I find highly amusing. It kept me playing the game. Not everyone will agree, but cranky gargoyles that insult you in a Scottish brogue to shoot them?  I loved it.Some here have said the game is too linear.  I would have said that of Fable 1, but its not as bad in Fable 2.  There's a fairly large world to explore though its nothing like the massive world of Oblivion or Fallout 3.  I suppose if you dont do anything but the main storyline the game might seem overly linear.  But boy you'd have to go out of your way to ignore the sidequests and \"social\" elements of the gameplay.Just as with Fable 1, there are no hard consequences for anything you do.  So you can be totally evil and then do some good deeds and now you are \"good\" again as if you had never been evil.  Ideally, the game would have at least a few more permanent consequences or permanent rewards for being good and evil.I downloaded the game to the 360's hardrive as one can do now with the recent update to the console and that made a difference in loading times.So, its not a game for everyone.  Fans of Halo 3 multiplayer are better off with Fallout 3 perhaps.  But I'm a long-time gamer and I got my 44 bucks worth of entertainment with Fable 2. Yea its too easy, but not every game released has to be difficult right?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"W.

The production values, especially the voice-acting, are simply astounding.  More importantly, Bioware has constructed a world and story that truly feel like they have captured the essence of what made the original trilogy great.  Even the writing, of which there is a lot, is crisp and witty.  All of the main characters have laugh out loud funny moments, and you will end up really liking most of them by the end of the journey.  I estimate I've got about 5 hours of play time left in the game, but I've already started thinking about the changes I want to make when I play it for a second time.

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Relive the good, old gaming days","reviewText":"Sid Meier's Pirates begins with you as a 17th century boy, you and family taken away and jailed because of some unpaid debts. But you escape. Then it's fast forward to you as a young adult, elected by your crew as their captain. So, skipping over most details, here you are, sailing the high the seas in search for your family and, while at it, a little fame, glory, and fortune.The action part of the game starts out with a little colonization but that's only the beginning. The game gradually grows and expands as you play. There is a large map and, before you know it, you can find yourself stuck in the middle of the ocean, low food and water, commanding an unhappy and demoralized crew so make sure you plan ahead before you venture too far off shore.You will go through many ship battles throughout the game. In preparation, while in ports, you upgrade your ship and prepare for the unexpected. The battle can begin with a little cannon fire followed by, if the enemy ship refuses to sink, by boarding the enemy and, if you have the skills and the guts, dueling the captain 1 on 1 while your crew fights the other. The crew is very important because if your crew is defeated you are forced to surrender so you better keep the well fed and ready to do battle. If you defeat the other crew the enemy captain must surrender. The game falls on crew sizes because you can have as many people as you want on a ship. The ship will never seem crowded and when you sail with a large crew your cannons will reload faster, and your sails will change faster on command. And... they are going to need a lot more food.If you want to raid a town you need to fire at their port. The hard part about that is that you can't fire your cannons unless you're in a battle. So you either spend a huge amount of time getting the port's people that could be French, Dutch, Spanish, or English to hate you and attack you you or you miss a shot and hit the port. Either way that can get very annoying. If you do get the port to attack you their port cannons will start to shoot at you. This attack is kind of pathetic because it's usually only one small cannon shooting at you. If you get close enough to the port you can try to rush them and duel the head guard. Or you can try to sneak in and then the game turns super strategic. Your men become like board game pieces as you sneak through forests or try and run towards the enemy pieces and kill them all. This can become very hard if they outnumber you before the match begins so planning is essential. If you are victorious you can replace the governor of the town to whoever you like as long as it's not you.The graphics of the game are pretty good, considering its age. You can switch between two views. You can have an overhead view or a straight forward view. This latter looks nice but it can lag some of the slower computers.Pirates met and exceeded my not so high expectations for an old classic encore. I am giving this little game 4 stars (means \"I like it\") for the successful facelift and for a good balance of strategy and action. Even though the game shows its age, it's still a few hours of honest entertainment. The fact that my 12 yr. old is playing it should be a good indicator that the facelift did not fail. Buy it 'used' for a couple of bucks and you can't go wrong.--Alan was here-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2010"}

A PSP remake of Star Ocean, which was never released in the U.S., First Departure adds several new elements, including all new backgrounds and a tweaked battle system, while still preserving the exciting storyline and themes of the original.Star Ocean: First Departure has been given new artwork and animated cut-scenes.View larger.Enter battle with basic melee attacks, special arts, or spellsView larger.In battle, you can control a character while the AI handles your teammates.View larger.Back to the BeginningIt is Space Date 346, and in a sleepy town on the planet Roak, defense-force members Roddick, Millie, and Dorn are on yet another dull patrol when a mysterious plague begins turning people to stone. Fortunately, Ronyx and Ilia, members of a Terran Alliance reconnaissance mission, beam down to the surface just in time. They explain that the plague is actually a biological weapon, and they take the defense-force to the space vessel to discuss how to save Roak from this mysterious attack.The majority of this role-playing game (RPG) actually takes place in the past, because the party realizes that the only way to save the people of Roak is to collect a particular genetic sample from the Roak of old. The game play of First Departure is fairly traditional RPG that has you moving about the world map on your journey, traversing towns and dungeons, progressing the plot as you go.Choose the Right StrategyYou enter battle either using basic melee attacks, special arts that require MP points and that can grow more powerful with use, or spells that also require MP points but take time to cast and can be interrupted before completion.Tactics let you set strategy commands for your characters before they enter battle and can be changed in the middle of battle. All characters will fight according to their set strategy, with different situations requiring different strategies.Private actions are sometimes offered as a character approaches a town on the world map. These private actions depend on timing as well as which characters you have with you as you enter town.. The outcome of these private actions will affect subsequent private actions, for better or worse.All New Artwork and New CharactersStar Ocean: First Departure uses a slightly altered version of the engine used for Star Ocean: The Second Story, but with many similar features. However, the pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D battle fields have been given new artwork and animated cut-scenes, and new playable characters have been added.First Departure has been given a much more dynamic battle system, letting you control a character while the AI handles your teammates. During battle, characters can move freely about the field, executing normal attacks with the X button, and performing special attacks with the L or R triggers. What's more, you can switch characters at any time with a quick press of the Circle button.First Departure also features an item creation system that lets you create new weapons and items to help you in battle, and an extensive skill system for developing your character as you play. You can boost certain party attributes, spending SP on skills to increase your fighters' speed in battle, for example, or spend points that develop your item creation ability and raise your character's strength.","reviewerName":"Paul A.

{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"Flea Returns: FF13","summary":"A good game worth playing","reviewText":"Since high school I have had a slight obsession with the Divine Comedy so when I heard they were making a video game based on the inferno...let's just say I was looking forward to it.  Now, the story of Dante's Inferno is very loosely based on the divine comedy. The landscape is pretty accurate but the story line is nowhere close. Many of the reviews rate this game down because of how similar it is to the god of war series. I will admit that this game does borrow a lot of gameplay techniques from god of war but it has several aspects completely unique to this series.Gameplay: 5/5If you've played any of the god of war games, the gameplay is very similar in Dante's Inferno. This is a hack and slash game at it's finest. However, in this game you have two types of techniques. The first is using the scythe of death and hacking and slashing everything in your path (much like God of War). The second is using the cross as kind of a ranged weapon and a charging weapon.  Playing through the game, you collect souls as \"experience\" and use those souls to either level up your cross or your scythe, gaining extra abilities. There are also puzzles in the game that you have to solve to keep going. None of these puzzles were that difficult and most of them were just annoying. Then again, I hate puzzles. So I didn't mind that they weren't that difficult.Another added gem to this game IMO was coming across famous people in history and deciding to either absolve their sins or punish them. Depending on the amount of souls you punish/absolve your path is set. I rather enjoyed this extra depth added to the game. If I had to pick one thing I didn't like about the gameplay, it would probably be the difficulty settings. The easy setting is rather ridiculously easy. However, the medium difficulty setting (for me at least) showed a rather large difficulty jump. But that is very minor.Story: 3.5/5The story was interesting but not very deep. However, when looking at other hack and slash games, the story is never very deep. In this you are Dante, a hero from the crusades, on a journey through hell to rescue your lover Beatrice. Beatrice was murdered while you were away and has been punished for your sins. Not very deep. Not very original. But it keeps you going. I liked the fact that you run into people you know like your mother, father, and beatrice's brother.I'm not really sure where to put this but I figure I would put it here. There is a lot of nudity and sex in this game (probably more than any game I've ever played). Back in Dante's time, sex was something that was often wrote about and portrayed. In greek mythology, sex was very rampant, so to take all the sex and nudity out of this game would have been very difficult considering one of the rings of hell is devoted to lust and another is devoted to seducers. However, the nudity in this game was still a little over the top. But then again, so was the entire game.Graphics: 5/5What can I say. Graphics were amazing and in game FMV sequences were even more amazing.All in all I give this game a 4.25ish. It has it's flaws but I think that this genre has the same flaws just because the attention to these games are usually graphics and gameplay and NOT story. This game has great gameplay and crisp graphics with a decent story. I take a little off because of the over the top nudity and sexuality but just a little because a certain amount of that is needed in this game just based on the time in history this story was written. I also take a bit off because of how short the game was. I beat this game in my first play through in roughly 10 hours and probably could be beaten the first time in around 6 or 7 hours (i usually take my time with games so it takes me longer to beat a game than most people I think). This is also a common flaw in these type of games simply because the hack and slash genre rarely has an intriguing story that keeps you guessing. So only so much hack and slash can be done in a game. However, I still think that 60 dollars is a bit much for a 10 hour game. Fortunately, they will be releasing some DLC in the next few months (some of it free to PS3 users...oh yeah) which will add to the value.To write this game off as a \"God of War rip-off\" would be erroneous. This game does share a lot of gameplay mechanics with God of War, but the extra depth to the gameplay and the decent story sets it apart.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2010"}

Crawford \"shadowgmrlrd9\"","summary":"Good, just nothing revolutionary, lol","reviewText":"When I first played Fable 1, it was one of the first \"big\" RPGs I had played, and I loved it. Very immersible, fun and epic. Had a touch that leaves nostalgia strong with me.Fable 2 was also difficult for me to put down. I overall would've expected AT LEAST as long of gameplay as Fable: TLC, but this wasn't so. Even doing sidequests, the main story only takes a few days to complete, and from there the game's remaining sidequests lose some interest. Still, I admire Lionhead for going from medieval to roughly 1600's time. It was overall well done, and still very fun. Was it over-hyped? Yes, I think Peter Molyneux has made a habit of that lately.Now, for Fable 3? I was happy with it, but also disappointed. It was overall better than Fable 2, but a few things were chopped down, like NPC interaction. In Fable 2, you could choose your expression, whereas Fable 3 basically chooses FOR you, and I find that to be a big No-No for RPGs.Fable 3's pause menu, or lack thereof, is interesting, and would be nice if Jasper would STFU for awhile. The only REAL problems I have is how \"silly\" they try to be with the characters, what with NPCs being childish as all hell with few exceptions, and the character animations seems kind of \"bouncy\" at times. That mystical, almost eerie feel of the first game in nonexistant. Even Fable 2 had a few creepier elements.Then there's the \"difficulty.\"All Fable games seem to have a problem with easy bosses, but at least Fable: TLC's final boss did a BUNCH of damage, and a few challenging parts. But there's literally NO WAY to die, either here or in Fable. At least in Fable 1 you could die if you tried hard enough, but challenge apparently wasn't taken into consideration when making Fable 2 or 3.Overall though, the fighting is fun when you get some tough enemies, the graphics are very good, and there is ONE big challenge; saving Albion during the final battle, though saving up the money can be boring. If you like Fable 2, you will almost certainly like Fable 3. Overall, good and fun but doesn't hold a candle to Dragon Age or Skyrim.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2012"}

Total Control Batting is pretty tough to master, I am playing a franchise at the Pro difficulty level and I suck pretty much, I can pitch a shut out but can't muster more than 5 hits a game, which I guess is pretty realistic. Fielding is a mixed bag, some of the animations are goofy, and maybe this is just me but I get a slight stutter on my screen after the ball is hit, none of this effects how much fun it is to play, but worth mentioning.Graphics and presentation are top notch. Lighting effects are great and the movement of the sun during those late afternoon games looks great AND realistic. Player models for the superstars are great, but bench warmers have a pretty generic look to them. Ball physics have been spot on for me so far and the crowd looks OK, not cardboard cutouts, but generic enough to notice.Commentary rocks, simply put some of the best you will hear in a baseball game.People get all worked up about stuff like this, in NO WAY am I knocking The Show, from what I understand it is absolutely phenomenal, I chose MLB 2K10 because of Live, it's that simple. I have a lot of friends on X-Box Live, I am always interacting with my friends, chatting etc...as soon as Sony gets off their a$$e$ and implements cross game chat my PS3 will get a lot more love.I have no problems recommending this game to anyone, it's a good simulation of baseball and most importantly they fixed most of the known issues and it's a heck of a good time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0002RQ3ES","description":"Product Features Use camouflage wisely to survive deep in hostile territory Infiltrate and survive by paying attention to your hunting skills and instincts Use the interactive environments to your advantage -- creating traps to catch enemies and prey Features a blockbuster musical score composed by Harry Gregson-Williams Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater introduces new depth and thrilling gameplay. It's a new level of gaming, with all the detailed levels, thrilling gameplay and stunning plot twists players crave. Set in the 1960s, you become a legendary soldier sent to uncover the secret behind Metal Gear, a top-secret superweapon with nuclear capability. You are all alone in hostile territory -- but you will complete this mission, to secure the continued existence of human life.","reviewerName":"Nick Schwartz","summary":"Perfect in Almost Every Way","reviewText":"Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater, (said to be the last in the MGS trilogy, although a fourth has been announced) is not only the best game of the year, it is one of the best games ever made.  Gamers disappointed by the story and \"secret\" character in MGS2 Sons of Liberty need not worry; Snake Eater has no huge surprises, (although the plot does twist and turn).Snake Eater is a prequel to the first two MGS games; (and actually, I believe, takes place before the original Metal Gear as well).  It takes place in the 1960's, in the jungles of Russia, and as usual, a lone hero, 'Snake', is sent in to stop a nuclear battle tank from launching.Snake Eater is an enormous step forward for the series gameplay-wise.  Firstly, no longer do you have a radar.  You'll be utilizing various camaflouged uniforms to blend in to your surroundings and hide from enemies.  Also, since it is in a jungle, hiding from enemies is much more difficult.  No longer can you simply run around a corner or hide in a locker.  There are no corners or lockers, (save for a few instances when you arrive at enemy compounds).  You'll have to hide behind trees, on your belly in tall grass, or even up on a branch.New to combat is the CQC (Close Quarters Combat) system.  Get close enough to grab and enemy, and wealth of options are open to you.  Slit his throat; break his neck; throw him to the ground; use him as a human shield while shooting over his shoulder; or interrogate him for information.  Very cool, and very useful.Boss fights, and boss characters, as usual, are amazing.  The characters are intriguing, and the fights require skill and brainpower to beat.  PLus, instead of fighting in enclosed areas, some fights take place in the jungle, and one sniper duel in particular spans many screens, and a whole lot of space.The graphics are phenomenal, the best seen on the Playstation 2, and easily able to rival graphics found on competing systems.  Faces and character models are accurate and detailed, as well as extremely well animated.  The environments are huge, and varied.  Sun light streams down through the trees, fish swim in fast moving streams, snakes slither by you on the ground, and crocodiles sun themselves on small islands.Which brings me to another new aspect of the game: survival.  In addition to your health bar, you now have a stamina bar.  And instead of using rations to increase your health bar, your health will recover automatically over time, and the speed at which it recovers is directly determined by how much stamina you have.  Kill and eat food, (snakes, fruit, mushrooms, deer, rabbits, etc) to regain stamina.  If your stamina drops too low your aim will get shaky, and your wounds won't heal well.And on the subject of wounds, another new addition is the treatment of injuries you sustain during the game.  It is done through the pause menu, and you have to treat everything from broken bones, to burns, bullet wounds, and deep cuts.Add to all this the amazing story, and writing, plus the always unbelievably voice acting, (the MGS series blows all other games away in this department), and you've got yourself the game of the year.  I strongly suggest purchasing it.  I do not think you will be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2004"}

The gameplay is fun. The replayability is amazing because even though you beat the game you get to continue with your character. You can increase the difficulty to match your character's level and then head out to level up your character again. I really thought this was going to be a game that I would beat one time and then put it on the shelf. That wasn't the case. I bet I've beat this game a dozen times and it's still fun to play.

Starkiller, cloned and retrained by Darth Vader, escapes with surprising ease and reunites with the Rebellion, stumbling through conflicts attempting to reconnect with his past, and struggling with whether or not he is really a clone or himself.Gameplay is little changed. Quicktime events abound, as do repetitive droid and Stormtrooper enemies, along with the normal smattering of Sith acolytes and lightsaber marauders. What gets to be frustrating is how mind numbingly repetitive it becomes. On normal at least, its like progressing through a factory of bad guys, standing the end of the conveyance system until they stop feeding down the killing trough. There's little in the way of strategy apart from learning the one of two moves that cripple the enemies so you can fling them off a ledge.Where the game hits its highest and lowest points is with the storyline and cinematics. Jedi are Olympic level humans with psychic and telepresent powers. They are not supermen. They can't survive orbital reentry without a space suit, they can't survive a terminal velocity fall, and they can survive in vacuum. All of these things with occur, and some repeatedly. Countering this are scenes that're Star Wars to the nines, with simple dialogue but still managing a deep, complex message. You'll groan through some of the scenes and be relieved by others, though the ending is... troubling for a variety of reasons.Graphics are disappointingly repetitive. If the stages weren't as linear as a ray of light, you'd get lost between identical rooms with identical connecting corridors and filler furniture are statuary. Audio manages to still be well done, with similar forces from the prior game, though the dialogue is again hit and miss.This can be beaten in a single day, so unless you enjoy challenge modes, its strictly a rent. The single player story is decent enough, but not worth the purchase price until it winds up in the bargain bin.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2010"}

Whether you want to decorate your home, catch bugs or fish, or just chat with the characters in your village, there's always something to do. Days and seasons pass in real time, and you can visit the villages of online players -- even if they're a thousand miles away.","reviewerName":"Charlie Brooks","summary":"A great franchise comes to the DS","reviewText":"Animal Crossing: Wild World is a translation of the original Game Cube ANimal Crossing to the Nintendo DS. The game plays very similar to the Game Cube version, and has an addictive quality that seems to defy age and gaming preferences. You wouldn't think that a game about drinking coffee, delivering packages, and fishing would be engaging, but Animal Crossing manages to pull it off with a combination of goal-oriented game play and a quirky sense of humor that makes the franchise appealing to almost everyone.If you've never played an Animal Crossing game before, this is as good a place to start as any. As the newest resident in a town filled with talking animals, you can do pretty much anything you want. You'll have a house loan to pay off, but that goal can be secondary to redesigning the neighborhood, building your dream house, or collecting all the bugs, fish, fossils, and paintings that you can put on display in the local museum. The game can be played in dozens of different ways, and has no real end point.This game leaves out some of the features of the Game Cube version, such as the ability to play classic NES games or the chance to visit an island. However, it also has some new features to make up for those departed features, including new events, new items, and new animals. The animals now pack up before moving out, giving you a chance to talk your favorite residents into staying. The best feature is the use of the Nintendo DS's wireless communication, which allows you to play locally or online. One feature missing from previous versions was the ability to play with other people in their towns. Now you can play a variety of creative games or just explore a new town, all while your friend gets to wander about the same area.The one down side to Animal Crossing: Wild World, which exists in the original as well, is the fact that there are certain ways that Nintendo tries to tell you how you should have fun. For the most part, this isn't a big deal, but a casual player may grow frustrated that weeds spring up quickly if you don't visit your town every day, or that you can't reset the game without having the annoying mole Mr. Resetti show up and waste your time. This last bit is particularly annoying if the game freezes (rare, but it does happen), causing you to go through an obnoxious scene through no fault of your own. However, despite Nintendo's usual attempt to tell people how they should be playing their games, the DS version of Animal Crossing provides months worth of open-ended entertainment. It's something that almost anyone can enjoy, whatever their age, gender, or gaming preferences.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2009"}

Did I want to buy an Apple iPod Touch, or a Sony PSP? I only had enough money to buy one, and I was really itching for a new portable entertainment gizmo. After buying the PSP I'm really glad it was what I decided on, but for very different reasons than I expected.First of all, the reason why I decided to go with the PSP was that you simply get more for your money. The screen is bigger, the memory is infinitely expandable (buy as many memory cards as you want), the battery is replaceable, it plays movie discs should you have the desire, it can play MP3s, and it's a full-blown game system to boot. I initially thought I would use it primarily as a video player, and maybe get a game or two on the cheap. Not quite how things turned out.The screen on this baby is indeed beautiful, but it scratches easier than a pair of cheap sunglasses. The digital controls are perfect, but the analog controls are frustrating (bad placement, wacky sensitivity). The system interface on the other hand is a model of great product design, allowing you to do most anything you might want to do quite easily. For instance, during video playback one button press brings up a mini menu and a second button press can adjust aspect ratio (allowing your wide-screen  utube videos to fill the screen with no gaps). The video playback on this device is truly impressive. MP3 playback on the other hand just isn't as intuitive as it would be a full-blown MP3 player like an iPod, so I don't recommend using the device in this way unless it's your absolute only option. The problem with video playback of course is that video takes up way too much space at high quality (I average about 150 megabytes for 20 minutes), and has to be converted to be compatible. So unless you fancy yourself swapping high-capacity memory cards and doing mass-conversions into the wee-early hours of the morning, you aren't going to enjoy trying to watch lots of complete TV shows unless they're around 13 episodes encoded at low-quality.On the other hand, I was quite shocked when I actually started buying games for the system. Most games for the system retail at $30.00 to $40.00 brand new, and can be found used for a ridiculous $10.00 to $15.00. That's on average $10 to $20 cheaper than a DS game used! What this meant to me, is that while I own about 5 DS games that I bought over a period of years, in a matter of a little over a month I bought around 10 games! And these are not underpowered portable games, but full-featured gorgeous console-quality rivaling (or exceeding!) masterpieces like Crisis Core, Daxter, Lumines II, Monster Hunter Freedom, and Ridge Racer! If you are craving more console games like Wipeout and other PSOne and PS2 games, you simply MUST buy this system just for the crazy values! And strangely, there are games that actually BETTER on the PSP than on their full-blown console versions. Lumines, which I had played on the Xbox 360, and Virtua Tennis 3, are both enormously MORE enjoyable on the PSP. Maybe it's just the those games feel when you hold them in your hands, and maybe it's the way the graphics scale down. Maybe it's the great feeling of booting up a game in seconds without turning on your TV. Whatever the reason, there are indeed gaming experiences that are just plain better on the PSP.Now that I've gotten into the PSP scene, I find myself wishing I had a wireless Internet connection, just so I could download some games onto my PSP. I also wish my friends had one so I could enjoy playing some games with them. But even without Internet, the system is an absolutely tremendous value. And now I find myself getting excited for portable games that are coming out, like a portable Gran Turismo, and the next Jak game! If you love PlayStation games or extreme gaming values you need to buy a PSP. Just don't buy one new. You can get a used PSP for a little over a hundred dollars. Now that's a steal!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2009"}

I was wrong!Of all the launch games that I have played (star wars, rayman, pilotwings, rabbids) this is my favorite and the only game that i personally feel was worth the 40 bucks (reviews of the others to come).Steel Diver has 3 sections:1. Missions (campaign & timed) - there 7 campaigns each a max of 10 minutes, in order to unlock the last 2 you have to have played all the missions with each of the 3 sub types available.After each mission you get a periscope game where you can earn \"decals\" which enhance your sub's abilities. Very cool.2. Periscope Strike (enemy ships, enemy ships in a storm, enemy subs) - which is wicked fun! The enemy subs are hard. This is a great pickup game if you dont mind spinning around in public.3. Steel Commander - which has 9 maps (6 have to be unlocked) and a download play mode where a friend (with a 3DS) can play against you without having the Steel Diver game cartridge.This game is a turn based cross between minefield and battleship and is totally fun! I am completely addicted to playing against the AI (which often beats me). I love this game! I will soon try against a friend who has ordered a 3DS and I can't wait.The 3D effect is excellent, easy to see and IMO adds to the sense of immersion.I can't recommend this game enough, it is truely the overlooked gem in the launch title list and the only one I am still playing weeks later.As always YMMV!CZR","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00002SVWG","description":"In Final Fantasy Tactics you must guide your nation through a revolution while defending it from otherworldy forces!","reviewerName":"Joshua Eyre \"LinePlaneVolume\"","summary":"One of the best console games of all time","reviewText":"Final Fantasy is easily one of the best console games ever created. There are many reasons for this, but it all culminates into one solid reason... replayability. There is no other game that I can play over and over again (with each game easily stretching over 40 hours) and not get bored. It takes a lot of assets to make something this replayable. So what are these elements?1) Game Design: All of the stars must have aligned for the game play to come together the way it did. True character mortality makes the battles more intense. Weather, affinity, facing, luck, agility, are more clearly factors than they usually seem in other games. Character classes and how they can be leveled and discovered is so much fun to explore (Like the monstrous mathmetician and how he to use him well). There are a huge number of spells spread across all of the classes and the variety of the visuals and effects are incredible. There are so many things lurking in the background of this game that make it so incredibly deep and infinitely replayable. It is different every time you play it.2) Art Direction: The artistic direction of this game is so focused and consistent, that it becomes totally convincing and ultimately haunting. The character design, colors, and shadows create an amazing atmosphere that comes through on every single map. The visuals of the spells are beautiful... bursting with colors and interesting particle effects. At this time, Square's magic spell had such a unique look to them, that it was almost like recognizing a great artist's style. They really stood out that much over the other games out there. Even with the crude polygonal maps and limiting rotoscoped bitmaps, the look of the game is impressive even today, causing the replay value again, to be high, because it is always engrossing to enter this world.3) Sound: The music for Final Fantasy Tactics is broad in scope and style. The soundtrack takes up 2 cds and to listen to all of the tracks separate from the game amazes with the shear quantity and quality of every song. They range from epic to intimate and are all memorable. Once again, the replayability is bolstered... This time by the excellent soundtrack.4) Story: This is one of the few times that a convoluted Japanese video game narrative actually improves the game. There is so much going on in this story that there is a dictionary to keep track of all of the characters and events. Because of this boatload of information, and complexity of the story, it never really gets old either, so there goes another one for replayability. Each time you play through, there's a good chance you might pick up a little thing you missed the last time around.5) Unique Items: The game is packed full of unique items that can be pretty hard to get a hold of. From weapons to characters, there are all kinds of things to track down. If you look through a strategy guide, you will be amazed to see the reems of info on stuff you can go on side quests to get.I imagine there are lots of people out there with short attention spans who would get bored with Final Fantasy Tactics, so it can't have universal appeal, but anybody with a stitch of patience will get sucked into this game big time. It never seems like a waste of time and is fun and amazing on so many different levels that I could never go into enough detail to give it justice. But I can say that this game has stayed at the top of my list of best games of all time through the last three generations of consoles, and there have been some great games since then, and that's pretty impressive.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2007"}

This can be ameliorated (somewhat) by saving often. So, if you alert someone accidentally all you have to do is reload. Hitman Absolution hates this idea as much as it hates you, the gamer. Instead of letting you save whenever you want, making the game fun, you can only save at save-points of which there might be one or two a level.So, if you play games for mind-numbing tedium and extreme boredom as you reload AGAIN because after 5-10 minutes of work at the game, someone saw you...

{"product_name":"B000UW21A0","description":"Sony Uncharted: Drake's Fortune 98103 PC Games","reviewerName":"ITBeast \"ITBeast\"","summary":"Move over Indy and John McClane - There is a New Action Hero in town","reviewText":"I originally got this game as part of \"Sony's Greatest Hits\" Double Pack thru Amazon but I am doing the reviews separately for the 2 games.This is basically an updated game version of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" set in modern times (circa 2005 time frame) with the main character (Nathan Drake) as a cross between Indiana Jones and John McClane from the Die Hard movies with a little touch of Ben Gates from the National Treasure Franchise. While Nathan (Nate) Drake is neither an archeologist nor a police officer he does posses a mixture of the three characters mentioned with his own moral code of ethics that sets him apart from your normal Hollywood action hero.Anyways, the game starts off with Nate and journalist Elaina Fisher having retrieved the lost Casket of Sir Francis Drake off of the coast of Panama (Elaina's cable company having founded the expedition for her documentary) only to discover that the coffin was empty with the exception of a Notebook left by the person was supposedly to have been in the coffin (Francis Drake). After Nate's and Elaina's ship is attacked and summarily destroyed by pirates both are rescued by Nate's long time associate and Mentor/Father figure Victor \"Sully\" Sullivan in his water plane.After returning to land, Nate examines Sir Francis's Notebook and discovers that it holds the clues and possible location of the lost City of El Dorado, the legendary city of gold.  Sully insists that Elaina would just get in the way and possibly tip off more people about the treasure. So Nate reluctantly agrees with Sully and strands Elaina on shore while they head off to the Amazon looking for Eldorado (Elaina joins them shortly later much to Nate's surprise and relief).The game play is a true mix of intense shooter and RPG as you both fight and problem solve through the whole game. When playing you feel like you are more or less watching a great action movie with the benefit of the movie letting you control the actions and directions of the games hero during most of the games run. The controls are basically easy to use with the weapons end of it being easy to figure out and navigate. However, the hand to hand combat control option left a lot of room for improvement. There also is no stealth mode in which to quietly take out an adversary from behind other than shooting them in the back. Thankfully these short comings are rectified in the succeeding sequels in the Uncharted Franchise.For almost a 5 year old game the graphics and detail look great (of course the processors look slightly better but still looks great by today's standard) and you will love watching the cut scenes that truly make Uncharted much more of a game but interactive movie story telling.To sum it all up this game is awesome and I have no regrets purchasing it. I truly recommend you purchase the double pack of Uncharted 1 and 2. It literally brings the price of the games down to about $19 dollars per game (Not bad for games that when first released where $60 a pop). Besides, as soon as you finish the first game you're going to want to get started on the second one anyways.Just FYI, There is no DLC with Uncharted 1 however if you purchase the double pack there is DLC for Uncharted 1 in the Uncharted 2 game case.UNCHARTED Greatest Hits Dual Pack","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2012"}

P U","reviewText":"With all the hype I thought this game would be something special, what it turned out to be was a thankfully short, boring stinker. The story was lame and the action tedious and redundant. Also a few years before the game was actually released all the previews were totally different, there were images a cloaked baddies, and a totally interactive environment. This game feels like it started out as a huge sprawling sandbox action/adventure/horror/mystery then due to budget cuts ended up a lame shooter.Graphics -+ Nice, environments were very detailed- Environments all looked the same.CombatInnovative system of breaking down enemy shields with a flash light then shooting them to kill them. Cool at first, gets old real fast.Game-play -This game consists of going from point a to point b and getting to a plot point then repeat. There are 3 types of enemies, and a couple of unimaginative bosses (a back-hoe for example). The environments while nicely detailed all look the same, with little to no thought in the level design, often you just head in a straight line through a generic forest, a generic building, or a generic office. The is combat fun at first, but once the novelty wears off (about 15-20 minutes) it get's boring. what makes matters worse is the cheap shots the enemies take. You'll find yourself just walking along or worse, fighting off a horde of baddies, when all of a sudden they start spawning right behind you, basically right on top of you. This happens so often and becomes so damn frustrating that you'll be tempted to quit, not due to the challenge but due to the fact that the game just isn't fun enough t keep you caring. I finished the game in a day, yeah it's that short, and that easy (minus the cheap shots.)Re-Playability -None, getting through this stinker once is a test of will-powerVerdict -Possible rental, if it's cheap, or borrow it from an unfortunate friend who got taken in by the slick packaging. You shouldn't pay more than 5 bucks for this, if you are really, really curious though.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2011"}

Alan Wake is one of those games that grabs a hold of you and you feel like you need to keep playing to see what happens next. It's set up kind of like a TV show featuring different episodes each with a surprising cliffhanger and a recap at the beginning of each show. It's a neat idea really and now that i've played it i hope they will continue to release episodes over time. I recommend you log in to XBOX Live and download the free Alan Wake prequel webisodes to get you in the right mood and frame of mind.I don't remember the last time i played such an intense game. The gameplay is simply fantastic, you will be doing battle with the local Bright Falls folk which have been taken over by the darkness. In Alan Wake the light is your ally, any form of light be it your trusty flashlight or a bright flare will help keep the darkness at bay. Enemies are consumed by the darkness and are invincible until you remove the darkness from them using a light source. Only after you have cleansed the \"taken\" with light can you harm them, at that point you use one of the several different conventional weapons like a revolver, shotgun etc. The taken usually have melee weapons like axes and chainsaws and they like to sneak up on you in the pitch black darkness so you will be dodging constantly to avoid getting your head lopped off.The levels are very linear, you can occasionally go off the beaten path to look for extra ammo and items and are usually greeted by more disgruntled taken. When i first learned Alan Wake was somewhat linear i was a little disappointed, but after playing through 4 episodes (There are 6) my disappointment has been left in the darkness. Sure i would have liked this to be an open world game but then it wouldn't have been what it is. Alan Wake is a wild ride with many fine tuned scripted events.From a graphical stand point im very impressed, i was completely sold on feeling like i was traversing the small town getaway called Bright Falls. Getting everything to look this good without any framerate hiccups is commendable. Whether it be day or night, it just looks amazing.The story will keep your interest, i don't want to say it will blow your socks off but it does a good job of keeping you in the dark just enough, feeding you bits and pieces of backstory and what might lie ahead in the form of pages that are scattered though each level. As you find them Alan will read them to further draw you into the tale. But like i said, you should start with the prequel on XBOX Live, im betting after watching the 6 webisodes you too will hunger for some psychological thriller action. So go out and buy this game so maybe they will continue to create add-on episodes so i can play them! :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2010"}

Being a fan of both games, I definitely knew what I was getting into and definitely looked forward to it. This game does improve over certain aspects of previous Quantic Dream games though. Controls are more intuitive and yes there are a lot of QTE's but they have been toned down a bit from their previous games as well. The story (which is the focal point for a game like this) is quite well. One thing I will knock it for is that the story is not told chronologically. It's not a deal breaker but having to remember where previous chapters fell in order to know exactly when what you're playing at the moment takes place can be slightly annoying. I'll also give it credit for adding a bit more action oriented sections to the story than previous games so everything doesn't feel as slow paced. A lot of credit also has to go to the cast themselves for making scenes feel more organic and not overacting or anything like that. I will also say that this is my favorite story out of all of Quantic Dream's games. The graphics, of course, are top notch. Nothing really more to say than that. Even just running at 720p and on this older hardware, it's amazing to see how good this game looks on a nice television. It really makes me excited to see what these guys will be able to do with the PS4. Overall, this was a fantastic gaming experience for me and one of my favorite games of the year.This is definitely one of those games that can broaden gaming's appeal. Titles like this will also often bring up the \"This isn't a game\" argument. Things like that are matter of opinion and that's fine but i've realized that this company isn't trying to make \"traditional\" gaming experiences and that is actually something I think they should be commended for. Not being a fan of the game is fine, but the people who say it isn't a game to begin with sound very close minded.Ultimately, if you enjoyed previous Quantic Dream games, you will most likely enjoy this. If not, i'd say steer clear or maybe rent the game at most.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2013"}

It starts out kinda confusing because it bounces you around different parts of her life which cause to wonder why they would do this. Towards the end you find out why the story is like this and how it actually makes sense at the end. I really like games that can tell a story and make you feel apart of it. The controls were good but not always responsive to the motions of the ps3 controller. There were times in the game where it requires you to move the controller either up, down, left or right at a quick time event where it causes your character to dodge or block an action. There are times when the game mis-reads it and you get hit. I can remember a few parts where I know I followed the correct actions and still got hit.

(so far)","reviewText":"My first Assassin's Creed was AC3. It was highly enjoyable for me, although I didn't pay a whole lot of attention to the story. I hated the bits where I had to play as Desmond, and some of the missions felt extremely linear (especially the ones where you need to assassinate someone). However, I loved the gameplay, and it was a refreshing change from the typical FPS gameplay that I had been used to. After completing the game and doing most of the side missions, I was looking for more Assassin's Creed. Fortunately, AC2 became free to download on Xbox Live! Once I started the game, I was immediately hooked. Sure, it was a big change coming from 3, but it is just so much fun to play! You play as Ezio Auditore, a young Italian man living in the city of Firenze/Florence. Soon after the game starts, your father and two brothers are publicly executed. You grab your father's gear and seek revenge on the men who did this to your family. I won't spoil anything else, (heck, I haven't even finished the entire story yet!) but I can tell you that the story is amazing. The cutscenes are very cool and entertaining, the characters are very interesting (particularly Ezio and Leonardo da Vinci!), and the atmosphere feels great. There are a few cities that you can travel to in the game, including Florence, Tuscany, and Venice. All three cities are very cool, and are packed full of stuff to see, do, and collect. Treasure chests are scattered across the towns, and it's very rewarding to find and loot these. You can do missions where you beat up an unfaithful husband, take on an assassination contract, find and traverse through secret Assassin tombs (one of the best parts of the game!), and take over Templar strongholds. You can also purchase weapons and armor, unlock new capes for your character, or customize the color of your outfit. It's all very cool, and you really get immersed in this huge world. And then there's Monteriggioni, the small villa owned by your uncle Mario (pay attention to the first cutscene with him!). You soon find yourself there, and you're put in charge of renovating and upgrading the villa. There are many shops to be renovated, and it's extremely rewarding to do so. Every 20 minutes, you receive a specific amount of income in your villa's chest. This amount drastically improves the more and more you upgrade the buildings in your villa, and it becomes very easy to make money after all the shops are upgraded. While this is extremely satisfying, it also serves as a bit of a con to this game. In the early game, weapons and armor seem very expensive, and money is a whole lot harder to come by. But once you upgrade your entire villa, you don't need to worry about being low on money anymore. I've fully upgraded mine, and I'm making nearly 12,000 Florins every 20 minutes! The game notifies you whenever money is deposited to your villa's chest, so you can just fast travel there in between missions to collect your income. When you upgrade shops in your villa (such as the Doctor, Blacksmith, Painter, Tailor, etc.), you also receive a small discount on all items purchased from that shop. The gameplay in AC2 is immensely fun, and the wide variety of weapons provides for an interesting, near-RPG like experience. You can be stealthy and use the Hidden Blade (probably the most badass weapon in the series), wield a dagger, or charge in on horseback whilst swinging your warhammer. While you're being pursued by enemies, there are many places to hide. You can walk with a large crowd, hide in a bale of hay, or sit on a bench to evade your pursuers. You build up Notoriety whenever you kill guards, and the more notorious you are, the faster guards will detect and attack you. You can decrease your notoriety by tearing down posters, bribing town criers, or finding and killing a corrupt public official. Travel in this game is very easy, and you'll want (but not necessarily need) to utilize the fast travel stations later in the game, when it can take you around 10-20 minutes to ride somewhere. It just costs around 100-200 Florins to travel around the map, and this becomes extremely handy when your missions will be spanning many different cities. You can also mount up on your trusty steed if you're outside a city (you cannot call a new horse nor ride one inside a city, unfortunately), and this makes exploring much faster. Highly elevated viewpoints are also scattered throughout the map, and when you Synchronize with them, more details of the map are revealed. It's pretty much a necessity to Synchronize with all of the viewpoints when you're in a new city, and it's very fun to do so. The parkour in AC2 is great for the most part, but sometimes a bad camera angle or accidental button push can kill you. This is only annoying in a high-risk situation, such as in an Assassin's Tomb (where great precision and patience are required to navigate the course) or when you're pursuing an enemy on the rooftops. Overall, AC2 is an excellent game, and I'd buy it for full price if I needed to. The atmosphere, gameplay, and story are all excellent, and you'll be having fun for many hours on end with this game. I'd recommend this game to fans of the Assassin's Creed series, history buffs, or gamers looking for a change of pace. I hope this helped, and thanks for reading!EDIT:Battle of Forli:In the original game, sequences 12 and 13 were 'corrupted' in the Animus, rendering them unplayable. They were later released as paid DLC. I personally think that it was really stupid of Ubisoft to do this. While this part of the storyline isn't strictly necessary to understand the story, they are very important for full enjoyment of the game. However, I recommend you either get both or neither. If you only get the first one or second one, a lot of stuff wont make sense. Anyway, on to the reviews for both of these. The Battle of Forli is a very fun sequence, and most of it (obviously) involves you defending the town of Forli. It takes about 20-30 minutes to complete, and it's very fun all the way. There isn't much stealth in this (being a battle and all), but the huge skirmishes were very enjoyable. I was glad that they had a sequence take place in Romagna/Forli, because it was barely featured in the main storyline (you pretty much get there and then leave for another city in the story). If you're a big fan of large-scale swordplay, then you'll heartily enjoy this DLC.Bonfire of the Vanities:This sequence was great as well! While the last one was a straight-up battle, this one features a lot more variety. It mostly features you running around Florence and killing 9 lieutenants of an evil man who has come to power there. Each lieutenant is different, and you'll be forced to use some strategy for some of them (for some, you can just run up and murder them, but for others, you have to remain undetected or you'll be desynchronized). It was great to go back to Florence again, and more of the city is opened up then before. It was very fun to do all of these, and it took me around 45 minutes to an hour to complete this. If you love the iconic assassinations that this series is known for, and you want to run around Florence again, then you'll really enjoy this DLC.I just finished the story today, and it was AWESOME! Once again, I highly recommend this game to you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2013"}

The game is not perfect on the PC, but the good eclipses the bad. It's hard to label 40 hours spent on a game as `first impressions,' yet that is exactly how you should treat this review.STORYSet 200 years after the events of the fourth game, Skyrim shifts the focus to the north. The main quest-line revolves around civil war and something about giant flying lizards. You are thrust into the role of the `dragon born' who is somehow destined to take down the dragon Alduin, the `devourer of worlds' who has returned to reset the clock on the continent of Tamriel or the world of Nirn as a whole (so far I'm not sure which). All this is well and good, but with all the other quests to undertake, you will find it difficult to focus exclusively on the main story. Personally I return to the core quests every 12 to 15 hours. If you do the math, that means I've done about 3 core quests.The side quests are thoroughly engaging. They aren't simple fetch quests. Simpler quests are all lumped together under a `Miscellaneous' heading in the journal. More complex ones can be uncovered through numerous means: talking to people, reading up on a mythical artifact, joining any one of the major guilds, etc. The guild quests are epic in their own right. I just completed the mage quest-line and have to say that Bethesda's narrative skills have improved substantially. For limitations arising out of the truly open-world approach, the overall narrative threads aren't as focused as what you may find in RPGs like the Witcher series. I don't have a gripe about this at all - it's just a different approach to game design.SETTINGThe Elder Scrolls have been around long enough that the lore that has developed over the previous games feels authentic. Like previous entries, there are pages upon pages of material to read through if you're into that sort of thing. Direct influences are drawn from several sources - most obvious are the works of Robert E. Howard and Tolkien, and believe it or not, Homer (then again, everything goes back to The Iliad). There are also subtle thematic influences from the classic Ultima series - which Todd Howard has always admired.Despite the varied sources of inspiration, Bethesda's game world somehow feels authentic. No other game offers the deeply satisfying experience that comes with exploring such a vast world. Round a bend and you could be looking upon a sprawling city with a towering great hall. Go over a peak and there's a gargantuan shrine dedicated to a powerful deity. Even underground dungeons can be spectacular to behold. Thankfully, the dungeons aren't corridor experiences like previous TES games. There are unique touches to almost every single dungeon. I would be remiss if I didn't praise the level designers for coming up with some of the best dungeons ever seen in an RPG. Bethesda smartly added more people to work on hand-crafting dungeons, and it shows.GAMEPLAYBethesda spent an enormous amount of time making sure that players never run out of things to do. There is so much to do in fact, that it is often difficult to decide which quest to tackle next.The repetitive filler quests become apparent after the a few rounds (e.g. go here, kill that bandit), but the heavy-duty quests have a lot of meat to them. To illustrate, consider the fact that I spent about 18 hours doing quests for the first major city I encountered. Since then I've started doing quests for two other cities. I haven't even set foot in any of the other major cities yet! Even after 40 hours!You can tinker with side professions - play the woodcutter, a smith or an alchemist - there may be some other professions that I haven't bothered to follow up on yet. All this stuff is good, but they are too serious. I would have liked to see some more casual activities - maybe something more social with NPCs, like gambling. There seem to be a few bar brawls (fisticuffs only), but this isn't really different from general combat.Combat remains choppy if you're using melee attacks. The spell-casting is fun, but swinging a sword still feels clumsy. At times though, blows land with a deeply satisfying impact. Slow-mo executions can be triggered depending on skills/perks. The much-touted dragon shouts are very useful and fun to use. As a spell-sword playing on moderate to high difficulty, I find myself having to think strategically when balancing shouts, mage and melee skills. Shouts have a cool-down timer while the other two skills are based on independent, rechargeable pools.Fighting dragons never gets old and it's always a head-rush. I love the random encounters as you have to come up with a game-plan off the cuff. On moderate to hard, the dragon fights can get pretty challenging. Prepare to be chewed, roasted, frozen or electrocuted to death several times. The dragons aren't entirely without issues however. There are fairly predictable attack patterns and if you're in a cramped space the dragons can end up landing in an absurd location.Exploration can be a large part of the experience if you want it to be. There is a convenient fast-travel option, which you will probably use frequently the longer you play the game. But exploring on foot or on horseback is too darn fun. Let me give you an example. On my way back to turn in a quest, I suddenly found myself in the middle of a fierce blizzard. Then I was in midst of a nasty ambush by a pair of ice wraiths - my horse didn't survive. After a few minutes of wandering about in the whiteout, I stumbled upon an epic-sized dwemer ruin, which led to an entirely different quest. The experience of one thing leading to the other felt like something straight out of Tolkien or GRRM. Bethesda's genius lies in distilling these experiences in a way that makes YOU the author.GRAPHICS AND DESIGN PHILOSOPHYOut of the box, the graphics are okay. While the art direction and lighting effects render a beautiful setting, the textures can get ugly up close. This is more jarring after coming out of a couple of weeks of straight Battlefield 3 action. That being said, there are already a couple of terrific mods out that can significantly improve the texture details for PC. I'm sure more will be available in a matter of days.Let's go back to the art direction: Bethesda has outdone itself. Every ancient tomb tells a unique visual story. Dramatic ruins make you wonder what happened in these once glorious halls. I found myself occasionally admiring the fine details and motifs carved into monuments and pillars. Distant locations on the horizon invite you to come and explore because they look either gorgeous or sinister. Each town that I've explored thus far has its unique visual identity. Small hamlets and large cities both feel lived-in. It's also nice to see NPCs go about their daily activities as opposed to randomly milling about. And they don't just talk about mudcrabs all day.I like the way the map is displayed in 3D. It gives just enough detail to quickly glance at where you're going and what you plan to do next. I also like the fact that dungeons you've been through actually come up with a `cleared' label.However, not all the design decisions were well thought-out. The biggest flaw with Skyrim PC, is the user interface. I can understand that the UI works great for a gamepad. What I don't understand is why Bethesda would blatantly ignore a hardcore and arguably more loyal PC fan-base (consider that all the excellent mods are done on PC, and not on 6 year old console hardware). Eidos Montreal did a fantastic job of making sure the PC interface worked perfectly for Deus Ex. I can't see why Bethesda couldn't have done the same.Menus are tedious to navigate, devoid of icons and waste a ridiculous amount of real estate. There is seriously too much text to get through to select what you want. Add to all that the fact that the game gives you a million things to collect and barter, and pretty soon you're tearing your hair out or sitting with a permanent rage face. Trying to find the right spell or potion in the middle of combat really takes you away from the moment. Hotkeys took me forever to figure out. You actually have to assign an item to the favorites list, then bring up said list and THEN hit a number, 1-8. And all this isn't explained on the instruction manual. A couple of more months of PC development time would have been fine. 11-11-11 be damned.AUDIOThe environmental effects are all excellently done. Many people complained about the voice-acting but I didn't have a problem with it. Some of it sounds phoned-in but because of the sheer amount of content, I think this is forgivable. Its still a massive improvement over Oblivion and Fallout 3 - where even the mighty Liam Neeson sounded bored out of his mind.There are neat little touches that go with some of the voice-work. Dragon-tongue sounds pretty badass when you hear dragons speak it. Their roar alone is enough to make you panic. SPOILER: In High Hrothgar, I love the `silent' Greybeards; when they whisper `Dovahkiin' the entire temple shakes and rumbles, such is the power of their voice. I had chills down my spine the first time I heard this audio effect.Then there is the music. I think this is Jeremy Soule's best work to date. Skyrim is a game where you will frequently drop everything you're doing in-game just to take in the beautiful score. Some of the dungeon tracks can be a bit repetitive but the ambient music and combat music raise the bar for not just the RPG genre, but the gaming medium as a whole.BUGSWhere would we be without them? Most of Skyrim's bugs are hilarious but some are annoying. I know Bethesda built a new engine, but whatever small percentage of the code was recycled clearly came in with the ubiquitous crash-to-desktop bug (to fix this: run Win vista SP2 compatibility). Youtube has got all the funny one's covered if you haven't experienced them yourself. So far, there is nothing game-breaking, so no serious complaints.OTHER THOUGHTSWhat a year to be a western RPG fan. We had disappointments in the form of Dragon Age 2. We had the surprisingly better-than-expected Two Worlds 2. We had the lovingly crafted Witcher sequel and the mind-numbingly good Deus Ex. And then Skyrim comes along and obliterates everything in its path. Yes, there are some issues, but I have faith in both Bethesda and the modding community that these issues will be dealt with.It's unbelievable how much I'm enjoying Skyrim. This sounds hyperbolic, but Skyrim is the best game I have ever played. Sorry Fallout 1, you have been dethroned after 14 years. More than just a game, Skyrim is an experience that no serious gamer should pass up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2011"}

Chrono Trigger, Zelda, Xenogears(prequels, actually) and Star Ocean all have sequels. Final Fantasy is a different kind of sequel: no characters repeat, new worlds, new storyline and only 4 things usually repeat: Cid, moogles(or Mog), chocobos(ostrich-like birds) and Biggs and Wedge. However, to this day, no sequel has been made...until now.Story: Takes place 2 years after Final Fantasy X. Yuna has successfully defeated Sin, a destructive force, forever; something no one has been able to do. However, that game's main character, Tidus, goes away. 2 years later, Yuna is part of the Gullwings, a sphere hunter group who roams the land looking for spheres detailing certain events in Spira(the world). She receives a sphere which looks like Tidus imprisoned and is determined to find out the truth.Graphics: This one is on 2 fronts: world and FMV/Cutscenes. The worlds? Pretty much the same as FFX. Same layout and everything. But the FMV's? Whoa. Especially Yuna(the real Yuna, that is)'s introduction. Beautiful. It's not abundant in FMV as FFX but still a marvel to watch.Sound/Music: The music? Sounds like the 70's. They even replaced the ever-popular Victory Fanfare with some rather boring piece. Voice acting? Even better than the first. Yuna doesn't sound dull and bored anymore and Paine is a great replacement for Lulu.Gameplay: Say goodbye to the Sphere Grid, welcome to the Level system. Additionally, say hello to Dresspheres. Similar to Materia and the Job system, your characters can change classes, even during battle. Use a Black Mage to deal magic, then switch to a White Mage to cure. That simple. One other notable feature is added: Jumping. Yes, sometimes travelling the land, you run into places that need to be jumped over, or climbed. It's a radical change and sometimes cumbersome.It's something I hope Squaresoft(oop, sorry...Square Enix) does now and then: provide a sequel. Who wouldn't want to see the events of Terra and the gang after VI, or how Midgar progressed in VII(there's a straight to DVD coming next year) or the continuation of Ramza and Ovelia in Tactics but this game is mainly for people who want to know if Yuna and Tidus end up together and looking for a new Final Fantasy to play until XII(12).

Especially for a game thats not the best anyway. I played through it the first time and when I got to the end of it I realized I only had 25% completed. If you don't go a certain way and do certain things, you miss half the game. But how are you suppose to know to do those certain things unless you follow the guide page for page. I went through it the first time without a guide and ended up missing over half the game. Check out Final Fantasy X if you want a good game. That game blew my mind.

This mysterious power forms the beginning of all life, is the source of all magic and the origin of all thought. For eons the angelic Seraphim watched over the T-Energy and therefore over the fate of the entire world. But eventually tiring of their burden, they passed their knowledge on to the High Elves. T-Energy helped the realm of the High Elves to experience an unimaginable boost of prosperity, making it the reigning culture in Ancaria. But a force as powerful as T-Energy carries great dangers. Not taught how to deal with this, no sooner did the Elves take control, then a heated dispute erupted among them as to how and to what purpose the T-Energy was to be used. Dispute morphed into irresolvable conflict, then rift and eventually to a civil war among the High Elves, where all participants were losers. Their realm collapsed and with it the entire power structure of Anacaria. In the turmoil all the peoples of Anacaria coveted the right, either openly or in secret, to wield the power of T-Energy and in the end, unmanaged, the T-Energy raged out of control warping creature and lands alike. Can anyone regain control over the T-Energy. And if so, will he/she strive to prevent the world from lapsing into final chaos, or deepen it?GameplayGameplay inSacred 2: Fallen Angelin divided into two campaign paths: Light and Dark. As the game begins players choose and customize their character and choose the path they will follow. This choice determines the ultimate goal and intentions of their character, and as the game progresses through literally hundreds of quests and side quests, the paths of different characters intersect at different junctions. Choose one way and you may be tasked to defend a town and its people, while another path could result in you attacking the same town. The choice is yours and the fate of the world and your well-being are at stake.Key Game Features:A massive, seamless and dynamic world delivering hundreds of hours of freeform exploration.Two deep campaigns: play as the 'Light' or 'Shadow' side, complete with distinct skills, rewards and story-elements tailored to the chosen path.Six exceptional, playable characters, each with a distinct look, capabilities and in-game motivation.Modifiable combat arts: change, upgrade and link together your alter ego's combat skills to match your playing style.Fight effectively from the back of a number of mounts under your control; equip and upgrade your character's unlockable special mount.Deities offer unique combat disciplines and unlock additional quests.Seamless transition between single and multiplayer gaming modes via Xbox LIVE.Captivating online modes of play challenge gamers in cooperative, PvP and PvE play.Extraordinary, cutting-edge graphics and Dolby 5.1 channel surround sound utilize the latest technologies for a truly immersive experience.Character ClassesInSacred 2: Fallen Angelplayers assume the role of one of six characters -- five of which are new to the franchise -- and delve into a thrilling story full of side quests and secrets that you will have to unravel. Breathtaking combat arts and sophisticated spells are waiting to be learned. A multitude of weapons and items will be available, and you will choose which of your character's attributes you will enhance with these items in order to create a unique and distinct hero.SeraphimOften referred to as 'Fallen Angels,' these mystical and angelic creatures are the oldest inhabitants of Ancaria. Fast, elegant and acrobatic warriors from a technological future they fight with light to medium weapons and, if required, with massive technological support. Players can assume the role of a Seraphim and protect the world from chaos.Shadow WarriorShadow Warriors were originally humans trained as elite soldiers in service to the High Elves. Upon their death their souls were stolen by an Elven general, bound to lifeless bodies and imbued with T-Energy. Now free, they travel between this world and the next as undead beings with only the desire to return to the peace of the golden halls of Elysium.High ElfThe best student at the ancient academy of magic in Thylysium, the High Elf character lives and breathes magic. Her hunger for adventure and her insatiable desire to increase her personal knowledge and the influence of her once-powerful house are the driving forces as she sets off into an Ancaria boiling over with turmoil.DryadMasters of the hunt and akin to the Elves, The Dryad are in tune with nature and are equipped with the strength of the forests. The most powerful and the strongest among them are knowledgeable of the dark art of voodoo and were chosen in order to save their peoples from extinction. All are expert with the bow, traps, poisons and lore of the forest.InquisitorThe Inquisitors are the High Priests of the High Elves. Arrogant and deadly, they are only committed to themselves and their ultimate goal of assume control over the T-Energy. Proficient in close combat and able to gain increasing power as damage is taken, their manipulative spells make them powerful fighters from the shadows.Temple GuardianSince the beginning of time the purpose of Temple Guardians were to maintain and protect the Great Machine, so that it could keep the world in balance. Neither fully flesh or mechanical, they are half human and half machine. Propelled by T-Energy and devoted to protecting it, they are part of the Great Machine and so able to use the T-Energy for their purposes.A Wide Variety of MountsAcross Ancaria you will find many horse dealers. They offer all kinds of animals, from the simple nag up to a real war horse. You can equip a war horse with bridle, saddle and even special armor. These special items can be found in the game just like player items, ranging in quality from regular to rare and even unique items. In addition, every character also has a unique mount created specifically for their character class. This mount not only fits the personality of the character, but also complements the various aspects of the character's playing style perfectly. All character classes can fight from a mounted position using a variety of tactics that the player chooses depending on the terrain and battle conditions.","reviewerName":"Moviedude","summary":"A good final effort from Ascaron, but not enough","reviewText":"With Diablo, Torchlight, and Borderlands all having lavish sequels, it's a good time to look back at Ascaron's Sacred sequel, which ended up being their final game before bankruptcy and closure.The original Sacred was something of a sleeper hit. With solidly 2d environment graphics (the characters were 3d) it actually looked a little more dated than Diablo 2, but it had a very clean sharp aesthetic and its intense customization, huge open world, and streak of cheeky naughtiness made it a star, particularly with older gamers. In my heady college days it was a recurring LAN party favorite, although Titan Quest effectively dethroned it.Sacred 2 was a bold attempt to do all that Sacred 1 did but with modernity. Now in full 3d, with a detail level comparable to Oblivion, dynamic lighting, and tons of environments, Sacred 2 was certainly a quantum leap forward in looks for the series. It also features a huge volume of voice acting, customizable skills (narrowly sneaking in ahead of D3's rune system) and just as many Easter eggs and rare items as its predecessor.And yet, something about Sacred 2 feels off. The controls feel a little less responsive, and the skills feel less balanced- generally within an hour of starting you will know what moves your character will use for the rest of the game. The world is huge and visually gorgeous, yet you feel very confined to artificial paths through it- much of what you see on the map is inaccessible obstacle terrain, and by the final quarter of the game it has become hopelessly linear. And while the characters look vastly better than they did in the first title, they lack the appealing oddball character of the characters in the original (with the exception of the inquisitor, an awesome villain-protagonist who seems to be channeling Emperor Palpatine by way of a Luc Besson gangster film). Sacred 2 bombards you with exotic locations and numerous characters, but they quickly become a slog, a grindy obstacle course you shoot your way through without paying much attention. In Sacred 1 there was a joy to discovering new areas, but in spite of the lavish artistry on display 2 does not capture this fun.Part of the problem may also be the story. Sacred 1 had a pretty easy to follow one: There is an evil wizard who has summoned a demon and you must go swat them, and also a crooked baron who is using the chaos to take over the kingdom. In the expansion it was boiled down further to \"go to hell and rescue this lady.\" Sacred 2 has a huge incomprehensible plot which is never well explained, but which I will try to summarize:-God is an alien-The Seraphim (chesty warrior cyborg women with a predilection for laser guns and jailbait haircuts) work for God but they get tired of doing nothing all day, so they build their own planet (this all directly contradicts the lore of the first game in which Seraphim were mutant elves bred to fight demons but whatevs)-The Seraphim's crapsack planet goes all to pot, the inhabitants all start fighting and the pipes that pump the planet's power source (a blue goo called T-Energy) start bursting, mutating wildlife into monsters and also somehow teaching people magic-The morally gray elven government finds the source of all T-energy, a wrecked spaceship that the Seraphim apparantly did NOT build, and which is full of robot dog men-Everyone starts fighting over T-energy and you have to make your way to the spaceship and fight giant robot ants so you can either shut it off or exploit its powerNot one bit of this makes sense or is worth following, and indeed the game is at its best when you are engaging in a series of unrelated quests.I am picking on Sacred 2 awfully hard, but the truth is that it was a step in the right direction. Unlike Sacred 1, it was visually modern, sumptuously designed, and in spite of being total nonsense, worth playing at least once. If you choose to however, I recommend against this version. The more complete Sacred 2 Gold, which includes the Ice and Blood expansion is now available on Steam, and while you can modify the US release of Sacred 2 to accept the Europe-only expansion, the all-in-1 represents a better value proposition.Mention must also be made of multiplayer: It was horribly laggy at launch, and as far as I know, is now dead (unless current IP owner Deep Silver maintains it). Were I you I would not buy this game expecting a satisfying coop experience.PROS:-Looks Great-Soundtrack includes music by German epic metal legends Blind Guardian!-Tons of skills, loot, and customization-Huge gameworld to exploreCONS:-Less rewarding and re-playable than Sacred 1 or many competing contemporaries-Awkward feel to controls-Largely forgettable cast-Quickly becomes numbingly easy-Little incentive to complete higher difficulties-Requirements far exceed what you get visuallyOTHER NOTES:-The collector's edition of this game came with a high-def texture pack that confers lag-inducing beauty upon the world. You can download this both as an official patch and unofficial mod pack.-One of the game's strongest points is that each character has their own campaign alongside the main story, and this campaign further changes depending on your alignment. This feature was meant to appear in Sacred 1, but except for the Vampiress, all the character's arcs end when the reach the first hub town.-Sacred 1 was released censored for violence in the US. Not so with 2; you can dismember your enemies with abandon now.-For all its mucking about with Canon, Sacred 2 is a solid prequel in many ways. The high elven society in 2 will eventually collapse into the aescetic wood elves and depraved, decadent dark elves of the first title, and the Dryads will eventually be trapped in the underworld by the time of the first game. Dwarves, for some reason, are absent from Sacred 2, although by all rights they should be all over the place. Then again, this game could easily be a prequel in name only, nothing that happens in-game explicitly precedes the first title.-The high elf's story arc is entirely about her trying to get out of Student Loan debt. Methinks one of the writers was a little bitter about college.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2013"}

The choice is yours ininfamous.caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Everyman turned superhero Cole.View larger.Devastating electricity-based powers.View larger.Go anywhere open-world design.View larger.An organic urban environment.View larger.StoryEmpire City was a run of the mill metropolis, until one day a massive explosion rips through six square blocks of its bustling downtown real-estate, seemingly leveling everything and everyone in its path. Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city. Players will be challenged to decide if they choose to save or destroy Empire City.Urban Exploration- Scale the cityscape to discover new vantage points and employ a vertical combat system. Utilize Cole&rsquo;s climbing skills to go where most people can not, opening up a variety of offensive and defensive combat options.Organic City Ecology- Watch the citizens and city react and evolve depending on players&rsquo; actions. Events will unfold based on the role players take in them, creating broader reactions in the city&rsquo;s people and environment.","reviewerName":"To be or Not To Be","summary":"Welcome Mr. Freak","reviewText":"I've been playing this game just 2 days only and not even close to finish this game. But here's my review on this game. An unknown bomb goes off in the city and apparently, you inherited some electrical powers and the ability to jump off from top of buildings without getting yourself hurt. Not only that, you are very acrobatic, meaning you can jump pretty high from the street level and jump onto objects and eventually you will get on the roof. Along the way, you will learn new abilities such as healing people. Plus, you can recharge yourself if you run out of electricity. The only two weaknesses you have is that your skin is not bulletproof and you hate water. Luckily it doesn't rain in this game (at least I don't think it ever will). If you have taken lots of damage, find a safe spot to rest and you will recover your health (I wish there was a health bar in this game, but you will know you are dying soon when your TV screen is blurry and turning dark and your dude is breathing very hard).In this game, you can be a hero or a villain. You can kill everyone that gets in your way or you can protect them. Its up to you. For me, I choose to be a good guy. I'm not sure what happens if you become a bad guy (maybe society will gang up on you?). There's lots of things to do in this game, so it will keep you pretty busy. As you gain experience, you can use your experience points to upgrade your powers.I think this is the best game so far for Playstation 3. Graphics are superb (as with any PS3 games I played so far) and its pretty fun. I only freed about 20% of the territory from the reapers and found only 9 recordings. I just completed the mission where you have to find the source of where all the black water is coming from. So I have a long way to go.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0050SWVIQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Terrence A. \"cinemaparker@twitter\"","summary":"Epic finale","reviewText":"Man, this game is long.It's easily the length of the first two games combined and slightly longer. That being said, you really do get a good amount of bang for your buck with Dead Space 3, a series that has diminished in terms of scares but excels in general intensity. Technically speaking, I'd say that this is the best game of the series, with fantastic graphics that top the first two games and sound that performs on equal footing. The new additions to the game, such as the co-op and weapon crafting bits are fresh bursts of air for the franchise. The co-op is a slightly different experience than the single player, providing a somewhat alternative scenario that is worth playing through once you've beaten the single player campaign. The weapon crafting system seems overwhelming at first but as you progress through the game, it becomes second nature and exciting as you get the hang of creating and upgrading weapons that pack some serious punch. The number of different weapons you can create is pretty high and you can mix and match until you find something that you're satisfied with to your heart's content.Like I said earlier, the game is incredibly long. This is due to a storyline that is lengthy not just on its own but with a number of optional missions that stretch out your playtime while expanding on the base events of the campaign. The game is still creepy and incredibly intense but if you're a Dead Space veteran, a lot of this is going to feel pretty familiar to you. The monsters are all either the same ones you've seen before or variations of them. Many people felt that the game's swing towards being more of an action game would ruin what made the Dead Space series tick but in a way, it makes sense because by this point in the story, protagonist Isaac Clark has already been there and done that and it shows in his character and dialogue. He's pretty much ready to beat these creatures to a pulp giving the game more of a gung-ho feel. You may have also heard of the inclusion of humans as enemies and frankly, I don't see what the big deal is. Their presence makes sense in respect to the game's story and those shootouts are few and far in between.If I had any complaints, it would have to be that the story is a bit... I don't know, off. By the end of it, it gets way out there and falls sort of flat in the very last minutes of the game. It's still a hell of a lot of fun getting there though and you'll be surprised to find that the replay value is pretty high on this game once you finish it and unlock even more game modes that are sure to challenge the heartiest Dead Space addicts.I really enjoyed Dead Space 3 but at the same time, I'm a little sad that the game isn't the absolute terror fest thatDead Space Platinum Hits Editionwas. It's a better game thanDEAD SPACE 2 (XBOX 360)was however and more or less a fitting end to this trilogy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2013"}

Most of then are no more than ordinary first person shooters with licensed characters. I guess since the original Goldeneye game on the Nintendo 64 was so popular they felt like they shouldn't stray to far from the winning formula.In this game we have a generic interpretation of Bond involved in a dull plot involving clones and kidnapped world leaders. We go through several different locations but only some of them are cool and none are used to their full potential. There are a couple of driving levels too, but the street design is just uninspired.The best thing about FPS games is the ability to just go berserk and shoot-up the place, hoping to catch the baddies in the crossfire. But you don't really get a lot of ammo and reloading is painfully slow sometimes. And the destruction you can inflict upon the environment is very limited.I can really only recommend AUF to Bond fans.

Not to mention the combat relationships have been improved along with everything else. I really enjoyed the soundtrack in this one. On one of the levels I seriously had to just stop playing and listen to the background music. Amazing.So why only four stars then? Well, it's just personal nit picks that made me downgrade to about 8.9/10. One was the clich&eacute; story which reminded me of DBZ Cell saga. Not my favorite episodes. Also this is for everyone that's played Fire Emblem before, but there's not been much improvement to the gameplay in the last ten years. A few things are actually missing too. Remember night fights when you couldn't see enemies due to limited vision. Sure this made for tough strategy, but that's not in this game. Also cracked walls are gone, which was another thing I liked. My last nit pick is the lack of improvement to the combat. It still feels like I'm playing Fire Emblem from a decade ago. It's not broken, so don't fix it. Though I was hoping for more strategy elements besides move and attack. Stuff like special attacks, trap placement, surprise attacks, attacking multiple opponents instead of one by one, and what happened to catapults.? Those are gone too.Okay I'm finished whining, but all this aside those who are  new to Fire Emblem are in for a real hand held treat. Those who have played past titles might nit pick a little, but enjoy the game none the less. Fire Emblem Awakening is a great game altogether.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2014"}

I thought they were over reacting when they said it was filled with \"non-stop action\". Truth is, they didn't stress on that enough to be honest lol. This game has no motion controls and it's gonna have you sweating. Aiming is a breeze, dodging and counter attacking is fast and fluid. You have a super fast hand gun, charged blast, and laser sword that all work in perfect harmony and the controls feel so good in your hands you'll have trouble putting it down. I don't play any game i buy whatsoever on the easy level so I don't know about that but the normal level will make you pull your hair out. It'll make you afraid to try the game on hard, but you will, because it's super addicting. Story is nice. Enemy design and voice acting all round is gorgeous. Environments are well lit and beautiful. The only characters who don't look so hot are the stars, which is sad, but you won't be staring at them with all the rockets and explosions on screen lol.This game will test your skills physically and mentally. No joke. You're gonna have to be quick to aim, quick to shoot/slash, quick to dodge,quick to counter, and quick to figure out your enemy's weakness before he snuffs your life out. A losing battle can easily be turned around in an instant once you've learned your opponent. Battles take place while running on foot, riding bikes, running on trains, flying etc. It's out of this world. This game has good replay value and you WILL, most likely, want to beat it on every difficulty level, then beat the game with a friend, if you have friends lol, then try to get your score up there with the top players around the world.Multiplayer is great but would be perfect if the second character appeared on-screen and not just the aim for the gun but it's still pretty awesome. It's one of those game where you get more than what you paid for. It's cheap but really fulfilling so it's a great buy. Nintendo did really good on this one.

Most games involve voice coordination between people on the same team, and sometimes even discussions with your opponents.I'm not sure why my experience was so different than the previous reviews. Maybe they got an older version of the headset? It definitely seems to be the same unit - made by Microsoft, for the XBox 360, the basic model.This headset is relatively inexpensive, and has a padded earphone and microphone. The earphone is adjustable, to have the headband part expand and contract. This lets it fit on larger and smaller heads. The microphone rotates, so that the unit can be worn on the left or right side. It only spins down to just under a 90 degree angle, though, so this forces you to wear the headset with the band right over the top of your head. At that spot, the microphone is pretty much right in front of my mouth (I prefer it a bit lower) and the opposite-side \"bracer\" part is digging into the skin just over my non-earphoned ear.I don't know what it is with these headset creators - but at its smallest setting, the unit is still too large for several adults I know. That makes it even worse for teens and kids! That being said, I find this problem with a lot of headsets, so it's something you just have to deal with.There's a relatively long cord, and it plugs right into the base of your controller. It doesn't interfere at all with wireless controllers. The base part has a mute button as well as a volume control.I didn't have any problem at all hearing other players when I was online - their voices came through very clearly. Also, the unit fit very snugly into the base - I didn't have any problems with static or dropped signals. In fact for a while I was letting my boyfriend drive in PGR3 while I talked in the headphone/mic, and even with the cord stretched out between us two I could hear fine. Other players could hear me. I didn't notice any issues with lag, our conversations went back and forth rather quickly.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00503E9FY","description":"","reviewerName":"Robert T.","summary":"Biggest strength also its biggest weakness","reviewText":"I won't mince words or write an overly complicated review. Just my basic impression for those on the fence about buying it. If you've played through MW2, you've played this game. There have been minor improvements, but nothing substantial. It's basically MW2.5. The single-player campaign is fun and exciting, if completely over-the-top and unrealistic (and short). The game isn't really built for the campaign mode, though. The MP is about the same as in previous installments with few exceptions. Most of the maps seem very familiar. The real gem here is in the 2-player co-op missions, but those are currently VERY laggy due to lack of dedicated servers. Hopefully this will improve, as it currently renders this mode unplayable. All in all it's fun, but nothing above and beyond MW2 or Black Ops...which will disappoint many (myself included to some degree). However, it's also what keeps selling these games, because you know what to expect and the formula doesn't change much. Consistency is what CoD is all about, and it really is starting to wear thin. In all likelihood, this is the CoD game that will finally send CoD holdouts (like myself) over the edge. I doubt future CoD titles will see the massive sales that the last few have, because the developers have all seemingly thrown in the towel. For the first time ever, I bought a new CoD game and shelved it for other games within a couple of days. Sad to say, it's just kinda boring. It's more than a bit pricey at a full $60...one wonders where all that cash is going since so little of this game (engine, interfaces, gameplay design, etc.) was created specifically for this game. With so little effort put in, why are we paying full price for the end result?","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005AV8W","description":"A dark shadow is spreading over the N64. Count Dracula has once again weakened the seals of his tomb, and the Belmont family is getting anxious.In the latest crusade against the forces of evil, players can choose between two brave vampire-slaying characters. Young Reinhardt Schneider, like his predecessors in the celebrated vampire-hunting Belmont family, will rely primarily on his whip. The other character is Carrie Fernandez, a young woman skilled in the ways of magic and spell-casting. Both are on the hunt for the dreaded Dracula and his devoted legions of vampires. You play a game all the way through with the character you've chosen, concluding with his or her own ending. Each character has an individual route to travel, and to see all of the areas you will have to complete the game using both characters.The passage of time and, especially, the fall of night, play a prominent role in the game. Players will have to search castles filled with dark corners, winding staircases, and other gloomy places. Daytime is the right time for exploring, but be on the lookout for vampires lurking in the shadows.Once the sun goes down, though, you should exercise extreme caution. When night falls, more creatures come out to play, and they become more aggressive as well. Some tasks are impossible to perform unless it is the correct time of day. A clock will allow players to calculate the time and plan their explorations accordingly.Konami has planted many cinematic sequences throughout the game. These scenes are surprisingly creepy, and may make you decide not to pick up your controller at night. Enemy characters are designed to terrify, ranging from the traditional horde of skeletons to half-woman, half-spider mutants. There are some gruesome bosses lurking in the darkness, as well. You will have to defeat Dracula in three different time periods, but don't expect the passage of time to improve his disposition.Reinhardt and Carrie will both have analog control, with different animation sequences for walking, jogging, and running. Reinhardt's whip works on a targeting system. When gruesome enemies are threatening, a green crosshair appears on the screen. If an enemy crawls, slithers, or slides within range of the whip, the target lets you know by turning red. The target automatically hovers over nearby enemies, so once it turns red you are guaranteed of a successful strike.Castlevaniahas 28 different areas to explore and four different special items at your disposal to fight the forces of evil. An eerie soundtrack tops off the package, creating a satisfying game that takes you on a unique adventure through spooky surroundings.","reviewerName":"tdl","summary":"Controls are awful, gameplay is too hard","reviewText":"I got this for my collection of NES & SNES games, but this is awful!

What a high price!!!","reviewText":"Currently the Amazon price is seventy dollars, don't know why, there are plenty of the out there.  Just some people trying to rip others off.The controller seems like a really nice idea, but that is where Nintendo stopped thinking.  This controller is just like the controller for the XBox and the PS3, with a few exceptions, the main exception is the build.  The XBox and PS3 controller appears to be better made and fir in the hand better that the Nintendo does.  Then again, I have just started using this controller and maybe it will \"grow\" on me as time goes on.Why the three star review.  The controller comes with a USB Mini-B connector, but no USB to AC adapter, so now I have the controller plugged into my computer for charging until the USB/AC adapter arrives.I have not found a devices that will charge the controllers like they have for other game systems, so if you are a person that knows how to invent that type of thing, there is a product to be made and people that are willing to purchase it.The Controller does have the rumble built into it.  You'll have to pay special close attention or you will miss the rumble. The rumble is weak at best.Update *** 12/05/2012 ***We have been using the controller now for a couple weeks.  The controller is no longer being used.  The Mainly due to the build of the 2 \"joy sticks\"  Not to mention that the controller will not work with Wii games.The good part is if you connect the controller to a computer, the computer recognizes the Pro Controller as a new device.  Perhaps a person will write a program so the controller can be used with a PC.Besides the inability to get used to the Pro Controller, the battery life is wonderful but I would prefer a better rumble and sacrifice battery life.  Another draw back is the Pro Controller is motionless, both in reaction and in any form of tilt sensitivity, and the buttons are not \"clicky\" but feels mushy.Still a decent controller as compared to the other Nintendo controllers.  Just not a great controller as compared to all the controller that are out there for all the game systems.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2012"}

A red light blinks on your answer machine. You check your messages and you're asked to go to a certain address to \"help out\" with various jobs. It's time to suit up and the most important question is do you wear your dog mask or your chicken mask?Hotline Miami is a truly bizarre game featuring some of the most violent content I've seen in a while. It's a top-down shooter with pixelated neon graphics and incredible electronic music. The story is very confusing as you can't figure out if the protagonist is on some sort of hallucination drugs or if he's a sort of crazed hitman. Either way, to progress through this game, you're going to need to stomach a lot of brutal killings. The game's brutally tough. So tough that you'll spend a good chunk of time replaying the same mission over and over.Each mission starts the same way. You select from a variety of animal masks that are unlocked from beating missions, each giving you a special ability such as speed or faster attack. Then you try to murder everyone in the building you're at. It'll require some stealth of patience to get through some of these missions too. Going in with \"spray and pray\" is always an option but one bullet or knife chop to your body will leave you lying in a pile of that red stuff. A resource given to you is your ability to scope out rooms before entering them. Patrols walk around in rooms, waiting to paint the walls red with anyone that enters. A lot of times, this becomes tricky. If a guard sees you or hears you, they're not afraid to charge in and investigate - with their guns and knifes. And you know the saying about bringing a knife to a gun fight? You'll learn that sometimes blades are deadlier than guns.If you do want to Rambo your way through the game, there's a variety of arsenal to choose from including shotguns, assault rifles, pistols, and sub-machine guns. The ammo is limited so you'll spend a lot of time switching between guns. To aim, you just move your mouse toward the guy you don't like anymore and fire. He'll drop with one hit, just like you do. If you want to single out a target, you can toggle the character you want to single out with a click of a button. This is extremely helpful in fights with enemies carrying shotguns and their friends carrying bats or knives.The gore is excessive and will be very disturbing to some. For example, a good chunk of your stealth work will be you knocking people down via doors or your fists, then grabbing them to slam their head against the ground until their heads crack. It's hyper violent in most all kills. Most rooms you leave will be completely red with chunks of body parts all over the place. If gore isn't your thing, you'll want to stay far away. It's very entertaining and disturbing at the same time.There's 19 missions that progressively become harder and harder naturally. Some of these missions will require you to fight bosses who take a tiny bit more of a beating and require you to move around a lot. You'll die a lot but you shouldn't feel frustrated with death. There's no load time to jump back in the action and you learn patterns quickly this way. It's essential the arcade stick shooter of Super Meat Boy.The controls will take a little while to get used to using a mouse and keyboard. Since the game now supports controller support, I'd recommend playing with a dual analog controller since it's how these games are meant to be played.If you're not a fan of playing games with the music on, Hotline Miami will change that. The music is electronic and cool. It fits well within this drug-crazed 80s game and pumps you up for the action. You know your in for a ride just by the menu's slow acid jam it plays with neon themed text and black/hot pink color schemes. The whole game feels incredibly well put together and is why I consider a prime example of how to make a great indie game.[...]","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2013"}

The detailed graphics and overall game play overcame the game's few flaws. But at that point I had only played single player mode. Since then, I've got the chance to do quite a bit of 4-way cooperative action, and I have to say it's been some of the most fun I've had on my Xbox in a while.Being able to have a friend just plug in a controller and start blasting away is great. No quitting your current mission and restarting from scratch.Sure, having to play on a quarter of a TV screen is kind of a drag, but I didn't think there was that much of a sacrifice in terms of graphics. Certainly the action was very smooth, with the frame rate ticking over at a rapid clip even during the most action-packed sequences.Although there is no way to switch characters with someone during play, if two or more people die, you can choose who you want to be respawned as.It is cool, too, that you don't have to set up a special cooperative mission profile that is separate from what you've done in single player mode. I had finished the first few missions solo, and my friends and I were able to continue playing in that profile. When I return to solo play, I will pick up where the four of us left off. No need to repeat everything we did.I have many other shooters -- Halo, Ghost Recon, Medal of Honor, Return to Castle Wolfenstein -- and this is only one that gives you 4-way cooperative action.

It's clever to add the new aspect to the game which helps in tough spots. You can have a character explore one part of the passenger train and the Umbrella Research & Training facility while the other explores another area. Team the two up (Rebecca Chambers and escaped convict Billy Coen) and you've got double firepower to take down the various creatures (both new ones & old ones, some of the newer are very interesting.)

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level.

As for Amazon, I buy A LOT from Amazon. Nearly every piece of electronics I own comes from them and given the A+++ customer service experience I've had I will never shop anywhere else. Yes, there is a BB 15 minutes down the street but they can't touch the level of service I've received from Amazon.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2010"}

This story is well written, touching, and full of memorable moments and lines that stick in your mind even after the PS2 is off.Now that I'm done gushing about the story, it's time for the gameplay. It holds up well in this day and age, as a weighty action RPG, which contains many Final Fantasy conventions, like the spell names, item names, item synthesis, shops, summons (from the Disney pantheon, so no Bahamut), party members (Donald and Goofy no less), and random one-shot mechanics like hitting things to restore HP, and EXP for deflecting attacks and exploiting weaknesses. All in all, a deceptively deep RPG awaits.The graphics have held up beautifully over 11 years, though there are some wonky, inexpressive faces during fights, or at specific points during cutscenes.Yes, you should buy this game.

Barry \"THE reviewer\"","summary":"Does Sonic's darker half have what it takes to dazzle discerning players?","reviewText":"It's all too easy to draw parallels between Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog. The classic mascot characters have endured the years to become videogame icons, recognized and loved by millions of game addicts around the globe. Nintendo's fat, Italian plumber helped pioneer the platformer genre and SEGA's blue hedgehog transformed it completely, placing a new emphasis on speed and rollercoaster-inspired level designs. In the old days, Mario and Sonic stood on even ground, each taking lead roles in an impressive selection of critically acclaimed titles. But as the years passed and consoles become more and more powerful, Mario's inevitable jump to the third dimension faired much better than Sonic's. Case in point: Super Mario 64 is remembered even today as one of the greatest games of all time. Sonic Adventure for Sega Dreamcast is conversely thought of as a flawed, but still enjoyable sequel by hardcore fans, and an altogether broken platformer by everybody else.It is more than a little puzzling, therefore, that developers SEGA Studios USA and Sonic Team continue to draw upon that archaic, clunky design for various Hedgehog-based sequels. Sonic Adventure 2, for instance, hit Dreamcast and was later ported to GameCube with the same fundamental mechanics and shortcomings that blemished the original title. And now, the software house has created Shadow the Hedgehog for GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox, a game that looks and plays like it was designed for Dreamcast a full six years ago. Sonic's darker half occasionally shines in the same way that its predecessors did -- namely, with an impressive sense of speed and dazzling stages complete with trademark twists and turns. And it's solely for these reasons that anybody who defends the original Sonic Adventure will probably like Shadow's one. Alternatively, though, players unimpressed with Sonic's Dreamcast outings will find more of the same here, and unlike a fine wine, age has not improved the formula.Identity CrisisShadow the Hedgehog seems to be Sonic Team's unofficial attempt at aging up its platformer games and as a result the title regularly deals with slightly darker and more convoluted themes that center on the balance between good and evil. The story is kick-started by a gorgeously rendered full-motion animation cinematic that introduces players to the troubled Hedgehog, who has recently lost his memory and is struggling to come to grips with his place in the world. The tale picks up after the events in Sonic Heroes and consequently Shadow can only vaguely recall in flashbacks that there was a girl named Maria, he may have loved her, and she was murdered.Shadow isn't allowed much alone time before his thought process is so rudely interrupted by the sounds of war and destruction. An alien threat called Black Arms explodes onto the scene and demolishes everything in its path, including nearby city skyscrapers. This is, again, all illustrated in impressive FMA cut-scenes that seasoned Sonic fans will undoubtedly appreciate. Shadow observes this phenomenon with a level of indifference before he is approached by a demon-like figure known as Black Doom, who leads the extraterrestrial forces. The menacing entity acts as though he knows Shadow and commands the Hedgehog to retrieve the seven powerful Chaos Emeralds located throughout the land. The anti-hero begrudgingly agrees, but only because Black Doom promises to restore his memory immediately after the artifacts are collected.This oddball setup is supposed to extend into and become an integral part of the gameplay experience. Shadow is out for himself and therefore he can and in fact does switch allegiances depending on the preferences of players. The hedgehog can be made to carry out Black Doom's commands, or he can switch sides and team up with Sonic and friends, or even Dr. Eggman. Changing teams is as simple as tapping the D-Pad during gameplay. One quick tap and Shadow will find himself being guided to various goals, such as destroying G.U.N. troops, for Black Doom. Another tap and Sonic and friends will appear at his side to fight against the Black Arms.The concept itself is intriguing primarily because it enables gamers to choose different paths for themselves as the hero advances through the adventure. The choices made will have a direct bearing on the stages that follow thanks to a branching storyline that allows for several possible paths and endings. This is a clever way to extend replay value and we're confident that completionists will play through the title several times, switching allegiances, so that they may see everything that there is to see.However, observing the unique goals per different allegiances is a messy undertaking marred by poor design. The fact of the matter is that any level of serious planned strategizing is wholly unobtainable in the intensely frantic makeup of the game, whose mechanics perpetually dart Shadow forward with both limited visibility and control. In turn, even when gamers are trying to fight alongside Sonic and friends, they will accidentally dispose of hordes of allies and even zoom into and activate switches or complete puzzle components that they should ignore. This truth renders the entire operation of choosing sides more or less useless.Speed, Loops and Guns, But Very Little FunDreamcast owners will already have an unfortunately accurate idea of how Shadow the Hedgehog plays (and for that matter, looks). To be brief, like Sonic Adventure before it. What this means is that speed and forward momentum are emphasized over control, puzzles, or to be frank, depth. Honestly, that isn't always a bad thing. Shadow, like Sonic before him, has his redeeming gameplay moments. We're referring to the rollercoaster-like stages complete with loop-de-loops, corkscrews and pinball bouncers that send the hedgehog zigzagging up and down environments at remarkable speeds. Because these scenarios are still plentiful, undeterred supporters of Sonic Team's efforts will undoubtedly find something to like about Shadow's quest.That noted, these thrill-ride fundamentals have outworn their welcome, as far as we're concerned. Just because they dazzled players six years ago does not mean that Sonic Team can copy and paste exactly the same loops and spins into each new franchise iteration and expect everyone to be happy with the outcome. Admittedly, Shadow is at its best when the character is zipping through 360s and or skating a rollercoaster track. But it's also during these moments that the game plays itself. It is, in fact, possible, for participants to put their controllers down for seconds at a time and simply watch what unfolds. How is relinquishing control for what amounts to watching Shadow tumble through a scripted corkscrew a rewarding play environment?Unfortunately for Sonic's darker half, there are all-new problems exclusive to his adventure. The very first level in Shadow the Hedgehog is a shining example of spectacularly lackluster game design and probably one of the worst single stages that we've played in any title for many months. The reluctant hero is thrust into a drab environment and immediately nudged forward -- right into a progression of objects, including obstructing walls and enemies. Disappointingly, the platformer also features a horrendously malfunctioned camera system that catches on environments or even occasionally runs amok for no particular discernible reason. The result? Commonly frustrating undertakings where the goal is to burst forward and gain speed, but before that can happen Shadow crashes into enemies and loses rings, or simply goes careening off a ledge. These impossibly trying outcomes are worsened because Shadow moves loosely through the worlds he explores, which at times makes precision navigation an insurmountable hurdle.The character can, unlike Sonic, wield a number of imposing weapons, from massive swords to explosive projectiles. But in a move that again harkens back to the days of Dreamcast, there is no lock-on system in place and therefore what is a simple process in other titles is overly complex and cumbersome here. Successfully targeting and unloading a bazooka shot at an enemy may as well be left to chance. Sonic Team has positioned Shadow's gunplay as a primary selling point to the platformer, but in practice the mechanics are really not that enjoyable.Recycled technology and replicated production values have ensured that Shadow the Hedgehog looks and sounds almost exactly like its Sonic-based predecessors. To Sonic Team's credit, there are more than 20 levels in the game and each is varied in design. Some areas have a futuristic look to them while others feature large metropolis backgrounds and more still take Shadow through lava and forest settings. Meanwhile, the game engine draws long, stretching locales populated with a moderate number of polygonal characters. And on GameCube and Xbox, the fluidity usually aspires for the 60 frames per second mark with some dips. The PlayStation 2 version is noticeably more sluggish despite the fact that it is visually lacking compared to its counterparts. And yet, these are small graphic victories, especially when held to today's more robust standards. Shadow oftentimes looks like it could have been designed for Dreamcast simply because the worlds and characters lack polygon numbers, which leads to a generally square presentation void of curvy shapes. Worse is that many of the game's textures are downright muddy, especially when the camera malfunctions and pans up close, as it consistently does. And overall character animation is primitive and incomplete when compared to the majority of today's games.Shadow the Hedgehog is proof that Sonic Team needs to get with the program if it plans to compete with legitimate current and next- generation software. This is Sonic Adventure with guns and less polish, and players today are far more discerning than they were six years ago. Diehard Sonic fans will cling to the fact that the title still conjures up corkscrews and loop-de-loops, as well as an impressive sense of speed when Shadow really gets moving, and this is all true. But this doesn't make up for the game's long list of shortcomings, from stupid level design, unrefined controls and useless gunplay to disappointingly outdated graphics.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"Crono \"Mega RPG gamer\"","summary":"Deja Vu.","reviewText":"There's something to be said for the Wind Waker. But I didn't find this game to be very exciting. Don't get me wrong it's very solid, but it feels a bit repetitive. You probably should get it anyway. It's worth a play through.Graphically, the game is absolutely beautiful. Whoever's been telling you that cel-shading doesn't fit this game was completely wrong. It's absolutely stunning. 10/10Sound wise, it's a different story. The standard effects are here, but compared to the incredible sountrack for Ocarina of Time and even the pretty good soundtrack for Majora's Mask, Wind Waker really lacks anything particularly memorable. The only memorable track was a remix of an older Zelda theme. 7/10The gameplay is solid. It's just as you'd expect from a Zelda game. Exploration. Check. Sword slashing and item finding. Check. Dungeons with great bosses. Check. It's all here, and it's the exact gameplay you've come to love with intuitive control. 9/10Story wise, it's a tweak of old Zelda storylines, but it all boils down to saving Zelda and beating Ganon. It's connection to Ocarina of Time is nice, but this is Zelda, and I'm not expecting something mind-boggingly amazing. I have one really big complaint here though. Why in the heck is Link being ordered around by a talking ship he hardly even knows?  8/10Here's an entirely new category I'd like to include: originality. This is where the game really suffers, in my opinion. First off, they've replaced the brilliance of the land setting from Ocarina of Time and Epona with a vastly huge ocean and a boat. Not good. To be frank, sailing sucks. Really badly too. The first time you do it, you'll probably enjoy playing the song and aligning the wind in your direction. But when you need to get halfway across the map, which you will need to by completion of the second dungeon and throughout the game, it takes forever to sail across. I needed to sail back to my home island, and it took 5 minutes to do it. And that wasn't even at the end. It was at the beginning. Another thing, there really isn't anything innovative about the game. It's the same tried and true gameplay, and frankly, it's startly to feel a little worn despite what a lot of Nintendo Fanboys will say. 5/10Overall, Wind Waker is a solid addition to the series. It's got enough good gameplay to keep you entertained for a long time. But the feeling of deja vu combined with the ridiculous sailing really made me question how much fun I was actually having compared to say, Ocarina of Time. Twilight Princess looks to be shaping up quite well, so we'll see then. Hope this helped you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2005"}

{"product_name":"B004EVWYYG","description":"","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Interview With the Daughter","reviewText":"My daughter has taken a huge interest in Pokemon lately, and as a gamer parent I made it a point to try to learn more about it from her even though I don't play this series myself.  When it came time for her to pick, she chose Pokemon Black simply because of the Legendary creature it offers: both Black and White have the same creatures, but you can only capture Reshiram in Black and you can only capture Zekram in White.If you're new to Pokemon, the shortest way I could explain it is that you are a young person in a land where many different kinds of creatures exist in the wild called 'Pokemon'. These creatures can be captured and cared for, and for many children this is a kind of rite of passage: you learn how to capture and train Pokemon, travel the land on your own, and have adventures. You use your Pokemon to have battles, against other trainers and against wild Pokemon. If it sounds a bit cruel, keep in mind that this is a game for young people and as such Game Freak goes out of their way to make the story a positive lesson: you have to take care of your Pokemon, they grow to like you, and no one ever dies--they just 'faint' and can be revived. Some creatures can 'evolve' into different forms, and that adds to your options and makes the possibilities even more diverse.If you're contemplating buying a Pok&eacute;mon game for a child in your family, there is educational value to be had here: I'm amazed at the huge and creative variety of creatures, and my daughter has coached me on strategies: type matching and analysis are important skills that require memorization, reasoning, and a bit of basic math. You have to manage money to buy things and plan your inventory before taking a trip out of town. And sometimes your character is asked questions to make them think.My daughter loves this game and she's already played many of the previous Pokemon entries in the series.  We've read reviews criticizing the graphics quality of the game, but I'm not seeing that here.  This new series may have graphics very close to the level of previous series, but I think that's the nature of the series:  unlike Final Fantasy where some releases can get a facelift, Pokemon is designed to be colorful, cartoon-like, and graphically simple.  My daughter loves the new and interesting sounds that Pokemon Black makes (particularly the opening screen), and I have to admit that is one thing that continues to get a little better with each title.  She often loves playing the creature sounds over and over and showing me what Pokemon she's captured, and we've had more than one occasion where she excitedly comes rushing up to me so I can watch this or that creature evolve and we can share the surprise of \"what will it look like?\"The rest of the elements of this game are what make it entertaining.  Children like consistency, so Pokemon Black and White have done a good job balancing the desire to keep the game familiar to a child wanting more of the same, and throwing in some small changes to make 'the same' still seem refreshing and new.  We still have the same theme:  your child is a Pokemon Trainer, and it is his or her job to travel the land capturing and training Pokemon and making them battle each other.  We have a new land: a different world map with different places (and going from Black to White, those places can look different).  We have all the same creatures Pokemon fans loved in the original series, and we have some new and exciting ones.  But probably the biggest reason my daughter gives this game 5 stars is because with Pokemon Black and White you no longer have to play the same boy character:  a girl can choose to be a girl trainer, and my daughter really likes the look of the girl character.  Kudos to Nintendo for making that little change, because for a girl gamer it has a big meaning.If your child is new to Pokemon, this game and its manual will help teach them all they need to know to get started, and it is a great title to entertain them.  If they are familiar with the series, chances are they'll very much enjoy this new world and all of its interesting new creatures.  I'm very glad to see that the makers of the Pokemon games are starting to realize that girls enjoy Pokemon, too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00000JRSB","reviewerName":"drqshadow","summary":"Legend, but not Perfection","reviewText":"It's been called everything from the greatest game of all time to the undeniable peak of an already legendary series. It's a big part of the reason Sony overtook Nintendo and ultimately won the 64-bit chapter of the console wars. And, truth be told, it's single handedly responsible for reviving a passion for video games that had lain dormant within me for years. So, cutting to the chase, is it worth the hype, does it really measure up to those previously mentioned, simplistic, cherished classics of the 8-bit era, can it really be as good as it's been portrayed? Well, yes and no. Final Fantasy VII is not the best game I've ever played, period. What it is... well, it's easily in the top five.The story basically throws players into the fast lane right off the bat. The opening video montage leads directly into a late-night raid on the planet's largest governing body, the Shinra, a raid in which the player is actively a part. As events unfold, the point becomes clear; you're a mercenary, aiding a terrorist organization in their efforts to destroy a significant portion of the city to make a point that the Shinra cannot ignore. Five minutes into the game and already it's covered more mature material than the previous six combined. Make no mistake, Final Fantasy VII is not a game you'll want to hand your six year old to help him pass some time in front of the TV. Not only does it cover some rough psychological terrain (mortality, semitism, terrorism and political espionage are discussed, in depth, and confronted... just to name a few) but the characters and dialog themselves aren't nearly as squeaky clean as they were in previous installments.With that said, the in-game visuals of FF7 are very much lacking, especially in comparison to later titles. This was obviously a very early release for the rugged PSone. Edges were extremely jaggedy, especially so when not in a battle, live renderings of the characters left a lot to be desired and even the cutscenes themselves were compressed poorly, leaving huge artifacts all over the glorious video renderings. In sharp contrast, though, the animation and design of the hundreds of different enemies, players, items and boss characters is amazing, and the variety of static, immovable backgrounds are superbly concepted, executed and presented.To a much lesser degree than the visuals, the musical score is undermined by the medium in which it's been presented. This is a soundtrack that would have shaken the earth if it were performed by a master orchestra. Unfortunately, the difference between a symphonic performance of these classic songs and the spotty, digitized portrayal that shipped with FF7 is as large as the difference between the sketches of the characters themselves and their eventual presentation on-screen. Sure, you'll recognize them without a second glance... but they've been crammed into a format that really can't do them any justice.As has been the case with each new chapter in the Final Fantasy legacy, one new tweak has been thrown into the mix, in this case going under the name &quot;materia.&quot; As the game progresses, you'll find these colorful blocks of concentrated energy (be it on the body of a defeated enemy, alone in a cave somewhere or for sale in a shop) that grant the holder magical abilities. They're the only way to upgrade your characters' abilities, and are completely interchangeable between the members of your party. By equipping a block of materia and then defeating enemies, the magic &quot;levels up&quot; and gains new abilities while simultaneously strengthening its previous benefits. Each weapon and bit of armor you find throughout the game has a slot for the employment of materia, which effectively limits the number of them you can use at any one time. You'll eventually need to make some tough choices over which materia to develop and which to ignore.A lot of players have voiced a strong dislike for the materia system, claiming it kills the variety of your characters. The common consensus says that by giving the player the ability to assign any skill or spell to any character, Square has basically given you a bunch of clones with which to do battle. I'd have to disagree. If you really want to nitpick and pay attention to the specifics of each character's stats like that, you'll notice that each character has a different affinity to the various materia commands in the world. Sure, you can give anybody in your party the ability to cast &quot;fire,&quot; but it's going to cause more damage if you give it to someone with an inherently high magic ability. Square's kept the variety in this cast, they've simply given you the ability to ignore each character's strengths and sculpt an army on your own accord.The theory behind Final Fantasy VII is outstanding, yet simple: create a game with an untouchable story, tremendous characters, amazing design, mouth watering special effects and great musical accompaniment. It was the right game with the right pop culture appeal at the right moment. It accomplished every single one of its goals, and it's going to win &quot;best video game ever&quot; polls from now until the end of time because of it. What it won't win, though, is a perfect ten from yours truly. While I'd be more than happy to go so far as to say the story contained herein is the best of all the Final Fantasy games, I can't say the same for most of the other aspects of the game. The visuals and audibles are hampered by the PSone's own internal limitations, the characters are topped by those of FF8, and the mini games make me shake my head more than they entertain me. This is very, VERY close to perfection, but I've admittedly played a few titles that are better","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2004"}

I am blown away how polished and well-optimized this engine is compared to whats being used in other games. Graphics look fantastic - textures and movement are very realistic looking. And even with the great graphics, performance is awesome. Very good game for even middling machines.That being said, the story line of this game is just uninteresting to me. The modern warfare theme is tired and blah. I'd rather see this tech (graphics engine, audio, and gameplay) used in an old WWII themed game... or even in another war era (just not modern day). I prefer the older warfighting era due to the simplicity and increased focus on the solider and his gun, rather than all of the network-centric stuff - flying drones, EMP, communications encryption. With Infinity Ward's polish and use of an excellent graphics engine, they could really make a solid older-era warfighting game. Set it apart from the original Medal of Honor and CoD games (i.e. MOHAA and CoD I) though... maybe a vietnam theme? Or WWI theme?All things considered here, MW3 offers very fun gameplay and great eye candy. It's just too bad all of their latest releases are pretty much all the same, thematically.

Dead Space is a great game.I really enjoyed this game on the Impossible Setting , I felt like it was a better game on that setting. This setting is only unlocked beating the game once.I also enjoyed the fact that you could use cheat codes and still get achievements. Something that is very rare in games these days. The cheats don't really ruin the game as you don't have God mode or infinite ammo, but they do help remove some anoying features like running out of oxygen and running out of stasis.I also liked getting the one gun achievement.This game has a pretty decent replay value as  you can carry your items into the next game ,UNLESS YOU CHANGE DIFFICULTY, you can restart a game with all of your weapons ,items ect.For those of you wondering what weapons are best?IMO the best armor is the TANK ARMOR and can be downloaded off LIVE.The best overall gun for the one gun achievement is the PLASMA CUTTER.The best overall gun if ammo wasn't an issue would be the LINE GUN.But as I played my 2nd time through I found myself really getting into the other weapons. Strangely though the flame thrower is weak and should be the last gun you upgrade.The other weapons are good ,its just the plasma cutter and stasis seem to be the best combo for beating the game. Freeze and enemy and shoot their limbs off will be the main combat component. The LINE GUN is devistating when your out of stasis and enemies are rushing you as the LINE GUN just slices them in half.I also enjoyed the basket ball mini-game. YOu could probably make a full fledged Xbox Live Aracade Game out of this mini-game. It's pretty kool and involves you using gravity and multiple hoops and involves you using gravity boots .Overall really kool feature.Also I liked the gravity feature one of which involved you walking on an asteroid and another which involves you throwing giant glowing radioactive balls out the ships air hatch.Dead Space does have some repetive momements , your basically on one large ship and each level basically is a reworked lateout of the next. Same Hallways, Same look , over and over. But I will say it still is a very good looking game. I had just wished they mixed up the same-ness of the levels.The story isn't hard to follow IMO and has a almost predictable ending , but still a good ending and an overall game. The ending and story is enriched by reading the text found along the way in the form of audio and video files ,although they are completley skippable and up to you to read them or not.I wish the DLC was free by now ,maybe they'll release a version with all of the DLC.But if your wondering the best armor by far is the Tank Suit , so I would get that as soon as possible off LIVE, you don't absolutley need it , but its the best rated suit and should be the one you get if you want the strongest suit.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2009"}

One thing people were talking about is that level of gritty realism which of course, sparks controversy over it's content. If they at least played the game, you'll realize it's fun as hell.Graphics: Well, these are good for the PS2, not the best but you won't be complaining. The real cool stuff is when you blow stuff up, cool visuals there.Story: It's all over the map. Mob bosses, double crosses in all it's glory. You meet several mobsters and ordered to do little jobs for them, and they can range from showing one of their friends around town or tailing a rat or just plain old dropping off a car with a corpse inside to a crusher. Nice variety.Sound/Music: This would've been great if they executed it a bit better. Get in a car and you have a radio blaring, and you can even change channels. Problem was I kept flipping through them all the time finding the right one. Voice actors are great and a lot of times I was like &quot;hey that guy's famous, where do I know him from?&quot;Gameplay: Little things that are missteps but it's all good. The only problems I had were aiming at multiple badguys that are shooting at you and you don't know where it's coming from.

{"product_name":"B00BMFIXOW","description":"","reviewerName":"Charles Smartt","summary":"You'll being singing pirate songs all day long!","reviewText":"The most interesting thing about this game is the open ocean combat. The world spans from the southern tip of Florida, to Cuba, to the Bahamas, and to Jamaica - it is an open ocean where you sail your boat, and a pirate, plunder loot from unsuspecting British, Spanish, or Portuguese sailing vessels. In real time, you fight multiple vessels, board the vessels in the open ocean, and take the boat for either your personal fleet, or to scuttle for repairs. This is the most critical feature of the game, and a vast improvement over the sailing mechanisms introduced in Assassins Creed III.The plot is interesting, but not as significant or important to this game as the plot was to previous installments in the franchise.The graphics are fantastic. Now, to the problems... Collision detection is a problem as was in Assassins Creed III and its PS Vita counterpart: in my first fifteen minutes I was literally between a rock and a hard place when I got stuck in a wall and couldn't get out. During a fortress raid, the enemy sent me through the war door room (via sword attack) after eliminating fortress officers breaking the mission. Another mission broke when the enemy AI triggering causing a mission restart, which was annoying. Mission layout is at times very poor as well with secondary objectives being there as more of an annoyance rather than a challenge. I spent 15 minutes in one mission trying to figure out where to go because they didn't block off parts of the island and at other times they would block off parts with little to no warning causing potential death. Walls that look climbable are not climbable (or at times he simply won't climb them... you have to push up two or three times or shift left or right to do what would be obvious), one mission had an invisible wall and the characters forward momentum was stopped. That is a primary complaint, the characters forward momentum mysteriously stops or he will take an unexpected direction making it frustrating. Sword combat and hand to hand theatrics is not as well done as in the Ezio trilogy of games (Assassins Creed II, Brotherhood, and Revelations); they tried to spice up the combat but got it wrong, although two button combat (square mapped to the sword and triangle mapped to a gun) is an improvement carried over from Assassins Creed III but not utilized fully. Audio was another problem: mortars and heavy shot audio effects would stop, and certain music tracks seem to have problems initially starting, this being a consistent problem (cannon sounds are fixed by hard game restart, the music track is perpetually like that).It is a good 20 to 30 hour game depending on how much into the side questing and pirating you are. If you liked previous installments in the franchise, this is a worthwhile upgrade. Despite the flaws that at times left me very angry, the game has an overall satisfying experience. And did I mention pirate songs?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2013"}

Enjoy a total of seven Mega Man games with remixed soundtracks original and sketch art, plus many other cool features!","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A Mega Collection!","reviewText":"In 1993, Capcom began to cult classic series, Mega Man X.  Now after thirteen years, the first six games (from the Super Nintendo and Playstation) have finally received a re-release.  It's what longtime fans of the series have been waiting for, but it isn't nearly as worthwhile as the original Mega Man Anniversary Collection.To put it simple, Mega Man X takes place in the future, after the original Mega Man series.  A group of robots calling themselves the Mavericks are waging war with the humans.  They are lead by an evil reploid named Sigma. Meanwhile a rebel group--a group of robots calling themselves the Maverick Hunters--are on a quest to save humanity.  And if you couldn't guess, it's Mega Man X leading this group.You won't find any members of the original Mega Man series here, except well... Mega Man.  The Mega Man X series shows a Mega Man that has more edge to him.  The series also shows a more mature and grown up storyline.Each of the Mega Man X games plays virtually the same.  You control Mega Man X, created by Dr. Light years ago.  Unlike the original, X can climb walls and cling to them.  Like the original, however, you select a stage, go to it, and make your way to the boss and defeat it.  Upon defeating a boss, you'll gain its special abilities.  It's simple gameplay, but it works out just as well as it did in the original series.Another highlight was how they introduced a key character.  Zero.  Zero isn't playable throughout the first half of the series, but in the later half he becomes a key player.  He plays a very important role in the story.In this collection, however, the games have been basically emulated.  The emulation is perfect.  Even the original passwords from the Super Nintendo versions will work.  The soundtracks are unchanged, and they look almost exactly the same.  There are a few differences.  The original dialogue that was edited for the SNES releases has been restored (such as cusswords), and there's actually a bit of animated blood.  Also, the slow down that plauged the cartridges has been fixed.  Each game runs at good speed.The only game that suffers horrible treatment is Mega Man X3.  CAPCOM, for whatever reason, ported the PC version of the game, and the PC version wasn't all that great.  The soundtrack sounds horrible, and I began to wonder why they skipped out on giving us the far superior Super Nintendo Version.In addition, there's also a kart racing game called Mega Man Battle and Chase.  It's a fun game, but the excitement of it drowns pretty fast.  However, outside of that, there aren't nearly as many extras as there could be.  For one, there are art galleries and that's about the only thing outside Mega Man Battle and Chase that's really worthwhile.  I would've really liked to see some interviews and background on the series.  The good news, though, the Gamecube and Playstation 2 versions are exactly the same.  Both of them have the same unlockable extras, and if the controls bum you out, you can change them with no problems.The other problem with the game is that like the original Mega Man Anniversary Collection, you're also getting games that were bad to begin with.  The first four Mega Man X games are solid, but X5 and X6 weren't that much to get excited about in the first place(perhaps because by then the original developers of the series left).  X5 and X6 also suffered some heavy criticisms by several fans.  Still, six games for the price of thirty dollars isn't all that bad.  And if you really didn't like them, you don't have to play them.However, for what it's worth, it's nice to see this collection.  There aren't as many extras as I had hoped for, but you do, for the most part, get some classics games.  It's better than looking for the original SNES counterparts, and the look and feel of the games is still the same.  It's great nostalgia for any fan of the Mega Man X series.The Good+Six games, for only thirty dollars+Excellent Emulations-even the original passwords still work+The look and feel is the same, meaning it's great nostalgia+A seventh game is included Mega Man Battle and ChaseThe Bad-Later games in the series aren't nearly as good-There just aren't nearly as many extras as there could've been-They gave us the PC version of Mega Man X3.  The audio is no where near as good on the PC version.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2006"}

The little issues from the first one have for the most part been corrected and I can honestly say Borderlands 2 is a masterpiece of a game, and it is huge! It has a feeling of a much better financed game as they did add a lot of bells and whistles.Improvements...+ Over-all control and combat is much better, your character feels more natural and less like a stiff FPS video game.+ The voice-acting, movies, story and environments are immaculate! Everything is very well done and polished to protection.+ Weapons are well designed and this time you can really tell a difference of what you are shooting with.+ There is a mini-map+ When down, you can move in any direction.+ The menu system is great and searching through inventory or inviting friends to join your game is a sinch.The campain is great, and much better in way of gameplay and design, compaired to the first Borderlands. The online multiplayer is decent, however unless you host a game, you are just thrown into a group of random people on a random mission. It is part of the game, and for the host, they are where they would be in the campain. However for everyone else, we're just tossed into a new world.There is 4 player split screen and you can play co-op online with friends who also play Borderlands 2. The friend online co-op is my favorite and I love playing with people I know. I can go into a friends campain, or he can come into mine.The main menu has many options, and as soon as it pops up you have a menu to play the campain or online, and then on the right side is a list of players you currently have joined, as well as your online friends who are playing. You can jump right into their game, or ask them to come into yours.The online co-op is decent, however I found it a little sliggish and confusing as none of us knew eachother and everyone was working on something different and transporting to new locations.I honestly think the entire game is great, however I feel the online is lacking simply based on the style of game it is. Borderlands 2 really shines with the single player campain, split screen or online friend co-op.All menus are easy to use and navigate through. I would not buy this game simply for the multiplayer aspect as it may get frustrating each time you are thrown into a new group of people in a new location. However if you are friends with all of those people you can easily set up an online co-op game and continue playing together.Over-all it is an amazing game and if you liked the first one, you'll love this one. The story is very grand and the environments are well designed. It fixed and improved upon everything the first one had to offer. The environments are very colorful and change often.Multiplayer is very well done and intertwined into the game much better than the first one was. Split-screen is great and you have the option of changing to horizontal or vertical screen stacking. The trophies are mostly hidden and there are just a few that are \"online\" trophies.Just like any game it may take a while to get accustomed to and could almost be too much to take at first play, however you will get addicted and it will be very hard to put the controller down.Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2012"}

S#^+. I'm still only in Blackwater...\"","reviewText":"A man is forced by the government to accept a difficult task . A powerful man, who was formerly a popular leader but is now considered a criminal, must be eliminated. Getting close to the target will require a long, arduous expedition to a highly fortified compound. The government must not be connected in any way to the mission. Sound familiar?No, the target's name is not Kurtz in Red Dead Redemption. But it might as well be. Rockstar has once again taken inspiration from a masterpiece of cinema. In the same way that the Grand Theft Auto series is strongly linked to works by Singleton, Scorsese, De Palma, and Kurosawa, Red Dead Redemption pays homage to Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now.On the surface, RDR appears to be based on classic Westerns. The game is set in the American frontier at the beginning of the 20th century. There are plenty of references to films directed by John Ford, Sergio Leone, Clint Eastwood, and Sam Peckinpah. The driving forces behind the game's narrative, however, are questions about duty versus honor, confrontations with enemies who may not truly be opposed to what your character represents, and most importantly, the achievement of spiritual redemption by completing a psychologically harrowing journey. Western films often address these themes as well, of course, but without any ambiguity or ambivalence. It's always crystal clear who is good, who is evil, and what is right and what is wrong in these films. In contrast, RDR and AN deliberately obscure their moral viewpoint on the actions of their characters.Anybody familiar with Apocalypse Now will recognize that many aspects of RDR's story are directly analogous to events in AN. While the characters and motivations of John Marston and Final Boss (no spoilers here) are never as fully developed as those of Captain Willard and Colonel Kurtz--due to both Rockstar's avoidance of Metal Gear Solid-length cutscenes and the limitations of the videogame medium--all of AN's key plot points are present in the game. There's even a minor reference to the sniper execution scene in Full Metal Jacket that helps reinforce RDR's connections to AN. All of this adds up to a rich and compelling story arc, especially considering RDR is a videogame.Story and influences aside, the bigger question is whether or not Red Dead Redemption is fun to play. The answer is YES. The graphics, especially the environmental effects, are outstanding. There's a good chance you will find yourself just sitting on a horse admiring a spectacular sunset or taking in the dramatic view from a mesa or hilltop and not doing anything else. The controls are easy to learn and quickly become intuitive. Finally, as is the norm with Rockstar, the game's world is gigantic and full of missions, mini-games, and random encounters. A few minor things feel a bit unfinished, such as some missions that involve long journeys without characters saying anything, or unrefined (it's left to the player to figure out how the inventory management system works while playing) but there aren't any glaring flaws overall.

Same Old Song and Dance My Friend","reviewText":"Dungeon Siege was one of the most anticapated games of E3 2001. It had beautiful graphics, beautiful landscapes, the gameplay was simplified, making it a different, more enjoyable RPG, and the sound effects were great. Now, finally, the wait is over. I picked up Dungeon Siege at EB Game World, and here is what I have to say about DS:Dungeon Siege, I think, is definetely revolutionary. There are so many great things, that no one would think of putting into an RPG, that truely make this game an experience. The graphics are on a 3d world, not a grid or map. There are pack mules, which, quite geniously, have a large inventory to cary your extra items. The sound effects are great, with the help of Creative's EAX. Lastly, dungeon siege is very flexible, letting you change your mind on the fly.The graphics in Dungeon Seige are incredible. There has never been an RPG out yet that has as good a graphics engine as DS. It is not on a map or grid, but in a 3d rendered world. I also enjoy the fact that I have never seen a loading screem, and never will, thanks to the engine.The Packmules are genious! Every RPG should have something like a packmule for now on. The packmules are great. They have 3 times the inventory size of your character, making it easy to cary many excess items, that you may have use for later on. They are also very smart. The AI is literally very good. When you get into a battle, the pack mule will run away until the battle is over, and it will then come back. Also, if the mule gets attacked by an enemy, it will kick it. Although this is good, it isn't very strong. You still have to watch your little packmule to see what kind of trouble it gets into. If a swarm of enemies like a swarm of fireshooting krugs, it will most likely be trapped, thus making you be the one to save it.With the help of Creative's EAX, dungeon siege has the best sound effects I have ever heard in a computer game. I also enjoyed the background music. The music would have decreshendos and creshendos, making the game more exciting. It is like being in a horror movie!The gameplay for DS is also great! You only have to click once to kill an enemy!!! Finally! My hands will not fall assleep from clicking and clicking repetively to kill an enemy like in Diablo 2! This is a great feature, but another good feature in gameplay is the flexibility. Chris Taylor, the creator and leader of Gas Powered Games, has made the game so flexible, that you can change your mind on the fly. In the beginnning of the game, you start out as a farmer, not noing much of any skill, like melee, range, or combat and nature skills. You are basically equal in evrey aspect, but very low. It is not in D2, where you chose someone with different skills, different attacks, and different weapon choices. No. In DS, you develope your character as you go along. You choose wheather you want to be a mage, or a melee weapon user, or an archer. That is all up to you. You can even say, \"Well, I have enough archers in my party, so I want to have a combat and nature mage.\" You have 8 people in your party, so it is always easy to change people around without having to many of one skill.Downsides, yes, there are some downsides to the game. First off, the game is very brainless. You just go into the cave filled with monsters, find that the entrance/exit is blocked off, need to find the other caved filled with monsters, go into endless rooms filled with the same creatures, and exit it, and then blow up the entrance, or whatever.I was surprised to hear this, but I have heard from people farhter in the game than me that there are vehicles, grenades, and guns. Now, I have no idea what time this game takes place in (there is not much of a story line, i will talk about that next), but to the looks, this game takes place in mid-evil times. But you have to remember that you can be a woman, and at mid-evil times, people did not have women fighting (no offense to any woman out there reading this), so this game could take place in the future. Who knows.Like I mentioned above, there is absolutely no story line to the game. There is a short cinematic in the beginning, saying how the kingdom of Ehb (where the game takes place) is peaceful, and then some monsters come and terrorize it. Next thing you know, your friend dies infront of you, and then the game begins.So, all in all, this game is revolutionary, but I don't know if people will be playing this game for a long time. You should still buy this game because it is revolutionary, and it is very fun. I am just going to warn you that many serrious RPG gamers will not appreciate this game. Most people will find it enjoyable, but, according to your own tastes, it will depend on how long you like the game and play it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2002"}

Your mission isn't terribly new (infiltrate a terrorist base and blow everything up), but the gameplay is: your numerous enemies are watching for you, and you are encouraged to sneak rather than simply charge in. Every level brings new challenges. You fight snipers, invisible ninjas, psychic warriors, and even an M-1 tank!

Campy humor also abounds as you rescue beautiful women, verbally spar with your allies, and blow up enemies in the bathroom.

It stars Solid Snake, a weary, gruff veteran of the battlefield with a deep, gravelly voice, who always keeps a pack of cigarettes handy just in case. His mission is to infiltrate a nuclear weapons facility on an island off the coast of Alaska, code-named \"Shadow Moses,\" which is currently being occupied by the ex-black ops unit turned terrorist group known as \"Foxhound.\" It's not immediately apparent what the group's ultimate goal is, and in fact one of the great pleasures of \"MGS\" is the way in which the story slowly unravels. Many of the characters have secrets and motivations of their own, some of which wisely go unexplained (what's Ocelot really up to?). As a game made on PS1 hardware, the gameplay holds up considerably well for its time. It's played from a third-person top-down perspective. You can equip different gear (rations, binoculars) on the lower left of the screen and weapons (guns, explosives) on the lower right. Stealth plays a big role as you constantly try to avoid alerting the patrolling guards. The best gameplay sequences involve the unique boss battles with the members of \"Foxhound.\" These sections are fun because no boss or battle is alike, and each character that you duel feels wholly original. The main draw and what makes this game, and the series, so special is the masterful storytelling that grabs ahold of you and doesn't let go. It's the stellar voice cast, including David Hayter as Snake, the ingenious plot, the phenomenal soundtrack and atmosphere - it's the meticulously crafted world that you can't help being completely absorbed in.--- 5 STARS ---","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2014"}

After finishing the single player campaign you will unlock 3 bonus missios. The graphics and game design are a little better than the main single player game. The bonus missions look more polished than the single player story. Other than that pretty much standard FPS action ,with some one on one duels Old West Style and some climbing and jumping with the Billy charachter. I beat this game in about 4 days, playing it for about 3 hours at a time give or take. It wasnt a horrible game, and the graphics arent that bad,but there is a problem with black shadows and white sunny areas.Something most Tv's can somewhat fix by adjusting contrast and in-game brightness level. Overall ,would I buy it? Not a chance .I Rented it and beat it before the rental was due. It was a nice change of scenery in the FPS realm though.Something different to experience. You play two charachters ,oNE IS an Indian/caucasian ,somehwhat stealthy sneak in the shadows player. And the other is a Preacher Hell bent delivering Justice w/ a revolver and a bible. You can duel weld weapons and both fire independently of each other LT/RT, respectively. You can even hold a bible in one hand and your charachter will read passages and the enemy will momemtarily pause, giving you ample time to pump em full of lead. But I never took advantage of this feature ,it was more of a novelty than a game requirement. The best feature of the game was the 'SLOW' time mode (like Matrix/Maxx Payne) , you can activate this mode and take out 2-3 enemies at a time,kinda kool. As a rental ,it is worth it if your a fan of FPS and jonesin for some gaming waiting for some betters shooters this Fall......HINT:HINT: spoiler alert !! To beat the final fight, (The guy that will stab Billy in the back). To kill the guy before he stabs Billy you will have literally a 'millisecond'to do this. As soon as you see the item boxes on screen after the cutscene . Pull back on right stick and push forward , youll enter the slow mo faze, then try to shoot the guy in the head but you dont have too to beat him. IT TOOK me about 15 tries to get as you dont have much time to do this move. Then after that congrats you beat the game ,now go play those 3 bonus missions, there a little better than the single player mode.(note) Initially only one bonus mission will unlock so you have to complete the 1st bonus mission to unlock the 2nd, and the 2nd to get the 3rd.

{"product_name":"B003O6G6G4","description":"","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"many satisfying moments","reviewText":"Dragon's Dogma is a fantasy action-RPG that doesn't \"innovate\" so much as it \"refines\".Set in a somewhat typical fantasy world of magic and monsters, \"Dragon's Dogma\" is a game with a fairly simple premise (at least at first): you are the Arisen, chosen to slay a mighty dragon before it can bring ruin to the world of man. On the path to confronting the dragon, there are many obstacles; vicious monsters swarm the land in the dragon's wake, yet the politics and intrigues of your fellow man may do more harm still.There are three base classes in Dragon's Dogma: the direct fighter, the agile strider, and the versatile mage. In addition, there are three upgraded classes (fighters become warriors, striders become rangers, mages become sorcerers) and three hybrid classes (mystic knight, assassin, and magic archer). Each class has a different gameplay role, and it's fairly easy to find one that suits your particular playstyle. To understand how they work, it's necessary to understand the game's combat.Combat in the game is simply outstanding. The easiest comparison is to a game like Dark Souls or Demon's Souls, in that you're actually swinging your weapon around rather than simply hitting the \"attack\" button over and over. Combat against most monsters consists of hacking, slashing, blocking, and evading in whatever manner is necessary. However, with larger monsters, it's also possible to climb onto their fur or scales and attack them in that manner, stabbing into weak points unaccessible from the ground. Fighters and warriors are better at ground-based combat, while the agile striders are best-suited for climbing and stabbing. It's difficult to convey how much weight is behind the combat, especially with two-handed weapons. It's absolutely satisfying to swing a sword into a crowd of enemies and have them all sent flying (with pretty good physics, too); skeletons, especially, are fun to fight because upon death their bones are launched based on the force of the blow.As the Arisen, you're not alone in your quest to defeat the Dragon. Beings called \"pawns\" - similar to humans in many ways, but lacking their will and drive - exist to assist you in your task. The player has one \"main pawn\" whose appearance, class, and personality can be chosen by the player; the main pawn must be outfitted by the player, and it also gains experience like the player does. The main pawn can also be hired out to other players via the game's internet service, and in the same way the player can hire two other pawns from the ranks of the game's other players. It's an interesting, albeit highly indirect, form of multiplayer. Offline players simply have a pre-made selection of non-main pawns to choose from.One of the keystones of the game's design is \"preparation\". The open world of Dragon's Dogma houses many dungeons, ruins, and labyrinths, but there are several differences between DD and a game like, say, Skyrim. The most important one is that there is only one major city in the game (the capital of Gran Soren), and all expeditions into the wilderness tend to originate from there. There is no fast-travel save for a fairly expensive \"return to Gran Soren\" option, so wherever you need to go, you'll be hiking there on foot. Your inventory, including your various potions, foodstuffs, and cures, will weigh you down as you travel - the more you're carrying, the more stamina you use while sprinting, jumping, etc. Therefore, unlike most RPGs, you cannot easily carry thousands of potions on your person - or, at least, if you do, it'll make things harder for you in other ways. Your kit and gear must be carefully chosen before setting out, for apart from things that you can find on your travels, that's all you have to rely on.While combat is more forgiving than a game like Demon's Souls, \"Dragon's Dogma\" is equally hardcore in its own way. As mentioned, there is almost no fast-travel in the game, so players will be hoofing it across the landscape every time they have to do a quest. The world is full of monsters, and interestingly there's no level-scaling (unlike the Elder Scrolls game), so in many cases you'll simply have to run for it when you encounter something far beyond your level. It's possible to get anywhere in the game world at a low level; it's just a matter of evading enemies rather than simply smashing your way through them.The game's graphics are somewhat technically limited (there's a lot of pop-in textures and slowdowns) but given the scale that the game is working with, it's generally not too bad. You can basically see the entire world from most high places in the game, and the city of Gran Soren stands as a major landmark from most areas. The game is full of amazing vantage points and scenic vistas, and that's one of the real benefits of exploring the open world. In addition, Dragon's Dogma is one of the few games where night is actually really dark, which absolutely necessitates the use of a lantern, and encourages players to return to the safety of the city walls before night falls (not that this is always possible). It's a game that really feels like a huge open world to explore rather than a collection of dungeons splattered across a landscape.The few problems the game has are of a \"convenience\" nature. The inventory system tries somewhat valiantly to deal with the fact that the player will be carrying many types of items and objects, but it's not exactly the best in terms of execution. An easier \"favorites\" system might have worked better, rather than simply a list organized by type. The long hauls across the game world are a somewhat necessary part of the game's theme and design, yet having some unlockable quick-travel options (wagons or horses, perhaps) would have been a welcome change.Dragon's Dogma isn't for everyone, but players willing to immerse themselves into an open, living world will find great rewards in it. There are many satisfying moments that exist as the result of limitations and weakness rather than simply defeating everything with ease. The limitations on your supplies creates tension that's simply not found in most games, and the combat is always satisfying no matter how many times you do it. The game has problems, sure, but they're technical, rather than design-based. In short, if you're looking for a fantasy game that goes above and beyond the traditional limits of the genre, Dragon's Dogma might be just what you've been looking for.Rating: 9/10.We purchased this game with our own funds to do this review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2012"}

Let's get one thing straight right off the bat: everything about the 2DS has the same high-quality and attention to detail that is to be expected of Nintendo products, but in my opinion, the 2DS pales in comparison to the3DS XLin almost every way. You should only consider getting a 2DS in specific circumstances. I'll warn you right now, in order to be as informative as reasonably possible, this may be a long review. If you don't like long, detailed reviews, give this one a pass. You've been given fair warning.Build Quality and Design: The 2DS' design is quite bold, to say the least. Abandoning the classical clamshell design that has been around for nearly a decade since theoriginal DS(or even theGame Boy Advance SP, if you want to go way back, :P) was introduced is pretty gutsy. Here, we get more of a solid slate chuck design. It's a little shorter than the original 3DS folded out, and actually weighs a little less than the 3DS. On the one hand, his design makes the handheld really tough and a lot harder to break, which is great for kids. On the other hand, this design makes the system a lot clunkier to carry around, and really lessens its portability. Not being able to fold the system makes it much more of a dust magnet, and little incidental scratches on the screen over time are more of a likelihood. All that means is you have to be a bit more careful with where you store it and how you handle it. You can also buy really high-quality screen covers for dirt cheap that will protect the screens, so that isn't much of a problem. Instead of folding the system, there's a slider button on the bottom of the system to engage sleep mode. All buttons have a nice click to them, but are lacking any colorized highlights to label the buttons. Instead, it's just indentations showing which button is which, which gives the system a much cheaper feeling than the other 3DS models. The d-pad itself has a shape similar to the 3DS XL's, but is much, much spongier and the clicky nature has been lessened in comparison to the other 3DS model d-pads. Personally, I actually like it more, but whether others will find it to be a negative or positive change is really up to personal preference. Button placement is different as well. Instead of the buttons, d-pad, or circle pad being to the sides of the lower screen, they're much more central and playing the system feels like holding theWii U's gamepad, which is surprisingly comfortable. The shoulder buttons also help with comfort as they are much bigger than the other 3DS models and wrap very nicely around the top rounded corners of the 2DS. They also have a nice concave groove to them, making holding the system superbly comfortable. My hands used to cramp up a lot with both the 3DS and the 3DSXL and I was forced to buy grips for both systems to be able to play for extended periods or else suffer from crippling pain in my hands, but not so with the 2DS. This is an incredibly comfortable system to hold, regardless of hand size, right out of the box.  Overall, the build quality of the 2DS is excellent, despite the jarring nature of its design.Sound: Unfortunately, one of the worst aspects of the hardware is the sound design. There's only one mono speaker on the left of the system and while the sound from it is just as loud as the other models, it's simply not detailed or distinct enough to match the other 3DS models (and their speakers aren't that amazing by themselves either, but their stereo set-up is much better than the 2DS single speaker by comparison). Trust me, you'll want to get a pair of stereo headphones to use with the system. Personally, most of the time I don't even play my 3DSXL without plugging ina nice headsetora decent set of speakers, so this isn't that big of deal to me. 3DS games are just much more enjoyable with headphones/earphones/earbuds/whatever regardless of which 3DS system you have, at least in my opinion. Still, some will probably be bothered by the mono speaker in the 2DS, so I must mention it. It sounds great with headphones though!Screens: The screens on the 2DS are the same size as theoriginal 3DS. Despite what I said a little earlier about the screens always being exposed being a small cause for concern, the 2DS' screens seem to be made of a tougher material than the original 3DS screens, which makes them more resistant to scratches by nature. They're also set into the system deeper, making it harder to brush the surface accidentally. The actual quality of the screens are very nice. Colors are vibrant and bright. The sharpness is very crisp and detailed. One of my biggest complaints about the 3DS is that when the 3D is all the way up, there can be really annoying \"ghosting\" of images in areas where brightness contrast is high. You don't have to worry about that at all on the 2DS, and that is a big positive in its favor. Overall, fantastic screen quality.Battery Life: The 3D effect can be a major drain on the batteries of the 3DS(XL). Since it's gone here, battery life has been dramatically improved by default. This is a big boon in the 2DS' favor. Now, batteries last at least 7-9 hours per charge, as opposed to the 3DS' 3-5 or the 3DSXL's 4-6 (keep in mind, that's with the 3D all the way up). That's really nice and makes the system less of a hassle on trips. Granted, without 3-D on, the 3DS and XL do last longer, and all 3DS/2DS models last longer when you turn off power draining features like wifi or lower the brightness setting. That been said, I stand by my statement that the 2DS has great battery life by default, about as good as the 3DSXL with its 3-D turned off.Backwards Compatibility: This is a bit of a mixed bag. While the colors and vibrancy are very nice, the screen size and pixel resolution leave a little bit to be desired. Playing in native resolution makes the screens so small you can't see very much and the bottom screen becomes super cramped. If you don't opt to use the native DS resolution, then you have to deal with the games taking up the whole screen as normal, but with a little bit of blurriness. Is it that big of a problem? Not really, no. Only the biggest sticklers will even notice any blur, let alone be bothered by it, and most will easily be able to enjoy any DS game on their 2DS.Lack of 3-D and Price Reduction: What is the 3DS without its most distinguishing third-dimensional feature? The 2DS. Is that a problem? For me, it would be because I love the 3-D effect personally. For those who don't like the 3-D, or for the kiddies, it's perfect. The 3DS' stereoscopic effect is not supposed to be used by kids younger than seven or eight. Until now, those young'uns could only play their games with the 3D slider off, and parents had to pay full-price for a system which would have one of its most prominent features unused. What a waste. Now you can spend much less and get pretty much every other good aspect of the 3DS system, including its most important feature: an excellent library of games. This is an idea I can get behind. Aside from the 3-D effect, the 2DS has virtually every other feature the 3DS has. All software aspects, such as wifi connectivity, access to the eshop, and all on-system programs, are here. The 2DS also comes with a nice-sized SD card so you can download a good number of eshop games. At a cool $129.99 (and don't ever pay more than that for this system), all of this is an absolute steal of a deal.I have to admit, when I first glimpsed the announcement for the 2DS, I was incredulous. What was this clunky monstrosity before me? A 2DS?! Why remove the very thing that defines the 3DS? What's with that slate design? Has Nintendo lost their mind?! As time has gone by, however, I've warmed up to the idea, and got one for certain occasions where I wouldn't be able to bring my 3DSXL. It has worked out well so far. Let me be clear, the 2DS is certainly not for everyone. If you have the funds, then I would invest it on the 3DSXL over the 2DS any day of the week. Ultimately, the 3DS XL is still the best version of Nintendo's current handheld brand. However, if you're the parent of a child who isn't old enough to use the 3DS' stereoscopic visual effect, a monetarily challenged gamer who wants to enjoy the incredible 3DS library, or someone who'd like a cheaper secondary 3DS-type system, then the 2DS is certainly a worthy investment. If you fall into anything resembling those categories, then I heartily recommend the 2DS. I hope you found my review helpful. Thanks for reading. Toodles","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2013"}

This really isn't a game so much as a movie where you're occasionally allowed to push buttons. The cutscenes and other mandatory dialogue take up so much time that there's little time left for your playing. Whenever you do play, it feels like the only point of doing so is to get to the next \"briefing.\"2.  Your character, for all his arcane military prowess, seems unable to climb over the hood of a normal car or climb a 4-foot-high pile of rubble. It doesn't go over well, especially if you're watching someone else play the game.3.  Sneaking around on the battlefield? Brother.  Sneaking around in the FOX headquarters may have been one thing, but I wasn't buying this for a second.4.  The boss monsters are boring and repetitive.5.  Unarmed combat was idiotic:  there's no aiming system.  it'll have you kicking a bookshelf whilst your mortal enemy stands by looking at you.6.  The game won't let you use your weapons in certain sequences merely because doing so would make the sequence too easy to beat.7  I wish the game would stop making me crouch by default!  I can't count how many times that's messed me up.8.  Warning:  in this game, smoke stops bullets.9.  With the original Metal Gear Solid, Konami stumbled upon something profound in video games:  stealth is fun!  But they seem to have lost sight of that with this outing:  here, stealth is a lot less important.  In fact, it's most efficient to simply run through every scenario, which you'll discover before long.10.  The plot was absurdly convoluted.  Did we really need all those details?  Yeah, we get it.  Naomi is a spy.  We have to kill so-and-so.  We have to retrieve this or that package.  Fine.  Can we play now?  Do we really need all those extra names and dates?  You'll notice that if you simply skip all that, it doesn't make a fig of difference to your enjoyment.11.  I found the biggest problem was that this game didn't have much zazz, much sizzle. With other video games, I find myself playing them compulsively every day until I finish them. With this one, I found myself able to leave it for a week or two before coming back to it: this should be accounted a defect.In sum, this could have been fun but was just confusing.  There were a good mix of challenges, though.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"Logitech Dual Action Game Pad USB","description":"Game Pad - Cable - USB - PC, Mac","reviewerName":"Mr.Chunky Monkey","summary":"Experimental GamePad From Logitech","reviewText":"Like others said, this is a problematic Logitech controller. I looked over the reviews of others and mostly they're spot on except I have a different opinion on certain things. This controller is definitely not flimsy or poorly built. It feels like a combination of the old xbox controller with a ps2 controller which has serious flaws.The most serious issue is that the thumb sticks are inside a square base which has rounded corners. So if on ps2 or xbox controller you can make circlular or semi circular movements with the thumb stick, on Logitech \"dual action gamepad\" you cannot due to the square shaped bases under the thumb sticks. This makes it really difficult to learn to use or impossible for 3D games.Besides simple 2D platformers, I used this controller to play a Street Fighter game on PC. As you may know some characters require sophisticated input commands to perform a good move. These moves are difficult to do with a thumb stick sometimes if they need a semi circle or full  cirle movement. Due to the square shape it actually worked really well for charge characters but very poorly for non charge characters. Also the classic directional pad works pretty accurately.Anyway, if you are looking for a good controller for use on PC check current models of Logitech GamePad or wired Xbox 360 controller by Microsoft. They look like all issues have been fixed and sticks are in proper circular bases. The reviews prove that last two models by Logitech and the 360 pc are the best. This one may be cheap, but it was released at least 4 years ago and will not work right on most recent shooters due to stick issues. When I bought it, it was the only one dual stick controller for PC.Pros:-sturdy and solid-rubber grips-strong \"Rumble\" if a game supports it-Plug and play-cheapCons:-poor thumbstick control due to square base shape-no \"select\" button like on modern consoles 2nd button is actually useless \"rumble\" button-no pressure sensitive triggers like console triggers-released too long ago, outdatedSo, don't abandon Logitech, just choose a better controller if you intend to play games that were released over last three years, first person shooters or flight sims. May work good on simple platformers.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2011"}

This is probably the very first Sci-Fi first-person shooter to go with a realistic combat approach. To accompany that is a somewhat heavy feel of the character and some uncanny physics that help immerse the player into the overall experience. The single-player campaign puts you into the shoes of Sergeant Sev, who was drafted into the Alpha Squad to help colonize the planet. The campaign mode for the most part is wave after wave of resistance swarming toward you, but the production value and presentation are absolutely unmatched to date on any console. The missions throughout the campaign spawn a fair amount of variety with vehicles and other events to help keep it fresh.However, the same great things cannot be said about the story.

The crazy thing is that the ending to the game shows you how great the story could have actually been, and it's a shame that such an amazing plot was not taken advantage of. Thankfully, the multi-player is really where the bulk of the game is at, and in that regard Killzone 2 is among the best ever. Multi-player features 8 maps and several different classes including the scout, tactician and medic among others. The experience is very fun and feels like nothing else on the market. The multi-player portion also features ranks and badges which both have rewards including the classes themselves as well as special abilities for the classes. To top that off, Killzone 2 features a great clan system as well as a built-in tournament system which has some flaws but has great potential.Controls:The controls for Killzone 2 have the feeling of weight, and all movements and motions have a slight delay to them to make the game feel realistic and original. Unfortunately, this approach made Killzone 2 not only original, but very annoying to play for many people. Some have argued that they have gotten used to it over time, but controls just shouldn't have to take getting used to. The delayed feel really makes multi-player frustrating and at times it feels like the controller is trying to prevents you from doing what you want. Thankfully, Guerilla Games has listened and has patched the game to make the controls a little more like what shooter fiends are used to seeing, but they are still unacceptable and an obstacle for most.Graphics:Killzone 2 is without a doubt the best-looking console game made to date. It is easy to tell that Guerilla Games took every precaution to prove that they have an art team that takes attention to detail. The effects of the game are absolutely unheard of and there are times in multi-player where grenade explosions, machine gun gunfire and ricochets are all on the screen at once with no slowdown and create an unprecedented level of chaos. To sum it up, Killzone 2 is absolutely gorgeous.Sound:The sounds that Killzone 2 has are very basic but don't overdo it. Many of the common sounds such as rifle gunfire and grenade explosions are great, while some other sounds like the air sentries flying overhead are very annoying. However, Killzone 2 does support 7.1 surround sound and does a great job of that. The main theme for the game is epic and fitting but the soundtrack is very short and limited.Replay Value:The single-player campaign takes roughly 7 hours to complete and the game also supports a multitude of trophies. The multi-player has 12 ranks and dozens of badges to unlock and earn. To top that off, multi-player also has 4 special ranks for those who place top 1%, 3%, 6% and 10% every week. A lack of co-op is probably the only thing missing from the game. Overall, the game will last a long time and is one of the most well-rounded first-person shooters to date.Rating:Story: 6.5Gameplay: 9.0Graphics: 10.0Controls: 7.5Sound: 9.5Replay Value: 9.5Overall: 9.2Own, Rent, Avoid:Own: Killzone 2 includes a great deal of content, and the presentation is fantastic. Not only is it a great experience, but it also lasts a long time.Last Thoughts:Killzone 2 has unprecedented presentation and atmosphere. The multi-player is deep, satisfying and there is enough included to keep any shooter fan occupied for the months to come. Summed up, Killzone 2 is one of the best shooters ever made.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2009"}
{"product_name":"B004H0J5S2","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"The SyFy Channel's Version of Assassin's Creed","reviewText":"You know those movies on the SyFy Channel, that have poor acting, bad special effects, awkward dialogue, low production values, but they're still entertaining?  Well, this is like the video game version of one of those movies.  The First Templar is a budget title with poor graphics, unrefined gameplay, and a fistful of minor bugs.  Despite these things, the game still manages to be fun.Story:  6/10The story is well written, but poorly acted.  It begins in medieval Europe as two Templars stumble onto a conspiracy involving the Inquisition and the Holy Grail.  The Templars were created back in the time of the Holy Crusades to uphold order and fight to regain Jerusalem.  They were temple knights who followed the strict codes of a monk and had the combat training of an elite soldier.  After they lost a major battle to Saladin's Forces, the order was disbanded with extreme prejudice.  The story takes the Templars on an action packed adventure through castles, ruins, swamps, temples, forests...  The story is told through in game cinematics with limited camera angles and limited animations.  Characters just move their arms awkwardly as the lines are spoken.  At times, the volume drops so low, you can't even hear what they are saying and other times, the dialogue doesn't match the subtitles.  But hey, at least they fixed the lip synch from the Demo Version, and you can skip them with the B button.Gameplay:  6/10This is a 20 mission hack and slash that can be played cooperatively or with an AI buddy.  The levels are linear, but there are branching paths and Optional Side Quests.  In most of the levels, you and an ally (AI or Online Friend) fight enemies with hand to hand combat.  There are also trap and puzzle levels that are pretty fair.  You have to dodge hazards and hit switches to progress.  Other levels use stealth.  The stealth in the game is very easy.  You go into sneak mode and you can see your enemies' field of view on your mini-map.  If you sneak up behind them, you can insta kill-them.  If they see you, they attack.  In some cases, they sound an alarm and you have to fight more guys.  This isn't the kind of stealth game where you have to run for 5 minutes to escape or restart.  The game is pretty easy, even on hard mode, and the checkpoints are generous.Combat:  6/10There are three main characters:  Two Templars, one uses a sword and shield, the other uses a two handed sword, and a female assassin who uses two daggers.  The Templar fighting styles are a good balance of offense and defense and the assassin is rewarded for offense and attacking from behind.  As you play, you gain XP.  The XP is used to unlock new moves (But they are limited), give you health, give you more energy for Special Moves, or increase the damage of your combos.You get a few basic combos (XXX, AA, AX, XAA) and some Special Moves (A+B) (A+X) (Y+B) HOLD X, HOLD B, RT...  You can counter incoming attacks with Y, and you block with LT.  Your arsenal is pretty limited, so understand that this isn't Bayonetta or Ninja Gaiden 2.So, the basic encounter goes like this.  Eight enemies charge you.  Some have a two handed weapon that can knock you down.  Some have (Breakable) shields.  Archers have missile weapons.  Some have armor.  The enemies surround you and take turns attacking, kind of like Assassin's Creed.  You can combo them, knock them down, break their shields, parry, counter attack, and block.  Because there is always a variety of enemies, you have to be careful and manage the situation.  Do you break the shields first?  Do you kill the archers?  Do you just combo, while avoiding the enemies with the two handed weapons?  It's these split second decisions that make the game fun.  You're constantly battling against the enemies and trying to figure out the best way to take them out.However, the combat does feel a bit sluggish.  In Great Games, your block is instant and tracks enemies.  If you get stabbed in the back, and press block, your character faces the threat from behind.  In this game, the block is just a bit slow and you have to manually turn to face enemies.  You also get a diving roll to evade certain attacks.  The combos aren't crisp.  They just look like guys swinging swords.  The problem is that the attack animations aren't super fast and don't have a sharp finish to them.  They're a bit looping.  Also, there is only 1 attack per button press.  So, XXX is always a 3 hit attack.  There really isn't anything flashy.  You are rewarded for timing the XXX attacks right with extra damage, but that's about it.If you do knock an enemy down, you can finish them off by pressing B, and executing a finishing move.  They're cool attack moves and aren't gory or bloody.  However, you can get attacked while you are performing them (unlike other games that zoom in and pause the AI).Graphics:  3/10This game looks slightly better than something you'd see on the PS2 or XBOX.  The lighting is bland, the graphics lack specular highlighting, normal maps, and serious detail.  It looks worse than Dragon Age.  The characters and environments are also pretty bland.Sound:  5/10The music is OK and sets the mood, but the voice acting is pretty bad.  Also, there are times when the volume of the dialogue changes about 30% during a speech.  Some lines are loud and clear, others are muffled.  The combat sound effects are pretty good, but some of them are odd.  It's like they tried to emphasize the characters are wearing chainmail armor and added an effect for that, but it sounds like someone dropped a baby rattle or a maraca.Replay Value:  5/10There are three difficulty levels (all fairly easy) and cooperative gameplay.  There are a bunch of collectibles, too.  You can try to find armor parts for new costumes or weapon parts for new weapons (the weapon changes are just cosmetic) and ancient texts that tell the story of the real Templars, which are pretty interesting.Maturity:  TeenThere is lots of sword fighting, no nudity, no language, no blood...  If you can handle Lord of the Rings, you can handle this.Overall:  6/10This is a very basic and fun game.  Sure there are a lot of minor bugs, but they don't interfere with the gameplay.  Sure the graphics are poor, but they don't make the game any less fun.  Sure, the combat system is pretty simple, but you'll never feel overwhelmed or confused.  It's just a fun, simple game that's only $10 right now.Buy it if you like Hack and Slash Games and have played all of the good ones already.Buy it if you have 8-12 hours to kill and want some easy Achievement Points.Buy it if you want to learn more about the history of the Templars.Avoid this game like the Black Death if you are a graphics snob.Avoid this game like the Inquisition of you love fast and complex combat like Ninja Gaiden 2 or Bayonetta.Avoid this game like Scurvy if minor imperfections and bugs drive you nuts.If you enjoyed this game, just about every other Hack and Slash game in the genre is better (Except Golden Axe: Beast Rider or Conan).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2012"}

Arriving at the hospital, the boy is sucked into a Vortex Field, into a dark mirror-image of his world. When he learns our world is ending to make room for this new one, he'll do what he can to get back home and (hopefully) stop the Apocalypse.","reviewerName":"M.

BUT, fun factor here is better than in Personas that reached America.***********************************************************************************************************Ok, I must add something now, when I beat the game (without Amala Labyrinth)This game has best boss fights after Xenogears.The character is built by choosing skills that are rewarded to you upon leveling up. Unfortunately, you can have just a few of myriad possible skills. Bad thing is, if you discard skills, you can be stuck later in game and not be able to get back old skills as far as I got into game.You will need anti expel skill (from Nirvana parasite) in combination w equiping Djed matagama (anti curse parasite) for Baal Avatar (sp?), sub boss OR in my case Boss of the game.You also need different attack skills to take out more monsters in one attack during game, but as the end of story nears, concentrate on heavy hitting skills which can damage bosses. Use Almighty matagama and get Freikugel skill, I think it is good for end of the game. I beat Baal Avaatar with Laksmi (healer, expel, curse and holy resistant) , Skadi (Windcutter magic and magic attack booster spell,expel, curse and holy resistant) and Flauros, using War Cry.Kurama is also important ally during first part of the game, since he has good spells and skills at low levels, just like Oni and later, Albion (evoluted GogMagog) and Shiki Ouji.Ok, just few more words: you don't have to read FAQ so frequently, but try to get list of parasites and skills they provide. Whenever fighting boss, see what kinda spell he loves and then equip parasite which absorbs attack or defends it. By exploring labyrinths and fighting, you'll progress better than reading FAQs.There was a boss in the middle of the game which clones. FIGHT HIM AT FULL KATSAGUSHI and you will see shadow below one you need to hit.What I disliked: items can be used by main hero only. There is spell Dragon Eye which allows enemy to get more moves per turn.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2006"}

A co-op player can come into the game at any time and leave at any time.- Leveling up your characters traits (Jumping, Strength, Driving, Shooting, Explosives) makes your character not only better at that skill but also gives you bonuses (Example: Leveling up your Driving skill gives you not only better control over driving any car, bus and or truck but your Agency Car gets upgraded as well with new abilities, such as adding car-mounted guns, think Twisted Metal)- The world of CrackDown has some nice level design and areas both high (like skyscraper roof tops) and low (deep underground bunkers) are well though out and fun to traverse.- Access to Halo 3 Beta TestBAD:- No plot to speak of outside of being a super-cop and killing gang lords.- Game is short with only 24 bosses and 3 riots (gang riots happen in each area after all gang leaders are killing in that area).- Driving cars feels a bit sloppy even after getting 4 star max driving skills.- Outside of foot/driving races, looking for orbs (about 500 in the game), and killing bosses there is not too much to do in the world of CrackDown.- The Music in this title is not that great and over all forgettable - mostly generic techno (you only can get music while in a car, while on foot which you spend 90% of the game you get no music - like GTA). Thank god, using Xbox 360 built in \"play any song I want at anytime\" feature was here to save the day, just before you play a the game put in your favorite music CD, rip it onto the 360's Hard Drive and then later on while playing your game click the Xbox 360 guide button and go to select track (and play your own songs).IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- A Sci-Fi (although near future feeling) Third Person Shooter (Camera behind the player)- A go anywhere do anything at any time type of game that we have seen in such games as Grand Theft Auto. The biggest difference is now you play as a super-cop charged with killing criminals instead of a gang member trying to become a gang lord.- Jumping plays a big role in the game and jumping roof top to roof top (like the comedic super hero The Tick) is not only fun but opens up a large part of the game space available for play.- Co-op gameplay is fun and useful (2 players are able to do things one player could not do alone, example: One player gets into a car/truck and the other player can throw said car/truck well behind enemy lines)GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (PS2/Xbox/PC)- Saints Row (Xbox 360)- Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction (PS2/Xbox)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- The first shipments of CrackDown come with free access/invite to the Halo 3 beta (which starts 5/16/07 and ends 6/7/07); later releases will not have this feature.- You can download a character pack for this game for free over XBL Marketplace, this pack will add four new characters to your character select screen.- There are Two downloadable packs for this game on XBL Marketplace which unlock seven new achievements and an ability to reset gangs (but keep your level of stats), get a new new ground attack, a new noise indicator makes it easier to find orbs (when you get to the last 20 or so), makes stunt ring more visible, and fixes some minor problems with targeting and camera angles when driving. The first pack is called the Free-For-All Pack which is a FREE and has the Keys to the City Mode (where you will be able to spawn such items such as vehicles, explosive barrels and change time of day at any time. Your characters skill level can be changed to your likeing and you can turn on/off infinite ammunition as well as GOD mode, achievements and game saving is turned off when in the Keys to the City Mode), a new vehicle selection system has been integrated into the agency garage which allows for new colors (such as Blue, Red and Green) for all cars even agency cars and now players can impound any civilian or enemy vehicle and store them in the agency garage as well. The Getting Busy Bonus Pack which sells for 800 Microsoft points ($10.00 USD) has three new vehicles such as the Beach Buggy (with Chain gun), Race Car (Which looks like a wacky go-kart, but is fast), and Armored Car (Looks like the Mini-Tank/Armored Car from the 80's Aliens [Alien 2] movie), This pack also has some new game types (like Stockpile and Rocket Tag) and even has five new weapons such as the Muilt-Grenade launcher, Proximity Mines, Harpoon Gun, Chain Gun, and even a Cloaking Device.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2007"}

Taegel","summary":"Assassin's Creed 2 on Steroids","reviewText":"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood feels like it could almost be chapter 2 of Assassin's Creed 2.  It's a very similar game, only everything has been upgraded, refined and improved.  These improvements are just some new bells and whistles and a shinier coat of paint -- it's a deeper game that incorporates more strategy along with the awesome new ways to kill people.The story in a nutshell: The stakes increase even more as the Borgia family drops the hammer on the Assassins for all the hell Ezio raised in AC2.It's the same world, only localized to a fully realized, enormous Rome.  Hence, you're not having to schlep it from city to city on a horse, which is nice.  Limiting the story to Rome (for the most part) also gives the game more focus.The gameplay is more or less the same, only enhanced with more diverse objectives, more fighting moves, more weapons.  You also begin to build a guild of assassins whom you train, equip and build. Having a team of assassins to do your bidding is not only amusing, but becomes a necessary part of your strategy to complete some missions.ACB is also more focused on the story at hand.  In AC2, there are all sort of side-missions that while mostly fun, have nothing to do with the superobjective of the story.  While I was playing AC2, I'd think, \"Why am I collecting these feathers?\"  or \"Why am I going to beat up a cheating husband while in the meantime I'm supposed to be rescuing my family on the eve of their scheduled execution?\"  Obviously video games have lots of conceits, but Brotherhood keeps these to a minimum, so that Ezio's efforts are more or less contributing to defeating the Borgias.An aside: If you haven't played Assassin's Creed 2, I'd recommend starting there.  It begins the story of Ezio, and Brotherhood is a continuation of that story.The bottom line is that this game is FUN.  Nay, SUPER FUN.  I haven't had this big a blast playing a video game since RED DEAD REDEMPTION, UNCHARTED 2 and ASSASSIN'S CREED 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2010"}

The graphics are subpar, even for the Wii.  The missions do run together and while there are hundreds of building to go into, they basically all have one of 8 or so layouts.  Every hotel and club is the same as ones on the other side of town.  The Michael character is awful and the events of the movie are changed and out of order.  I can't argue any of these points.Yet, the game is simply a blast.  The controls are spot on, from great melee fighting to the excellent lock and aim shooting system, you will control your character better than you thought possible.  Also, for an epic game, its remarkably easy to use on a casual basis.  Have a few hours?  Do some missions and blow up some compounds.  Have a few minutes?  Kill some gangsters and take over a bakery.  Its all up to you.Sure, its a GTA clone, but its a good GTA clone.  And for $30 you can't go wrong.

The graphics were surprisingly impressive and the combatives that you use, (Such weaponry as the soul reaver, Kain Reaver, Ariel reaver, Fire Reaver, Etc) is impressive and totally sucks you in.  There are two reasons that I gave this game 4 stars instead of five stars: It can be very hard due to the puzzles and lack of direction, and plus it can be boring after a while because the enemies get pretty redundant after the first couple of levels.

In this action-comedy, the full cast of voice actors from the TV show and movie reprise their roles to lend the ultimate in authenticity and realism to the game. In The Simpsons Game, Homer, Marge, Bart, and Lisa use exciting, all-new powers to save the world from rising chaos. To help the Simpsons, gamers at home must journey through all of Springfield (as well as vast worlds beyond!), vanquish an amazing array of villains, and fight their way through parodies of multiple popular games.","reviewerName":"bixodoido","summary":"A review from a long time fan of the show who's actually played the game","reviewText":"The Simpsons game deserves credit for bringing the world of Springfield to life--I'll give it that much.  As you run around the interactive town, going into landmark locations like Moe's or Krusty Burger and listening to the mumblings of the town's citizens you know and love you can't help but be appreciative that the experience was FINALLY put into a game.  The game is also voiced by the actual cast, thus giving the game validity and making it actually feel that you're involved in an episode of the show.That said, the Simpsons game delivers only a mediocre gameplay experience.  The game features several levels (18 I believe) with various silly scenarios.  You progress through the levels using two members of the Simpson family in each of them, and each family member has abilities that are useful and can help you in unique situations, and each has a collectible item (Homer has Duff bottle caps, for example) to obtain during the levels and throughout Springfield.  The game also features \"Cliches,\" which are unlocked moments when you do certain things in the game and Comic Book Guy pops out with a sarcastic comment about how boiling lava (or whatever) in video games is not very original.The levels are mildly amusing and some of the commentary from both the Simpsons and the town's denizens is very entertaining.  The gameplay, however, is lacking.  Not only does the camera get annoying, since it never quite adjusts the way you need it to, but the controls have several little quirks that can drive you crazy if you play the game for any amount of time (such as Bart's aiming mechanism for his slingshot).  This may not be enough to deter hardcore fans of the show, but it's something to keep in mind.That brings me to another very, very big disappointment with the game.  Sometimes the animation is great, and the 3-D imaging while you're actually playing is pretty good.  At other times though, especially during the cutscenes, the game features some of the most sloppy animation I've ever seen in a game.  It's tough to describe, but suffice it to say that some cutscenes look as though the characters in them were literally cut out by a 10 year old with scissors and then stuck onto the 3-D background.  The result is horrible--just awful--and I cringed every time I saw those scenes with jagged lined and flat-looking characters on my high definition display.If you're a fan of the Simpsons it's probably worth renting this game.  Don't buy it, though, just because it's got the Simpsons name on it, but take it for a test drive first.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2007"}

The art style will probably immediately remind many comic fans of Sin City combined with Hell Boy.  The game has attitude when it could have very easily turned out to be a foul-mouthed pathetic mockery of comic-book style.GRAPHICS: Very stylish.  Hands down, the graphical presentation is best part of this game.  The only colors used are white, black, red and a smattering of yellow here and there.  The high contrast art style is surprisingly good, although it can be harsh on the eyes at times.  As long as I had the lights on around the TV I managed to avoid issues, but playing this game in the dark would probably be painful.  You'll probably either love the graphics or hate them.STORY: Without giving away too much, you play a guy named Jack who is part of a sick and twisted reality TV show that features psychopaths trying to kill anything that moves.  It's honestly a pretty good story from what I've seen and I'm enjoying it a lot, but I can already tell it's short.GAMEPLAY: Controls and gameplay are pretty tight.  The camera could have been a lot smoother and there were some questionable decisions on one or two of the button placements, but overall, this game controls very well.  Best of all, this game incorporates motion control without turning into a waggle-fest.  Gameplay can get a bit repetitive and is pretty linear, but this is offset by the fact that the game encourages you to experiment with different ways of killing people.  Mini-games pop up along the way which also break up the monotony.  I haven't played all of the mini-games yet, but so far all of them have been enjoyable.AUDIO: Audio is a mixed bag.  The individual components of the game's audio are all very good... sound effects, music, voice acting, and the announcers.  When they combine together sometimes all I can hear is noise.  I had to turn the sound effects and background music down to about 50% in order to keep the voice overs and announcers from being drowned out in a mess of noise.  My favorite part of the audio is the announcers, one of which is played by the voice of Bender from Futurama.  The audio does get repetitive at times, but most announcers within video games are like that, so it is to be expected.REPLAY VALUE: This is the weakest point of the game.  I am sure that I've beat about half the game in two sittings, but I understand that the hard mode is much more difficult.  I figure I'll get about 6-7 hours out of the game on my first play through, which is pretty low for a full-price game.MULTI-PLAYER: Multi-player modes are present in this game, but I haven't tried them out yet.  Looks like standard mini-game fun.Overall, I highly recommend this game if you enjoy visceral, bloody games and have a high tolerance for rude humor and profanity.  Watch a few online videos of the game in action.  If you are concerned about the short game length, I recommend renting it because it is pretty short.  I personally expect that this game will be hard to find in a year or two, which will probably also make this a near instant collectors item.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0047TG2R0","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Aikens","summary":"Smoke and Mirrors Mostly but still fun","reviewText":"This game was touted as an improved experience on console. The graphics, combat system, inventory system, and the overall presentation were supposed to be improved drastically. However, what I found when I played the game was a game that bioware cut corners everywhere and the game just seemed to be rushed. Some things are improved somewhat such as the graphics (although there is still little detail in the overused areas in the game) and the combat system (which looks cool but 20hours or so in you get tired of the same old animations and the battles where enemies spawn out of nowhere over and over. Overall, I do not think the game was developed around the storyline, but the the storyline was made to match the game. The inventory system was less for the developers to do in the name of progress. Your party looks the same throughout (except for a few minor changes such as when Aveline joins the guard) and the upgrades must be bought from vendors although you can change accessories and weapons. The main problem I had with this system was finding the upgrades, I ended up searching every vendor every time something major in the storyline happened and if you miss some then it seems like they are not to be found as time passes by. The other problem with the inventory system is the sheer amount of junk you find that is automatically labeled junk and goes into your junk pile in the inventory. It cannot be looked at even though some of it is books. All you can do is sell it. Well then why not get rid of it completely and just give extra coin instead? The problems just start there though.The storyline is missing the epicness that made Origins so engaging and this alone would not have been such a problem if there was at least an antagonist through the first 2/3's of the game. Somehow 20hours in I still felt disconnected from the world, part of this comes from each area being used over and over. If you have played Origins then think of Denerim only slightly larger with a few small areas outside of it and a night and day system and that is it. The night system just seems like another excuse to reuse the same areas over and over and make it seem like its bigger than it actually is.  The story also suffers because of lapses in believability, for my first play through i played as an apostate mage and although it is mentioned in conversation that the Templars are right on my tail, I never once felt like that was so, in fact the templars are so stupid that even as I cast spells in front of them (as I battled against some blood mages) they never once accused me. In fact during the conversation that followed they mentioned several times how they thought apostates were evil and needed to be stopped. The game also suffers when I do the item quests as there is no dialog or story but a random npc just says something like \"Thanks I thought I had misplaced that\" as you return an item you randomly found in a dungeon or sack or something. The best one was when I found someone's remains and this npc said the \"I must have misplaced that\" line when I gave them to him. The 10 years in the same city storyline just feels like it was built around not having to do as much work so the game could come out faster.It's not all bad though, as where the storyline shines is with the character quests and interactions. These are too few though but they carry the weight and heart that the main quest is missing for the most part. The characters are all interesting save for the disappointing Anders and the DLC only Sebastion who are both kind of lame. That saddens me quite a bit as Anders was my favorite character in Awakening. Speaking to your party members and gift giving have both been \"upgraded\" as now you can only talk to them in their home base in the city and only when a quest pops up that says go talk to them. Gifts have been turned into quests and now there are a lot less gifts in the game. I would be remiss not to mention the new mass effect style conversation wheel which works well for the most part but even with that bioware cut corners as there are quite a few times that no matter what is picked you get the same generic reply from the character you are talking to. It also takes part of the fun of the conversations out as you don't pick your comment as much as you pick the type of comment you want to make. The voice acting is well done although there isn't as much voice acting here, despite the main character now talking, as there was in origins.The leveling system has also been changed as certain skills or spells can now only be taken by certain characters, for instance Merrill cannot take any spells in the creation school. So for a healer mage your main character or Anders is your only option. There is only one true shield tank on there and it is Aveline. The main character is the only one who can take specializations now and each of the party members get options to take their own personal skills or spell school, which is neat but I liked the customization of the old system much better.There are also couple of bugs I want to mention, the most annoying one being that I cannot attack with my mage sometimes. I can cast spells but then out of nowhere my mage refuses to attack and just twirls his staff around. If you switch characters then come back it fixes it most of the time. The other one that is just plain annoying is how loot sometimes will sit there after battle for a couple of minutes before it will let you loot it. For a fast paced combat system this is a major problem.I love origins and gave Dragon Age 2 the benefit of the doubt since it was announced but it seems more like a spin off or a massive DLC than an actual sequel. I am still not regretting buying it, but after one play through I think I am done and it took me 3 play throughs before I started getting tired of origins. Dragon Age 2 is still a fun game but it could have been so much better. The seeds are there for one of the best rpgs available but this is the first time that I truly felt like bioware dropped the ball. Overall, I would say, buy it right now only if you are a huge bioware fan but prepare to be shocked and disappointed by the changes and the lack of polish on the title, otherwise wait for the price to drop before picking it up.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2011"}

Kim","summary":"Metroid, Metroid,..Metroid-","reviewText":"It's little over 2am and just finished Metroid Zero Mission under 4 hours.  I'm extremely tired right now, however, I'm forcing myself to write a review while everything is still fresh.Game starts immediately after GameBoy logo disappears to set the urgent mood of the game (you will see and appreciate its fresh intro).  I just thought about how I should describe this game (because I can't think right now, ha!) and I think the best way to describe this game is by comparing with Metroid Fusion (although this game is REMAKE of original Metroid).  This game is very similar with Metroid Fusion in the sense that their graphical presentation is very similar.  Metroid Fusion came out earlier than Metroid Zero Mission and you would expect somewhat better graphical presentation than Metroid Fusion although Metroid Zero Mission takes place way before Metroid Fusion in its time line.  However, Nintendo didn't forget that this is the very first mission - it would be a mistake to present this game in a fancy, flash way, graphically superior than Metroid Fusion-  Of course, I'm not saying that Metroid Zero Mission looks outdated.  It looks beautiful, BEAUTIFUL, however, Nintendo managed to strike that perfect balance where the game looks graphically beautiful while attaining `this-is-first-mission-atmosphere'.  It's very subtle, however, you can discern the difference.One thing I didn't like about Metroid Fusion was that it sort of killed the exploration aspect by literally telling you where to go next.  It's not really same with Metroid Zero Mission although it does show you where you should go next.  I said it's not really same in the sense that you would have to figure out how to get there and it takes lot of turns and finding out secret passages to get there.  And moreover, I didn't feel that Metroid Zero Mission killed the exploration aspect in any sense where as it was the case with Metroid Fusion.Metroid Fusion incorporated this movie-score-like-music in order to initiate this `sci-fi' movie feel to it, which was great with the kind of story it had.  However, Metroid Zero Mission reused same music from previous Metroid games.  It sounds bad, right?  Wrong.  I absolutely loved it.  I was in heaven for about 4 hours because of remake songs from previous Metroid games, not just original but PREVIOUS games.  You will be surprised for what they used as their credit ending song because I think it is the best credit ending song till today for Metroid games (and not to mention its original Metroid title song, it literally gives me goose bumps).I was able to recognize lot of part of Metroid Zero Mission from its original counterpart.  However, trust me, this game literally feels like totally new game because they did not just applied more vibrant color, changed the structure of places here and there- they literally created everything from scratch except the `feel' of original Metroid here and there with its respect areas.  I wouldn't call this game really remake of original Metroid but rather they mixed all the element from original Metroid to Metroid Fusion.  I did not feel like playing original Metroid, Metroid 2, Super Metroid, and Metroid Fusion, which I have no complaint because they have mixed everything with style.I guess the best feature from Metroid Fusion was its story twist toward the end, which I thought it literally elevated mere gaming status to something higher.  And Metroid Zero Mission is no exception.  It shows what really happened after Samus evacuates from Planet Zebes after defeating Mother Brain.  I'm not gonna spoil the story here but just wanna say that I was `scared'.  You get to play a considerable amount of area after defeating Mother Brain and I was `terrified' by its game play and atmosphere (ok, may be it's just me).  Not only it will show you what really happened but also it shows personal past of Samus when she was young with the planet history in a vague term.Well, I thought the game was on the short side, however, not complaining because they have recreated the original Metroid with lot of style and added much more area to explore.  Not only that, they have added some galleries and get this: ORIGINAL METROID.  That's right, Original Metroid on your Gameboy Advance!!!  Wow, incredible (I played little bit of it and my reaction is SWEEEET~).You know, to tell you honestly, I would've given this game 5 Stars anyway even if they included only original part of Metroid with only one hour of game play- without any extra stage, original Metroid, etc.  I'm just happened to be biased when it comes to Metroid, still remembering Metroid game art cover vividly, ending theme of Metroid 2, emotional sacrifice of a `Metroid', and the relationship between Samus and the Navigation...  Ok, I'm not sure if I was able to describe how I felt about the game but gotta sleep now.  Whether you buy this game or not (it will be a fatal mistake for you if you do not buy this, however), I dedicate this review to Samus, Metroid, and rest of Planet Zebes.Gosh, I love Metroid (sigh, and can't believe I'm turning 30 next month..)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2004"}

Sme\"","summary":"A good but not perfect RPG game","reviewText":"Much of the hype this year has been about \"Mass Effect 2,\" which is well deserved, so I thought it would be interesting (and help me understand the story better) to play the prequel.\"Mass Effect\" is a RPG (role playing game) set in a universe only a few hundred years in the future.  Some of the \"feel\" reminded me of Babylon 5, and a very little bit of Star Trek.  The Geth (the bad guys)honestly look like they were inspired by the killer robots from the obscure 1996 Dennis Hopper film \"Space Truckers.\"As with most RPG's the quests are not linear, there are some that advance the story while others are mainly filler.  However, in Mass Effect the side quests usually let you gather equipment and supplies.  You also can tailor your character's appearance and select their gender.These games typically allow a character to become more good or bad by their interactions, in Mass Effect this is a more Yin and Yang concept of Paragon and Renegade.  Neither is truly good or bad, and both can at times be a liability or an advantage depending upon the situation.The universe it plays out is is large and complex, and the storyline likely could fill in several sequel games and probably will.  Overall I'd rate this and it's sequel as one of the top 20 games I've played, however there was still room for improvement which Mass Effect 2 largely fixed.  I'll list the problem areas I saw below:Weapon overheating: This was a serious limitation that could not always be gotten around by planning and tactics.  Once it overheats that's it until it cools down.  Mass Effect 2 fixed this by letting you \"reload\" the heat dissipators.Upgrades: The upgrade system only has four classes of weapons, but each type has literally dozens of variants.  The upgrade system wasn't very intuitive to figure out and required digging through endless lockers and storage areas to get the \"right set.\"  However the effort pays off as by the end of the game you'll have a very powerful character.  Mass Effect 2 has instead more weapons types and one console where possible upgrades are listed and can be applied.The universe is a little too big:  There were several times I'd have to stop and try to figure out where I was going and what I needed to do, and several of the side quests had a cookie cutter appearance to them.  The same rooms or landscape would be used, just in a different color or lighting.  The more direct storyline of Mass Effect 2 is sometimes called a criticism, but honestly you could miss large portions of the first game and not even know it.Repetitious quests: Many of the quests had the same goal, go in and kill all the bad guys in a bunker and grab the goods, while the sequel had changing and more plot oriented goals.That's about it. Almost the sole reason the PC version is rated lower by people than the console version is because of SecuROM.  The DRM on newer games is getting so ridiculous I may finally just buy a console, even though playing shooter games on a gamepad is like trying to fly a plane with a keyboard, it's not much fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2010"}
{"product_name":"B004QEV0MI","description":"","reviewerName":"Axle F. \"The Brutally Honest Critical Reviewer\"","summary":"They added some new things, but took away even more.","reviewText":"This is a single player only review. I don't do online or multiplayer/co-op as that stuff is done to death nowadays.*EDIT* I brought the review score down one more star because of the recent DLC content. THEY ARE RIPOFFS!! They only add 3-6 missions/basic activities each and can be completed in under 30 minutes at the cost of $6 or more EACH!! This is just too much and I am tired of all these companies and their \"Micro-Transactions\" and Day one DLC stuff that should have been in the game from the very beginning! THQ AND VOLITION HAVE LOST ANOTHER ONCE FAITHFUL FAN OF THEIR GAMES! AND HAVE LOST THE MONEY THIS FAITHFUL FAN HAS FOR FUTURE RELEASES! *EDIT*I own this game on PC and on Xbox 360. I am a fan of the Saints Row Series. I understand that gaming companies are given limited development time, and this game is using a new engine over the previous games, but, this game is just lacking when compared to the previous games.I will be comparing this to Saints Row 2, as a sequel or an on-going series of games should always \"out-do\" the previous versions. You should not make a \"New\" game in a series that is worse than the previous games.I can sum this game up quite simply as, \"The more I play Saints Row The Third, the more I want to go back to Saints Row 2.\"The game is zany, wacky, random, and fun on its own... But when compared to Saints Row 2, it just falls short on content... Though THQ may give you the full game if you are willing to pay for it in bits and pieces over the next year or so for tiny little DLC packs that may contain one outfit, weapon, or non-customizable vehicle.Pros:1. Great graphics when compared to previous games.2. Keeps \"SOME\" of the customization options that made the previous 2 games so great.3. Little to no learning curve to game controls.4. Tons of customization options for vehicles, the FEW weapons in the game, character design, and some clothing customization.5. Plenty of WTF?!? and Funny moments. So the laughs made it worth buying.6. Improved Vehicle controls.7. Great voice acting. The player character will say different things in the game depending on what player voice you use. And depending on what \"homies\" you call in the game, they will have dialogs with each other some times.Cons:1. Customization has been SEVERELY limited when compared to Saints 1 & 22. There is HALF the amount of vehicles available in this game when compared to previous Saints Row games.3. There is no more clothing Layering option. Instead, there are pre-made outfits you can mix and match in top and bottom styles and pick the color of various parts. No more clothing decals/logos to choose from either.4. The characters have little to no character development during the storyline, so you don't get attached to anyone like in previous games..5. There is no Airport or waterways traffic AT ALL in the game, while the previous games felt much more \"Alive\" with boats and planes doing what they would be expected to do in these places.6. No more mission replay option!7. No crib customization.8. The story just isn't as \"free-roam\" and open or involving as Saints row 2. There is little to no character development in this game. You cannot \"choose\" who to go after first, so the game has been made more LINEAR on rails at times (meaning mostly going from Point A to B without being given a choice). Whereas in Saints Row 2 you could choose what, who, and where you wanted to go. In fact, nearly half the missions in the story line are just the first level of various side activities in the game, so this game is much, much, shorter than Saints Row 2.9. There is still a problem with \"Pop-in, Pop-out\" And no options for draw distance. So objects and people will appear and disappear a large amount of the time, if you get too far from them or turn your focus/camera in a different direction and then back, though it is less noticeable than in the previous games.10. No more \"Service\" Vehicle activities. In Saints Row 2 you could get into an Ambulance, fire truck, taxi, tow truck, etc.., and do activities and get rewards related to what those vehicles would do in the real world. One of the things that made it such a fun \"Sand Box\" game.11. The city in Saints Row The Third is smaller than in Saints Row 2 and just feels a lot more \"Bland\" It just doesn't have the different personalities that the parts of the city in Saints Row 2 had.12. No more in game phone call options. Not a big feature, but it was sometimes useful to call a cab, or ambulance or such.13. The stronghold type missions and a large majority of Interior cells are gone. Instead of the stronghold missions, they have been replaced with a bunch of unthinking goons from whatever gangs just hanging out on a street corner or parking lot that you can take out with a single grenade. There are no more gas stations, or convenience stores to rob and create chaos in and around.14. Objects in the game world are no long able to be interacted with, which is a huge disappointment for me. NO MORE IMPROVISED WEAPONS!! It was fun to pull out a parking meter and beat a meter-maid with it, or throw a full size mail box at a fleeing bad guy, or run after a guy with a broken traffic light pole.15. A large amount of side activities and Easter eggs are gone. No more \"fuzz\", no more \"Bathroom Ho\", no more hidden islands or places to explore, no more \"Fight Club\", no more \"Demolition derby\", no more Water & sky & boat \"Races\", no more \"zombie\" side activities, and so on.16. AND WORST OF ALL: The massive amount of DLC \"Down Loadable Content\" that has been found already installed on the game disc that you have to pay your real life money for to \"Unlock\" and be able to play with it in the game. (This is money you have to pay more than the initial price of the game for!!) And most of the DLC is NOT SUBSTANTIAL IN ANY WAY, usually consisting of ONE full body outfit and a NON-CUSTOMIZABLE vehicle, and weapon, OR LESS! You even have to pay for CHEATS that were included in the previous games for FREE! WTF?!?!?I'm hoping that there will be a modding community or patches or such to fix a lot of these missing things for the PC version, like Saints Row 2 got for PC, but it looks like you should really just rent this for Xbox 360 and play it first for a while before deciding to buy it or not. For the PC players look up \"Gentlemen of The Row\" for Saints Row 2 mods and fixes and \"Gentlement of Steelport\" for saints row the third mods.The game is fun... But having played, and still playing Saints Row 1 & 2, many times over, it is just... lacking. I want to say Saints Row The Third is a great game, but it just feels half finished when compared to the other games. It's a lot like what happened to the Newest GTA IV when compared to the older GTA San Andreas, where the previous game was more fun and had more content than the newest game.I would have given this a higher rating if I had never played the previous games. I have to give it a rating with a smile and an \"Ehhh....\"It's an okay game just not a GREAT game like Saints Row 2. So do yourself a favor and get Saints Row 2 or Saints Row 1 first. If you don't like the first two games then you will likely love this game... But if you love the first two games, you will not like this one.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2011"}

A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Players will enter this new environment and follow the exploits of their own customized snow pirate on their quest to seize control of the changing planet.GameplayLost Planet 2, like the original game in the series, is a third-person shooter featuring huge boss battles, challenging terrain and the ability to pop in and out of battle mechs, known in-game as Vital Suits. The primary difference in gameplay this time around hinges on the inclusion of RPG gameplay elements. Players can now customize many of the aspects of their playable snow pirate, including his physical attributes, clothing and to a certain extent, weaponry and gestures. Players will control these customized heroes across 6 interconnected episodes, creating a truly unique and interactive experience that changes depending upon the actions of the players involved.

However,Lost Planet 2's biggest weapons come on two legs: the heavily armed and armored robotic Vital Suits return in greater numbers and variety than the first game.

The matching system might not be as nice and easy as Call of Duty games, but it works fine.The main gameplay is awesome! I didn't pick this game up on the release date because of the bad reviews from big publishers such as IGN and now I regret it. Instead, I picked up Red Dead Redemption on the same month this game was released. To be honest, I didn't like Red Dead Redemption that much.

McGraw","summary":"Fun Game Better for Fans of the Show Vs Gamers","reviewText":"Ok so I am not like, -the- most hardcore gamer in the world (well my xbl score is 32,812 so I'm no slouch either) and FPS's usually kind of bore me, but I love zombies, I love the Walking Dead, and I hate games that aren't -fun-. Like, I found Dead Space 2 to be tedious, it made you work for everything and there was no real fun to it. It was pretty, but painful, like a bad date.The Walking Dead Survival Instinct is not the best game in the world, it's not gonna win any awards for innovation or graphics, but it's fun and it's obviously totally geared toward fans of the show. The TellTale game immersed us in the comic universe, and Survival Instinct does the same for the TV universe.Honestly a lot of the reviews I've seen on youtube or kotaku (who lost all credibility when they said if you wanted a good Southern Zombie game to play L4D2 which is awful as we all know) just seemed like they were aiming for all the low hanging fruit they could find. Yeah this game is a cheapish TV tie-in that rests on its laurels, but 99.99999999999% of the time that is exactly the case with franchise tie-ins. Chances of getting a game on par with Bioshock or Limbo out of an existing IP is pretty unrealistic IMO, and I feel like a lot of people are hating on this specifically because this is -the- game to hate on this season. Like people complaining about the grapple mode, considering this is essentially a stealth game, you're not really SUPPOSED to get into the grapple sequences, let along enjoy them.So here's my breakdown:1) graphics - eh, better than Left 4 Dead but does look like early console titles2) voice acting - sparse but quite good3) plot - thin but ties into the show and fleshes out the relationship between the dixon bros4) gameplay - pretty simplistic with a range of melee or ranged weapons that are pretty easy to cycle through. no weapon degradation5) zombie AI - fine by me. people have complained that the walkers seem stupid but THEY ARE ZOMBIES WHAT DO YOU WANT? Also the zombies models are lacking as there seem to be maybe 10 unique zombies (not that this isn't also the case in L4D)6) length- it's pretty short but offers rewards for replay. since you have alternate routes to traverse it makes playing through a couple times more desirableTo me this game is a fusion of Oregon Trail and Dead Island, both are games that I enjoy. You have to figure out who to keep, how to keep them alive, and how to ration out supplies. It's not an overly complex game, but again it's enjoyable if you want to spent time shredding zombies up with a machete or crossbow.For real, I think this game is unfairly maligned because I feel like the wrong audience is reviewing it. Hardcore gamers who want up date games that push their console to the limit are not going to enjoy this. Norman Reedus fangirls and fans of the show are going to enjoy it because it provides backstory and fairy simplistic fighting mechanics making it easy to play regardless of where you fall on the gamer spectrum (unless you only play zynga games or some nonsense).So yeah, I went into this with suuuuuuuper low expectations and was pleasantly surprised since I was expecting something super glitchy (i haven't run into any really massive bugs) and awful, and it's just a pretty simple game where you run around either hiding from or slashing zombies. But I do feel that this is really made for the fans of the series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00004R9IB","description":"That cute little squishy guy is back in all his pastel glory to  sweeten up 2-D life on the Nintendo&nbsp;64. With 3-D games such asPerfect DarkandDonkey Kong&nbsp;64getting the bulk of  attention among consumers,Kirby 64provides a fun change of pace for both  young and experienced gamers who don't necessarily need all three  dimensions to have fun.Young gamers will love the bright, colorful graphics in this game,  which is 2-D with some 3-D foreground and background elements. Kirby is  joined by plenty of friends who will aid in his quest to recover the  pieces of an important shattered crystal.While the levels are a bit too easy for older gamers, the gameplay inKirby&nbsp;64is original enough to entertain all ages. Kirby  still has an appetite for enemies, sucking them up and spitting them  out, but he can also swallow them, inheriting abilities such as fire  and cutter. Also, Kirby can now combine enemy powers, often with  hilarious results. For instance, electricity plus stone turns Kirby  into an electrifying little light bulb. Sure, you don't need to use all  these powers, but they're still fun to play with.--Robb GuidoPros:Whimsical 2-D graphicsKirby 64's copy and combine abilities result in some unique and varied  gameplayCons:May be too easy and too cute for older players","reviewerName":"GintaxAlvissforever","summary":"One of the Most Memorable Kirby Games","reviewText":"I'm reviewing this game based on the Virtual Console version (because honestly, this game is too expensive).People say this game was too easy but this is actually one of the harder Kirby games out there (Mass Attack is probably the hardest in terms of actual gameplay while all the Kirby games are hard for the 100 percent competition). This game required you to get the 100 percent completion to get to the final boss.The plot takes place after Kirby Dreamland 3 completing the Dark Matter Trilogy (consisting of Kirby Dreamland 2 and 3 plus this game). Ripple Star a planet full of little fairies is suddenly attacked. The queen of the fairies sends one fairy named Ribbon away from the planet to protect the Crystal Shard that if it were to fall into the wrong hands would be devastating. As Ribbon attempts to escape, the Dark Matter chases after her. They managed to break the crystal sending it spiraling in different worlds. Kirby is just enjoying star gazing when Ribbon and a crystal falls on him. Immediately he decides to help Ribbon collect all the crystals and save her planet. Joining Kirby would later be a Waddle Dee (who might as well be Bandana Dee from Kirby Return to Dreamland) a painter named Adeline and King DDD as after saving them from the Dark Matter, they all join Kirby and Ribbon on his quest.This game was known for Kirby's powers working differently. When Kirby inhaled an enemy, he would gain a power. This is one of the only games where Kirby can combine the powers of his enemies and create a more powerful attack. For example getting a fire enemy and a boomerang foe would give Kirby the ability to use a fire sword (pretty broken in a lot of boss battles) where he can choose to swing it, protect himself from the top or throw it at the enemy in front of him. If you take two fire enemies, the ability of doing a simple fire dash suddenly becomes a phoenix rush. The Rock + Cutter ability is one of the best abilities in the game turning Kirby to stone and changing into one of his many friends from the previous game and each of them (except Kine) can do special abilities along with Kirby being immune to damage while stone (the best is being able to fly higher than how far Kirby can fly). Which is another thing. This game gives Kirby a limit to how much he can fly. You can tell as he starts drifting downward so no more flying over the stage or flying to dodge enemies for a long period of time.This game is divided into 6 worlds with a theme for each. The goal is to find all the crystals before moving on and its essential before getting to the final boss or get a bad ending. And finding the crystals that aren't in Pop Star or the first stage isn't easy. The bosses are unique in the game and some power abilities are pretty useless depending on the stage. The game is also surprisingly creepy despite the cute cover. Shiver Star is probably one of the most speculated topics online (especially since the common theory is Shiver Star is OUR planet earth and we as humans abandoned the place leaving it to machines that kill you in one hit and the planet freezes over...yeah).This game is worth the buy on the virtual console. However this game is also available on the 20th Kirby Anniversary. It brings nostalgia back and has a good difficulty.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2013"}

This game was great the second I started playing, but it just got better as I went along because at first, I had no idea how to play, but after I got the hang of it, and I got into the story, the game just got better ever minute of playing. It's not really HARD to play, but it's not really EASY either. I'd say the learning curve ( for me at least ) was about 1:30 hours. Which is not bad compared to some other RPGs out there. Anyways here is my stack up on the game:Graphics: 5/5. The graphics are just amazing in this game, from the opening sequence in 3D, to the in-game graphics, they fit great with the game, and have great color.Sound: 5/5. Very well done. Each world has a different rhythm, and when you are in battles and using your attacks, the sound is very, very, very good.Control: 4.5/5. For some people, the control may be hard and annoying, but like I said after that learning curve it will be easy as pie to know how to play the game.Fun: 4.5/5. This is what a lot of people have been waiting for. Kingdom Hearts for the PS2 was a huge success, so it was put onto the GBA, and done just as well as the consol version. There are times when this game is a little slow, and boring, and repetetive, ( get cards, get keys, open doors, move on. ) but the story is so intriging, and the cards you can use in battles are so cool, you don't really notice it. But there is another thing I didn't care for in this game. When you are in a battle against certain things, or bosses for example, you will be there for a while just trying to kill them. it is pretty hard to die in this game, though, because everytime you run out of cards you can simply hold A and get a new deck. This game is simple enough for most people to play, and the story is so interesting, you can't stop playing. Here's a bit of what the story is about:This game is based around Sora's memories, so what he sees sometimes can decieve him, and other characters also think different things or similar things. ( Knowing random peoples names with no explanation, hence the game name Chain of Memories. ) The story is basically the title of the game. So the few things I didn't like about this game was: How you are always stuck in a small room unless in a battle, needing cards and different keys to open some doors, and how the game is semi-repetetive. There are too many things in this game to go over that are good, but a few are: It's a portable Kingdom Hearts, it has Disney characters, and it's just a fun and overall great game. Buy this game for anyone at any age, and expierience the fun Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories has to give.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2005"}

{"product_name":"B003EZ1KGQ","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Conceptually and narratively bold, but the gameplay suffers a bit.","reviewText":"Dubai, the near future. Massive sandstorms have rendered the city almost inaccessible from the outside world. Just before this happened, the US Army's 33rd Battalion went into the city to help with the evacuation, and hasn't been heard from for six months. Three Delta Force operatives are sent into the city with orders to find out what's going on and report back. What they are embarking on is a journey into the heart of madness, war and death.Spec Ops: The Line is two things. The first is a fairly standard, cover-based action shooter, in which grim men shoot other grim men in the head with a variety of lethal weapons. The second is a meditation on the soul-destroying nature of war and the psychological trauma that exposure to long periods of violence and mayhem can cause. It's essentially a subversive take on games which apparently seek to glorify war, like the Call of Duty franchise, and instead argues that war is not a cartoon game. Much more than this, the game very deliberately makes itself often uncomfortable to play, to the point where the player may not be having any fun and may want to turn the game off (and, incredibly, the developers have said this is something they deliberately wanted to happen).The degree to which this works is up for debate. Spec Ops: The Line is an incredibly grim, hard-going game which does not relent on the action or the reflection on the death and slaughter afterwards. Some of the most harrowing scenes I've ever seen in a video game are present here: the scene where your soldiers deploy white phosphorus on an enemy position only to hit a load of sheltering refugees is going to be one of those watershed moments in gaming which people are talking about for years to come (a bit like the 'No Russian' bit of Modern Warfare 2, only not so gratuitous). The game borrows a lot of its atmosphere and tone from the movie Apocalypse Now (and the novel it is based on, Heart of Darkness), but also brings in contemporary imagery from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, particularly those incidents where well-meaning soldiers inadvertently bring about the death of innocent people. At every stage of the game, your character, Walker, makes what appears to be the right decision, but the consequences are almost always shown to be disastrous.This is both good and bad. Good, because games which challenge and subverts expectations and makes the player incredibly uncomfortable about what's happening are few and far between. If we are to accept that games are art, then games which are 'difficult' to conceptually 'get' are as valid as any 'difficult', art or theme-fuelled film or album is. On this basis, the game is successful because it sets out to do something different and thought-provoking, and does it.The problem is that the game also does not offer any choice outside of its linear story (aside from a few different endings, which can be replayed easily enough) despite choice being the cornerstone of the entire game's philosophy. You are constantly told that it is your choice, your decision which has brought about disaster, but it isn't. It's Walker's. Walker is the character you are directing through the game, but you aren't really playing him (aside from telling him to shoot Dude A before Dude D in a firefight). You have no choice, you simply have to experience Walker's story and its consequences. Normally in a game this isn't a problem - linear action games are a perfectly fine thing to play and enjoy - but here it jars badly with the game's focus on choice and consequence as a major theme. Giving you real choice and real consequences for those choices would have been the more powerful option...but would have made the game far more difficult to make for the developers, and diluted their point if you simply chose the white hat option throughout the game.As far as the gameplay goes, Spec Ops is a fairly mediocre shooter. It has a typically badly-designed cover system which sticks you to walls and can be fussy letting you go (especially when a grenade's just landed by your feet). It also does that weird thing of limiting you to just two guns at a time, but then throwing 50,000 enemies at you to kill and then loot, so the attempts to limit your choices of gun and ammo really come to nothing and the game goes to some lengths to ensure there's just the right gun for the job conveniently lying around when you need it. There's also the tradition profusion of cut scenes every 5 minutes or so of gameplay, although the point of the game is more found in the narrative than the gameplay, so this time around it actually works. Graphically the game is not very advanced, but its art direction is astonishing, depicting Dubai as a sort of actually-existing Rapture (from BioShock), a defiant technological challenge against nature. Particularly well-realised are the game's sandstorms, and the one outstanding gameplay moment of the title comes when you have to press through a blinding sandstorm whilst fighting off an enemy attack.Spec Ops: The Line (***) is a narratively and conceptually bold game, but one that sacrifices - to a certain extent - gameplay on the altar of theme and art. Those who want a fun shooter game are advised to look elsewhere. Those who want to see an example of a game that tries to be something much more ambitious and powerful than its flawed building blocks - even imperfectly - are advised to check this out. The game is available now in the UK (PC, X-Box 360, PS3) and USA (PC, X-Box 360, PS3).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2013"}

God of War style gameplay + Lightsabers = The Perfect Idea for a Video Game.2.) It actually had, given the level of quality of most post-original-trilogy releases, a pretty solid story line that tied in really well with the overall mythos. And wasn't actually that badly \"acted\" for a video game. It was a great examination of how the rebellion got started, and focused on the badass, evil SOB Darth Vader that I grew up with.3.) A pretty decent \"force\" mechanic which, although not perfect...got the job done.Now that is not to say that there weren't flaws in the first Force Unleashed game. The major issue with the first one was that the overall gameplay was, let's say, \"unpolished\". But given everything else it was easy to sort of gloss over that fact. Dropping a tie-fighter on a hanger full of storm troopers was pretty much \"the tits\" and made the fact that the controls were more wonky and less fluid not such a big deal.With this iteration however, it's a lot harder to ignore the glaring flaws in the gameplay. And that's because while it's still GOW with lightsabers, the story's gone a little of the rails (by way of the fact that Starkiller did not die and has been cloned - like....really?) and by this point you might expect a more polished experience. The fact is it's somehow worse.You are still grotesquely overpowered when fighting storm troopers, and then unable to fight other characters with certain aspects of your powers. Which doesn't really spice up the gameplay when there are like 4-6 different types of enemies in the game total. Most of the time when I died - it's because I would magically slide of some platform or get crushed by one of the two types of AT-AT walkers that appear everywhere amidst a million of the \"you-can't-use-force-powers-and/or-your-lightsaber-on-this-guy-type-of-enemies.\" That might have been an interesting challenge if it didn't make up literally 90% of the game. There are maybe 1-2 boss fights that I actually recall and neither of them presented any real/cool/memorable challenge.And I didn't die much really. In fact I think I finished the game literally in a couple of hours. When the credits rolled...I was blown away by how short this game was.If you liked the first one - and can find this used and cheap, and are looking for a quick way to kill a Sunday afternoon. Then this'll do the trick as along as you are not expecting much. If you're looking for something on par or better than the first one - you're going to be disappointed like crazy.They definitely set this up for another sequel. Let's hope that Force is Strong with that one. Cos' it ain't with this.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2011"}

From the wonderful beginnings of Arkham Asylum, the new chefs that've taken over cooked up another awesome batch of asskicking from the same tried recipe.The story is top notch. Batman, much younger and still feeling out a relationship with Gotham PD. This gives a great chance to introduce new and old villains with a feel of novelty and adventure. And the twists are so subtlely delivered that only on the second playthrough can you see them being set up.Gameplay is classic, with a few enhancements. Several new enemy types add real spice and novelty to the traditional setup, and the gadgets are clumsier and bulkier to reflect them being in development. I really liked how the disruptor was the size of a shotgun rather than a garage door opener. Upgrades and level are vastly more expansive and organic, and the leveling is spaced enough to not feel dumped on you but consistent enough you don't feel like you're grinding.Also novel are the crime scenes. While they're a bit railroaded in feel, its nice to have the new feel be more exploration and discovery than just scan four items and be done with it. The enigma riddle setup is slightly modified as well, with more a feel of eroding an enemy power base than collecting randomly scattered trophies, as well as a much more organic reason for doing the collection.Only a handful of issues prevent this from being five stars. Most infuriating, combat has reintroduced the flawed ground takedown that renders you helpless for several moments, meaning its very easy to have a freeflow interrupted. The story hiccups at a few points. At one point, you have to enter Lacey Towers. But theres no indication where that is on the map, and when you find it, to get inside you have to somehow know you need to beat up two cops on a different nearby building, cause that makes total sense. Some of the side bosses are so brief as to not even be appetizers, such as deathstroke being a single fight despite being touted as a major villain. Some aspects aren't well explained, like there's no \"on\" button on the generators you find, you have to have a story gadget. But even these glitches are only a few smudges.Overall, this is superb. Great story, well revamped combat, and novel, well crafted villains make this another great addition to the series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2013"}

Invest an hour into this game and get back to me, because I've played my share of difficult games, but few are as unforgiving as this game is. There's a plethora of RPGs out there, so does this game manage to stick with the pack or pave a path all its own? I find out in my review of the newest arrival in the fantasy RPG genre, Demon's Souls.To be completely honest, I'm the type of gamer that rarely explores outside a game's medium difficulty setting, and most of the times I died were because I made a poor decision that landed me in the Nexus (the game's version of limbo). I walked off cliffs, messed up a block (or parry), and forgot to heal myself when I was low on health plenty of times, but when I thought I had the hang of things and was doing good the game decided to stop going easy on me and threw me into a room with a terrifying demon that sent me packing with one swipe of its weapon. Demon's Souls does not care about your feelings. It is beautiful, it is addicting, and utterly ruthless.The times when I wasn't being ravaged were when I got to really take in the game's locales. There is some gorgeous scenery in this game, the dungeons are dark and creepy, the castles look ancient, the graveyards are unnerving, every location in this game is beautifully imagined and immensely fun to explore. There's also a decent variety in the locations; you'll be exploring expansive vistas one minute and crawling through claustrophobic corridors the next. This isn't the type of game that forces you to explore dungeon after dungeon, there's a good level of diversity to keep it fresh.The game is divided into five locations that can be traveled to from the Nexus, the hub the connects them all. Each location has a very different look and feel to it; you start off at a castle before moving on to underground tunnels and a couple other locales. Each section has enemies exclusive to its location, my favorite being the Shrine of Storms level where you have to fight skeletons as giant manta ray shaped creatures fly overhead.Demon's Souls has a very imaginative story that gets revealed to you through many very cool grainy cinematics. The story surrounds the search for power and wealth of King Allant XII who brought unprecedented prosperity to the kingdom of Boletaria. That is, until a thick fog covered the lands separating the kingdom from the rest of the world. Those who entered the fog never returned. The aging King Allant XII had awakened the Old One, a great beast below the Nexus, which in turn let loose the fog and hordes of demons. The Demons grow stronger and more powerful with every soul they devour. The story makes for the perfect backdrop and is also a great incentive to keep going, just so you can see what's going to happen next.Some of my favorite parts of the game were also the sections where I managed to die often. I`m talking about the game's bosses, which are truly petrifying. They're usually intimidating because of their mammoth size or their disturbing design. Fortunately, you can team up with two friends and take them down through teamwork (or, in my case watch as you all die one by one but the former sounds better). The bosses are always tough, but also extraordinarily fun to fight. There's no better feeling than the wave of satisfaction (and relief) of conquering your first boss.That brings me to what is arguably the game's best, and most innovative feature: the multiplayer. When From Software wasn't thinking of inventive ways to punish you for being such a weakling they were thinking of ways to make the online support incredibly original. If you want to help other players fight through the tougher sections of the game you and two others can team up and fight alongside each other. If you're feeling a little less kind you can enter another player's world and fight them as an evil spirit and attempt to take them out. Many games in this genre have some form of co-op or PvP but Demon's Souls takes it to the next level by letting you interact with other players outside of the aforementioned features. When you die you leave a bloodstain that can be touched to see how the recently deceased met their end. Thankfully, you only leave one bloodstain at a time, otherwise you could probably tell what levels I just got through because they looked like the elevator scene from The Shining.Like any good RPG, there's a ton of customization in this game. You can tailor your character's appearance to make him or her look like whoever you want (mine resembled a young Dan Aykroyd), your class, and equipped items. Being able to make your character your own really helps to make the dozens of times the game chews you up and spits you out even more heartbreaking, but when playing online no two characters will be alike.  If you find yourself spending more time in the Nexus than playing the actual game you can always trade the demon's souls gathered from slain foes for new items, upgrades, and repairs.The multiplayer is less an addition than a seamless integration; if you want to play with or against other players there's nothing stopping you from doing so. But if you're looking to have a less noticeable effect on other players' worlds you can always leave your mark (quite literally) through your bloodstains, or through helpful messages written on walls. If you find a particularly useful (or not-so useful) hint or tip scrawled on the wall you can rate it so other players know whether to heed your advice or ignore it. Another cool addition was the wandering spirits of other players, which made the game feel even more real, and if you follow one long enough there's a chance you could find something you otherwise would've missed.This is a truly amazing game with a unique setting, gorgeous environments, and more than a couple jaw-dropping moments. Unfortunately, for me the game's controller tossing level of difficulty keeps it from achieving a place amongst my all-time favorite games. In no way should its difficulty detract you from diving into this game, because for any RPG fan this is a game you shouldn't miss. When a game's difficulty is my only real gripe that just goes to show how great it really is. Maybe they should've just included a \"Wussy Baby\" difficulty for gamers such as myself?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0014UGK8G","reviewerName":"Michael G. Lustig","summary":"Thankfully you can try the demo before you buy this.","reviewText":"Hey Amazon: Where's my golden sledge hammer for pre-ordering?  I need it bad.  I found the answer online.  Type HARDHITTER in the game options cheats section and you get the gold hammer for multiplayer use.I've downloaded probably 100 demos this year since I'm tired of buying games based upon hype or reviewers (other than me).  That said; download Wheelman for some good laughs...OK, back to Red Faction.  The \"Red\" in Red faction refers to Mars not Russia.  The plot is very similar to Total Recall meets Demolition Man in many ways.  Your player is a miner who collects salvage for money.  The planet is controlled by a group called the EDF who are running Mars like a dictatorship.  Your goal is to destroy EDF equipment, kill their soldiers in order to get scrap and raise overall morale.  If you die too much or too many workers get killed morale drops and that's not good.  As morale goes up, the workers join you while fighting and there are better drops and more ammo re-supply trunks.There's a mix between missions and just cruising around until you find something to blow up.  The missions start easy but get progressivley more difficult as you liberate more sectors.  There are five sectors in total and it take a few key missions to liberate each one.  The enemy combatants (ECs) aren't too smart (like they are in COD).  If you start getting pounded, running away or hiding works almost every time -- especially if you hide in a crate.  In other words, the ECs don't pursue you.OK, I didn't read the manual (RTFM) so I didn't get the World Map until I was on like the second or third sector.  You press the Select button and highlight your destination and the game plots a course for you.  This is a very cool feature.  Keep in mind that there's a lot of loopbacks and you can almost always find quicker routes by driving over a mountain or off of bridges.  Remember that it's Mars gravity so damage it greatly reduceds from Earth-normal gravity.Did I mention that there's a lot of driving?  Well there is.  If you're not on a mission, just use the world map to locate missions or high-value enemy targets.  If morale is high enough, you usually get some help; however, the help is just about useless since they rarely kill the ECs.  The best approach is -- strangely enough -- to take on large groups of ECs with your sledge hammer.As always, ammo conservation is key.  My approach is to waste a few ECs and resupply from their drops.  Once you run out of explosives, it's time to head to a safe house or locker to resupply.  Otherwise, you're just in a constant fire-fight and you're not collecting scrap.Once you have enough scrap dollars, you can increase the number of explosives you can carry and plant and buy better weapons.The controls are similar to COD but there are no grenades.  Instead, R2 is a clunky weapon select that's kind-of slow because you have to hold R2 and the make a weapon selection.  Unlike COD, running out of ammo doesn't automatically cycle up the next weapon -- bummer.  Speaking of weapons, there's a whole bunch of weapons that are totally useless and a complete waste of money.  I settled in on a Nano Rifle, a Rocket Laucher and the Rail Driver (which is a drop and my Personal favorite) plus my sledge hammer.  The Rail Driver is dropped by the white ECs and has a thermal imaging scope that can see and shoot through walls.  Towards the end of the game there's a Thermobaric Rifle that shoots something like a small atomic bomb.  There's two problems: first, if you shoot something close, you kill yourself; and, secondly it's introduced so late in the game you don't really get to use it.I completed the game in about 24 hours.  The final mission was really fun.  You start out in a modified tank and they throw everything they have at you.  I mean it's like hundreds of LAVs, Tanks, foot moguls, trucks and more.  There's no way to survive in the tank so I just got out and ran the whole way.  Imagine running through a group of 50 soldiers 4 tanks and 10 LAVs and not taking much, if any, damage.  I enjoyed this the most.The graphics are very good and there's no shortage of terrain or missions.  For the most part it's an open-world game.  My only minor complaint is that you see distant objects rendering themselves during play.  The amount of destruction you can cause is nothing short of amazing.  All things considered, I like this game and will spend many hours playing it.Once you complete the game, it resets and the difficulty level increases significantly.  I recommend that you create a few saved games immediately before and after you complete the game so you can come back and play with all the missions unlocked.  This games must have taken forever to write.  It's worth every penny. (And I think most PS3 games stink -- especially anything from Ubisoft or Unreal.)Online play is pretty good but not great.  First of all you have to find a game which isn't that easy since there are minimum number of player requirements.  They did manage to incorporate some of the wrecking theme into some of the games -- which is good.  I'm not sure how the leveling-up works and if it has any effect on your character other than the sledge hammer you can hold.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2009"}

Plugged it in started downloading my online games, froze up around 90% on Trials HD. I proceeded to hit all the buttons on the controller(which had a lose piece of something making noise on the inside of it), went up hit the button to shut it down, nothing, so i unplugged it back in. Felt the system it was blazing(note:i have a totally open entertainment system with my HD TV, PS3, etc. not a thing closed in. Upon plugging the system back in the power pack was also extremely hot, then guess what? You guessed it, red light came on, and no power no nothing for the whole system. I'v seen some things about the system having the red light when you power up the system but it wouldnt even beep to turn on, NOTHING!. I work on computers for a living and am stunned that something straight out of the box could fry so quickly. My thought is that the brick itself isn't running enough power, or the +/- going  through the system power supply is blowing out, for what reason? I have no clue. The only other thing i know is with all the new system ventilation your more likely to get extreme Static Discharge on your unit, so definitely do not set it on any kind of plush carpet or touch it if you feel a slight bit of static shock on anything around it.  Thats really the only thing i can think of at the moment that could be the issue, i don't bother with tech support i just took it back and they gave me a full refund. They said usually they don't but they were actually expecting problems, so they are making exceptions. Good thing i didnt trade my Elite, i've had 0 problems with it from day one. Love xbox but i guess there are still touchy issues, which is expected with a new system. Also have a PS3 0 problems, so i think its just luck of the draw here. All the computer issues i see with dust, cat hair, ever pure dirt clocking up ventilation, power supplies, fans etc. it seems electronics just aren't made like they use to be. 35 year old man here, so no kids i'm not your fan boy dork, or some TROLL teen as the kids say. Whatever that means. So just be careful with this one.UPDATE:I'd like to add that,  If your old enough to remember, nintendos(original) and ataris, they took so much beating and lasted forever. Also stereos, even older computers took a LOT more abuse and lasted a long long time as well. Technology is becoming a very advanced process, much different from the old days, more power, more speed, and a more vast array of visuals are just stunning the world now, so it stands to reason the new stuff has trouble. Also your packing the power of a large desktop computer into a small compact unit, so yes there will be heat, and other issues as well with so much in something so small. Just like laptops will never beat a desktop for gaming, same reason, size, and they have the same issues. So hopefully it will get rectified, as i said love Xbox, just got a lemon.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2010"}

Wii, like all the previous releases in theSuper Mario Bros.franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiis held sideways, allowing for easy, classic inputs using the D-pad to direct playable characters, the 1 button to jump and 2 button to spit out projectiles like snowballs and fireballs. In addition, players can access powerups with their choice of either the push of a button, or by shaking the Wii remote, again demonstrating the perfect merging of classic gameplay and modern game design which isNew Super Mario Bros.

Players can pick each other up to save them from danger or toss them into it.Supports 2-4 players in multiplayer mode.Mario, Luigi and two Toads are all playable characters, while many others from the Mushroom Kingdom make appearances throughout the game. Players can even ride different Yoshi characters and use their tongues to swallow enemies &ndash; or their fellow players.In some areas, players use the motion abilities of the Wii Remote controller. The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"Amazon Deity","summary":"Can't get enough Mario in our home.","reviewText":"We Love it, love it, love it.  The gangs is all back - Mario, Luigi, Princess, Yoshi and Toad.  I originally had the DS version of this game and was hooked on it till I finally completed the game.  Now I am able to play it on the Wii on my 56 inch HDTV and have up to 3 more players play along with me as a team.  Our family spends hours and hours playing and laughing, arguing, joking around, complaining and just having the time of our lives.New Super Mario Brosis a great family game.Nintendo has done it again.  I can remember the original Nintendo game system that came out and finding all out the little secrets to get tons of lives and tricks to beat the game.  Things have surely evolved since then.  Now I have a hard time finding all the large gold coins on each level.  Compared to the DS version, this version has new features such as propeller and penguin Mario to help you in times of need.  Those times come in more often than not.One handy dandy move that comes in real handy is that we always have one player convert into a bubble.  This way if we are in danger of ending the game that person can save the day.  This probably does not make sense to someone who has never played the game, but if you have more than one player you are able to press a button on the Wii remote and your character will go into a floating bubble. Everyone else can keep playing until someone touches them and it pops and you are back in the action. Players are also able to be added in and dropped after each level played, no need to restart the game.A must have for any Mario Bros. enthusiast.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2009"}

In desperation, the Soviets created a time-travel device that they've used to assassinate Albert Einstein before he is able to develop the weapon technology the Allies later use to defeat the Soviets. Upon returning, they notice a new world, and there is a world war taking place between three groups for control of the world.Play As Three Different Factions for Varied game playIn Red Alert 3, you have the choice to play as the Allies, the Soviets, or the Empire of the Rising Sun. Each faction has its own story-line and distinct units with advantages and disadvantages that you have to master in order to win. The new faction to the series is the Empire of the Rising Sun, derived from Imperial Japan, with an all-new cast of units and characters.The three factions have many differences, exemplified by their wildly different types of units. The Soviets, for example, have armored attack bears, Allies have the Dolphin ship which can high jump and use a sonic attack, and the Empire of the Rising Sun features such quirky units as a giant transforming mecha and ninjas. As they've done with the series, EA injects humor into the game when possible, keeping a smile on your face as you wage war.Fight on Land, in the Air, and on SeaRed Alert 3 has land units, air units, and naval units, all integral parts of the game. Unlike most strategy games that don't bother with naval warfare, Red Alert 3 makes controlling the seas an essential part of the game. Controlling resources in the seas and mounting attacks from all directions are strategies that must be employed to achieve victory.Cooperative Mode Lets You Team Up with Your FriendsRed Alert 3 has a fully co-operative campaign mode where you and a friend can play together to achieve victory. This means that you have to develop a strategy together, as well as execute it in synch in order to win. If your friends aren't online, you can also choose one of several AI commanders as your teammate.Play Against Your Friends in MultiplayerWith the different units and play mechanics of each faction, you and your friends will have a great time playing against each other, perfecting different strategies to best suit the units you have and the maps you play on. And thanks to the balanced game play, no one will have an unfair advantage.For previous fans of Command and Conquer, Red Alert 3 will provide the same light-hearted game play, but with more units, more strategies, and more fun.

Like Warcraft 3, Starcraft, or Age of the Empires.Single Player Campaign--------------------------------------------There are 3 different campaigns one for each of the different factions: Soviets, Allies, and The Rising Sun (Japanese).There are 9 missions per campaign, which is a total of 27. You have a co-commander for most of these missions and the resources you gather will be divided evenly between you and your computer AI co-commander.Skirmish (Against Computers)--------------------------------------------There are 3 factions, Allies, Soviets, and Rising Sun. Each computer AI faction has 3 commanders, each with their own style/strategy.Changes from Red Alert 1 & Red Alert 2:--------------------------------------------- No more ore fields, now they are setup as mines (like Warcraft 3). One collector per mine will suffice.- Can attack everything, not just units but buildings too without clicking on them (set your units to aggressive stance or use the hotkey Alt+A)- Most/all units have alternate attacks and special abilities- Detailed statistics are kept for your profile, so every time your play in offline in Skirmish or Online, those stats will be kept.- Improved AI, when playing in Skirmish (against computers), they are more of a challenge- When playing in Skirmish (with allied computers) you can give them command orders- Each faction has 3 commanders with their own distinct tactics and strategy. They also talk smack at the beginning and end of the match where your minimap turns into a video transmission from the enemy commander- Engineer rushing is less effective, since it now takes time for the engineer to take control of a building.- Added special faction abilities. For instance, you can do a airplane sweep and reveal part of the map or freeze enemy units/buildings depending on what you upgrade. These are setup in tiers, and will be available to upgrade when enough time has passed. Each ability has a cooldown time.- Building multiple Barracks/Buildings won't speed up building times, but rather you can build additional units from those buildings- Minimap is not completely black, but rather the map is shown but with fog of war (again, similar to Warcraft 3). Also, you don't need a radar station (or Airfield etc.) to see the minimap, it is on automatically.Technical Issues:--------------------------------------------The shadows are pixelated. Not a big deal, but good to know that it's not a computer problem.Online activation with 5 Authorizations. If you used all 5 of your authorizations, you can deauthorize one of them and will be able to play it on another computer. In the options menu under the settings tab in the game, there is a big button that says \"Deauthorize\". You won't have to download a special revoke tool.No disc is required to be in the drive to play this game.Other Notes:--------------------------------------------I played with the latest or near latest patches.Bottom-line:--------------------------------------------Red Alert 3 does what Red Alert 2 did to the original Red Alert. Better graphics, better gameplay, and just better overall.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2009"}

Between the board game and minigames, there's something for everyone!The basic premise on this one is that you're on a cruise ship. This of course is a great family fun idea in itself :) You get to play board games to unlock minigames, and then you can replay those minigames as much as you wish. There's a lot of incentive to keep replaying - you get points to win in-game prizes, soundtracks, and much more.If you've never tried the Mario Party series before, think of it as an animated board game. You \"roll dice\" and hop along the path, aiming for whatever your current objective is. Along the way you trigger special events and minigames. All of your favorite characters are involved - Mario, Peach, Luigi and more. I'd really like to see more female characters, as I get a little tired of Peach.With Version 7, you get a free microphone included in the game. This lets you have fun games involving voice. We didn't have any problem with the game understanding us; it was much better than other mic-enabled games we'd tried. You can play with up to 8 people at a time, but I appreciated that the 1 and 2 player games were great, since it's rare that I have 7 people in the house that all want to play this.There's a good selection of mini-game options. Some are memory testers, some are key-tapping challenges and some are random luck, to help out not-so-skilled players. With the handicap settings, even youngsters (or oldsters) can play along with the more experienced gamers.Each of the Mario Party games has its own environment, game set and therefore fans. If you like this series, I really recommend renting all of them, to see which specifically appeal to you and your gaming style. It's not that 8 is necessarily better than 7 - they are all like perhaps the Nancy Drew book series, where they are the same theme and different people have different favorites.This one, for example, would be PERFECT for homes with several kids (or kids with several friends).Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2006"}

In it, you play a survivor of a plane crash who also happens to find by some strange stroke of luck an underground city called Rapture lying deep down the Atlantic Ocean. The first minutes of the game are just simply amazing and frightening as you try to make sense of what is going on. One of the most frightening moment is when you enter and encounter face to face the founder of the city as he talks to you for the first time. Personally this was one of the many goosebumps I got. But the most frightening is in the surgery room when you find some tonic, you look behind you and then...From the start, the atmosphere immerses you into the game, from the creepy fifties' music to the spooky and morbid lighting around this strange ghost town and the very impressive voice acting to the animation of the character's which are excellent. Loved the powers that you get during the game, especially the telekinesis and the one with the bees. Though you never are to sure of what your character really looks like, if you are very careful, just before you get to meet Andrew Ryan, the founder of Rapture, you get to see photos of you and also learn a shocking revelation.Happy to see that the public responded well to this game, which was not the case for certain masterpieces like Beyond Good and Evil which got great reviews, but not enough attention from the public for it was released between prince of Persia, The sands of Time and another Tom Clancy's game whose name I forget.

I really enjoyed the first few hours of the game, but the story is very enigmatic. Being put in this \"animus\" which transports you back in time, or something? I never understood this. Not able to finish the game would prevent me from truly understanding the plot. I left the first town for Damascus which was amazing and looked very historically accurate. Here I went around the city attempting to save citizens, most of the time dying or having to run away. Another thing that was kind of fun was climbing up to the tops of the eagle perches. This apparently updates your map of the city. There are missions to do within each city as this assassin, such as interrogation, pickpocket and a boss fight. After finishing things off in Damascus, I went to Jerusalem.This is where things went sour. Jerusalem looked pretty much like Damascus. Ok. Then I found I was doing the exact same things I did in Damascus. I tried saving citizens, did some pick pocketing, then fought the boss and failed miserably. The story and missions were nearly identical to what I did in Damascus. However, once I fought the boss I became enraged. I was expected to fight seven guys or chase the boss. I decided to run, because I kept getting killed. I had a hell of a time trying to change from fighting to running. Then once I chased down the boss, he ran into a group of guards, so I was fighting four or five guys again. I was demolished. I decided to quit before losing my sanity.Ultimately, this is only my opinion and I am by no means a professional reviewer. Many people really liked this game. I didn't. Many of the reviews by websites were incredibly bloated. One website even gave it a perfect score. This game is far from perfect. I believe that there has been such a shortage of quality games in the past year that even decent games seem better in comparisonThings I loved about the game-The graphics are brilliant. Light and reflections are very accurate. The colors are not washed out or too cartoonish. Cities have amazing detail with true dimension given to shutter, wood and other pieces sticking out from the sides of houses. Clothes have wrinkles and even shadows are cast on other parts of the body. It is very next-gen looking. This is the crowning achievement of the game which is both good and bad.-Animation is very natural and life-like, especially the walking and climbing actions-If you need help, there is always a tutorial to let you know what buttons need to be pressed for what you are currently doing.-There is a real deviation from the norm with this game. Instead of a FPS or sports game, this game take a story from where few if any games have tread before; the time of the crusades and the location of the Middle East. If I were to pick a game that was somewhat similar, I could only think of the Metal Gear franchise. You have the ability to hide instead of risking open conflict. There are also two modes of action: action mode and blending mode. In blending mode you can appear to be in prayer and just push people gently to get through a crowd. In action mode, you can tackle people or attack obviously.What I liked about the game-The sandboxish feel to the game is a welcome change from the endless stream of FPS games.-Being able to climb up almost anything adds another dimension to the game-The action or blend modes are very helpful when you don't feel like dying.Things I disliked about the game-The game can get very repetitive. From what I played through, I did the same thing in Damascus as I did in Jerusalem. This seems to be the rule instead of the exception with the new games-less unique content more work put into the graphical and presentation aspect.-Interaction between sword and person look cartoonish. In other words, the sword looks like it is cutting through paper instead of flesh.-Side quests seem to be thrown in, to add playable content, such as finding the little flags for each city.Things I absolutely detested-There are no subtitles. I have no idea what the people are saying sometimes and more importantly I didn't see the words to have recollection of what I am supposed to do. I just followed the blinking icon on the map.-Going along with the subtitle problem, I don't know what is going on in the story and frankly I didn't care. None of it seemed to tie together.-There is no way to skip the dialogue. Come on. This needs no explanation. I can't even believe they thought gamers would want this.-It is extremely easy to get caught doing nothing wrong. What I mean is that if you are sprinting or even riding your horse fast, guards will chase after you just based on the fact you are suspicious. I can understand this, but it should have been a more intelligent system.-Being able to change between fight and flight mode is very difficult. You could be surrounded by 8-10 enemies and instead of blasting through them to get away he gets stabbed. I find myself constantly running because I couldn't take on more than a few guys at a time without getting killed.-To me the game really seemed like a more advanced version of Prince of Persia with a sci-fi twist. If you get right down to it, the game is incredibly simple while at the same time very frustrating.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2007"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Gears of War comes to the PC","reviewText":"Arguably the best game to hit the XBox 360 yet, Epic Games' Gears of War comes to the PC with a more than solid translation from console to PC.  If you've played the game before on the 360, you'll feel pretty much right at home here with what the PC edition of Gears of War has to offer, as it boasts the same gorgeous graphics, brutal gameplay, and addictive multiplayer that helped make the game such a hit in the first place.  For newcomers to Gears of War, you'll get to see what all the fuss is about for the most part, although there are a few flaws to be found.  Most notably is the fact that there are a few glitches and bugs to be discovered as you progress throughout the game, but they don't detract from the overall experience of the game.  The difficulty curve could have been tweaked a bit as well, but as far as flaws go, they end there.  Gears of War supports the keyboard and mouse as well as the XBox 360 gamepad, but either way, the control remains tight.  There are some new additions, including added mission chapters and maps, and while they aren't anything spectacular, they're still worth playing through.  As mentioned before, the game is a sight to behold, even more so now on the PC, but beware that there are some pretty steep system requirements to witness Gears of War in all it's visually brilliant glory.  That aside, if you have the hardware and have never before experienced Gears of War, you should definitely give it a try now that it's on the PC, and see for yourself what all the fuss was about when the game was first unleashed last year.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2007"}

McKinney","summary":"Looks great but controls ruin the game","reviewText":"This game has great graphics and is one of the better looking games I've seen on the 3DS. Unfortunately, the control setup ruins the experience. Being left handed, I had to switch the control scheme so that I control the main character's movement with the buttons on the right. This is a counter-intuitive setup. I find myself many times trying to shoot by pressing one of these buttons rather than the shoulder button. It's more difficult using the buttons rather than the joystick for directional movement.  And if that doesn't present enough of a challenge, you then have to aim using the stylus. It all becomes something of a chore. I really don't have a desire to play this game again, so I'll be trading it soon. For left handers, I'd recommend staying away from this game. For right-handers, perhaps it will be a different experience. But aiming with the stylus and moving the main character with the joystick is akin to patting your head and rubbing your stomach at the same time. When the acton heats up, it's become frustrating.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2012"}

I also own a PS2, however for some strange reason, they just don't seem as fun on it. Anyway, back to the review. Clone Wars is an extraordinary fighter flight sim game. Along with some on foot battles and absolutely amazing flight fighting, this particular game completely blows my mind, with it's amazing graphics, it's perfection on controls and lack of any lag whatsoever, this game is by far my favorite game in the series. I also own Rogue Leader and still love that game, but so far Clone Wars just simply delivers about an ounce more overall fun in gameplay that Rogue Leader was lacking, and believe me, Rogue Leader dosn't lack a whole lot. I highly recommend Clone Wars to anyone who is a fan of the Star Wars games. For those of you who have been sceptical to try out the Star Wars series games, I think that this is the one to buy. It, like the other games also has a number of different diffaculty levels for those who are a little shy to try the Jedi and harder difaculty settings, but it is quite simply one of the funnest flight shooter games that I have ever played. Along with a wide variety of vehicles to use in gameplay, (including a walking vehicle which is very cool), this game is just totally fun. I guess I'm babbling so I wil quit now, however buy the game, it's sooo worth it. Trust me, hours of fun!!! I mean my girlfriend even likes it!!!

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists. The only hope of the colonists seems to be a vault discovered in the side of a mountainside, rumored to contain alien technology and secrets about Pandora. Will this discovery be the colonist's salvation or their end? Discover their fate inBorderlands.GameplayAs in a traditional RPG,Borderlandsis built around the continual leveling of characters as they delve into quests. These quests include both story-driven adventures and side quests that offer players rewards such as items exclusive to quest completion and/or forward movement of the story.

Since the days of Contra on the NES, I've always enjoyed cooperative style games much more than player vs. player, and Borderlands provides a singular co-op experience.Borderlands itself is a quest-based first person shooter with light, accessible RPG elements woven in.  There isn't a whole lot of focus on story here...this game is about shooting everything you see and collecting loot.  As you get further in the game, your character can level up in a wide variety of areas that are unique to that character type, as well as level up certain special abilities.  For people who aren't into or haven't experienced RPGs, the leveling system in Borderlands is extremely easy to use and well implemented.  Borderlands has a ton of cool weapons to use, and a huge part of the fun was learning enemy types and locations, and choosing which item from your arsenal you will use to mow that particular enemy down.  Weapons and other items you no longer need or use can be sold back at shops for cash to buy new upgrades, items, or best of all, better guns!  Borderlands' controls are customizable and responsive.  I particularly liked how the characters jumped.  It felt meaty and old school, like in the platformers of yesteryear.  From a stylistic perspective, Borderlands shines.  The sound effects are top notch, the voice acting very good (the dialogue is hilarious at times) and it has some of the best music I've heard in a game this gen.  The standout to me was the art design.  The game has an absolutely incredible look that is unlike anything else out there.  I can't describe the look of the game in words, but there are plenty of gameplay videos out there that can show you.  It was stunning to look at...a true triumph of art design by the developers.Lastly, and most importantly, is the co-op element.  The designers have stated that this game was designed to be played with 2 or more people.  The game supports 2 player local co-op via split screen, and 2-4 player co-op online.  Playing with another person makes the game MUCH better.  In fact, I don't think I would be able to recommend this game as highly to someone who was planning on playing it single player.  Especially when you have different character types playing together, its so much fun to plan your assaults in a fashion that caters to each character's strengths.  When I played, I was an infantry type solder, where my friend was a sniper, which worked out beautifully.  It was very satisfying to clear the area of enemies, and go down and collect all that hard-earned loot.  I imagine that playing with 3 or 4 people online would just be insanely fun.  I'm planning on getting all the DLC for this game and going that route next.To me, Borderlands just has a few weaknesses.  The story is there, but it's very minor and plot development is practically non-existent.  The ending of the game was somewhat anti-climactic and slightly disappointing.  And most of all, the single player route just isn't that enjoyable once you've experienced co-op with others.  I played several missions by myself and the game just was not as fun as it was with other people.  If I had started the game single player and played the entire game that way, my opinion may have ended up different.In the end, if you're looking for an absorbing, addictive and extremely fun game to play with your friends, whether they happen to be sitting next to you or somewhere in cyberspace, I can't imagine there being anything better than Borderlands.  This game kept my buddy and I completely entertained and absorbed for over 40 hours, and we were sad when it was over.  I'm looking forward to exploring the DLC for this game, and am keeping my fingers crossed for a sequel!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2010"}

If I was to buy only two of the games in the Resident Evil-series, I would choose this, along with the remake of the first RE from 2002. Things that separate this from the previous Resident Evil-games:*No fixed camera angles (\"The camera\" follows you wherever you go)*More \"realistic\" enemies (At least some of them. The \"standard\" enemies you fight in this game feels more like inbred and brainwashed humans than zombies. It actually feels a bit like playing \"Deliverance - The Game\". But every now and then there is also a cave-troll (or worse) to deal with)*Ability to buy and sell items and weapon-upgrades from a mysterious vendor (you can sell jewelry collected throughout the game and use the money to buy weapons and other cool stuff:-))Resident Evil 5 is also made with this \"recipe\" and is also a great game that I highly recommend, but it's not as spectacular and epic as RE4. Besides, I think that a misty spanish village (RE4) is a better place for true horror than Africa (RE5). Incredible atmosphere. You'll never get tired of playing this. This game is so five stars.*****Don't pay too much attention to people giving the PC version badder reviews than the Gamecube version.

In fact, the world map (a staple in previous Fantasies) is completely absent, replaced by, well, a line. Nonetheless, the game is excellent, once again buoying my faith in video games.The mini-games and side quests (and there are many) are quite enjoyable, but are really only feasible during a second playing of the game (you'll want to know how the story finishes, I presume). Also, for once, the bosses are difficult, requiring a good bit of strategy (but DON'T buy the guide; I'm sure it spoils everything), and the random enemies are no piece of cake, either.Finally, money for once has a use!All in all, a fine gaming experience...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2002"}

If I know EA though, their going too 9-10 make dlc's of different characters of different races instead. So more money out the pocket for us, which is why I hate EA, and sooner or later Bioware too. PLZ! STOP MILKING US with mediocre DLC's! The combat is still the same as Origins, but there no auto attack for console users, and they have unfortunately took out the execution finishers, which was in DA:O, which sucks, but it isn't a game breaker.Overall I enjoy the game. You can transfer your DA:O data over, which rewards you with some items and special character appearances. Now the main reason why this game didn't get a close to a perfect score from me, even I love it, is because of the ending. The ending is what kills the game.

So glad I did.As I bashed my way through Covenants forces on the Pillar Of Autumn I remembered just how frickin' great Halo Combat Evolved was. Thank you 343 for giving this kid flashbacks of great times.  The developers did a great job re-creating all ten levels in new Xbox 360 graphics. For those who speculate the graphics are lack-lackluster go ahead and flip the settings to classic mode...good, now disable them. Ah, now you see just how great 343 did. This is fantastic for gamers who do not want to play old Xbox games, now you will only have to play Halo 2, but want to play through the Halo series start to finish.I was severely disappointed there was no Halo:CE multiplayer re-created. Just some maps you can access in Reach.  That sucks. I recommend just renting this game because you can only play the campaign, and most people can burn through that in just days.  Still there is great fun and memories to be had.Personally, the adding of the terminals was great. I loved finding the terminals and looking at the extra content. The terminal on \"Keyes\" was so revealing and kinda freaky, but a plus never the less.The way 343 handled Halo: CEA is promising for the newest Halo trilogy.

No special weapons, no sniper guns, a silenced pistol you never need, and several machine-gun style weapons that are all the same.  The enemies are the same guy over and over again, with little variation.  Maybe a \"boss\" guy once in a while who's tougher to kill. The graphics are pitiful, and so many times you're trying to pick guys off from far away and could really, really use a sniper rifle instead of yet another SMG.  No health or special items to pickup - just magic orbs that refill a special action option that you never use.  The levels look very much alike, and it's really a chore to just get through the game.  I'm utterly surprised by all the great reviews here.  At least I got this really cheap, used.  That's the best thing about the game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2013"}
