One thing I did find more in depth, however, was the story. This again, seemed to make the game worse. It made the prince, the story...everything seem dark. The game wasn't suttle about this either. It was like a totally new experience. One thing that seemed like a huge change from Sands of Time, in my opinion, was the very open feel of this game. In Sands of Time, you seemed to go from point A to point B with a clear path in between. This game, however, was very open-ended and I seemed to have to back track quite a bit. One good thing that comes from the open-ended approach was the length of the game; it was fairly long for an adventure game and seemed to start and end at exactly the right time. The thing I find most appealing about Warrior Within is the combat system. Although it is much the same as before, it is at the same time somewhat different. In this game, you can dual wield two weapons which is very fun. The combat system is much more free than before too which allows you to create your own combos and fighting techniques. Although the story and main character are much darker than before, the gameplay was still Prince of Persia in style. So, overall, the game was still much enjoyable.PresentationLike I said before, the story is much darker than Sands of Time and while this isn't entirely bad, it seems like a bit much.GraphicsThe graphics are very nice in this game. The environments are very open ended and look pretty realistic.SoundThe voice acting in the game is on spot. Well done. The music, however, was really loud and kind of obnoxious.GameplayAgain, the gameplay didn't change too much, so it is very much still typical Prince of Persia platform/combat style.Lasting AppealMuch longer than the first and there are unlockables and 2 bonus modes to play.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2006"}

All seem to be hailing this game as one of the must-have RPGs for the DS. You'd think it was the best thing since Final Fantasy VII.  I must admit, it's nice to see something refreshingly new amid the sea of ports, remakes and sequels.  But is the fact that this game is one of the few original RPGs available on the DS the only thing that's convincing people that it's truly awesome?  Does \"The World Ends With You\" live up to all the hype?  Well, let's find out!Graphics (score 10/10): One word sums up the graphics, and that's \"stylish\".  Everything is just so sleek and stylish looking.  Whether or not you'll actually like that style is another matter.  If you don't like anime or comic books, then this isn't the game for you.  The graphics are very anime-ish, and the cutscenes look like they were pulled right out of a comic book.  I happen to love the bold direction the game developers took when deciding what the game would look like.  They could've used generic RPG settings and character styles, but they chose to go a different route, and I respect that.Music (score 8/10):  Now, the music, like the graphics, are either love or hate.  I like the fact that they once again chose heavily stylized music in favor of generic RPG tunes.  The soundtrack mostly consists of J-pop and Rap-type music, which I feel fits the game pretty well.  My only issue is that some of the tracks seem to loop every 30 seconds, which grates on the nerves when it involves a song with vocals.  Just imagine listening to the same stanza of a song over and over again.  Thankfully, most of the songs are tolerable.  Now, let's discuss the voice acting and dialogue.  The voice acting is limited, but decent.  I just don't like the way they implemented it.  Most of the text is silent, except occasionally things like a grunt or scream will be voiced.  That's just awkward sounding.  They really should've left it all silent or all voiced.  The other voice acting you'll hear is in shops, where the store owner will say something like \"Thanks for dropping by\".  These sound decent, but are pretty unnecessary.  As for the dialogue, well, I just assume that the game takes place in an alternate reality where people talk the way the characters do in the game.  Seriously, I don't know where the writers came up with this stuff.  With phrases like \"You're zetta slow!\", who knows?!  If you treat it like I do, and just assume that's normal for the game world instead of comparing it to reality, then the game is fairly enjoyable.Characters (score 8/10): Many people have said that they hate the main character, Neku.  I can understand why.  He's a bit like Squall (from FFVIII), except to the tenth degree.  In other words, he's anti-social, unlikeable, and has serious trust issues.  Thankfully, I have special love in my heart for such character types.  Plus, it's refreshing to have a main character that doesn't have the stereotypical \"hero\" personality.  You know, the characters that just rescue people for the sake of rescuing people and being heroic.  Anyway, I could see how some people wouldn't be able to stand Neku.  Now, as for the other characters, they are all well developed.  Even Neku exhibits excellent character growth over time (so he does have a change of heart).  Overall, everyone has well fleshed-out personalities.  The villains, on the other hand, don't seem to have much personality at all.  Plus, we really don't learn much about their motivations on a personal level.  Oh well, this section gets a score of 8/10 just for the excellent characterization of the main characters.Story (score 8/10): The story starts out with Neku being attacked by something that looks a bit like a half-animal, half-tattoo monster in Shibuya, Japan.  He later teams up with a girl named Shiki, who teaches him how to fight the monsters.  He learns from her that he is trapped in some kind of weird game, and that in order to survive, he must continue to work with her as his partner.  I won't spoil the rest of the story, but rest assured, it is good.  You won't really understand it until you replay the new game+ and get the good ending.  Even then, you may not really understand it, but it's still pretty good.Battle System (score 7/10): Oh boy.  Well, I guess I had to talk about it eventually.  Let's see, the battle system is a bit complicated, and yet, not, if that makes any sense.  You'll basically be fighting on two screens; the top screen controls your in-game partner character, with Neku controlled on the bottom screen.  Enemies seem to move between the two screens and also to exist simultaneously on both screens (don't ask).  I'll be honest here, I have no idea how to use the top screen outside of simple attacking and dodging/blocking.  I got through the game just fine anyway, though, so it's not too tough.  Also, it's hard to fight on two screens simultaneously.  Thankfully, the game has an auto-play feature since Squeenix realized most people wouldn't be able to fight simultaneously on two screens.  So, I just use the auto-play on the top screen most of the time and focus my attention on the bottom screen.  The only time you'll really need to use the top screen is during boss fights (especially during a boss in the middle of the game, which seems to be the hardest boss of the game; go figure).  The bottom screen involves fighting with pins, which you equip on Neku.  These give you different abilities in battle.  For example, one pin has a lightning ability; you just tap an enemy and it electrocutes it.  So, that's pretty simple.  However, movement of Neku is controlled by the stylus, the same thing that controls the attacks.  This is bad because the game often does an attack when I want to move Neku, or moves Neku when I want to attack.  This is frustrating.  Instead of having the stupid top screen battle, they should just have used the d-pad for Neku's movement, and the stylus for his attacks.  They could have your second character be A.I. controlled and fight on the bottom screen with Neku.  The top screen could've been reserved for character stats or something.  In the end, my main problem with the battle system is that it just becomes tedious tapping and raking the stylus across the screen constantly.  And trust me, you'll be doing it a lot.  I hear this game compared to Kingdom Hearts a lot, but unfortunately, I find that Kingdom Hearts is a lot more fun to play than this game.  I can't really put my finger on why, it just is.Gameplay (score 7/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Well, there are several things to discuss here.  Firstly, you can move through the game with the d-pad (thank goodness!).  The menu controls are handled with the stylus and work pretty well.  In general, the out-of-battle controls are pretty good.  Unfortunately, the game is somewhat repetitive in its gameplay.  You start off a day (the story's split into days) with a mission, usually involving fighting monsters, then you start a new day and do it again.  And, you'll be doing this in the same areas over and over again.  Still, it's not so bad, as the story manages to keep things interesting from day to day.  My big complaint is that there seems to be a lot of tacked on crap that seems unnecessary to me.  For example, the brand system is pointless.  So is the shop system whereby you must get popular with the clerks for them to reveal the abilities in the items.  Why not just have a regular shop system where you just buy accessories and then equip them.  Even Tin Pin Slammer, the one minigame available, isn't very fun and is also pointless.  The one thing I did enjoy was the food system.  You can eat food that gives you stat upgrades.  That's pretty awesome.  The other things, though, seem to be tacked on in order to try to lengthen the game.  I guess a completionist may enjoy all that the game has to offer, but I felt it was unnecessary and bogged down the gameplay.  Sometimes, less is more.  As a whole, the gameplay works, and if you want to utilize all that extra stuff, you can, but if you want to ignore it, you can do that too.Overall (score 8/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  Well, \"The World Ends With You\" gets a respectable score of 8/10 overall.  This game is far from perfect like so many make it out to be, but it is a pretty good game nonetheless.  Even though I wouldn't say it was the greatest RPG of all time for the DS (that game is yet to be made, I think), it is definitely worth getting, especially at it's current reasonable price ($20).  If you're an RPG fan, you should add \"The World Ends With You\" to your collection.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2009"}

Fortunately for us, Battlefield 4 came out first as being one of my personal favorite shooting franchises, I'm happy to have that first.  I got mine on the 360 while I patiently wait a few weeks for Playstation 4 to release.  Until then, I'm left with simply a taste of what to expect from next generation.Dice and EA do a great partnership with these games to make them as realistic and fun as possible.  COD games typically have more cartoonish graphics and a video game feel to the weapons and equipment.  Battlefield games tend to have more basis in reality with both the look of weapons and the sounds of them.  In BF4, we're faced with some crazy weather, exploding buildings and gun battles that will make you think you're getting shot at in real life.First off, the campaign.  Most shooter games are not known for their campaign.  In fact, you could probably count on your hand the number of people who buy these games just for the campaign.  However, EA realized that for that handful of people, they'll make them happy.  This campaign plays out like a big budget Hollywood war movie.  It has better graphics than the online and more equipment and vehicles to use.  My one friend hated the online so I had him play campaign and now he's a BF fan!The online's first impression to me, and current impression, isn't the best.  The gameplay itself is loads of fun and I can't Bf4 1wait to get it on PS4 and play it for more time than I'll admit to.  However, there are little problems that they're yet to fix.  First off, when you level up online say from level 4 to 5...the next match you'll still be a level 4.  It's annoying as hell to have that progress erased in the 20 seconds between matches.  Next up, the game freezes a lot.  I can count on at least once a day my entire console locking requiring reboot because of this error.  Thirdly, the graphics suck.  The water in the 360 game looks like you're swimming through mercury.  The textures take 23 seconds (yes I timed it) to properly load.  Before that, your stairs are just ramps, everything is just mudded colors and your sights on your gun are not punched out yet.  It's very sad to see such a great game look so bad.  However, that's because this game shouldn't be on seventh generation.  Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 are not powerful enough to hold such a game.  Seeing footage for it on Xbox One and PS4 make me not only very optimistic about the game, but I've already committed to getting Battlefield Premium for my copy on next gen.Seventh generation hiccups aside, this is by far the best shooter on the marketplace and will take a miracle by COD to be better","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2013"}

Original, fast-paced, action packed and FUN!!! I'm not going into story details but I will say that it certainly feels like a really solid action movie.I first saw the game when I was hunting for affordable PS3 titles. The cover and pictures looked interesting (I'm into weird puzzle-like games... ala Noby Noby Boy). Upon further researching, this was PERFECT for me! I played the demo and I was hooked. My brother gave it to me as a gift (also including Red Faction: Guerrilla... which F***in' rocks!) and that was the beginning of great hours of gameplay. The graphics look better on the game than the demo, the sounds/music are ambient and feels just right, controls are excellent, as for replay value... this is where I have to explain. This game is definetly not for everyone. There's no shooting (if you choose to... which is the best choice), you have to THINK like a free-runner in order to get from Point A to Point B, and you have to think FAST!There are several reviews stating the game is short. In escence, it is but I've been playing it in intervals of 1 1/2 hours per day, so the game actually feels alot longer. The game feels like Portal... you know you are closer to the end but getting there is so much fun!! I will definetly replay it on Hard difficulty as soon as I finish it. The game also offers Challenge Mode. This is where the game gets really tough but that just adds to what Faith (the main character) can do. Another point are the cutscenes. They look like E-surance commercials... LOL... but cool enough to get you into the story.Oh yes... if you do not have patience, you will end up throwing the game out the window. You have about 30 seconds to think where, how, and when do you have to act in order to not get killed by a barrage of bullets. This makes the game heartpoundingly fast and exhilarating... and don't worry, you get enough checkpoints to not make you repeat everything again.Overall, I TOTALLY recommend this game... especially if you are into puzzles, first person shooters, and action... and for only $20... what are you waiting for?!?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2009"}

When you complete each level, you earn a gold Lego brick and once you collect all of them - you obtain true Jedi status.  You can also unlock characters and games along the way.I love how this game forces my son to think things through as he is presented with different challenges in each chapter.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

The cartridge-based system had not done well on the market and they had been severely overshadowed by the Sony Playstation.  Thankfully, Nintendo has ditched the cartridges and made developing for their system more &quot;programmer-friendly&quot;.  As a result, the Gamecube is a vastly better, thought flawed, system.The good news is if you get this system there will be a number of high-quality titles you can only get on the GameCube.  Metroid Prime, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind-Waker, and Eternal Darkness are just a few examples of the quality, and unprecedented variety, of Nintendo's titles.  There are two drawbacks, however, that will be holding Nintendo back in the current console race.  First, the lack of RPGs.  Most gamers remember the days when you could play the latest Final Fantasy or Dragon Warrior game only on Nintendo.  Sadly, this is no longer the case.  There are, currently, only a handful of RPG titles for the Gamecube.  Second, the lack of a stable online environment for play.  While the GameCube is expandable and can have dial-up and broadband adapters added, it lacks a community to rival XBox Live, which alienates avid sports and action gamers who want to compete online.All in all, if you like the single player experience, the GameCube is the superior choice.  If you are a hardcore RPG gamer or online gamer, you may want to look elsewhere.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2003"}

One-button controls didn't seem like all that great an idea, and I was considering buying F-zero instead. Nevertheless, I am a big fan of Kirby, having played most of his games, even weird spinoffs like Kirby's Dream Course,  (basically Kirby Golf), so I decided on the less traditional game. I was glad I did. Lacking a storyline but not much else, this game leaves F-zero far behind in sheer variety of gameplay. If you get tired of the Normal Race and Time Attack modes, which each feature plenty of unlockables, you can compete in entirely separate top-view racing (I got used to the controls for this pretty quickly, considering). Also available is the vast City Trial, almost a game on its own, in which you race to boost your vehicle's attributes, such as speed, steering, etc., then battle in a random multiplayer contest.

If you have not played 999 to the true end then you better get on that, because this game has drastically less meaning without knowing the first story.To make a long story short, this game has better/more challenging puzzle rooms and some new gameplay elements that make the game itself more interesting than 999.  In regards to the story, 999 is stronger.  The reason for that is 999 develops the characters more and you identify with them better. The outcome of the story is less rewarding in VLR as a result, but not bad by any stretch of the word. There were also way more sci-fi elements which may have caused some feelings of being less grounded.One thing I really liked was the way you need to obtain all the endings before you get the True Ending, because each gives you one necessary clue to proceed down the right path.I recommend this game to anyone who liked the original, but go into the story with an open mind.One last warning:  there is a bug in the 3ds version of the game. fortunately I read about it early in my game and managed to play through the whole thing without having any issues whatsoever. The best advice is to only save during the story segments, not in the puzzle rooms.  You will be A-OK.

{"product_name":"B00005MO5G","description":"Although the game will seem very familiar to Sonic fans,Sonic  Advanceis an entirely new creation that's been built from the ground up.  The gameplay, graphics, and sound borrow from the classic Sonic games on the  Genesis and are successfully translated to the Game Boy Advance. The game's  single-player modes are relatively short 2-D platform rounds--each run takes two  to three hours--but replay value is added through the game's various characters.  Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy each have different abilities that make getting  through the game a unique experience.The real star here is the game's link capabilities. The Chao Garden allows you  to raise your little critters and upload them to the GameCube via thelink cableandSonic Adventure 2:  Battle. Having one cartridge lets up to four GBA players compete in one  minigame. Gamers can play two additional minigames if each player owns a  cartridge. Although the single-player game is quite good, the link options give  the title tremendous value.The only notable problem stems from the series itself: There are still entirely  too many cheap deaths resulting from the title's high-speed gameplay. You'll  find yourself zipping along a level only to be hit by an obstacle you had little  chance of seeing, let alone avoiding. Ultimately, the only way to get past these  hazards is to memorize where they are. This minor flaw doesn't detract from the  game's excellent value, though.Sonic Advanceoffers a very good  single-player game and some of the best link options of any GBA title.--Raymond M.

Only on this one, I can get through the first 8 levels in about 30 minutes with no trouble, while on the Genesis versions i cant get past the fourth level.  If you want a short game that you can beat in a really short amount of time, or giving this to a small child you should try this.

{"product_name":"B0014ULQB2","reviewerName":"A. Nonimowse. \"bomber214\"","summary":"One trick pony, clunky interface, unpolished, falls short","reviewText":"Red Faction: Guerrilla is an open world type third person shooter-sorta.  I hate to do what everyone else does, but:  It's GTA III (not even IV) with much less character, more explosions, and a severe lack of gameplay mechanic polish.  You play Mason, a guy gone rogue due to the oppressive EDF who have a stranglehold on Mars and its people.  You come from a mining background, and so you spend lots of your time with mining related equipment wreaking (very repetitive and lackluster) havoc on, basically, carbon copy enemy installations that are heavily defended, including magical teleporters that allow enemies to spawn anywhere near you, especially right behind you where you were just looking.The spawning engine is uneven and often over-zealous:  You'll wipe out two or three guys within sight, and two seconds later there are five or more on foot, where there were none prior.  No, they didn't drive up and get out -- that happens, as well, on top of the teleporting magical sniper sharpshooter baddies.  Which brings me to another point:  The enemy are very hardy.  Run them over with a big truck full bore?  Unless you hit DEAD on, they get right back up as if nothing happened.  Hit them with a rocket, right in the eye?  Sometimes they just ragdoll away, get up, and charge forth.  The turret gunners are brutal and can draw a bead like it is nobody's business.Now, I'll hear some babble from the peanut gallery:  It's a guerrilla tactic game, sir!  You are supposed to use stealth and hit and run tactics, SIR!  Jesus, don't you know what guerrilla means?!  Yeah, right.  The enemy has eagle eyes, and if you drop one (quietly) and there happens to be one near by, NOT EVEN WITHIN EYESIGHT, suddenly the entire installation is aware.  The game generally devolves into you running away like crazy trying to duck an onslaught of fire.  You'll eventually find a vehicle, if you survive, then you get to flee until the little indicator says GREEN.  GREEN means happy.The driving mechanics.  Ugh.  You hop a little bump in your buggy, and when you land all the glass blows out, you lose speed, and heaven forbid you aren't perfectly straight -- you'll begin to wildly careen.  Since there is a lot of driving to and fro, hither and tither, yonder and near this can be an annoyance.  Many missions require precision driving, especially later on, to beat the idiotic time clock imposed on many missions.  QUICK, STEAL THIS VERY SLOW VEHICLE, AND YOU HAVE INEXPLICABLY TWO MINUTES TO GET BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANET.The mission variety is good, if your definition of variety is:  the same three components arranged differently.  Go to place, get mission.  Drive to another place where you either shoot something, drive something, or blow something up.  Rinse, dry, repeat, repeat.  The main story missions have a slightly deeper level of character, but mostly they are the exact same thing as the side missions, only with a non-generic narrative.  If you are lucky, a cut scene.The weapons/ammo situation is also out of whack with the intended designs of the game.  You need copious amounts of ammo to get anything done -- and yet you carry, in all reality, a very limited supply.  So you have to run to these idiotic magic stockpile boxes -- painted with the symbol of your faction, naturally -- and re-up.  Depending on your popularity with the brainless people of Mars, you get more or less ammo -- but never all that much.  Ultimately, you have to chip away at some goals -- hit, run back to safe house, run back to site, hit, repeat.  You will spend a lot of time driving, which, honestly, is a chore.Overall, the game has its upsides, but they are heavily out-weighed by the clunky interface, poor gameplay polish, and generally silly decisions the developers made.  It is the technical issues that detract heavily from what could be a decent game -- and the icing on the cake is that, for all of its \"innovative destruction capability\" and its interesting setting of Mars, it really is rather bland and uninspiring.A gimmick of collapsing buildings is not enough to float a technically inferior game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2009"}

You can either get an add-on for those old style controllers - or you can get a new, integrated Wii Remote Plus Controller.We have numerous controllers lying around the house. Some are in that initial no-motionplus state. Some have the add-on stuck onto them, which makes them fairly bulky. When one of our old controllers began to fail, I decided to order a new all-in-one controller that had the MotionPlus built into it. I'm very glad I did!The new controller is the same size as the original controller, so they were able to stuff all the extra electronics inside the same smaller unit. This is great for long term gameplay. Your arm doesn't get tired moving the controller around, and it's easier to do fine control with it.The built in gyroscope means you have much better control over your characters and activities compared with the original basic remote. If you're playing a game, you definitely want the Wii to react precisely to what you do! It is quite annoying to die because your controller didn't register the movement you made. I've been very pleased with the responsiveness of this unit.It even comes with charged batteries and a rubber skin. I always have all my Wii controllers skinned - it makes it so much easier to hold onto them during long gameplay sessions. So both were highly appreciated.I do have to say, as an aside, that we use all rechargeable batteries in our controllers so we're not continually throwing batteries into our waste stream. It's better for the environment to recharge existing batteries. So while I appreciate them providing the batters from a consumer support standpoint, long term I do recommend that players use rechargeable batteries to help our environment.So, that being said, I'm very pleased with this purchase. I got this one in black so mine would stand out from the other remotes in the house. My new black remote was promptly claimed by my boyfriend as his own. Hmph. Apparently I'll have to buy yet ANOTHER new controller - this one perhaps in pink - so it actually remains mine.Highly recommended!I purchased this remote with my own money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2012"}

The characters have a attack stance for single enemies and another for multiple enemies that you can switch between by pressing f1.  You also have special attacks that are mapped to the triangle, circle, and square buttons.  I think you have a power attack when you fill up a gauge and press f2 and a special attack, but haven't really figured out or used that yet.  Also when you deplete your mana by using special attacks you regain it by attacking regularly.  Also when you defeat enemies you get life back as well as mana.  There are no health potions but you get a healing ability that will heal you when to press f2 and square.I am having more fun though with this than diablo 3.  The fighting system has more variety, the locations are more varied, and there is much more story.  I thought the story might be boring, but it kind of drives each quest and I find it works fine.Also so far the game has been very smooth even with a lot of enemies and a boss on screen.  So far am happy with a lot of boss fights.  Also pretty good challenge so far.  And so far no broken quests.  Don't have any negatives yet.So if this looks good to you give it a shot.  I resist games I know I would like sometimes because of a few bad reviews.  Usually If I see a game I would like I do and you might too if this type of game appeals to you.Kevin","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2014"}

{"product_name":"B000930DIM","description":"Rule the road by dominating your rivals and laying waste to rush hour traffic.","reviewerName":"EMAN NEP","summary":"PHOTO FINISH","reviewText":"I just about finished Burnout 3:Takedown when--lo and behold!--Burnout:Revenge just so happened to hit the shelves. How convenient!For those of you who--like me--are still coming off of Burnout 3, I'm going to breakdown the major differences in these two games:Perhaps the most welcome addition to BR is that you can actually smash into cars FROM BEHIND without crashing yourself! There is a catch to this, though, head-on traffic, sideway's traffic, and hitting an oversized vehicle from behind will still total your car.On the down side, I think that this feature decreases the challenge aspect by quite a bit. In BO3, if you hit a car, you were done for, so you were either a stellar driver with super-sharp reflexes, or not.Remember how tired you got in BO3 with the Elimator laps--doing FIVE of them consecutively to win the race? BR has improved the Eliminator races by having instead five 30 second periods. Whoever is in last place at the end of these periods is eliminated. Makes the event much quicker and less tedious.Racing events have stayed the same, for the most part, but now there are shortcuts. You can win the race without shortcuts, but you're more likely to win if you use them. Note: Your CPU players ALSO use the shortcuts, so watch out!BO3 had a Face Off event. BR has no Face Off event, but you still win cars like crazy after doing races or outstanding feats.But BO3 had no Traffic Attack Event like BR does. In this event you intentionally run into traffic--preferably traffic that is going the same way as you, unless you like crashing.Burning Laps/Preview Laps are pretty much the same in both games, but of course BR has the shortcuts. I have a small complaint with the Burning Laps in BR: Getting a medal in this even is either too easy or too hard. Example: On one track I boosted 90%--if not 100%--of the whole track--without crashing-- and didn't get a gold medal! You almost HAVE TO use the shortcuts to get gold in these events. BUT, on the opposite hand, if you drive, slow as hell, casually, like I did once (in a Preview Lap), with no intention of winning, I still somehow got a Bronze medal.Ah yes--CRASH MODE. This is where BO3 and BR REALLY differ and this is also where I have my chief--but few complaints--with the game. In BO3, you controlled how quick of a \"takeoff\" you wanted once the crash event started. If you wanted boost, just bump into the boost icon. Bump into the other icons to multiply your score, etc.But, in BR, it is much different. You still control how fast you \"takeoff\", at the beginning of the event, but now you have a bar and by pressing a button you make a meter shoot up. The higher the meter is on the bar, the faster you start. No big deal, a bit more Luck, than Skill, for my taste, but where the BIG PROBLEM is, is that no matter how slow or fast you start, no matter how light or heavy your vehicle is, you ALWAYS swerve uncontrollably to the right or left about two times before you can straighten out! You can not imagine how aggravating this is and how many times you will prematurely crash into guardrails, lightpoles, or other objects.However, once you get past this annoying part, the crash event is pretty much the same, but without the bonus icons, because you will be doing so much damage anyway you won't need 4x multipliers.I also sorely miss the presence of a garage to see at a glance all the cars I've won.But the Carl's Jr. Gut truck is definitely cool to smash into things!Despite my few complaints, BR is a GREAT game, with LOTS of replay value.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2005"}

This game is relatively flaw free which is something you can't say about many games. The story is very well done and entertaining. The story has you trapped on an island asylum where joker has planned an escape. You end up chasing joker all over the island and meeting several of the villains batman has placed in the asylum over the years. All characters are voiced with top notch acting. Batman has lots of gadgets to use and they are fun to use. The combat is simple enough you can use your toys and fists and in most cases it's not too difficult. It takes a few battles to get the timing for combos down and over the course of the game you level up and get stronger. Most of the time you'll want to be stealthy and the game does a good job of making the stealth elements work. Batman creeps in vents and climbs up walls with ease. The details and graphics are excellent. Everything looks sharp in this game. I never had to replay and area more than 2-3 times as the checkpoints are quite frequent. There aren't any long load times either. This is a very well put together game so go buy it today!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001E8VB6O","reviewerName":"Tyler Johnson","summary":"You are the Dark Knight","reviewText":"Batman: Arkham Asylum is the best Batman game ever made. But that is not the reason that you should buy it. You should stop what you are doing and get this game immediately because it is one of, if not the best, game of the year. It excels in every category, and is alot of fun to play, a quality that is fast fading in this modern gaming age.The game starts off with you escorting the Joker back to his home away from home in Arkham Asylum. Just before he can be safely stored in his padded room, all hell breaks loose and you are trapped on an island filled with your fiercest foes. The story only gets better from there, and you see villans ranging from Harley Quinn, to the Scarecrow in some of the most psycologicaly thrilling levels since Eternal Darkness.The Graphics are gorgeous. Period. The voice acting is so good I go to geek heaven every time I hear Mark Hamill give us the greatest Joker laugh ever concieved. Many of the voice actors from the excellent Batman: The Animated Series reprise their roles in this game to great effect. Paul Dini penned the excellent story so have no fear, you will not be rolling your eyes at cliched dialogue the entire game. Think of this as one of the best episodes of the animated series ever.As I stated in my title You are the Dark Knight, and it has never been this enjoyable. As Batman, you have at your disposal a wide array of gadgets ranging from your standard issue Batarang, to grappling hook, and blasting gel. Every item has a unique function, and often has combat applications for the more adventurous players. Which brings me to the combat. As Batman you have the ability to jump into a group of ten thugs and put generations of Jet Li and Jackie Chan movies to shame. After a few fights you should have the basic mechanics down, and by the time you have logged in a couple of hours you will be racking up 20 hit combos. There are times however, when you won't be able to charge into battle, but will need to use stealth, and badass scare tactics to defeat the more heavily armed foes. There are few things as satisfying as swooping down from the ceiling, tying your foe up, and leaving him to swing, scaring the crap out of the rest of his friends while the Joker taunts his men for their incompetence.While the combat is fantastic, the area of the game that most impressed me was the exploration. In games past exploration was barely a sidequest and treated more as a distraction for after you had completed the game. In Arkham Asylum you have a ton of interesting things to find from awesome recordings of the villans psych evaluations to engravings chronicling Amadeus Arkhams slow descent into madness. While most games make you turn over every rock and look in every cranny in AA you can find maps that point out the approximate location of the items. And once you find said secrets you are rewarded with extra experience to boost your abilities.The one gripe I have with the game is that you do not have a jump button. You jump automatically when you reach a ledge. While this seems like it would be a hindrance, in many case it is easier than a jump button. There are a couple of times I wished I had more control over my jump, but not to the point that it affected my performance.The playstation three version allows you to use the joker in the challenge maps so if you own a ps3 get this for that.This is an incredible game, and you owe it to yourself to play it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00005BW7Q","reviewerName":"Crono \"Mega RPG gamer\"","summary":"Xenosaga...... the future looks bright.","reviewText":"I just finished playing Xenosaga and I must say that it's one of the best RPG's I've ever played. Let me take you through my review of it....Xenosaga is an RPG based in the future where mankind has spread and colonized the universe and battles internal strife as well as an alien race called the Gnosis. The best feature of Xenosaga is its story. It's huge, engrossing and simply amazing. It really is a surreal trip through an alternate reality. The next best thing are the characters. They are so well developed and each has their own backgrounds and history which are revealed through the story. There are no useless characters in the story; they all play a role and are brought to life through voice acting and dialogue.Xenosaga's battle system is also a very nice change from the norm. It can be as simple or as complex as you want. It's filled with customizations, AGWS (giant robots), boosts, fiersome enemies, and some very nice features. The only thing that's unfair is that alot of the bosses way abuse the boost ability making it feel very cheap. And it's hard to use the various points and learn the ropes without really examining the various features, but it's still good once you get the hang of it.One element of the game that's come under heavy fire is the cutscene method. You will be watching as much as you play. I guarantee it. But the story is so well done that I didn't mind. Xenosaga ain't for everyone: but if you want an amazing RPG with a one of a kind story, it's a crime not to play it. If only they had better integrated the movie and gameplay parts... but still, it's extremely impressive. The game graphics are still awesome after 2 years and the soundtrack is excellent even though I wish they would've played more of it over the course of the game.The back of the Xenosaga case says that the game contains 80 hours of gameplay. Most gamers I have seen say it's around 60 hours, 40 if you're quick. I watched every cutscene, did alot of the side missions including most of the decodings, fought every boss and played through it all in only 30 hrs. Half the time alotted by gamers. Still, the game felt more than sufficiently long, and I was very happy with the ending.My only complaint with it all that really irritated me involved the enemies. The enemies are almost always placed at the chokepoints so you're FORCED to fight them even though the idea of seeing them is that you're free to not fight them if you choose. Even if you're a good distance away, the warning sign goes off and the enemy chases after you, something I've never ever seen in any RPG that's use this system. It really becomes a game of cat and mouse as you try to outmanuever them and it becomes 5 times more frusturating when they catch you and you're forced into battle. Please follow the Chrono Cross model. This is absolutely ridiculous.Xenosaga really is an RPG all on its own. It sticks to formulas, but mixes it up with its story. It's a must play. If you're scared, try it out anyway. I was scared of the cutscenes when I read reviews, but I never really noticed them because they were so well done. (Xenosaga movie anyone?)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2005"}

I loved Mirror's Edge, and the thought of a customizable class-based team shooter with Mirror's Edge-like movement sounded amazing. But I'm not unrealistic - I'm a game developer, and I know how hard a trick that is to pull off. Brink not only fails on the high concept, though - it fails at just about everything else.The entire structure of the single player campaign is basically a giant botmatch, with some of the stupidest AI ever seen in a commercially-released game. Entire missions can be spent shooting down a single hallway, mowing down enemies for 20 straight minutes until the time finally runs out. The weapon customization is extensive, yet totally pointless. The character customization is gorgeous (the one thing they really did do right), but the underlying class-based nature of the game means that the customizable characters actually work against clarity of gameplay.More, the class-based nature of the game is horrendously structured - honestly, one of the worst designs I've seen in any game, ever. You can improve your class, but in most games, you'll need to switch constantly from one class to another. So if you want to specialize as an Engineer... FORGET IT. Your team will be completely screwed when a non-Engineer-related challenge comes up.Worst of all, the much-vaunted parkour system is almost utterly pointless. The level design is such that half the time you can't tell whether you can make a jump, there's not enough visual feedback to determine what you'll actually do as you run forward, and you'll often get \"stuck\" on obstacles you wanted to just run by.Brink is full of bad design decisions, awful AI, boring weapons, lousy controls, and mindnumbingly poor gameplay. It's a joyless, fun-free mess, and a complete waste of time. It takes a game with a lot of potential to fail *this* badly, but unfortunately, there's nothing redeeming about Brink whatsoever.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2011"}

It really seems like a lot is missing and they mainly focused on a \"multiplayer\" experience (defending and destroying - not to be confused with multiplayer as in deathmatch). There just doesn't seem to be a whole lot of substance to the game. I guess i had high hopes for this game.

COD4 completely changed online multiplayer and Infinity Ward's COD games (Modern Warfare series and now Ghosts) has been almost unchanged while Treyarch has taken the COD4 formula and has been leaps and bounds more proficient in adding on with its Black Ops series.Ghost's has a VERY short campaign, ridiculous levels in space that'll have Neil Degrasse Tyson on a rant for weeks, and a story that could have been considerably more fleshed out. The story is admittedly better than MW2 and MW3, but those two were absolutely terrible.If you were only interested in multiplayer that's fine. There is really nothing new. They basically copied and pasted Black Ops 2's multiplayer and added a facelift. In fact, there are noticeable deletions like the mode I play: Ground War. No ground war. Only 12 players, which makes multiplayer less intense. This is very disappointing.Save your money. Just play Black Ops 2.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2013"}

Sorornejad","summary":"More of a remix than a sequel","reviewText":"I dont mean to rehash most of the reviews that were already left, but this game was essentially quite similar to BioShock, just a different protagonist, with a somewhat different story line.  With that said and out of the way, I must say that although my former statement may deter some gamers from purchasing this game, it should be noted that the game is indeed a great game, and builds upon the story of one of the most ground breaking video games of the past decade.  In this sequel, you play as a Big Daddy who is on a journey to uncover more about his past, and about exactly what his purpose is in Rapture.  Even against todays standards, the graphics are indeed great, and the gameplay is one that sucks you in as you really start to feel the emotions and pain of the person you are controlling as he uncovers pieces of his past.  The game is somewhat short, and there is a multiplayer mode, but to be quite honest, I think they really dropped the ball on the multiplayer.  The maps are horrible and the gameplay seems feels like a Half Life style deathmatch game that was slapped together quickly, all of which made me put the controller down after about 20 minutes of confusion on what replay value is provided by the poor multiplayer.All in all I would say this game is worth a shot, but better purchased used or at a sale price.  Die hard BioShock fans may enjoy the game a bit more than the average gamer due to its uncovering of a bit more of Raptures history, but dont bank on it becoming as much of a ground breaker as the first.As far as difficulty goes, the game is quite difficult on Hard, but it is pretty rewarding.  At first, expect to die, a lot.  But as you start to gain more experience and more powers, the game starts to balance out in your favor, even on the hard difficulty.  If you want the most out of the game I suggest playing it on Hard, as most will find Medium a bit too easy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2010"}

The main problem was the storyline.  I didn't mind that it was a trifle, I don't go into a computer game expecting a Russian novel.  I minded that it ended so quickly, and before I really had any idea that it was about to end.  There's many side-quests you can still go on after that, but narratively speaking it just doesn't seem right.  A game which allows you to buy fortresses or even castles should somehow incorporate being a virtual king into the storyline.  Instead the storyline is mostly just hack and slash for 5-10 hours until a bunch of monsters are killed, then you win.You're able to have a different reputation with everybody you come across, and get married, and so on and so forth.  That all sounds very interesting, until you realize there's really about a dozen people in the entire kingdom, just copied over and over.  You're able to buy a house, but you're not allowed to really do anything interesting with the house, just upgrade the furniture to more expensive furniture, all of the same style.Unfortunately I hear Fable 3 is a small step back, although even so I'd like to give it a try someday.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2011"}

I was disappointed with the first Fable, mostly due to the director Peter Molyneaux's claims of \"The Best RPG ever!\" and other unworldly promises that ultimately were either scrapped or severely reduced.  So, when Fable 2 came out, my expectations were dampened and I told myself not to get overly excited.  Having played through it a couple times, I'm glad to say that it's not the disappointment Fable was, but it's not anywhere near as epic as it could be.At the core, Fable 2 is a simulation and not a RPG and it's this distinction that limits the game.  When you begin, you choose a gender and are whisked away to your orphaned childhood, with a dream of living in a castle and having a much better life.  Right away, the themes of morality are explored with your decisions impacting what Old Town Bowerstone looks like when you're older.  Of course, you get your wish, end up at Castle Fairfax and right before you can start your posh life, your sister is mercilessly killed and you are shot out of a window.  Obviously, you don't die but the game jumps forward to your teen life, setting out in the big (at least compared to the original Fable) world of Albion with one ultimate goal: kill your sister's murderer.The story in Fable 2 is a pretty standard hero story.  It basically deals with your journey to locate three other heroes and then defeat the ultimate bad guy.  I'd say that's a spoiler, but it's the same typical, generic RPG story tossed into a variety of generic RPGs.  It's become a cliche.  What helps Fable 2 is that there's a lot more to the world than a simple quest to avenge your sister.  The world is populated with a good sized variety of interesting quests centered around helping (or hindering) the local populace.  So, you might go about helping a young man find his ideal mate and explaining to his father his lifestyle choice or you might help a local gravedigger locate the body parts of Lady Gray so he can recreate his one true love.Other quests have pertinent changes to the story.  If you ally yourself with the Temple of Shadows, you might ultimately bring havoc to the Temple of Light.  It's here where some of the original promises of the first Fable are brought to life.  At some point in the story, you'll move ahead a good span of time and you can see how your choices have affected Albion for the good or bad.  I like this, but I was hoping for something a bit more.Some of the great moments in the game come in the form of money.  I spent an ungodly amount of time amassing wealth, purchasing houses throughout Albion and generally making myself into a real estate tycoon.  I loved this system, though it felt only partially implemented.  If you set the rent to the highest possible, all you get are comments from the townspeople about how it must be nice to sleep on piles of money.  Where's the revolution?  Where's the underclass rising up to throw off the shackles of their oppressors?It's not that type of game, unfortunately.  Though it is really buggy.  I think my game crashed about 10 times during one playthrough (which took about 15-17 hours).  Locking up, the game just stops loading, black screens, etc...all of it happened and it was very annoying.  When the game was loading, people and places tended to not load with it.  A couple times, upon loading Bowerstone, some of the houses looked like they were floating because the porches hadn't loaded...or you could hear people talking, but couldn't see them.Which brings me to my biggest problem, which isn't the bugginess.  Fable 2, like Fable before it, is a simulation first, an RPG a distant second.  It's hard to forge any empathy with the vacant people of Albion when the only way you can interact with them is to dance like an idiot, pump your arms like an egoist or growl at them in a skipping-audio fashion.  And when all of the NPC's voices blur together into some kind of aural kaleidoscope of sameness, the immersion is broken.I knew marriage takes a lot of work, but having to interrupt your quest because your spouse is upset is obnoxious.  \"I'm sorry, hunny, I know you want me to do 20 arm pumps and dance like a stereotypical Russian but I don't have time.  I'm, you know, trying to save the world,\" is a conversation I would have liked to have a thousand times over.  Instead, I found myself pumping my arm, dancing and professing my undying love every time (and sometimes a couple times) during a quest.  Not because I wanted happiness for my character, mind you, but because if I got divorced I'd lose half of my money!I think this is what ultimately distances the celebrated RPGs of this time and Fable 2.  Yes, there's a visual cue that you are evil/good and your individual, stats-based growth is visually represented...but at the end of the day, you're a silent doll dancing lifelessly to appease the empty dolls of Albion.  It's empty and a little soulless.  That said, there were two moments of immense pathos towards the end of the game that really did hit home; especially the final choice you make in the game.  If Fable 2 were made of more of these moments and less of silent pandering, Peter would have a terrific game on hand.  I had a lot of fun playing the game, but ultimately it felt like a huge progression from the first game, but Lionhead Studios has a long way to go.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2009"}

Did it live up tot he name? Almost. First the good. Graphics are sweet. Unreal atmoshere and smooth framerate. The textures are blurry for a GC game, but they're decent. The lighting and particles are a sight to see. Sound is really well done as well. No voice acting at all but the sfx and music is top notch with pII support. But essentially, some fundamental gameplay flaws make the game needlessly frustrating. One of the flaws is the controls. I disagree about the current perspective being &quot;ideal&quot; - even when jumping, it'd be nice to look down at my feet before I leap and gauge how close to the platform's edge I am, but that is not possible. Jumping from and to platforms is almost always harder than it should be, not to mention the pot you're in when an enemy manages to get behind you when you're fighting a pack in front of you. Dual-analog would've made this perfection. Even after finishing the game just under 14 hours, I still find the controls unecessarily prohibitive. I know that a few weaksauce types fear and abhor the free look style controls of Halo/TS2, but there really should have been an option. Funny how the two aspects I *don't* like - the dull-as-dirt scanning and the limited prespective controls - came from Miyamoto. Again, that's what's symptomatic about the &quot;new&quot; Nintendo - dumbing their games down just a little too much with overthink and overdesign. The morphing ball is also a nice touch though, although nothing that evolves the game.I can say, that I would enjoy Metroid quite a bit more if it had the option for a non-fixed free look, and there is NO situation I've encountered in over 14 hours of play that would've been compromised by it. It's missing for one reason, and that reason is that console-style FPS controls are very daunting to novice gamers as well as many &quot;hardcore&quot; gamers, since they've only been around for a short time. I know a couple people who breathed a sigh of relief when they heard the controls &quot;were like Goldeneye and not Halo,&quot; just because they couldn't really adjust to the free-look style. This doesn't excuse the lack of an OPTION to change the controls, though. I would also enjoy better visor controls, since the D-pad requires me to take my hand off the analog stick in order to scan in the heat of battle (to find boss weak points), although some of the blame could be leveled at the Gamecube controller and it's relative paucity of buttons. There's also a real lack of Zelda-style context sensitivity which makes these various buttons/pad presses necessary.Also, the game is a single player game, with no multiplayer whatsoever, whch really brings dow the replay value and the game is pretty short as is. But all in all, it is a decent game. Just don't expect it's gameplay to match it's visual and sound presentation.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2002"}

Anyways, I thought that it was so much fun. It's a very unique style of game play where you don't actually have to do a majority of the work. You just send your minions out to terrorize the town. I played it for about a week before I got bored, but I think I almost beat it. Even though it got boring to me, I still think it's a really sweet game and it was worth the money. I'll probably start to play it again after a few weeks so it will be fresher to me. I think the reason it got boring is that the upgrades are really limited and the gameplay gets really repetitive. And, a lot of times you have to use a particular type of minion to beat a level, but they're not avaliable on that level, so you have to go back to a previous level and kill enemies until you get enough minions built up. It's really annoying and repetitive. I constantly found myself shortchanged with my minions and they weren't avaliable enough throughout the game. Still really fun though, so I recommend at least renting it.FYI: There's three types of armor you can get get throughout the game; there isn't that much game play in between the upgrades, so I'd recommend just saving your minions for the final armor upgrades. If you use them to upgrade the other armor/weapons, they're lost forever and you'll find yourself short on minions later on in the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2007"}

Sure the story from F2 was lacking overall and seemed disjointed in parts, but the world itself and all that could be done  made up for the lacking storyline to keep the game interesting. As I read about the story for F3, I was immediately intrigued. I love politics and political struggles.In the end there is something exciting about power. Of course this sounds \"evil\" as we typically regard power in a negative context. We often see those seeking power as only wielding it for their own purposes stepping on the necks of those they consider beneath them in order to elevate themselves as Logan seems to exemplify. However, power can be used for good. I could truly care about saving someone's life, livelihood, etc... but I must have the resources, power being chief among them, to be able to do so. There are so many avenues to take to incorporate this type of thing and the effects of wielding one's power to elevate oneself or to the benefit of some/the majority/all. The consequences (either positive or negative) of the decisions/actions taken are literally only limited by the story writer's imagination.Here is where F3 falls flat to me and leaves me unsatisfied. They (Lionhead/Molyneux) often speak to this idea of giving you choices (you must have power to have choices) that affect the world of Albion, but they fail to incorporate this or deliver on it really. Apart from the final decision (which again was stupid and borderline the worst ending of a video game ever...though KOTOR 2 still takes the cake on that one in my opinion) F2 did a decent job with this. For instance, you let the law breakers go free in the starting scene of the game and the Old Town part of Bowerstone was a much different place than had you decided to help bring law breakers to justice (give the warrants to the guard).Now enter F3, the premise of the story sounds awesome. There is no need for me to rehash it as anyone reading it knows what it is. Finally, I thought, they are truly giving me a position of power that is going to allow me to put my mark on Albion and shape it (aspects of it) as I make decisions throughout the game. All the better, I thought, that I have to build a base of power (allies) to overthrow the ruling monarch in order to take my place on the throne of Albion. I mean the potential here is mind-boggling. I feared though basing it on previous installments of Fable that this would be haphazardly done giving you no real influence or power within the game. My fears were unfortunately spot on. It is all meaningless and the story falls flat. I won't elaborate too much here as I do not want to \"spoil\" anything as the game disappoints in this area enough on its own.I will give a couple examples though to give you an indication of what I mean. In gaining allies, the vast majority of the time there is nothing revelatory to the main story line that you must do to gain supporters (allies). Let us take the Bowerstone resistance for example. All you need to do is earn a certain number of guild seals (or whatever they are called) to prove yourself. You can do anything to gain those from interacting with people to playing some silly \"board game\" with some wizards. Though the \"wizard game\" provides a bit of stupid humor in the game, what the heck does it have to do with anything regarding me, defining my character. or why anyone should choose to submit their trust and loyalty to me? It doesn't and therefore makes the whole gaining allies thing meaningless and stupid. How does it provide me with choices that are shaping Albion? It doesn't and is therefore nothing really but a side mission/quest. This is the real glaring problem. 99% of what you do in this game is a side mission, and simply there to hide or cover up the fact that there is nothing more than bones of a story which lacks any real meat. The premise of the story is exceptional and truly provides limitless potential of making interesting exciting ways of progressing from point A to B to C, etc... Hearing about the story makes me want to dig further. Unfortunately, the chapters of the story are full of material that isn't related or even remotely relevant to the topics of the story's outline.I am all about side quests, the more the merrier, but providing hundreds, if not thousands, of side quests is no excuse for making no or poor main story line related content. Also while there are countless, I seriously do not know how many there possibly are they are so numerous, side quests so many of them are the same thing repeated over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over (this is getting pretty monotonous and boring huh?)  again. No creativity at all is shown in forging relationships. Interact with someone a few times, and they give you a quest to cement the friendship. The quest is ALWAYS you delivering a package for them or fetching an item for them. After about 20 or so relationships I couldn't handle it any more. It doesn't help that they have so dumbed-down the user interface that interacting is just a repetitive act of pushing and holding a button to watch the same display of handshaking, dancing, or pat-a-cake (pat-a-cake? seriously?) over and over again. It is mind-numbingly repetitive and boring after a few hours of game play. I started playing \"nice\", but the next citizen of Albion who gives me a \"go fetch\" quest to befriend me isn't just going to get their head farted on, I am going to crap on it, rip it off with my bare hands and then kick it down the street like soccer ball just for fun. After a couple hours of interacting with the rather one-dimensional people of Albion, I found myself sympathizing with Logan for having such dimwitted citizens to look after and put up with.Now an example of what I was trying to say about how meaningless and ineffectual the choices in this game are. Isn't Fable supposed to be about choices? Are you given choices? Yes a few, but most of those those, unless I am just too dense to notice, have zero effect on anything really. Do you scold or inspire? Do you sign the guy's petition? Do you spare the people or your love interest? Either way it doesn't matter. Sure you get to decide, but who cares if it means nothing and has no affect on anything beyond whether you look like an angel or a demon? This is the problem with ALMOST every \"choice\" you get to make, it has in most cases no impact at all on anything in the game. What's the point then?At first the world of Albion seems expansive. It is not. Sure if you want to befriend all the citizens in the game there are seemingly endless amount of quests within the game and you can literally spend days if not weeks in just a few areas of the game with fetch and carry friendship quests. I played this game for at least ten hours just in the first three areas of the game alone. There are a caves and cavernous buildings to quest through within those areas and at first it does seem the world of Albion is going to be massive in scope. Once you bore of the all the \"let's make friends fetch and carry\" quests though and move forward with the main story you get a very quick rude awakening at how small Albion truly is and how little there is to do outside of the fetch and carry quests. I did count but around 1/3 of the areas on the map for instance are just Bowerstone. Again these seem expansive and huge, but after a quick explorative run around (or looking at the minimap of the area in the sanctuary) you'll find actually each area to which you have access is only composed of a couple of streets and there is nothing interesting or new to explore, be found, or to do on those streets. Though yes there are plenty of NPC's to give you more fetch and carry quests as if the first 50 or so of them didn't bore you enough. Perhaps the problem isn't that the world isn't large but that there is nothing new to experience or to do throughout much of it therefore you can breeze by most of it.Others have said plenty about the menu now being the sanctuary. I personally could care less. It doesn't add or subtract much of any enjoyment to the game for me. While it may make the \"menu\" more appealing I am not sure it makes it less cumbersome as in my opinion it increases the amount of time it takes to change clothes for instance and you still have to scroll through multiple \"pages\" once you start acquiring more items of the same type. It is neither a good or bad thing in my opinion. It is still a menu it is just fancied up a bit.I do not like what they have done with the \"real estate\" market in this game. Now you have to periodically spend time and money \"repairing\" the houses you own or you collect no rent from them. This is fine IF houses looked nicer after investing my money back into them, but they do not. They look the same whether their condition is 100% or 0%. This perhaps highlights my biggest problem in general with this game. For a game that is supposed to be about choice and the consequences of them on the world, nothing I do seems to affect anything. So what is the point of doing any of it? The only thing this feature does is add one more boring monotonous repetitive task to complete in this game. While it doesn't take hours or anything it definitely takes several minutes to go through the entire mini-map (by far the quickest way I have found to do it) to repair all your houses once you have quite a few in different areas. Thankfully the rate at which they degrade and require repair doesn't seem to be too quick. You can definitely get in several hours of game play before having to repeat the process.I ranted a bit and hopefully made some sense. I am let down more than anything by the lack of real purposeful and/or interesting quests, real significant choices, real significant consequences from those choices, real fighting (I said little about this mash the same button over and over again, that's pretty much it), real interaction with NPCs, interesting places to explore, and most of all the lack of any real story. I think what has been created here is a causal gamer's delight. You can always hop on find something to do to kill an hour or so, but for the hard-core gamer the repetitive nature of the quests really starts to get boring after a few hours and you start craving different stimuli, at least I did. When I play for an hour or two I find myself enjoying the game. When I attempt to play much longer than that in one sitting I find I am bored with it. I must say in general I am becoming fearful as I notice this trend where epic game titles of this nature get systematically dumbed-down in hopes it seems to entice the casual gamer folks.As I play through F3 and I go back and listen to Peter Molyneux discuss what he likes/dislikes in reference to RPGs, what I am beginning to realize is he doesn't really like RPGs much at all. He likes some elements of them perhaps, but overall he does not like RPGs. When I look at the Fable series and how it has evolved what I get the sense of is what Peter Molyneux really wants to create is a simulation adventure game. In many ways the character interaction for instance is a lot like \"The Sims\". People will like you, hate you, or love you depending on your choice of simplified style interaction with them (compare Mass Effect type interaction with Fable). You can fall in love, marry, have children, etc... You can dress you character as you like from hair to make up to the shoes they wear. I truly believe Molyneux is trying to give the player a whole simulation type experience of a life within Albion. I am not saying this is negative per se, but many aspects of a true RPG get sacrificed (such as the main story line) for this and while I personally enjoy \"The Sims\", I do so in a limited scope as so much of what you do is repetitive and gets boring after a few hours of game play as many times it lacks purpose and there is no real goal(s) to achieve. Even your character in F3 looks as if he were stripped right out of \"The Sims\" video game (again this isn't a negative per se). Of course there is some adventuring to do so this isn't strictly a \"The Sims\" ripoff, but in many ways it feels like what Molyneux wants to deliver with Fable is that simulation experience dressed up in an adventure game. When I look at F3 from that perspective Molyneux and Lionhead do an outstanding job at delivering that type of experience. Honestly, when I judge this game in that regard rather than as an RPG I would say this is a 5 star game and no one has come close, that I can think of at least, to delivering such a high caliber game for this \"genre\" that Lionhead has produced here, and it is definitely much more interesting and immersive as a life simulation than \"The Sims\" ever was. Unfortunately it does carry over the lack of story/purpose and some of the boring repetitive nature these simulation type of games tend to have. Unfortunately as well there isn't too much on this front that is different than F2. With this type of simulation game it isn't a question as to whether there is something to do in the game as there always is, but whether what that something to do is that interesting. For me the repetitiveness and lack of purpose typically kills that interest in short order. I mean the main story of this game is REALLY short, lacks content and is not built upon much at all. As a hardcore RPG lover this is a bit of a deal breaker, hence my low rating despite the fact that this game delivers a first class gaming experience in some regards.1 to 2 stars as an RPG5 stars as a Simulation","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2010"}

Many people will claim this is a new game completely unlike the previous titles, however, in my opinion, it is more or less more of the same.The graphics are improved, although I am not someone who obsesses too much about that kind of thing. The deployment item from Halo 3 has been modified to be reusable, thus allowing you to keep using it over and over until you swap out for another one or die. The game is a little bit more open than Halo 2 or 3, about the same as Halo 1.My only real complaint, personally, is that many of my favorite things were only done once. You only have the opportunity to use the jetpecks in one mission in the game. There is only one point in the game when you get a tank and get to go nuts, same with spaceflight. I am not saying it's that bad, but in my pinion, there is no reason that they couldn't have had more jetpack deployments around, and an extra tank tossed in here and there. One of my favorite missions, taking out scarabs, really doesn't exist in this game either. 95% of the deployments are sprinting and invincible, neither of which is really that interesting to use. I played through the entire campaign and didn't run across a single invisible. I am sure they exist, I probably just missed it, I just think these armor deployments could have been a little more available and varied.Nitpicking aside, the game is fun to play. Rather than the upbeat \"take on the universe\" feel of the halo series, you really get a good sense of the hopelessness of the battle with the depressing music, atmosphere, and dialogue. You know things are going bad and you are fighting on a losing team. Emotionally, it is definitely a different feel for Halo.In the end, however, the game feels the same. Combat is almost identical to the predecessors, sure you have life like Halo 1, but that is about it. You will feel right at home playing this game. Brutes have been toned down and are actually quite easy to kill, elites have better AI and are actually more difficult to kill, and even the effectiveness of grunts seems to have gone up a bit. Hunters are gruesome as ever to take down, in one level, forcing you to take out 4 at a time. Wraiths don't feel as powerful as they used to. So everything feels tweaked in one way or another. Weapons have been tweaked too, most notably, the battle rifle fires only 1 bullet rather than a a spree of shots. There is a couple of wildlife monsters you have to take out, but they only appear once in the game. It would have been nice to have to kill a couple more of them.I haven't said anything about multiplayer. It is just as fun as always, and I don't think you will get anything more or less out of it than previous Halo 3.Pros:*No flood*Earn Credits to Purchase and Unlock Armor*Deployments are reusable (sprint is nice to have when you find yourself  vehicleless)*Better graphics*Creepy Yet Unique Mood*Some very unique environments such as the night club and office building.*Spaceflight and the City flight missions were two of the funnest I have played*More open environmentCons:*Not enough Tank Missions*Not enough variability with armor deployments*Less Epic*You already know how things are going to end, more or less*No opportunity to knock out a scarab(there is an opportunity, but the game suggests you speed right passed them, and you aren't really given the weapons to do it, so I suppose you can, but it you'd be going out of your way to).So to sum it up, I like Halo Reach. It was more of the same with just enough modified to keep things interesting. If I wanted a completely different revolutionary experience ever time I played a new game from a series, then I would buy a game from a different series. I think too many people obsess over each subsequent game being a completely new experience from it's predessor. To me, that is stupid. If you want a different game, buy a different game, don't buy Halo 2 or 3 if you want a Gears of War experience. Personally, I am happy with the new story, the newer graphics, and a couple of unique missions yet still being essentially the same game. I recommend buying this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2010"}

The campaign is epic, multiplayer is just darn addicting, and the other modes are simply the icing on the cake.CAMPAIGN: (no spoilers)Halo Reach's campaign takes place just before the events of Halo: Combat Evolved. You are put into the shoes of Noble 6, a member of a Spartan squad called Noble Team. During the campaign, you help out Noble Team in their defense of Reach against the Covenant, a courageous effort against impossible odds. The campaign is reasonably long, logging in at about 7-10 hours on your first playthrough, increasing or decreasing with difficulty or skulls activated. The campaign is very epic and entertaining, featuring a wide array of enemies, vehicles, and locations to discover. The graphics are excellent, though not ground-breaking. And on top of all that, the masterful music of Marty O'Donnell is put in, adding even more emotion to the story. Though the overall campaign is not as good as some of the past titles, it is still excellent and is highly recommended.MULTIPLAYER:In a nutshell, the multiplayer of Halo Reach is awesome, providing many new changes (i.e. armor abilities, new gametypes, maps), but still being the tried-and-true Halo multiplayer that we've grown accustomed to over the years. Some new weapons and vehicles have been added in, which are all very cool. Finding and joining a match is easy as pie, and you will find hosting a game with many friends has been made a lot easier. There is some occasional host migration, but not enough to detract from the overall experience. A cool new feature of this game is the sheer level of customization that you can put on your character, like armor pieces, helmets, coloring schemes, emblems, clan tags that you can use. You get most of these by earning credits from playing campaign, multiplayer, and firefight, but some are unlocked by default. These changed apply to multiplayer, firefight, and even campaign, appearing in the cutscenes as well. Offering new game modes like Invasion and returning classic old ones like Infection, Slayer, Big Team Battle, Grifball, and Assault, the multiplayer of Halo Reach is grand.FIREFIGHT:Returning from Halo 3: ODST, Firefight is Halo's version of Horde or Survival mode from many other games, adding in many new and interesting features. You can go it alone, invite some friends, or find a match (finally) with up to 4 people. You can adjust so many aspects of Firefight, including ammo, player traits like shielding and movement speed, enemy type, how many spawn, difficulty level, etc., and this makes an already great experience even greater.FORGE:Forge has returned from Halo 3, and is Halo's level editor. While you cannot change the level design itself, you can put in and delete weapons, structures, scenery, vehicles, and much, much more while in Monitor mode, easily switched to and from with the D-Pad. And the best part is that this is all done in real time, meaning that you and a bunch of friends can both work on the map or just fool around, as you can switch to a normal player easily. This makes for some hilarious mayhem and awesome finished products, so it is top-notch.THEATER:Theater from Halo 3 and Halo 3: ODST has returned, which is pretty self-explanatory-a place where you can record, rewatch, and edit your recent game sessions. While I have not used the feature much, it is very cool when I want to record some gameplay where I did really well, highlight the best parts, and put it in my file share so that my friends and the world can see.CUSTOM GAMES:In custom games, you can create your own game modes and game types that can be played with your friends. There's lots of room for creativity here, whether you want Superman-like, fast-moving, high-jumping Spartans facing off against each other, or slow, lumbering soldiers struggling to race to the other side of the map. It is a very fun mode to use, and what you do with it is completely up to your imagination.OVERVIEW:Overall, this is a fantastic game and sets a new standard for what modern FPS games should be. You definitely get a lot of bang for your buck, and time spent playing this game is certainly time well spent. And for you parents out there considering getting this for your kid(s), I would only recommend it for youngsters 11 or older. There's a surprisingly low level of violence, blood, and profanity in this game, a level of which I consider a \"T\" rating. It's at your discretion which ages you let play this, but again, it's not that violent compared to most other games. So if you haven't already, do yourself a favor and buy this game now. It's a steal for $25 (writing this in October 2012), and it's even more fun if you have lots of friends to game with. I hope this review helped, and Remember Reach!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2011"}

The Fear, a Predator like man with a long lizard tongue, stealth cloaking, and incredible agility.  The End, a hundred year old man known as the \"Father of Modern Sniping\", most of the time he is asleep or in a wheelchair, but when you fight him, his battle is so well executed and paced, that it can take up to an hour to complete.  The Fury, an ex-NASA astronaut who's gone a little insane; he rides around his lair on a cool-looking jetpack and wields a flamethrower that sets almost everything ablaze.  The Boss, a woman of great legend and combat skills, she has a past with Solid Snake and i can't say much about her without ruining anything story wise.  Then there's The Sorrow, and i can't say anything about him except he is one of the coolest characters ever created for a video game, and his battle is...different, and really makes you think.  and whenever he is around he causes a nasty rainstorm.  then there are all other kinds of cool characters and game situations that i won't go into, for fear of spoiling anything else.the jungle setting adds much more in terms of gameplay.  you can use different camos to blend in with the backgrounds.  if you sneak up on enemies, you can press circle to grab them and put your knife to there throat and either:  1. knock them to the ground/knock them out. 2. Interrogate them, maybe they'll tell you some interesting secrets... 3.  slit their throat.  4. use them as a shield against other enemies.  this tactic is usually helpful in alert mode, because ememy soldiers won't shoot at you if their fellow comrade is in front of you.  and enemy troops are a lot more aware this time around.  so no more running up behind people and snapping there necks without having to worry.  now, you have to creep up behind them, and even then they will still hear the grass under your feel moving around, or the dirt crumbling, or the soft footsteps on cements caused by your boots.  it doesn't hatter what you do, they will always turn around to see what the hell is behind them, but if you are quick, you can grab them without them warning their friends.  maybe this is just in normal mode, i don't know, i haven't done easy or very easy modes yet.  but after i beat the game i unlocked some cool stuff, but i still haven't recieved the optic camo yet.  if it's even in the game, i don't know, but i really hope so.the graphics in this game are amazing.  every blade of grass blows in the gentle breeze and gets smashed when you crawl over it.  the trees and canopy look great and the water is fantastic.  the numerous animals also look realistic, but you still need to kill or subdue them to eat them in order to survive. and at one point in the game, someone has a plastic bag over their head, and it inflates and deflates with every breath they take, it looks amazing and very real.the new suriving aspect is great.  you must hunt and eat animals to recover stamina, which drains over time and even more when you run or swim or do anything that involves a lot of energy.  some things taste bad and don't recover as much stamina, while others taste delicious and have excellent stamin recovery.  your life bar refills itself at different speeds, depending on how much stamina you have.  when your stamina reaches zero, you pass out/die. i'm just assuming that, because it never happened to me.  i always made sure i had stamina.  but i'm assuming it's just like a breath gauge, when it reaches zero, you start to lose health rapidly.  i have no idea.when you get shot, or fall off something too hight, or get burned, the damages don't just magically go away.  you have to remove bullets and arrows, treat burns, and set broken bones.  it a new system that adds even more to the reality of the game.  if you choose not to heal your wounds, you will keep losing life until you die.  so make sure to heal yourself whenever possible.in the game, you are taken from lavish jungles and forests, to swamps filled with alligators and leeches, to mountain trails and a mountain summit.  you visit all kinds of interiors that look great and are all quite varied.  sewers look dingy and grimy and high tech areas seem very clean.  but i still think a stage later in the game, a very important part, is the most amazing.  there are literally thousands of beautifully rendered flowers all around you, about waist high.  just the sight of seeing all of them swaying back and forth in the wind, or bending over as i ran past/over them is just plain phenomenal.  the area where you battle The End is also very lush and quite gorgeous from certain spots.  but every area in this game looks amazing in it's own way and this game seems to have squeezed all of the power from the ps2, and stolen some from the other two systems as well.  i don't see how people can say the graphics haven't changed much since mgs2.  that game all looked the same.  puffy, soft looking metal floors, walls and ceilings.  i'm not saying it was a bad game, it was just bland.  and Raiden sucked.  in Snake Eater, all the character models are much more detailed.  when people look at eachother, their eyes move realistically.  people actually have fingernails, and everyone's hair looks really well done.  all the different camo suits are cool looking, especially the sneaking suit, which has a bunch of different lines of metal alloy all over it, all of them shine independentely in light and it looks pretty cool.  explosions are bright and vibrant and are some of the best on any system.  same goes for The Fury's jetpack and it's exhaust shooting out the back.  bright blue and white flames, causing the air around him to ripple.  everything in this game is just plain cool to look at.There is also a minigame called \"Snake vs. Monkeys\", and it's pretty fun.  it pits snake against a set amount of Ape Escape monkeys/apes. he has banana camo on and a little toy looking gun he has to use to tranq them with so he can capture them.  every level has rankings for good times, so that will keep you busy for awhile.  just the first level took me about twenty minutes to get first place, and there are still at least four or five more levels.  then there are other training areas, in CQC (close-quartes combat), and other survival techniques.this is by far the best, and longest, metal gear game, so pick it up immediately if you're a fan of the series, even if you were turned away by the strange story of Sons of Liberty (mgs2).  this one is just plain amazing and if you have an internet connection, you can download new camouflage to creep around the jungle in.and don't worry, this will not be the last metal gear game.  the series will continue on the next gen playstation and the PSP.  but until then, buy this game and get ready to experience one of gaming history's finest titles.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2004"}

Scenery, mood and graphics are different and very good. Game takes the best of other good games and molds in in a unique way.  Stealth is actually fun. I appreciate the fact that you don't have to look at maps constantly to tell where to go as well as using some stupid radar to tell that enemies are around \"I am talking about you Deus EX Hr\". You need to rely on sound, peeking through keyholes and peering out to see threats. Much better done than other stealth type games I have played. One thing that  makes this game so good is side missions are not simply go there and do this over and over.They were not simply added on to increase game length.  Again talking about you Deus ex.

This is my summary, 1) very fun game 2) great atmosphere 3) really cool special powers 4) many ways to play game 5) interesting and unique story 6) excellent save system 7)high replayabiity 8) good length no added on sections leading to monotony .

Lethal","summary":"a very flawed game","reviewText":"If you ever wondered what would happen if someone made a Bioshock game with bad stealth elements, this is it.  Your right hand wields a sword (or dagger for stealth kills), while your left either holds a crossbow or gun or uses supernatural powers, which are shamelessly taken from Bioshock right down to using blue vials to regenerate power.  Several times during the game I absent mindedly tried to switch to telekinesis to claim out of reach objects (that particular power isn't here).  The ability to summon a rat swarm just like the Bioshock bee swarm is another total ripoff.I chose to be stealthy to get the good ending (no spoilers) and it's a huge hassle.  I'd say a good 25% of the time I tried to choke a guard out from behind for a nonlethal takedown it didn't work, Corvo swinging his dagger a few inches in front of him instead.  On several occasions it meant getting spotted.  Once that happens you pretty much have to reload your last save because it's impossible to evade the guards; they run as fast as you and often still see you if you use the blink ability to teleport away.  Sleep darts are in your arsenal but you can only carry ten max to ensure you have to deal with this frustration.  Incidentally, the \"good\" ending is brief and completely not worth the effort.  They don't even bother to explain how the rat plague that's the theme of the entire game comes to an end.You could try to Rambo your way through, but the guards come in numbers and have pistols that take a great deal of health from you.  The lethal options are very standard FPS stuff anyway.While the graphics are solid and bugs are almost nonexistent (the occasional guard getting stuck to something), this just isn't a very fun game and you don't have the freedom to choose your own play style as had been suggested.  By the last few stages I didn't really want to play it anymore but decided I might as well finish.  This is bargain bin at best.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2012"}

See now you can skip my review...","reviewText":"Well I'd been holding back from buying CoD4:MW for a while. As I'm sure you have read it has a really short SP, but I caved recently and wow am I both impressed and disappointed.Single Player. Yes it IS a short campaign. Much shorter than say GR:AW 1 and considerably shorter than GoW. Several extra SP cardinal sins are going on here too though - on replay you have to endure the cut scenes/voice overs including very extended scenes where your only input is camera movements and I'm talking many minutes. I found myself mashing the A button, the start the back the X and so on, and that was merely on the second run though. I'd say 15% of the SP campaign is unskippable cut scenes. Factor that in when calculating the total SP play time you get.There are several other pet hates here too - aside from the exact linear levels, there's many of them which are \"Get to position X in five minutes, then get to position Y in two minutes, now on to Z\" Each with decreasing time to get to the position. I HATE this form of tension creating in games. But to add to it are the never-ending spawning bad guys. You end up running like an idiot rather than killing anyone. I mean they are unlimited in their number so why bother killing them?There are MANY levels like this. Get to the roof. Oops it took two seconds too long so start again. Oh no you died because you didn't expect the same enemy in the same place over and over again. In the end you feel like you're playing a graphically amazing version of Dragon's Lair.Speaking of graphics, they dart from photorealistic to shoddy and crude. This is apparent in daylight levels where the low-rez textures out number the next gen look. Why?So I guess after completing the SP campaign on the same night I moved onto MULTIPLAYER. And boy what a pile of nonsense that is.Firstly, CoD:MW employees a unique MP - almost RPG in its nature. You will get owned when you first join a game. Death after death. Why? Because you have to earn your health, your weapons, your extras and your skills.Your newbieness is instantly announced upon entry to the game merely by your rank. Your more experienced opponents can shoot through walls, call in air-support, place trip mines, use a sniper rifle (yes such weapons are not for peons like newbies like us), and so on. Each MP game rewards you with XP and eventually you get a different class to choose from.I've never felt more out numbered in a free for all match in my life. As if not knowing the level, the weapons, the flow, the tactics was bad enough, well imagine that then imagine that on top you have the other folks who can totally destroy you instantly the moment you move.I felt MP in this game was a waste of time.All in all a short SP game with a horribly elitist MP makes this a rental at best.

{"product_name":"B000ZKA0J6","description":"","reviewerName":"Genryu","summary":"Solid game on its own, but just doesn't have the same magic for me as the original","reviewText":"OverallStarcraft 2 is a pretty solid game on it's own right. It's got everything you'd expect from one of the best in real-time-strategy: a wide range of unit types, interesting and expansive map designs, and fast-paced strategy action. It's done a lot to keep things more modern beyond just the step up in the graphics department, by throwing in new unique character abilities and units that are really well tuned to specific strategies and scenarios over others. As far as balance goes between the 3 main races, I think it's still there but the Zerg just feel a bit too powerful at times with the sheer number of units they can get out onto the field.Single-PlayerThe single-player campaign is engaging enough, and encourages you to explore the maps and complete optional objectives by giving you bonus points to spend on unique campaign-based upgrade trees. Some of these upgrades are quite useful and for me at least changed my strategies as I played through the campaign. It's got a solid story and I'm sure more will be revealed with heart of the swarm in 2013. You can also walk around and explore your ship, talk to characters, and get to know everyone onboard. There are still the surprises and twists and turns, and it does a nice job tying back to previous events for fans of the series. I recommend reading a wiki or playing the original if you're a newbie and want to learn about the story of starcraft thus far.MultiplayerIf you're new to Starcraft, prepare to probably lose a good number of times before you start getting the hang of things. While Blizzard does a good job in matching players to appropriately skilled opponents, this doesn't always work out as well as you'd think and can lead to some frustration early on if you're taking on seasoned veterans. If you're going to play with friends like in the old day then you should be just fine. There is that whole lack of LAN support which is definitely a big bummer though. Still, I expect for most people today battle.net will be more than enough.NegativesOn paper and looking at each individual aspect of Starcraft 2 it's a great game. But when I just step back and think about how much I enjoyed the game...it just wasn't as enjoyable as the original starcraft. There's a reason a lot of people still play the original starcraft, because it has such a great balance of gampeplay that just hasn't seemed to carry over. I remember wanting to play another match just after the previous one ended back in Starcraft 1's heyday. With starcraft 2, after finishing up the story and playing some multiplayer games I've thrown it completely on the backburner and left it untouched since with no intention of going back anytime soon.ConclusionIf you're looking for the same feeling you had playing the original starcraft, I'm sorry it's just not there for me at least. If you're someone looking for a solid RTS to get lost in for a while and are a fan of the original (or not) then Starcraft 2 will suit you just fine.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Jonathan","summary":"Minor tweaks, but the same idea","reviewText":"Basically, if you liked Halo, you will like its sequel. Here's a rundown of the new pros and cons:Pro: You can now use some weapons two at a time, allowing for more raw firepower.Con: The shield/health system that worked well in Halo has been scrapped for a harder-to-interpret, seemingly easier to defeat system.Pro: Graphics are better.Con: The ending is a total gyp (no spoiler here, but if you really want closure you'll have to buy a 360 and play Halo 3).Pro: More weapons, and improvements on existing ones (the needler especially).Con: I found a few rare, intermittent glitches, mostly with the Arbiter levels.Pro: Multiplayer is vastly improved, now with XBox live.Con: While the levels are more varied, they don't stand out as much as some of the memorable levels from its predecessor.Pro: The plot is much deeper.So, all in all, it's more of the same, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. There are some minor improvements, but there are a few things that could have been better. A good buy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2008"}

{"product_name":"B007TYC8MI","description":"","reviewerName":"Sky","summary":"I Did the Monster Mash","reviewText":"Sitting down to play God of War Ascension was like getting back on a bike after 3 years of not having ridden one...it was pretty natural: Hold this button down and mash/combo with that one; hold another button down and mash/combo with the other one; QTE triangle/circle/X/square when it appears on the screen; solve a puzzle every now and then. A very simple, yet effective and addictively fun formula.I actually got GoW Ascension on release day, but I never opened it until a couple of weeks before writing this review. So I'll try to keep the rest of this short as I'm way late to the review party for this game. Basically, if you like the previous GoW games, get this! You'll have a lot of fun.The story is a prequel to the previous GoW games and a bit more discombobulated than its predecessors. But discombobulated story aside, you know what to expect if you've played any of the previous GoW games: A narrative or cinematic cutscene followed by a trek, climb or swim through an area where you eventually platform to face a puzzle, a wave of monsters to mash with, or a boss.After playing so many 'next gen' 3rd person games released for the PS3 (like the Uncharteds, the Batmans and the Dead Spaces), I was looking for God of War Ascension to finally upgrade the controls to be able to look around at the scenery and my surroundings with the R stick while walking and moving around from room to room and during battles. But just like God of War III and the older PS2 games the R stick is for rolling and evading enemies, which is kind of a negative if I had to come up with one.I did play the Multiplayer demo before the game release, and it was pretty fun. But by the time I got around to opening the game so long after its release, I was so rusty and \"un-upgraded\" that I didn't stand a chance in the Multiplayer areana.Other than one particularly perplexing puzzle and an annoyingly long, 3-wave battle that had no checkpoints between waves, this is a tremendously fun game.

If you think about it, it took all of us banning together (U.S., Russia, Britain, etc...) to defeat the Germans? That's scary!Not to say I am for the Nazi's and not the Allies but in a game it should not matter to much really, it only counts in real life.I always wanted to play as the Germans in Call of Duty.

This game has a serious story with plenty of characters introduced throughout the story.  I begin to feel for vergil near the end of the story, but alas we already know his fate from DMC 1.2.  The game is quite challenging.  In fact I died a lot in this game.  Not as quite as much in Ninja Gaiden 2, but a lot lol.3.  This game sports one of my favorite boss fights, and that was against vergil.  The passion and carnage leading up to this fight made it even better.Cons1.  There is not much that deride this game other than the repetition of slinging a sword.  The fighting gets boring at times, but that about it for me at least.Overall this is a great game.

If you had no other real life responsibilities you would literally waste away on your couch as the world of Skyrim enraptures you and won't let you go.  Ok I'm exaggerating but seriously, this is the greatest RPG I have ever played.  Morrowind used to wear the crown, then it was passed to Oblivion, now Skyrim is the king, and it's even better with the expansion packs - in Dawnguard you deal with a new vampire threat, in Dragonborn you are pitted against your predecessor, another dragonborn - plus you gain the ability to tame dragons and ride them (which sounds really cool but suffers a bit in the execution) - and maybe coolest of all is the Hearthfire expansion in which you can buy a plot of land, gather materials and build your own house.  It didn't sound that impressive to me, but once you start with the main room, then start adding on different rooms, towers, kitchens, halls, greenhouse, barn, etc..  and add furniture, fixtures, workbenches and the like - it's seriously addicting, plus it gives you a safe place to hoard all the stuff you collect during the game.  Even patched there are stll glitches in the game, but it boggles my mind to try and comprehend the amount of work it would take to create a game this immense and diverse.  A few bugs are forgivable - even expected - in my opinion.  I've finished all the main quests, now I'm working to complete all side quests and explore all there is to be explored.

He has all sorts of different ways to defeat opponents. His healing factor is way cool. Fights last quite a while, and multiple attack methods are needed to win the day. It also has one of the best Boss Battles I have ever fought! I won't spoil things, except that it is an early in the game fight. There is a little platforming, but nothing under pressure. (It took me a while to learn double jump - double 'X' button - and until then I was hurting! I am not much at platforming games.)

The gameplay controls have pretty much stayed the same as from AC:2-3 so there isn't too much to relearn on moves and abilities so no worries about learning new button controls and the like.The graphics are amazing from the jungle exploration to the town exploration and ship battles and sailing with a nice touch of sailing songs along the way as you sail from place to place.Your character is also somewhat different then the previous assassins of the games and actually seems more human in that way without the need for revenge or some calling from an ancient order and such.Some have asked is the game worth getting right away? I have to say and I know it's annoying that it's up to the gamer. If you liked the gameplay and story of AC3 then you'll probably have more fun on this game to another gamer who preferred the style of AC1-Revelations.

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both? The choice is yours ininfamous.caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Everyman turned superhero Cole.View larger.Devastating electricity-based powers.View larger.Go anywhere open-world design.View larger.An organic urban environment.View larger.StoryEmpire City was a run of the mill metropolis, until one day a massive explosion rips through six square blocks of its bustling downtown real-estate, seemingly leveling everything and everyone in its path. Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

Even normal mode doesn't pose too much of a challenge. But there is no way that random button mashing will get you thru the Titan and Chaos difficulty levels. Not only will you need to learn how to effectively block, dodge, and parry, but you will need to discover which weapons and what kind of attacks are most effective against your various enemies.So if you are looking for deep combat gameplay, skip the easy and normal levels and go straight for the higher difficulties.MORALS: As it has been redundantly pointed out, this is a brutal game. Kratos not only kills his enemies in gory fashions, but he also kills innocent people who get in his way. Gamers who are easily offended by this should steer clear since GoW3 is a much stronger M-rated game than, say, Halo games. Personally, I love games with action and violence, and since I don't get my morals from video games, the brutal images from GoW3 don't bother me. It's actually kind of fun playing as a bad guy from time to time.STORY: Not much here. Just Kratos throwing a tantrum while yelling bunch of blah blah revenge this and that. He's out to finish off Zeus along with the remaining gods. Oh, and the Titans piss him off too; namely his previous ally, Gaia. The story was much stronger in GoW 1 & 2. But that's no big deal to me. They could've had Kratos going on a rampage to save his pet poodle for all I care; whatever it takes to get me into action.God of War is one of my favorite series, and God of War 3 does not disappoint. Don't let the 1-star button mashers fool you; The challenge is certainly there. For those who dare to go beyond the easy and normal levels, it requires reflexes, strategy, and overall skill. The graphics are sumptuous and gameplay is entertaining. This game belongs in the library of every elite gamer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2012"}

I deducted one star from my review because the audio crackles randomly during certain points of all three Half-Life installments.  The fact there is no trophy support for this collection also is worthy of a full star deduction in itself (and there are no plans for trophy support from PSN in the near and distant future....a real pity, if you ask me).As for Team Fortress, I never bothered to play it because I'm not a multiplayer type of guy at all.

With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists. The only hope of the colonists seems to be a vault discovered in the side of a mountainside, rumored to contain alien technology and secrets about Pandora. Will this discovery be the colonist's salvation or their end? Discover their fate inBorderlands.GameplayAs in a traditional RPG,Borderlandsis built around the continual leveling of characters as they delve into quests.

I'm lucky enough that i get all my games offline. I downloaded this from steam and had no problems with multi-player nor single player, because i like first person shooters on my gaming rig more so then consoles. In which i like for Platforming games etc. So onto Borderlands, 2k is definitely a champ for FPS games, i remember when Prey came out, lots of people knocked it but i loved it, still play it today, also both Bioshocks among other titles are great. So Borderlands is no less fun, its not quite as action packed as say Bioshock, but its not a bilinear in it's gameplay, you have a lot more area to roam, and the game just looks awesome. I crank it up to full 1080p on my PC and the game looks like you are basically watching a cartoon, its more of the comic book style graphics which aren't real common these days, but i for one think it rocks. The little robot, Cadad or whatever his name is, is quite a funny lil robot, he helps you all along the way with things and isn't as annoying as he is funny.You go through various warm up missions in the beginning then get right into the more intense stuff later on, so the learning curve may be about 20 minutes or so. That being said there are a few flaws in the controls, aiming down an enemy(other than the sniper rifle) i don't like because you have a gigantic aiming sight that just turns red when over an enemy and its to big to really be accurate and know whether or not your hitting them. So what i do is just run up and shoot them in the head, plain and simple. I accidently started out on Normal, and wanted to try easy being that i had never played the game before, so its a bit tough, health wise. There are many places to search for items, mostly a lot of money and health is what you pick up, and purchase other items at certain store locations. It reminds you of the basic 2K gameplay, Bioshock more than anything, which tends to have a little TO MUCH of items to pick up. But thats fine, at least there's no lack there of. So this game is fun, and for any Post Apocalyptic fans out there this will suit you fine. Its not as in depth as say Fallout 3, or as realistic but its still fun, some of the dialogue is cheesy and the AI isn't always as intelligent as you like, or maybe u do. I haven't gotten to the vehicles yet, as i said i'm just starting, but i'm sure everything else in the game is a blast. I'm not much of an online gamer mainly because i'm 35 and get tired of the little teeny kids getting all P'O'ed and on my nerves, so that doesnt bother me, even though i havent played this online. Call of Duty Modern Warfare is still the best for Online.So this is a very good game, with great graphics, not much of a story, descent controls(excluding aiming), and its just well different, violent fun. With a sense of humor. Reminds you of a cartoonish less dark Book Of Eli. So if your not into PC games just get it for Xbox 360, i saw my cousin play it on his PS3 and the graphics were very discolored, and the frame rates very laggy. So go for the 360, also there are more people online, i've been told, if thats your thing. It won't win any awards for originality but its sure one heck of a cool fun game. I would like to also see more comic book looking graphics like these, they are a blast.Btw-When playing PC games, download them, DRM free. Gamersgate.com Direct2drive.com...or Steam. I've had 0 trouble. As i said.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2010"}

You play as Jade, an &quot;action reporter&quot; who becomes embroiled in a plot to expose a government conspiracy. The &quot;Alpha Sections&quot; are nominally your planet Hyllis' defense force, but you find that they seem to show up conveniently just after the invaders, the DomZ, attack. You're not the only one who finds this fishy, and in the process of trying to figure out what's going on.The plot is relatively straightfoward - you find a secretive group who's working to uncover the government conspiracy, and you face some obstacles and hurdles along the way. There's some stealth, there's some puzzle solving, some item fetching, and some combat. All the standard adventure ingredients are there. But that's not all there is. You drive around in your hovercraft, which you can also enter in races, and you can take photos of the local flora and fauna. You'll also use your camera to photograph the evidence of the conspiracy at hand.All that adventure-y goodness is wrapped up in a beautiful, and interesting package. Though the &quot;Jade Engine&quot; which BG&amp;E is built upon isn't going to change the world, it is powerful enough to make BG&amp;E a graphically stunning game. The environments are an interesting blend of Jeunet and Miyazaki, and the fact that Michel Ancel also created Rayman isn't lost on the design aesthetic. On top of the beautiful and imaginitive environments, the supporting cast is one of the most interesting aspects of the game.Your uncle, an anthromorphic pig named Pey'j, is a cantankerous old mechanic, whose affection for Jade really shows through his cranky exterior. Jade has some really novel casual interactions with the patrons of the local bar, from a humanoid shark man who plays a variant of air hockey, to the bartender, who's an eight foot tall cow-man. The casual way she talks to these otherworldly creatures (the shark-man is named &quot;Francis&quot;) gives the game a sort of supernatural familiarity that is unlike most games.Beyond Good and Evil is really the game that's made me really consider Ubisoft both a powerhouse of game development, and a studio that's willing to take some pretty risky moves in order to move the medium forward. Just as Sega did, when they were publishing games for the Dreamcast, Ubisoft seems to be making a wide variety of really interesting, and unfortunately overlooked games. BG&amp;E, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, and XIII all tried new, and interesting things. Couple that with bestsellers like Rainbow Six 3, and the Ghost Recon series, and it's hard to argue that Ubisoft doesn't possess a stellar lineup for the discerning gamer. Though not all of their games are excellent (the multiplayer in R6-3 is broken, and XIII, though visually interesting, plays to its weaknesses by including far too much stealth), they're trying new things, and have been hitting quite a few completely out of the park. Prince of Persia is hands down my favorite game of last year, and BG&amp;E looks to be of similar quality.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2004"}

You will encounter many bugs, crashes, and some off character rigging throughout the game (something that should have been remedied in the `enhanced' edition if not by subsequent patches).  I was also disappointed to find that the game is not as free roaming as other games of its genre (most notably `Oblivion').  The game comes with a map which covers all the lands within the novels, but unfortunately, the player is only allowed to see a small fraction of the area surrounding the single kingdom of Vizima.Nevertheless, with all the side missions included, the game will keep you occupied for many tens of hours.  And though I complain about how little of the world you will actually get to explore, the environments that you will get to see are beautifully rendered.  The NPCs and Player Character have plenty of rich detail and back-story and actually feel more `alive' than in many other games of this genre.  The soundtrack is masterfully done, adding to the ambience of the game.Overall, bugs and clitches aside, definitely pick this game up if you love a good R-rated fantasy.  I also recommend picking up \"The Last Wish\" and \"Blood of Elves\": two novels by Andrzej Sapkowski upon which the game is based.  They're both a fun, quick read and will help you understand the characters in the game since most of them are taken directly from the books.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003O6JIVE","reviewerName":"Adrian Jenkins \"southerndudeman\"","summary":"Much like the Be Sharps...","reviewText":"...this game starts off pretty clever, but becomes less clever as time progresses. After getting over my initial prejudice against this game (which included a test buy that was returned in a day), I decided to get down to the business of actually playing this game. At first, I was very pleased with the effort. Although I still stand by the conspiracy theory that this is really the third Chrono Trigger game with an (unconvincing) FF XIII skin, I still enjoyed the changes from FF XIII. Indeed, many of my biggest complaints were answered. However, as the game wore on, the plot became cloying, the graphics offended (particular Academia 500, which has so much color that it just looks disgusting), and the play began to tire. But anyway:THE GOOD:The map situation: I could not believe how bad the map was in FFXIII. Who in the world turns their map every time he turns his body, so that he is always facing north? It was one of the most confusing maps I have ever seen in a video game (and this included the unreadable 3-D maps from Valkyrie Profile). Thankfully, sanity has returned - maps are always situated with N at the top of the screen (and if you are that one person who turns his map constantly, don't ever give me directions, and look in the options menu, since you can set the map to do this as well).Monster hunting: One of the joys of this game is monster hunting and raising. Sure, it's only a skeletal system, with little in the way of improvement or evolution. But I really enjoyed raising my Blue Chocobo, or Gigantuar, or  Chocobo, or Tonberry, or most any other monster in the game (the Cie'th are left out, but I didn't really care, since they have by far the worst design of any monster in the game).Chocobo Racing: My second joy in this game. Although not nearly as fun as the chocobo racing of FF VII (where you actually did the racing), I really enjoyed putting my Gold Chocobo through all of the events (and there are a ton of them), winning tons of prizes which ranged from humdrum to slightly-less-than-fantastic. It was certainly better than the slot machine game, which might be the worst slot machine game I've seen in any video game, ever.Story concept: Although the execution is horrible, the concept is good. Time travel should be incorporated in more JRPGs. With the amount of ridiculous science we see in these games, why not? It's not like Square is any stranger to time travel - besides Chrono Trigger, we saw it in FF VIII, as well as the published games Valkyrie Profile and its sequel. It's completely riddled with holes here, but the idea is fun enough.THE BAD:Tone: The single biggest problem with this game is rather abstract. I was no fan of FF XIII. I thought the storyline was laughably stupid, both in its absurd concept as well as its simplistic structure. For the most part, I thought the characters were a laugh riot (the one exception, Sazh, is ruined in this game, but I'll get to that). However, despite all of this, the developers certainly attempted to develop a particular tone of isolation and dogged self-determination. For example, Gran Pulse was mostly an uninhabited world, populated instead by massive creatures that were so sure in their superiority, they didn't even bother to look at you when you passed.This game doesn't even try to build on this in any real way. Lightning the loner soldier? Well, now she's a goddess. Why? Who cares! It pushes our plot forward, so let's run with it! Remember how much Sazh cared about his young child? Well, now our great parent decides to...take his child with him on a dangerous final mission 500 years in the future, rather than leaving him behind to live a relatively peaceful childhood. Why? Of course, you want to see your favorites, so that kid needs to be there at the end! Remember those evil Fal'Cie like Barthandolus, Titan, and Orphan? No? Well, neither do the developers, apparently - they are never mentioned in any meaningful way (I don't think Titan is even mentioned a single time, despite the fact that you now have colonies on Pulse).The fact is, nothing really works in this game when its considered a sequel to FF XIII. It really has nothing to do with the original, other than character skins - the characters don't even behave remotely close to their original counterparts.Missions: After a lot of complaint, Square decided to add missions to this game. These missions are some of the most boring missions you'll ever encounter.  The only enjoyment really comes in wondering how stupid our protagonists are in taking these missions. Allow me to explain: the first mission you encounter (which is similar to around 75% of the remaining missions) has your party searching for some medical supplies. Do you discuss a reward? No way - why try to make this realistic? When you find the supplies (which were conveniently hidden in a christmas box), the benefactor offers you...some weird rock she found. Now, as it turns out, this rock has some value (at least for the game, although the value to the party is dubious right until the end), but have you ever had an interaction like this? Amazingly, as it turns out, EVERY MISSION IN THE GAME OFFERS YOU ONE OF THESE \"WEIRD ROCKS\". Every. Single. One. Missions mostly come in two varieties - find a randomly hidden item (some so randomly hidden that I dare you to try to find them without a detailed guide), or beat a monster (these are more fun, but I only remember around 5-10 of these missions in the whole game). There are a few off-the-path missions (quiz games, which are impossible, and winning coins on the slot machine, which takes hours), but that's it, for the non-story missions. It gets really old. And those \"weird rocks\"? I didn't even know what they did until the very end of the game, when I was randomly prompted to visit someone.Postgame: This has to be the LAMEST postgame I've ever seen in an RPG that supposedly had one. The entire game took me 67 hours from beginning to platinum finish. It took around 25 hours for the main story (pretty sad - this is about half a game), 9 hours to win casino coins from a slot machine (letting the game play overnight), and the rest hunting down monsters in the bestiary. I wasn't particularly efficient - I wanted to build up some extra monsters, and do some chocobo races (both of which are pretty much unnecessary for anything), and I was still able to find every rare monster, complete every mission, find every fragment (160 in total), find every alternate ending (which I can't really list as good or bad, since the endings are mostly throwaway), and beat every super monster (only the last one, Raspatil, is even remotely difficult). That's OK for a twenty dollar game, but I feel for the suckers who paid full price for this (particularly since that price was cut in half in under three months).In the end, I feel like this game needs significantly more development. Another year, and this could have been a tour-de-force, even with the unconvincing FF XIII connection.

{"product_name":"B008CP6RUW","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"The Definitive Way to Experience Uncharted 3","reviewText":"In 2011, Uncharted 3 hit the ground running and quickly became one of the most well received games in the Playstation 3's library.  This is an impressive feat considering the game was the sequel to.  Uncharted 3 manage to live up to much of the hype which surrounded it and continues to be a popular treat.  As with most games that do well in the market as well as with the fans, Uncharted 3 was given a game of the year edition.  For those who've yet to experience Uncharted 3 this is most definitely the edition you'll want to buy.  The original game can still be find for a cheap price, but you'll wind up having to pay a lot of extra money for all the DLC.  If you don't really care much for the DLC then there's no real reason not to buy the original game.  This review is for those who have not played Uncharted 3 as well as for those who have so it's a rather long one.Uncharted 3 is a much more character driven story than the previous two.  The game focuses pretty strongly on Nate's relationship with Sully and just how far back it goes.  This time Nathan is looking for the Atlantis of the Sands.  Apparently Francis Drake found something, and Nathan Drake wants in on the action.  Of course he's not the only one after it.  A secret agency headed by a woman named Marlowe is also searching for Francis Drake's secret and they'll stop it nothing to get it.  In order for Nate to survive this one he's going to have to use all his cunning and wit, as well as face some of his biggest fears to date.  The story is actually pretty simple.  And while there are some nice twists and turns, what really makes it good are the characters withing it.  It's a character driven story through and through.The Uncharted series is pretty well known for it's good characters, sharp writing and easy to follow narrative.  This is perhaps the most true in the third game.  The characters here have an established narrative that the game is willing to fill you in on, but one does not need to play Uncharted: Drake's Fortune or Uncharted 2: Among Thieves to really understand the game in and of itself.  The characters introduced have such natural exchanges with one another that even if this is your first outing with Nate and his allies you'll grow to like them and know them without having played the previous games.  Uncharted simply doesn't slouch on the character development.  Even when simply walking around the characters carry on with jokes, conversation and banter.  It really makes for an enjoyable experience.The movie like quality is what helps the game along.  Uncharted isn't known for being a non-linear experience.  Players will always know where to go next and there isn't much off the beaten path.  There are treasures to find, but they're usually not too far out of the way.  On the other hand, Uncharted never makes you backtrack, always carefully guiding the player through its scripted sequences.  Normally this might be a deterrent for a game, but with so much focus on story and narrative, it helps keep the story pacing at a decent speed without getting too distracted from it.  Most of the gameplay segments are easily divided into three types of moments.  First there are the platforming elements which usually involve Drake scaling walls and jumping from hanging ledge to another to reach a destination.  The second are the puzzles he'll have to solve to progress further in the areas he's exploring and the last is the gunplay.  Because the game alternates so well between all these elements you'll rarely feel like you're being bogged down for too long.  After a long gunfight, for instance, the game slows down a little from the action by giving you some platforming to do or a puzzle to solve so that you can have a respite from the gunplay.  Likewise the story is pretty good at keeping things in focus.  The puzzles don't feel like they're just there to keep you busy, but because they actually add something to the story, while the platforming is worked in elegantly that it feels natural.The gunfights, however, can be some of the most challenging Uncharted has thrown out yet.  There are moments where enemies are all over the place and it's your job to take them out.  Much like the previous two games, Uncharted 3 isn't always easy.  You may find yourself dying in some gunfights either because you feel overwhelmed or simply can't find cover in time.  It's also not unusual for someone to come sneaking up behind you and blasting you away because you were focused on other enemies.  The good news is that checkpoints in Uncharted 3 are plentiful.  If you screw up a platforming section or bite the dust in a fire fight you're usually not too far away from where you died.Arguably, there isn't much Uncharted 3 needs to build upon from Uncharted 2.  The second one was such a huge step above the first that it didn't leave much of anything for the third to improve upon.  There also aren't enormous changes to gameplay.  A few things have been added in.  The melee combat has been improved a great deal and is now more fun than ever.  You can also pick up and toss back grenades that are thrown at you.  But by far the biggest reward to Uncharted 3's gameplay are its set piece moments.  They are easily some of the best the series as ever had.  In the second game players were treated to moments such as running away from a helicopter across roof tops, fighting a tank and doing battle on a moving train just to name a few of the games better moments.  Uncharted 3 strives for more.  Here you'll find yourself playing set piece moments that have you fighting bad guys as the building around you burns.  There's also a moment in which you'll be fighting on a capsizing cruise ship and it's easily one of the greatest things I've ever experienced in a video game.  These moments are big and epic.  I'd rather not give too much away for people who have yet to play, but Uncharted 3 packs in a lot of adventure in between its narrative, platforming and puzzle solving.  It's a game that adventure enthusiasts simply must experience for themselves.  It's amazing.All that being said, Uncharted 3 is a rather huge game.  The main campaign itself is rather short, but the multiplayer will more than make up for that.  It's enormous, with tons of modes to play and lots of customization options.  The reason I highly recommend the Game of the Year Edition for those who enjoy multiplayer is because it's simply that big.  You've got your typical deathmatch modes where you can be on teams or free for all.  There's also the standard king of the hill type stuff.  But there are also tons of maps that really make it special to play.  In part because the maps themselves are just a playing field but can also be their own experiences.  In one level, for instance, you're on trains jumping from one to the other until they arrive at the train station where the battle will continue.  Another has one team defending a plane while another constantly jumps there until they take off and land on another map.  It's also nice that some of the previous maps from previous games have been brought back.  Some of them look different because Naughty Dog changed the weather... and yes they do feel different as a result.  Some of Uncharted 2's better maps are back and they're just as gorgeous as they ever were.  Likewise, a lot of classic character skins are here as well.  You'll be able to play as your favorite characters from Drake's Fortune or Among Thieves, if you wish.Other aspects about the multiplayer that really add to the experience is that each game isn't afraid to mix things up.  For instance if you're doing team deathmatches the losing team might get random perks to help out such as revealing the winning teams location, or making their shots do more damage.  To also add to the variety you can select perks to take into specific maps that might help you reload faster, or collect more cash upon defeating adversaries.  But it doesn't end there.  In every game you can earn medals that will grant you more cash that you can spend on character skins or accessories to customize your own creation.  The medals aren't just used for that, however.  In every match each individual has kickbacks that act as temporary perks.  For instance getting enough medals might allow you to be granted a sniper rifle for a while, or roam around faster than usual.  You're also given the chance to customize weapons as you see fit and make them more powerful or helpful in other ways.  All this combined with rankings and clans can make multiplayer feel extremely overwhelming at first.  It certainly isn't as simple as Uncharted 2's, but once you get sucked in it can be very difficult to stop playing because it's done so well.  I've yet to experience a lot of connection issues.  Your mileage will vary.  So will your gameplay experiences.  The multiplayer is huge and we haven't even begun to talk about co-op yet.The game excels in the co-op arena as well.  There is a campaign complete with cutscenes.  Although it isn't much for story, it's lengthy enough that it can keep you satisfied with some exciting gunplay.  It's also pretty cool because you'll see some old favorites.  You'll get your brand of perks here as well.  But there is also the arena in which they mix up the rules when playing with friends.  For instance just the arena itself has you fighting ten waves of enemies with things in place.  You might be told to survive one round by killing everyone, and then be subjected to gold rush in the next in which you must escort an idol back to the chest with your team before your killed.  There is also one that insists you kill enemies from within a specific area on a map.  You can play all these modes by mixing and matching in the arena, but you can also opt to play them separately.  Simply put, there's quite a bit to keep you busy with the multiplayer.  And if you decide to take the dive into it then getting the Game of the Year Edition is a must.One of the things the Uncharted series is known for is having some of the most impressive visuals ever in a video game.  Uncharted 3 doesn't disappoint.  Every environment is brimming with detail and life.  The attention to detail is simply amazing.  It's all done so well it's hard not to notice some of the details.  For instance, when Nathan banks off a wall you'll notice he actually pushes himself off.  The animations are absolutely fantastic in part because of how the motion capture is done by the actors who actually provide the voices.  This gives a very human like quality to how the characters move.  Other little bits of detail include how well the environment interacts with the characters.  When Nathan is in the desert for instance it's hard not to be impressed by how naturally the sand flows.  Or looking at the water effects as they hit a ship.  The lighting is also done incredibly well.  Simply put, Uncharted 3 is a technological beast and there aren't that many words that can be used to describe just how much detail was put into the presentation.The voice acting and writing is also as sharp as ever.  The writing is very clever as the exchanges between characters feel very natural.  The voice actors also did the motion control and you can tell that they were disciplined in their work.  The acting is great and the emotions are spot on, not to mention the animations.  It's also hard to ignore the fantastic sound effects and music score.  It all compliments many of the games moments.  The music in each environment compliments the environment.  But the sound effects are also pretty stellar.It's hard to really knock the presentation of a Naughty Dog game because there's so much attention put into it.  However, it is NOT always perfect.  Because of so much put into it, there will be moments in which you may experience a bug or two.  It's usually never anything huge.  Rather it's things like... when you die Nate might clip through a piece of the environment or something like that.  It's usually never going to get you killed but when it happens it's much more noticeable than in other games because of that attention to detail.  As I said, I never died because of this... I always noticed this WHEN I died.  One time Nate's rag doll corpse went through a wall and into obscurity.For those wondering, yes, there are making of featurette that shows you how they did some of things they did.  It's complete with interviews and trivia, as well as showing you some of the things they did to improve the game.  However, there is no New Game+ here.  The previous two games managed to squeeze in some nice perks on subsequent playthroughs such as being able to change your character skin or being able to get infinite ammo in your weapons... or even just flat out select a gun to use--even if it wasn't available.  This was missing from the original Uncharted 3 and hasn't been restored to the game of the year edition.With an unquestionable amount of hype surrounding it, Uncharted 3 managed to somehow live up to just about all of it.  It's a great adventure and the Game of the Year Edition is even better for multiplayer enthusiasts.  There's so much loaded here that it can easily be enjoyed by anyone willing to take some time to play.  If you like adventure games and really enjoy multiplayer then Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is the game for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2012"}

Or is it? Is this game worth the hype that has been on this game since the trailers at E3? I believe it is.This is for FPS fanatics as what Madden is for football fanatics. The reason why I have some trepidation in giving this a full endorsement is although I have played through this for 7 hrs, in single player, Spec Ops and Multiplayer, there is not enough time vested to give it a `full' review yet I feel like I played it enough to know what to expect, so take this as truly a 1st impression and not a full blown review.Story mode:  Still feels the same as any other CoD game especially the last MW game. You are randomly given a character and assigned any given hotspot in the world pointed at a target and you go achieve your goal. That's pretty much it. This is also MW's weakest point in my opinion because the way that the narrative is told it feels like you are dumped onto a set and away you go. Not to say that the set pieces aren't nice but I still would have liked a tighter story setup similar to possibly an older game like GRAW's setup that makes me feel like I am more involved in the story.**SPOILER**Because of the lack of a tight narrative, it took away the impact of the airport level (those of you that played it, know what I am talking about) and how it would make one feel playing that particular role and because it's brief, you don't have time to get into it and feel immersed in that experience. Either a longer portion of this level or another level playing that role woould have fleshed it out and really hit home.Online and Spec OpsHowever, this is not what most people come to MW2 for. They come for the multiplayer and this is where MW excels.  What can I say? Tons of modes, tons of weapons, perks and better maps all designed for the sole purpose of creating arenas of digital death for online players to enjoy. Added to that, when you don't want to play with many people, you have the option of playing the Spec Ops mode in co op mode either split screen or online with a friend. The AI in this mode is no slouch as it can and will adjust to your play style. They won't keep sticking their head out in the exact same spot waiting for you to shoot and they will take advantage of whatever is around you and double up to outflank and kill you and some levels you have to do this and not hit innocent civilians caught in the middle. Every now and again however, I have seen a glitch where the enemy AI will just stay `struck' in one position until you kill them.  The multiplayer hasn't change much in the overall scheme of things, but the structure is still RPG like, the more you play, the more you unlock and the more you are rewarded, and to help draw new people in or people that aren't all that good, there are rewards to be had if you get dominated that will keep lower level players from feeling too frustrated or left out by higher level friends.Control wise, if you have played one, then you have played them all and this is a no brainer. It's as intuitive and responsive as ever and no sense in making any radical changes. I do however wish and I have stated this is past iterations, that it would be nice to see possibly some kind of cover system instituted into the MW series. But I guess some fans would say, if you want tactical shooting, go play a Tom Clancy game or GoW. But hey, I am just one person.So all in all, MW2 gets a strong 8 for such a good focus on seriously supporting and augmenting the multiplayer aspect of the game especially the co op part (which can take a lot longer than the main story) but it falls a bit short on telling the story.  With so many games that they have done on the current gen systems, I really think that by now, it could have been fleshed out a lot more and made to be just as enjoyable and immersive as the multiplayer side.  The graphics are as great as ever, the set pieces are fantastic (wait til you see Northern VA for those of you that are from around these parts...) voice acting is always top notch, (Keith David anyone?) and the action is non stop as ever.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2009"}

After some harrowing firefights and a quick airborne escape, both you and he probably assume that the good guys will be able to wipe out the terrorists and save the day. Not quite. Instead, your helicopter nosedives, and your poor marine is suddenly left crawling on the ground as a nuclear weapon is detonated nearby.This and other provocative images helped define the original Modern Warfare experience, and they're back in full force in its blockbuster sequel, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Odds are that you've already heard about the horrific \"No Russian\" airport sequence, and I don't wish to dwell on it. It remains difficult to sit through even when you know what's coming, but it's hardly the only memorable imagery contained in the short but brutal campaign. This virtual world war takes you to war-torn Afghanistan and our nation's capital, and you're often required to watch through the eyes of endangered soldiers. So with all of these stirring and occasionally disturbing sequences, why exactly did I feel so empty when the credits started to roll?After four main contributions to the Call of Duty franchise, Infinity Ward has perfected the first-person action sequence. You'll scale icy mountain ranges, speed down the same mountain on a ski mobile, fall to your near-death a half dozen times and - inexplicably - rescue hostages by taking out their captors in \"bullet-time.\" Though I still prefer Halo's guns/melee/grenade trinity, Modern Warfare 2 has its sci-fi peer beat in terms of sheer excitement. The game's variety of settings and set pieces result in a game that's more fun to play than its acclaimed predecessor too.But like a bloated summer movie - I'd go with Terminator: Salvation, but any dumb flick will do - it's all style without narrative substance. Maybe Infinity Ward's trying to \"say something\" about the realities of war, but I'm straining to remember anything besides impressive pyrotechnics.I'm sure that civilians would evacuate in times of global conflict, but the levels in Modern Warfare 2 still feel lifeless. Running around through a burned-out Washington D.C. should rile up the blood or at least make me feel a little uneasy, but the empty suburbs and nearby monuments are too sterile. There are exceptions, but the game never struck me as an honest portrayal of war, which I'm pretty sure was what Infinity War was trying to do.They also need to figure out how to bring actual characters into the game. Sure, these guys have names. Soap, Price, Makarov...I know who they are and sometimes what their goals are. But because so much of the story is told through radio chatter and loading screen briefings, there's never any emotional attachment. Now, your mileage may vary on this point. I thought that the cast of the previous game was paper-thin and would feel right at home in a recent Tom Clancy novel. I know plenty of folks who disagreed with me then, and will disagree now. I would love for someone to explain to me what I'm missing.Luckily, in the new cooperative mode, you'll find yourself actually caring about your brother in arms because he's controlled by a fellow human being. There's something quite stirring about carrying a wounded friend out of harm's way with bullets Swiss-cheesing your cover. So much so that I wish the campaign had allowed buddies to team up to hunt down Makarov together.It's in this mode that differing perspectives take on significance. For instance, there's one mission in which a human pilot handles the AC130 gunship from the first Modern Warfare, while the other player is pursued by enemies in a fenced off field. While the first AC130 appearance was positively chilling thanks to the unflinching voice over work, you now effectively become the \"older brother.\" For the guy on the ground, the gunship becomes god-like, raining down destruction from the heavens. It's a unique dynamic that hasn't been explored much before in other shooters, and a welcome change of pace.Other scenarios include a sniper hunt through the snowy woods, a helicopter patrol through a D.C. suburb and a jog across a terrorist-filled suspension bridge. Though some are more familiar than others, all of them require communication between players. If both of you decide to aim for the patrolman on the left and leave the right one standing, the flesh-tearing attack dogs are sure to follow. And while there is an indicator to direct you to your fallen comrade, you'll need to keep talking if you want to keep track of each other in the chaos.And if chaos is your thing, you'll want to dive into multiplayer immediately. With or without the Javelin cheaters, you're never safe for too long. Enemy helicopters, UAVs, turrets and other perks ensure that you'll take your fair share of bullets. But no matter how frustrating multiplayer can be - I die a lot - the leveling system always brings me back.You're rewarded for doing everything. Do you die constantly? Well, at least you can steal your killer's class and earn some end-of-round experience as consolations. Do you find yourself constantly running from tough fights? Equip the Marathon skill and use that footwork to build towards something. The constant upgrades encourage endless experimentation, whether you're a pro or a private (like me).So do I have fun whenever I boot up Modern Warfare 2? Absolutely! The online stuff has even more hooks than the first game, and the moment-to-moment gun-play of the campaign is always intense. But in the end, they are just moments, explosive vignettes that never feel cohesive. If Infinity Ward can figure out how to make me care about these soldiers in their next game, then they will have a masterpiece on their hands. But Modern Warfare 2 is the video game equivalent of a flashbang - it leaves your senses overwhelmed for a little while, but it's never able to make the kill.--Reviewed by Justin Hemenway","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2009"}

I like the concept of the games, but I just don't like the games. RE 2 and every game after it was just too boring. Code Veronica for Dreamcast was the best of the lot in my opinion, so that upped my memories of the games a little bit. Sadly, upon playing RE for the Gamecube, all the truth about this series came flooding back. I rented it for five days, played it for two.First off, this game just isn't scary anymore. RE2 could creep me out like nothing since the original Alone in the Dark. This game however, just feels so \"been there, done that.\". The first zombie I met I tried to shoot and kill, big mistake. Surprise, it killed me despite being pumped with several rounds from my handgun. So, annoyed, I restarted. This time I ran&#65533; and that worked. After reading up in some walkthroughs, I found out that you spend the vast majority of your time doing just that, running. \"Survival Horror\". I was depressed. None the less, I figured I'd give it a try. For two days I ran from everything in sight. I tried not to chuckle at the \"horror\" of it all, and kept running. Even when I finally got the firepower to fight back a little, the game had lost appeal. And of course I use the word \"firepower\" very lightly, ammo is rarer than gold in just about any RE game out there, and of course you'll never get a useful unlimited hand to hand fighting tool except for your worthless survival knife. Why can't your character effectively shoot them in the head? Just give me some dang weapons and the ability to use them!I really can't see why anyone would enjoy a game of this type. I can't see the appeal to anyone but the most casual gamer or hardcore horror fan. My advice, avoid this one completely. If you're a big RE fan, rent it. But don't buy it without trying it first or you may regret it.- Rirath_com","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2003"}

{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"M.

Saying that though, I did get Rock Band and The Beatles: Rock Band and enjoyed them both for the drums and mic. With that said, DJ Hero hit me with the music that I love and if you like this music than you will be satisfied. It has so many great mixes worth their own soundtrack and there is so many.When I started, I expected something not so elaborate. There is many things you can do from simple scratches that range from a quick scatch to long scratches to the fader needing to be shifted left to right while doing scatches and hitting the beats via the color coordinated button. It isn't all that hard to do. I was breezing through at a steady pace on medium. its very enjoyable and fun to do. There isn't a lot of freedom for you to freestyle but there is little segaments that allow you to rewind when you want to gain more points if you do well and the ability to change the tone of the sound during certain moments.The game does a great job with the visuals. They really catch the mood of the game with great special effects and a constant revolving camera and lights that blister the atmosphere that gives a great party atmosphere by showing off the DJ and everyone dancing.One thing is pretty cool is the option for a guitar to be used during the playtime. Someone can actually play as the DJ while the other uses a Guitar. There has been a lot implemented in the game. You can challenge others online and you can even make your own track list of songs to play. It is a fun game and if your into this music or like music games that I highly recommend it.

{"product_name":"B003IEBO9Q","description":"","reviewerName":"DryvBy","summary":"Wait for the Ultimate edition","reviewText":"**WAIT FOR THE ULTIMATE EDITION WHICH IS HERE:Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3The new heroes are here to kick butt and take names, and after a decade of wondering if this game would ever come into being, Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is finally here. If you've never played the series before, let me just inform you this is not your typical fighting game. This is more of an action fighting game, in the sense that the first few matches are going to be chaotic looking. There's characters popping in and out of the screen. There's combos popping up all over the screen. Before you know it, you're dead without even getting a hit in. But with much practice comes great benefits.Your first choices in the game will be to take it offline in arcade mode or training, or take a chance in online battles via ranked or player matches. Offline modes are limited to arcade, training, versus, and a mission mode. Arcade is just the basic story mode. You'll pick three characters to battle, all with different abilities to battle round after round until you defeat a special boss. When you beat the final boss, you'll unlock a comic strip ending for the character that you were last using. You'll also unlock some badges and titles for your win to show off online. If you're having a difficult time learning moves, training mode is there to help. However, mission mode is going to be more helpful in teaching you how to successfully complete moves. Mission mode is more reminiscent of the challenge modes in Super Street Fighter IV. You have a training dummy in front of you, and you're mission is to provide a certain attack to it.Online modes are limited to ranked and player matches. I don't really find this to be a bad thing, but it's apparent some people wanted more modes. You can party up online much like a \"quarter mode\", which is great, and it's also the downfall of online play. While you're the observer, you never get to watch the battle. You're treated to two player cards of the fighters with the health bars moving up and down during their match. But you'll never get to see the moves they're pulling off, making tournaments seem almost pointless. There's also no replay feature, so watching some of the cool moves you distributed to a player is long gone. Hopefully Capcom will reintroduce this in a patch in the future, without a DLC cost.Everything in a match is fast moving and player momentum is natural in a game like this. You want to keep moving, providing damage, and repeat. In Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and while the animations have been slowed down they compliment the game atmosphere nicely.One way Marvel vs. Capcom designers have tried to help remove the anxiety new gamers feel during their first match is by introducing a new mode: Simple mode, or button mashing mode if you prefer. It gives high hopes for beginners to be able to win a match. With this mode enabled, you literally can just press the same button over and over while moving the stick around to pull off sweet moves. By using simple mode, even the most novice player may have a chance at winning. While simple mode may be good for grandmas and tottlers, it is going to limit the amount of special moves a player can use. It enables easy access to simpler moves, and that's it. Now, this doesn't mean that in simple mode, you're not going to need any skill at all. You'll probably want to focus on blocks to get you ready for the real fighting of the game: the online modes.Another huge change is the inclusion of X-Factor. This mode enables to you increase your attack power and speed for a limited time, depending on how many characters are still alive in your party. It also resets your animation, giving you access to chain more moves together that would be impossible otherwise. It sounds like a gimmick move, but in the game, it's been quit helpful and I haven't experienced it being overused.Graphically, this game is well done too. The game feels much like a comic book opening up in front of you. The dark shadows look amazing, and can't simple be justified to how amazing they look in screen shots. The animations are smooth, and you'll rarely see a hick-up in the game. The backgrounds are slightly muted to bring the characters forward a little bit. It almost looks like you're playing a 2D fighting game at times, which isn't a bad thing. They just mastered how well to do the visuals in a sense that it looks old school, yet 3D at the same time.Let's talk roster for a minute. There's 36 characters to choose from, half from Marvel Comics, and the others from Capcom games. This is a lot less than the roster of Marvel vs. Capcom 2, but is that a bad thing? Marvel vs. Capcom 2, while a terrific fighting game, had some huge holes in the balancing because of so many characters. Most of the time, the balancing wasn't from over-powered fighters as much as under powered characters. So Capcom decided to keep the roster a little smaller while fine-tuning each character with pros and cons. This is obviously a good thing, but coming from Capcom, this might have been a way to milk a little more money out of the game. We can expect some DLC to come out shortly after (March has two new characters and a costume pack scheduled for release). What worries me is how much this stuff is going to cost. Capcom knows people will buy it up, so are they going to charge the extra mile because they know this?However, even though I'm not a fan of overpriced DLC, Capcom is at least listening to the fans on the DLC they want. On Capcom Utility's website, you can actually vote for characters you want to see in the game (hint: Gambit needs to come back, so vote!). I find this to be really neat and I hope they truly listen to their fans. If anything needs DLC fast in the game, I feel they need to add some more maps. The maps are awesome that are already in the game, but there's hardly any to really look at. I wouldn't even mind some recycled maps from the previous installments of the game.The only other complaint I have is the controls on a standard controller. They work, but they never feel comfortable. The game begs for a fight stick of some sort. I haven't played on the Xbox 360's D-pad yet, but I can imagine it being atrocious given that the 360's D-pad isn't exactly the most impressive on the market.If anything, the game is going to hold it's own for a while but it will probably not be in the ranks of classic like it's predecessor. It's all a matter of time to how well this game will rank in the end. With DLC coming out, one can hope that Capcom listens to their fans and keeps the community strong.+ Great character list with balance issues in check+ Outstanding graphics and sounds.- Being nerfed online by Iron Man.

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"It's a sunshiny day","reviewText":"Link's new cel-shaded PaRappa-paper appearance; Metroid reinvented as an FPS; Mario's latest stint as an Earth-cleansing Greenpeace spokesman; the mere fact that Pikmin even exists-many gamers have taken these as sure signs that Shigeru Miyamoto's sanity meter has finally hit rock bottom. Here's hoping the entire video game industry contracts a crippling case of mad cow disease. In Super Mario Sunshine, paradise turns into a public relations nightmare when a beloved Italian is falsely accused of dirtying up an island resort with ugly magic gloop, chasing away the island's magical Shine Sprites and making things dark and dirty for vacationers everywhere. Now, in order to make reparations, he has to clean up the island using his patented F.L.U.D.D. water cannon and enter a variety of surreal island sub-worlds to explore, jump, dive, race, hover, and squirt his way to the missing Shines. If Mario Sunshine seems a lot like Mario 64 with a water cannon, that's not too far from the truth. Yes, the Shines are the equivalent of Mario 64's Stars. And yes, Delfino Plaza, much like Mario 64's castle, acts as a \"hub\" that connects the sub-worlds together. The levels are even structured in the same episodic fashion-one level contains eight \"episodes\" or missions-though the objectives are often less vague (thanks to a quick pre-mission \"fly-through\"), the changes to the level in between each visit are much more visible, and it's much harder to \"accidentally\" stumble upon a Shine you weren't supposed to just yet. Levels are crafted with endless care, and each stage is its own preposterous superplayground-and a single level is packed with more gameplay variety than the entire length of your standard Mario-free 3D platform adventure. The \"challenge types\" are easily categorized, and you'll quickly recognize a pattern for the episodes in each sub-world: Fight a boss; collect eight red coins; explore a complex maze; win a race; fight the boss again in weirder circumstances; find a hidden cave that leads to a trippy obstacle course; chase down Shadow Mario; etc. But even though you may be collecting eight red coins for the eighth red time, you're never doing it quite the same way-and unthinkably clever level layouts mean things rarely get tedious or annoying.Rest assured, Mario's new ability to squirt water isn't merely a gimmick so Nintendo can say, \"Look, it's different\"-here, it's as natural and integral a part of Mario's move list as his wall jump, butt stomp, or just good ol' fashioned ability to walk forward. There's hardly a moment when you aren't hovering or squirting or executing some sort of hover/squirt combo maneuver, be it to hose down an enemy, land a tricky jump, water a plant in the hopes of revealing some sort of pleasant surprise, or just giddily annoy the endlessly agreeable citizens of Delfino. The GameCube controller seems specifically designed for the task-double jumps, triple jumps, wall jumps, and backflips are executed with supernatural ease; narrow pathways are navigated effortlessly; and the analog shoulder button makes water cannon control a brainless affair. This is one of the tightest-controlling games you'll ever play. Mario Sunshine's graphics are best described as larger-than-life and absolutely alive. The smooth animation constantly delights, and a curious peek in the distance reveals an entire world of bulbous happy things hopping and bopping and glooping about. The sheer sense of scale is astonishing-sometimes you can see entire levels looming way out in the distance-and often leaves you with the overwhelmed, overjoyed feeling that there may, in fact, just be too many things to do in this damn game. The effects are glorious-the water (squirted or swum-through) is gorgeous, and the mirror effects are mind-bogglingly cool. The voice-acting in cut-scenes is weirdly understated and a bit rushed, but the garbled villager-speak is great, and the music is classic Mario. The one shortfall is the close-up graphical detail, where the primitive textures stand in sharp contrast to the rest of the game's polished glory. In summary: Yes, it's much bigger than Luigi's Mansion; yes, it's very, very much like Mario 64; no, you don't spend the whole game scrubbing dirt off walls as some sort of interactive environmental message; and yes-oh, hell yes-Mario Sunshine is exactly the brilliant, enormous, endlessly fun GameCube purchase-justifying Miyamoto supergame you were hoping it would be. Shine on, you crazy designer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2003"}

It is the sequel to Soul Caliber for the Sega Dreamcast. It has beautiful graphics, a comprehensive storyline, and some great moves.The basic story of the game is that there is this evil sword, called Soul Edge. Many want the sword for its great power. It is said to be, in fact, the most powerful sword in the world. However, most people don't know that it is evil, and so many pursue it. The current wielder of it is a mysterious black-armored knight named Nightmare. He was once a bandit, leader of a group called Der Schwarzwind (The Black Wind). He found Soul Edge, but gradually it took over his body. In the last game, Soul Edge was shattered by its opposite, the spirit sword Soul Caliber. However, the broken fragments of the sword have shown up in many places. Some seek to destroy the pieces to prevent the sword from regaining its evil power. Some want it to use to destroy their enemies. Some want it for the power it brings. However, everybody wants it, and most have no quarrel with destroying everyone in their way to get it.There is a huge selection of characters, with six secret characters adding to the lineup. They vary from a Japanese swordsman to a village mystic to a female ninja demon hunter to a diabolical golem to an undead tomb guardian. There are also a great variety of stages, including a windmill in a mountainous village, an abandoned yet well-preserved Japanese castle, and a lakeside garden. Most of these places have at least one place where a fighter can be knocked out of the ring (except for the cage matches), so knocking someone out or tossing them out is a vital strategy for winning.The modes of play that you can do include arcade mode, in which you fight several random enemies and one character-based enemy in order to accomplish your character's goal, Weapon Master Mode, in which you can earn gold to buy extra weapons, costumes, and artwork, to various time attack modes and \"see how long you can survive\" modes. Besides the normal modes, you can also get \"Extra\" modes, which allow you to use the weapons you buy in Weapon Master mode. The weapons can give that little boost needed for victory. Most weapons have a pro and a con, like a staff that has good offense and recovers health, but has poor defense. The higher the cost of the weapon, the better it is. Some weapons have no flaws, like the katana Masamune, which has good offense and defense, with no downside.The in-combat gameplay is good. There are a number of actions, like Guard Impacts (which reverse or trip an enemy's attack), to prevent button mashing. This game is responsible for the most fulfilling fighting round in any fighting game I've ever played. My character was Mitsurugi, the Japanese swordsman, and my opponent was Raphael, the fencer. In most games, the victor would basically be whoever bashed most first. However, in this game, I actually had to think about it. There was thrusting, parrying, slashing, and basically everything that makes a game seem realistic and not just a \"bash, mash, smash\" game. The other moves that can be done range from ninja teleportation to awesome throws (like where Link, the GC guest, grabs the enemy by his shirt, runs up their body, and slashes them on his way down).The main reason to buy certain console versions of this game is the \"guest character\" on each one: Link for the Gamecube, Spawn for the Xbox, and Tekken's Heihachi (who uses, well, gloves as his weapon). Also in the game is a character not seen in the video arcade games: Necrid, a special character designed by Spawn's owner, Todd McFarlane (which is why Spawn is the Xbox's guest character and why McFarlane toys manufactures the action figures).As for being \"kid-friendly\", there is no blood, as hits make strange glowing/electrical red spots (but not cuts or slashes). There is some minor swearing (from characters that don't take losing well) and there is some \"female character bounciness\" and skimpy costumes, though each character has at least two costumes, and the alternate costumes on the skimpy characters are usually less bouncy and revealing.This is a very good, fun, and attention-holding fighting game, with only a few clipping errors (objects accidentally going through other objects). It gets a 10/10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"Siklootd","summary":"Innovation Mastered","reviewText":"Last year when I decided to purchase an Xbox 360 despite already owning a PlayStation 3, it was because of a select few games that remained exclusive to the Microsoft console.  Games such as Left 4 Dead, Halo, Crackdown and Mass Effect were incentives to purchase the console, but what finally made me get one was the anticipation of playing Gears of War.  Being new to the series, I figured I should start with the first game of the franchise, so last year I purchased an Xbox 360 and Gears of War on the same day.  This is a decision I wish I had made years ago.The game starts off by placing the player in the shoes of Marcus Fenix, a member of a team known as \"Gears\", located on the planet Sera.  Marcus commands a squadron known as Delta Squad, which includes characters such as Dominic \"Dom\" Santiago, Augustus \"Cole Train\" Cole, and Damon Baird.  Their squadron is a member of the last remaining human government left on the planet, known as Coalition of Order Governments (COG).  The responsibility of COG is to fight for humanity against the alien onslaught being driven by a race known as Locusts.  Locusts are giant crocodile/human hybrid looking creatures who are capable of using heavy artillery against their enemies, in this case humans.  Marcus is handed the responsibility of placing a resonator within the tunnels where the Locust reside, this will cause an outright extermination of the race, however the team did not properly diagnose the exact size and mapping of the tunnel the first time around, so players spent the rest of the game fighting their way through the Locusts until once again getting a chance to place a resonator within their underground tunnels.The game features unique weapons and gameplay mechanics that make the game addictive beyond belief.  Add in the ability to play the campaign mode cooperatively with other players or competitively against other players, and you have a winning formula for non-stop action.  Health bars are absent, instead replace the system with status indicators which tell the player their current state of danger.  This is done with the use of a flashing red screen that symbolizes impending doom unless the player takes cover long enough that the screen returns to normal.  The ability to chainsaw opponents in half comes in handy, especially in instances where the player is bombarded by enemies such as Wretches.  Enemies vary greatly from one another, and gameplay moments such as avoiding darkness to survive the attack of Krill is very unique.Gears of War is visually stunning, and has mastered innovation on so many levels.  The \"cover mechanism\" was relatively new to video games before Gears of War launched, and now it is common gameplay for third person shooters and is used in games such as Mass Effect and Uncharted.  The character design is unique, the gameplay is solid, and the campaign and multiplayer modes are addicting.  This makes for a great addition to any Xbox 360 collection, and Gears of War has quickly won its place on my list of favorite franchises ever created.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2010"}

The combat system was reworked and is really fun, Conner is the most powerful of the Assassin lineage, and it shows in this game.

Not only is it really fun in single player, it's truly addictive in multiplayer as well!First off, the game itself. It's just like tetris, where blocks fall and you arrange them. In this case, they are all squares, with two colors. You are trying to make the colors connect up into blocks. There is all sorts of different color changes, music changes and cool techniques you learn as you go. Don't just play it a few times. Keep playing up into the higher levels, and it becomes a truly amazing game.Then you can take it multi-player, and the head to head gameplay is really fun. It's not just \"two people building side by side towers\" like most other game systems. You actually use the same board and slide the ownership of area back and forth based on how well you do. It is incredibly fun!There are other challenges, with puzzles and time trials, but the basic game is really the core here. It's perfect for picking up for 15 minutes when you're waiting in line - or it can make an hour long train ride zip by in seconds. This is really the must-have game for your PSP!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2005"}

Especially HOUSE OF THE DEAD OVERKILL.  There's a lot more blood and gore when you blast the zombies, and the gameplay is more dynamic.  Also the dialogue and story are punchier and more fun.  And the soundtrack rocks.  The only problem with HOTD OVERKILL is that it's way too short.  Whereas not as tongue and cheek, DEAD SPACE EXTRACTION is pretty solid all the way around, and the TELEKINESIS feature makes it much more interactive than your typical light gun rail shooter.Now, I went on that digression because in contrast, shooting a shotgun in UMBRELLA CHRONICLES doesn't feel all that different from shooting a handgun.  And damage to your enemies doesn't show up visually all that much (e.g. you can't blow limbs off your enemies).  There's not a whole lot of ways to interact with the environment other than shooting it, so the fact that your bullets and explosives don't create lots of destruction and gore really detracts from the game.  You don't get to see bullets or shotgun slugs riddle their bodies or blood spurting from the wounds.  In other words, there's not a super visceral experience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2009"}

Rhodes","summary":"Final Fantasy Should Remain in the RPG Realm","reviewText":"The unfortunate thing about Dirge of Cerberus is that it has the curse of being in the universe of one of the greatest and most beloved video games of all time:  Final Fantasy VII.  There's no way Dirge of Cerberus could possibly stack up to Final Fantasy VII.  To expect any spinoff to stack up to the original Final Fantasy VII name and legacy is unrealistic.  Dirge of Cerberus is pretty different... for Final Fantasy, that is. For your basic shooter, though, it's really not that different from any other shooter.A group of underground soldiers known as Deepground have plans to revive the dreaded Omega Weapon.  In order to do that, however, they need Vincent Valentine.  Throughout the game you'll play as Vincent Valentine, getting to the bottom of this mystery.  The gold of the story is that it provides quite an interesting look into Vincent's past.  There are moments when the story feels a little complicated, but it's still a good experience nonetheless.Dirge of Cerberus isn't really an RPG.  Square refers to it as an \"RPG Shooter,\" but in reality, it's really just a shooter.  The game has a rather simple formula for its missions.  You'll view a cutscene that introduces you to the level.  The cutscene is usually long, and you'll have to wait for it to load first, and then you'll have to wait for it to load after its over.  Then you'll go into said level and blast everything and anything that moves.  Then at the end of each level you'll fight a boss.  Rinse and repeat.  Every stage in the game is pretty straightforward.  All you need to do is keep shooting at virtually anything that moves.  In some missions there are other things you can do, but really, you don't have to do these optional events.  They're just there so you can improve your score.  The basic goal of just about every mission is to kill stuff.A lot of these levels feel a little uninspired.  Most of them are bland looking with not much of anything for you there.  You can't tear apart the environment or anything like that.  It's also sad that a lot of areas in some levels look the same.  These stages don't really show you a lot of variety in the environment.  You'll also find yourself visiting some pretty familiar areas like Midgar.  When you visit most of these familiar areas, however, you don't really feel like you're revisiting anything in Final Fantasy VII.  Also, you'll mostly find yourself in the sewers or something.  It's also really sad that you can't explore more of the world.  The game is set in such a linear path that you can't explore your surroundings.Going through most of these levels isn't always bad.  Most of the action isn't all it's cracked up to be.  You simply aim and shoot.  The game provides a nice targetting system that makes missing most enemies nearly impossible.  Even worse for the gameplay, there aren't a whole lot of variety with the enemies themselves.  You'll mostly battle soldiers.  Though from time to time you'll battle other things such as mechs and dogs.  Once you've seen one soldier, though, you've seen them all.  They're downed within a couple of shots, and their attack patterns aren't really all that varied.  Before long, the enemies will do the same predictable things they always do.  The game becomes incredibly easy before it even gets a chance to get hard.  When you're near the end of the game, the enemies will still have their same old attack patterns.  They never ever change.  Bosses can be tough, but the only thing that actually makes the bosses tougher than your normal enemy is that they have more health.In addition, most levels have little in-game cutscenes of their own.  Again, though, you have to wait for the cutscene to load and then wait for it to load when it's over.  These moments wouldn't be so bad if they didn't constantly come in the middle of the action.  One minute you're shooting up your enemies, the next the game is loading a cutscene that might only last for a minute, and then the next your back in the middle of the action.  It isn't that these moments are bad, it's just that they're inserted at inappropriate times.Using magic also has its own hits and misses.  You can equip materia to your weapon and fire off a magic shot.  This adds some variety to the stale gameplay, but you'll end up depleting your MP really fast.  There's not enough of the magic to go around.  Likewise, you'll find items called Limit breakers which will allow you to use Vincent's limit break for a limited amount of time.  Using Vincent's limit break provides some more fun to the game.  You'll get to rip most of your enemies to shreds, but unfortunately, it only adds more ease to the game.  Even bosses become a cakewalk with the limit break.  Even though it only lasts for a limited amount of time, you'll still be able to take down a boss using the limit break.Weapon customizing is a nice addition, however.  After each level you have a chance to use the gil you've earned from enemies to upgrade Vincent's weapons.  Throughout most of the game you'll be using the Cerberus, though.  It's by far the most potent weapon in the game.  It's nice to be able to explore and customize a vareity of weapons at least.Dirge of Cerberus isn't a long game.  It may take you less than ten hours to complete it.  Upon completing it, though, you unlock an abundance of extra missions and such.  The standard game is nothing special, but the extra missions can really keep you busy for a while.  They're a lot more fun than the standard missions, and ask a lot more of your skills.Graphically, it's hard to judge Dirge of Cerberus.  Most of the environments are pretty run of the mill for the genre.  There's not a lot of vareity or interaction with anything in these levels.  Most levels really aren't that impressive looking.  On the other hand, the pre-rendered cutscenes are beautiful to look at.  These cutscenes themselves look just as good as the movie Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children.  Outside of that, however, Dirge of Cerberus doesn't take the PS2 to its full capacity.  Most of the music is alright.  Nothing great, but good enough nonetheless.  The voice acting is pretty standard.  Not a lot of emotion, but at some points it goes along with the dark mood of the game rather well.  Sometimes the characters not having emotion is what makes the voice acting good at some parts of the game.  On the whole, though, it's not fantastic voice acting.Dirge of Cerberus isn't really a bad game, but outside of it having the Final Fantasy name on it, there's really nothing in this game that sets it apart from other shooters and action/adventure titles.  The Final Fantasy name is the only real reason to get this game.  It's interesting to learn about Vincent, and to expand upon the Final Fantasy VII universe, but perhaps Final Fantasy should stick strictly to the RPG genre.The Good+You get to play as Vincent Valentine+Vincent's past and story is explained rather well; the overall storyline of the game is pretty well done+Beautiful pre-rendered cutscenes+Neat weapons customization+You get to use Vincent's Limit Break+Tons of extra missions after the game is completedThe Bad-Little innovation-In game graphics are not up to standard for the PS2 or Square-Enix for that matter-Poor voice acting in many spots-Environments are bland-There isn't enough vareity to the enemies, they do the same thing over and over until the end of the game-The gameplay gets stale... fast-The stages lack variety and exploration; they're all linear paths-There's little challenge to the game","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2006"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"Karl Grosvenor","summary":"truly monotonous","reviewText":"Lets start by saying I am new to the PS3 having had an XBOX 360 for a few years now,but I decided to get a Playstation and bought Resistance 2 together with Fall of man,I really loved the first game,but this is a stinker.What went wrong everything about Resistance 1 that was good,the controls,the story the game-play were thrown out of the window for this sequel what were the developers thinking,where they drunk all the time through development or were they playing a joke on gamers,whatever it was they really messed this game up it's as if a whole new team worked on it without any or little knowledge of what came before.I can't think of anything but the rumble feature that this game has that's an improvement over the first,this game is all trial and error and it gets really tedious when you die over and over and over and over again and each time have to start again from the beginning of the level, you often die because enemies just spawn out of nowhere when you least expect you also get confused as to what to do and where to go you often get swarmed with masses of creatures who bizarrely only target you and not your teams mates and you often run out of ammo a lot as you are restricted to two guns,they also changed the controls around as well which annoys the hell out of me,but I finished this game because I bought it,but had I known how bad and inferior it would be compared to the first game I wouldn't have bought it,I hoped the third installment would be better,but sadly it's worse.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2012"}

What the.....","reviewText":"I'm only referring to the campaign here as I don't buy the Halo titles for the MP.Plainly put, there's never enough ammo in Halo 4.  A large majority of my time is spent constantly scrounging after every skirmish for rounds, and that's just to use any weapon, not just the one I currently have.  I can't fight with the arms I desire and always have to switch every few minutes (if I'm lucky).  There've been occasions I've had to restart checkpoints because both of my guns ran dry in the middle of a fight and I had nothing but melee attacking.  This is an FPS whose sole focus is on shooting things; it's not Deus Ex where the gunplay compliments the whole package.  In Halo, gunplay IS the package.  Running out of ammo should not even be a possibility unless one is making a point of being wasteful.  I once picked up a Needler only to find that it had a whopping 17 rounds of ammunition in it.  SEVENTEEN.  Hell, why not just make it five?  I killed one Elite and was forced to find a replacement.  Once I found a shotgun with 12.  What is the point???I just can't play this game.....it is not fun due solely to this issue.  Ammo consumption/distribution is incredibly imbalanced as the amount of rounds one must use to kill an enemy is disproportionate to the amount of ammo the game affords the player.  Perhaps 343 wanted to force the people to try out all the weapons instead of the ones they like but this is not the way to do it.  I've searched around the net and see this is a fairly common complaint (even in multiplayer) so I know it's not just me.  This problem was also present in Reach but not nearly so pronounced.  Here it's absurd.  Playable?  Yes.  Fun?  No way.  It's a damn shame too as if I were able to fight without always having to scan the ground near corpses afterwards for useable weapons Halo 4 would be an enjoyable game.  As it is now, it's imbalanced to the point of frustration and tedium and my copy has quickly found its way onto ebay.The only thing I kept thinking while playing 4 was, \"I want to be playing CE\".  I did so and it felt like restraints had been removed.  Maybe a patch will come out that balances this but until then this game suffers and I can't recommend it on this aspect alone.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2012"}

Even without gameplay in consideration, it's rewarding alone just to get from cutscene to cutscene.- Gameplay: Essentially, RDR is built on Grand Theft Auto IV's engine. As you'd expect, gunplay isn't perfect, but thankfully the engine has been polished a lot since Rockstar's last game. The sheer amount of variety ranging from minigames to treasure hunting means you'll be entertained for a long while.- Graphics: RDR is a beautiful game to look at. The wild west setting is depicted perfectly and feels very authentic. Texture pop-in is annoying but unnoticeable when you're sucked into the game.- Audio: Outstanding voice acting from a variety of characters coupled with great sound effects. The soundtrack is very basic given the setting but it serves the game well.- Replay Value: Rockstar has put together a massive game full of enjoyment and content. The multiplayer is fully-featured and incredibly fun to play with friends.

Delaney \"Tech Guy\"","summary":"Would be the Best Game EVER - If it weren't for the Bugs.","reviewText":"There are plenty of reviews here on Amazon stating how good this game is...  I agree that this is one of THE BEST games I have ever played, especially on the Xbox 360.The main problem with the game is that there are too many bugs.  I could live with most of the minor bugs and I was able to complete the main quest in the game.  I have a level 54 character and I have been trying to complete the mid-level and side quests to get all of the achievements.The problem is, I seem to have encountered a bug that is preventing me from completing these quests.  The bug seems to happen in one of two places.  I am doing the Dark Brotherhood line of quests that requires you to kill people in towns.  This puts a bounty on your head.  Now, when I go to those towns, the guards come up to me and give me three options:  1. Pay the fine, 2. Go to Jail.  3. Resist Arrest.If I choose option 1 or 2, my Xbox locks hard.  The screen freezes and I have to power off my xbox and restart from the last save.I was willing to live with this since I could choose option 3, and just kill the guards.  (Which would raise my bounty further.)  In some towns, I would have the option to bribe the guards since I became leader of the Thieves Guild.  That would work, but I didn't get the option in all towns.But now, while trying to complete the Dark Brotherhood quest line, I am getting the hard lockup when I have to get into the coffin with the mother for the second time.  (Towards the end of the questline.)It seems to be when the game is automatically trying to take me somewhere.  Like when I am being arrested, or I assume when I am in the mother coffin.I have another Xbox and will try it out there...  But, my thought is that the Xbox is a closed system.  I have not modified my Xbox or my game, so I should not be getting these hard lockups or the multitude of other bugs.Again...  One of the best games I have ever played.  Just wish I could finish it.  (I would also like to play the DLC, but I WILL NOT buy it if I cannot get by these lockup bugs.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2012"}

I had bought Disney's Coaster several years ago and thought this game would be just like it. Wrong! This game is way better. You have several scenarios you play plus you can play and redo real amusement parks. They give you lots a money to start with to build up your park. You control the admission fees, the price for all of the rides, price on the food, and you can even charge people for usin the restrooms. You hire mechanics, people to mow and clean garbage, security guards, and entertainers. You can change the color of every ride and play your choice of music. There a banners that will display any message you type plus you can name any ride or food place. The best thing is you can design your own rollercoasters and water rides though they are expensive (don't build your water ride too big as you typically only have 2 boats and the lines get long and customers get upset). You also do your own landscaping and you can see what every customer in your park is thinking and how each ride is liked. If you choose to, you can watch them ride each of your rides. The only conflict with the game I have seen was what they call &quot;thrill rides&quot;. When you go to build these, the excitement level is typically low to moderate so I am not sure why they call those thrill rides.This is a very addicting game and time will get away.

{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"Dagger One Bravo","summary":"GW2 - Noob Paradise","reviewText":"EDIT (6-19-2014): Well, it happened! Just a few weeks ago Arenanet demoted every single champion mob save one, on all the starter maps, from champion to veteran status thus permanently derailing the noob-train. On the one hand I'm tickled to death because at least that huge problem has been solved. On the other hand, it's a crying shame that it took the permanent elimination of the most fun to be had on the starter maps to get these clowns to stop doing what Arenanet made more than obvious they did not want people to do. Who do the new players have to thank for this? Themselves? Minimally, yes, but the greatest majority of the blame lies with players ranging from 20 to 70 levels higher than the recently demoted champions. The reasons are laid out somewhere below and you may as well throw into this mix no shortage of Guild Wars 2's store-bought (and mostly store-brand) \"commanders\".It's also a crying shame that not even two days after this happened, these same noob-trainers (many \"commanders\" included) were advising people to simply go to the next lowest map and do the same thing there!I think I'm going to write a book and title it Guild Wars 2 Players - Case studies in apathy, denial and self-serving idiocy.Anyway, end of edit and you fanboys and commander lapdogs are more than welcome to attempt to refute a single thing in this review.Since my review has been so popular I decided to update it (5/10/2014) to more accurately reflect the state of the game after it's most recent update, as opposed to when I wrote the review initially.Well, it's still trash. About the only real change is that it's actually worse now than it was before.99% of the gear is still laughably ugly, the skills (all 5 of them, which are predetermined for you) are still laughably generic and the targeting is still as broken as it ever was... as are many of the events that have been bugged or totally broken since the game was released. The targeting is so over the top bad and so universally hated that the fact that it has NEVER been fixed or seemingly even addressed makes me think it is nothing but one in a long list of AI cheats that is the only thing that makes this game challenging to any degree whatsoever.On top of this, none of the so-called improvements have been for the better. Because the servers are being abandoned Arenanet decided to slyly merge them via a megaserver system which is nothing but a different way to merge servers when games start to die but they say they did it to end empty overflows. Hah! It wasn't the overflows that were empty. It was the servers we were playing on that were empty! Prior to this megaserver bs, you could traverse entire maps and never see a single other player. I'm not sure how many people actually believe Anet's nonsense about why they did it but I bet a lot do.What we have now with the new system is a nightmare. Are there people in your game now? You betcha. So, what's the problem? Well, the problem is that 75% of all these \"new people\" are horrible people. They're horrible players and they're just generally unpleasant to be around. Besides your standard gutter-mouthed stupidity they spam chat with the most foul, sexually-explicit trash they can puke out and all many of them do (at ANY level) is run around in a giant zerg-fest killing champion mobs over and over and over, all day long. On certain maps these noob-trains think they actually own whatever it is they're after, will sometimes demand that other players do not attack them and anyone that does attack a certain type of mob without them or tries to do an event that they don't \"approve\" of will be harassed and insulted incessantly by several people, most of whom couldn't beat their way out of a wet paper bag without 50 other 14 year old noobs there to help them. If it weren't so pathetic and if their presence and attitude weren't so hostile it'd be quite funny. I even had one threaten to beat me to death with a baseball bat recently because I was killing things without waiting for the noob-train. I'm not even going to mention the several other things he had to say and these aren't isolated, rare incidents. God forbid you respond to any of this harassment either. Do that and you immediately get labeled a troll and you will be reported, often by the very same people that just called you some of the most obscene names you can think of. Unbelievable, these people...! Daily this is becoming more and more the norm and it blows me away that Arenanet seems like it couldn't care less that his is happening. Then again, at the rate the game is dying I guess I'm not surprised that they're in no hurry to alienate the scrubs that still play it regularly.Okay, so what else... The \"commander\" tag! Wow, what a nauseating joke this thing is. What is a \"commander\" tag? A commander tag is something that every single person can BUY for a measly 100 gold and 250 badges of honor, which are easier to get than 100 gold. There is no other qualification. No test, no review, no nothing! Just BUY the tag and put it on. Once you get this stupid thing you get a blue icon that litters everyone's map and you get to appoint yourself a \"commander\". It's a WvW feature and it has it's uses but most of these noobtards use it in PvE also to attempt to direct gameplay and lead others around by their noses as if they are actually some kind of authority figure or know better how to do something than anyone that doesn't sport one of these blue epeens. Sadly, TONS of players have them and they all race to be the next person to \"tag up\" (as they call it) when someone else leaves the map. Many of them even go so far as to request that another self-appointed commander \"take over\" when they're about to leave! It's so stupid. It's also unbelievable how many dopes actually listen to these people! The self-appointed commanders are also notorious for being the most vociferous when it comes to harassing players for not following the noob-train's make-believe rules. \"Commanders\" love the noob-train too because it's the perfect opportunity to show off to the lowbies how important and pretentious they are. Some of them will even round up a bunch of them and take them on \"map tours\" as if these new players are too stupid or too fragile to find their own way around a freakin' starter map by themselves.Speaking of the lowbies, it's their champs that are the most frequently zerged but not by the lowbies they were made for. Nope! Most of the noob-trainers on the lowbie maps are 20-70 levels higher than the level of the mobs they're farming. They burn these champs down in under a minute. Probably under 30 seconds for most of them and the lowbies may as well not participate at all. Why do they do this? Few different reasons:1. Because the game is dying the starter maps were virtual ghost towns so in an effort to make the game appear more populated to the inkling of actually new players they added daily and monthly quests that were infinitely easier to complete on low level maps than the level of map that the majority of players should be playing on. Obviously, it didn't take them long to figure this out and now the low level maps are swamped with high level noobs with low level mentalities looking for easy kills, easy loot and any chance they can find to show off their \"skills\" to the lowbies who's game and abilities they're ultimately ruining. I admit, I like to run around on the lowbie maps too sometimes but I never rape their champs or their event spawns and ruin their game as is the case with nearly every high level player that happens to be on these low maps.If you want to see the worst of it, wait until the daily quest reset and watch in horror as capped players literally flood into the Queensdale map (level 1-15) and crush everything in sight until they've all finished their daily quests. I mean, they will run right out to the spawn points (you have to know how this game works to understand) and completely decimate entire waves of enemy mobs while the low level players that these events were designed for are left standing in the back where the event is actually supposed to be happening without ever getting a single kill! It's absolutely shameful the things that happen in this game and for about 2 weeks this kind of thing is amplified tenfold when the monthly quest resets!2. Low level champs now drop items the level of the player they drop for so a level 80 player can spend all day on a level 10 map and only suffer the loot loss of high level crafting mats. This is for the same reason as 1. As far as xp and karma rewards go, yes, they are lower on lower level maps but you can do so many more events and do them so much faster on low maps that you get as much or more than you would on your own level maps and at almost 0% risk of dying.3. New player ignorance of the truth about the commander tag offers these clowns an excellent opportunity to make themselves feel important by leading around lowbies under the pretense of helping them level. Unfortunately, they're only creating a generation of players as noobish and apathetic as they are. You can spot the noob-train products easily once they reach the high maps because all they ever post in chat is this: \"Where da zerg at?\" \"Where da train at?\", \"What do we do now?\", \"Where to now?\", \"Now what?\" \"I just turned 80. What kind of gear should I get?\", \"What are the best traits for xxxx class?\". Capped players that still do not know how to think for themselves, build their gear or play their class! None of this happened before some dope or collection of dopes invented the noob-train.This game... this poor game. It's bad enough on it's own and the community just makes it even worse. We will see how Anet handles this commander stupidity in the future but my guess is that they're not going to address it at all because it's such a great gold sink and it's ease of acquisition is a major incentive to get people to buy gems with real money to convert to the gold required to buy the idiotic tag.Attn make-believe PvE commanders: Has it ever occurred to you that for a long time after this game was released, before every 3rd person decided he was going to appoint himself a commander over the rest of the players, we somehow consistently managed to complete the events for which you think your presence is so valuable?As for the game itself, well, it's terribly generic. You get all of 5 attack skills that are preselected for you based on the weapon you're using and they all unlock within about 2 minutes or less of using that weapon at the lowest possible level. Conceivably, you can have every single attack skill available, across all weapon choices in less than your first fifteen minutes of gameplay! They're all pretty mediocre and other than animations they all do basically the exact same things no matter what class you play. I can't imagine how much money and time they saved by using this stupid model. Absolutely nothing to look forward to here and this is the case for just about every single aspect of this game. It is generic and dumbed-down like this throughout the entire thing.What else? What else? Lemmeee seeeee... Oh yeah! The drop rate nerfing. It's unreal how terrible the drops have become in this game but not without some justification. You play and play and play and at the end of the day you end up with a bunch of silk scraps, assorted junk and 1 or 2 Tier 6 crafting mats. Rare gear drops have become very rare and exotic gear drops virtually nonexistent. We have the noob-trains to thank for this too. Anet doesn't want people doing the very thing they are doing (and harassing others for NOT doing) so in an effort to de-incentivize the practice they started nerfing the drops. Well, it hasn't worked. They keep right on doing it and complaining because the drops suck so bad. The reason Anet doesn't want them training or \"zerg-farming\" is because it creates the very environment it has created - one in which a certain group of players begin to feel that their gameplay takes priority over other's because they're a collective that imagines itself to be \"the majority\" of players in the game at any given time. Thus, they begin to create and attempt to enforce rules of their own and subvert the intended gameplay design; i.e., rules already in place or implied by the Terms of Use or general game design.Perfectly understandable that they don't want these trains running and we're all now seeing exactly the destruction that they cause. Unfortunately, due to the game's dying population what is Anet to do about it? Put it out of it's misery by permanently derailing what a very large portion of it's player base is doing or allow those same players to continue to flush the game further down the toilet just to keep some amount of money coming in, in hopes that one day it will repopulate with a better class of people? Not a decision I would want to have to make but if they didn't cater the game to such a juvenile segment of the population and had designed the game to be more engaging and worthwhile for the more mature gamers they probably wouldn't be having this problem in the first place.The game is LOADED with AI cheating also:*Previously mentioned broken and never once addressed targeting mechanic.*Dodging ultimately never avoids damage because your target simply follows you as soon as you attempt to dodge and makes up for his missed attack while you're recovering from the dodge.*AI can hit you with attacks directed in the totally opposite direction while your attacks wont work but still go into full cooldown when you try this.*AI can move at least 10x faster than you can and routinely run behind you and steal free hits while you're trying to turn your slow as molasses character around to hit them back, just for them to do it to you again as soon as you do. No creativity here at all. Just the usual GW2 dumbness. Do you die from this? No, it's just frustrating, cheap and stupid.*On this same note, the AI does not suffer the same movement speed handicap that players do. Dimwits like to call this \"combat movement speed\" or \"movement speed debuff\" in an effort to save the dignity of their sacred cow, but neither of these definitions are correct nor is the handicap justifiable under any circumstances. It is simply a cheat employed in an effort to make the AI more challenging without actually designing them as such.*AI can see and react to attacks cast behind their backs before the attack ever does any damage or even makes contact, usually blowing the attack completely and putting it into cooldown for no reason. This cheat is one that they have recently heavily ramped up the use of in the new and incredibly stupid introduction of \"toxic\" mobs that will often begin evading your attack the very instant that you cast it, EVEN IF YOU ARE OUT OF THEIR AGGRO RANGE!*AI can see your casting rings before you ever actually cast the skill and they simply avoid the areas you're about to place them. You can actually steer entire waves of mobs with a keyed but uncast aoe skill.*Shield blocking for warriors is a wasted skill slot because when used the enemy mob simply stops attacking you until the timer runs out, rendering the shield useless and just for show 90% of the time. I'm hesitant to call this one cheating but whatever. It still happens and shields are still rendered ultimately useless because they don't block damage if no damage is incoming.*The second you touch your heal skill the AI knows it and will almost always immediately subject you to multiple attacks from multiple enemies before the heal even goes into effect (or immediately after) often making healing either grossly ineffective or an ironic death sentence.(Probably I could eliminate much of the above and simply say that the game has omniscient AI but, nah,. Simply stating that Arenanet has employed the omniscient AI cheat doesn't have quite the same effect as pointing out the many examples of it's existence.)*Related to the aforementioned mostly useless dodge mechanic, because the AI knows even better than you do where your dodge-roll is going to put you, champion mobs will instantly lay down AoE damage at your destination before you even get to it very often killing you the second you get done \"dodging\". The same champ mob famous for doing this is also the same one that will suck up 100% of your HP at will no matter how much you have, how far away from it you are, whether or not you're even involved with the event it's related to and without regard to how many other people are attacking it. It will lock on to you just for running by somewhere in the general vicinity and start draining your hp until you are dead just out of Anet-programmed spite and stupidity.*I can go on and on with this kind of stuff.Guild Wars 2 is the worst, most insulting game you could ever play but there is apparently no shortage of people that worhip the ground this trash walks on. At first that'd seem surprising given the truth of this game but when you understand the type of people that make up a large part of it's community you can begin to see why this is. Most of them are juvenile, lazy, noobish kids or immature adults that want everything basically given to them simply for playing the game. Sure, there is a gear level that's pretty difficult to obtain but that gear is only necessary to participate in one single instanced zone. It's just a carrot on a stick to amuse the easily amused and my God the gear in this game is the ugliest stuff I have ever seen in my long and boring gaming life. I have a friend that loves this game and even she says the gear is horrible looking. And you would think that the gear skins you can buy in the cash shop would look better, right? Well, you'd be wrong. Most of that skin is even worse than what you can buy in-game!Ok, so what's good about the game? Well, it's pretty. The graphics are top notch but that is all this game has to offer to anyone with any amount of intelligence capable of being insulted. This is the kind of stuff you expect to see on consoles. Not because consoles are bad but because it doesn't offer anything that a console isn't perfectly capable of handling and if I was a betting man I'd bet you just about any amount of money that this game will one day be released on the console market. It's perfectly designed for it, which I don't think is a coincidence. All they have to do is dope the graphics a little bit and everything else will work.To hell with this game. Although not perfect either, Tera is a much better choice as far as gameplay, mechanics and stability is concerned. The community is as bad or worse than this one but the game itself is far and away better than Guild Bores 2. Aion is also a much better choice if you don't mind some pretty hardcore open-world PvP.Oh, and have fun (at least try to) fighting any champion mobs even at your own level because as soon as someone sees it they call it in chat and an entire swarm of players come and burn it down. All you have to do is just stand there and spam your attacks (again, all 5 of them) for a few minutes until it dies.NcSoft needs to just go ahead and put this thing out of it's misery, record and track many of it's loyal fans and be sure they are blocked from polluting any of their future releases. I think this is one instance where NcSoft's reputation as game killer could actually be beneficial but they could have easily avoided the many problems with their community simply by designing the game to not be so attractive to the toxic, cancerous type of player that is around every corner and under just about every blue square on your mini map in Guild Wars 2.That is all.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2012"}

You start off by building your ride, which will take you some time.  You get to pick every little minor details for your ride.  I'm not a mechanic-saavy, so even though I have no idea what a crocket or a fuel injector does, it cleverly explains to you and how does each part affects your vehicle's speed and handling.  After you are done, you are off to the races.  There are basically 3 types of races: Long Race, Short Race and Freestyle.  Freestyle race is fun, but regular races got a bit boring after a while, even after new tracks were unlocked.  Performing tricks can be tough.  If you are fraction of a second late on some tricks, you will find yourself crashing just like that.  Another annoyance occurs when you step out of bounds.  If you do that, you automatically crash, which makes you lose a lot of ground.  So while the point of the game is to make crazy tricks that earn you boost, I honestly think that if you drive careful and do not crash, you have a good chance of winning, which makes the whole point of tricks a tad dubious.  However, despite that, any fan of racing games or anyone with a passion for ATVs should definitely pick up this title and enjoy it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2008"}

Most people overlook the game when they see a half-naked chick on the cover, but Tomb Raider is one of the few (only?) \"chick\" games that are actually good. Everyone and their mothers have heard of Tomb Raider or Lara Croft as being \"the game about shooting animals in ruins and sex\" so if you're reading this you're either a fan or one of the latter. While Tomb Raider has absolutely nothing to do with anything sexual Lara's skimpy style can contradict that.The series has always been known for its intricate puzzles, great platforming, and beautiful tombs, ruins, and vistas to explore. Tomb Raider: Legend is the first TR game since the PSX days to be actually good and worth playing. With the first 2 TR games being great the series started falling with 3, got saved with 4 (The Last Revelation) and just went down hill with 5 (Chronicles), and 6 (Angel of Darkness). TRL revives the series by feeling familiar and redoing everything we've grown to love. The game's story is also very interesting and mainly for fans of Lara who want to know more about HER past. Lara is trying to find the pieces of the Excalibur sword that killed her mother and she runs into ghosts of her past that come back to haunt her. While the story is teeter tottering on the edge of bleh it does get interesting and saves itself at the end with a twist. TR has not been famous for its stories so let's get right into the adventuring! The game seems to have tried too hard to bring the series back since the game is really short (6 hours you can beat the game) and there are too many levels to explore, so you don't get a lot of feeling for one level.Everything about TR's platforming is still here so you can either stop reading now or carry on if you are a skeptical action/adventure fan trying to find a new series to get into because you're bored. The whole game is about puzzles that use the environment and hanging, swinging, jumping, pole climbing, rope swinging, zip lining all about. Most of the game is pretty easy to figure out on where to go since you get a grapple that lets you pull boxes off ledges, bring certain things down to climb across, you even use it to swing across chasms. A lot of items you use with the grapple hook has a gold shiny bit on it so you know to grapple there otherwise you'd spend hours trying to grapple every object in the game. A lot of puzzles are usually lever and switch puzzles with you pulling statues onto this pressure switch to lower this bridge to pull this block across onto this switch to raise the gate. Most are simple, but some are unique and fun that have you climbing huge cliffs, walls, and statues to push giant balls (hooha!) off ledges to use down below. A lot of the platforming is fun and awesome with ledges crumbling away, swinging across poles onto ropes etc.Not one situation is the same and that's what is so great about the TR series; you'll have something new to figure out. Jumping around these beautiful environments is easy thanks to the responsive controls, great animations, and good camera (most of the time). When you jump to a ledge and there's a wall behind you the camera will swing out to the side so you can see the whole 30 foot pillar you're supposed to climb. This works with every type of situation and the camera does a good job following you. The only time it gets weird is when you're in tight spaces then the camera doesn't know what to do and has seizures. You wind up exploring places such as Japan, Bolivia, Nepal, Kazakhstan and other places. These range from jungles, dark tombs, snow, and even the city. What I found odd was Lara climbing around in buildings like in Japan (she wears a damn sexy dress in that level), and a military base in Kazakhstan so this can be weird for long time fans. The whole things fits well, but it just seems out-of-place compared to past games.The combat is also the second thing you'll be doing the most and while it's easy, repetitive, and not amazing it works and you won't get annoyed. You just lock onto an enemy and fire away with your pistols, machine guns, or shotguns you find lying around off of enemies. If you get too hurt you can use health packs lying around as well. While you'll spend most of your time fighting brain-dead enemies that just stand there and fire at you can use the objects in the environment to kill enemies like barrels, tanks, and even snappings things to make them fall. So while the combat is nothing interesting or fantastic it's there and it works well for what the game can offer. The camera stays behind you well enough when you're locked on, but Lara will lock onto enemies off-screen a wee bit too often force you to target them yourself.A new part of TR are the motorcycle driving sections. These can be fun and annoying since the physics are a bit weird and the checkpoints are punishing. You just shoot baddies off their bikes while you go off jumps and make your way through. Another added idea are button pressing cinematics and these are cool to look at and are a lot of fun. What make them so fun is why you have to do them. A lot of the times it'll be the most intense part of the game so you really get into it. The boss fights are also another cool part about the game since they are a bit easy, but they are big and cool so you'll have tons of fun with that.Now that we have two main elements out-of-the-way let's talk about cosmetics. Lara's whole appearance has changed and she looks so much better. Gone are her sunglasses, and the F size boobs, along with her usual outfit. Lara has different outfits she wears throughout the game and they are all hot, sexy, and they make Lara look smart and sharp as well. Her breast size has been reduced to DD (boohoo...), her main outfit is now a brown belly top with shorts and I prefer this over the old. She wears an earpiece now and she no longer has a braided ponytail. Along with Lara looking amazing she also gets dirty and wet (ohhh if only...). When she climbs out of the water her clothes look wet, and dirt sticks to her as well so this adds to the realism. She also has a personal light now so exploring dark places is no longer a problem. The sound is also great with Lara's charming British accent, and everyone's voice acting is top-notch.With new characters aplenty you'll expect to like them all, but actually you won't. They are underdeveloped and wind up annoying you with their stupid comments over the radio so the only character you'll love is Lara. Apart from all of this the game has replay value with a time trial mode, Croft Manor (where you unlock certain areas to get rewards), and cheats. Doing all of this will grant you new costumes, concept art, profiles and more. So, as you can see, there is so much to love about TRL and fans who have hated the series can come back since TR is getting better and better as time goes back. Give the `ol girl a second chance and explore her tombs (awww yeah...)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Sturgeon","summary":"Best New Super Mario game yet","reviewText":"In my review of New Super Mario Bros 2 for the 3DS, my main complaints were that it was short and too easy. Well, this game certainly took care of those problems. There are ways to circumvent a lot of the content (Blooper's Secret Lair can bypass several worlds). But played straight, this game has a lot of content. I finally beat it yesterday and I still have a lot that I can go back and do. So for content vs. dollar price, you get your money's worth.It's also not nearly as easy as New Super Mario Bros 2. If you lose at a level enough, sure you can have the game beat it for you via the 'Super Guide' function. But lives aren't *quite* as plentiful here for you to lose and it won't let you beat the game like this. If you try to use the Super Guide on the last level, it will let you do it. But you only get a very abbreviated ending and it doesn't unlock anything like if you beat it yourself. So some challenges you absolutely must meet head on.The graphics are also amazing. Of course, this should be expected, being that the main pull of the Wii U in general is that Nintendo finally went HD. But this really does look amazing. Of course, the graphics do take a bit of a hit if you're playing on the controller instead of an HD TV. That's just to be expected. But even then, this game looks beautiful.This is an easy 5 stars. This game delivers on all fronts: Graphics, challenge, length, control. This is easily one of the best Mario games I've played in a while.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2013"}

Now I'm online and \"Fraggin like a pro\".The online experience is where this game shines.  There's nothing like getting together with 5 or 6 friends and blowing the crap out of each other (ha. ha.).But seriously, the way that you level up is refreshing and gives you incentive to keep playing.  The higher you rank, the better weapons you unlock.  But the best part of the multi-player is that it's accessible for everyone.  It's possible for anyone to just dropped in and take out a vet.All in all, it's one of the best shooters I've ever played.  I highly recommend this game for purchase if you have Live.

If you have not played any of the other games the story will not only be difficult for you to understand but it will also mean much less to you.

Proably 90-95% of the game is story.  And the text is painfully slow.  Which, I suppose, wouldn't be too bad if it was great writing.  It is not.It is written at what I would estimate is a grade three level.  The vocabulary, sentence structure, plot, characters etc are all very very basic.  There is also a slight tinge of racism in the game, so be forewarned if you are sensitive to that.  In terms of quality of story, I would equate it to a decent manga, nothing more.The small amount of gameplay has point and click adventure elements, and some puzzle solving.  But it is so sparse, that I cannot give the game more than 2 stars.Before purchasing, watch some youtube gameplay videos first to see what you are getting into.

Putting the game into my PS Vita and starting the game noticing a big difference of graphics from a regular PSP game from a PS Vita game. Just Like most all Sony games they push the system and utilizes all its features. Uncharted Golden Abyss does that.Controls:Uncharted: Golden Abyss uses all the features that the PS Vita has to offer. From the two analog sticks to the touch pad in the back and touch screen in the front. UC:GA plays just like any other UC:GA games but with added features. I find this a big Plus since it made the game more fun and challenging. The controls are little awkward at first since the PS Vita is bigger than a normal PS3 controller. The touch screen is use when need to throw a grenade or to dust of artifacts for clues. Also when getting close quarter combat the player most swipe his finger on the direction the game tells the player to swipe. When climbing the player could also use the touch screen to guide Nathan to climb with a single touch. The Rear Pad is used to climb a robe or to rotate an artifacts. UC:GA also uses the PS Vita's Motion Sensing to take pictures and other stuff. After awhile the player will get use to the controllers.Graphics:Uncharted series is well know for its graphics. Just like any other uncharted games. Uncharted Golden Abyss have the best Graphics so far on the PS Vita. The beauty of the game makes this game so good for a handheld game. the PS Vita is the closes you will get to a PS3 game and Uncharted Golden Abyss is the one that shows it. With some minor Screen tearing Uncharted does everything good on the Graphics.Sound:Uncharted: Golden Abyss have some amazing music. The Sounds Effects of the guns and explosions are the same as the ps3. The voice acting is perfect. Dont have much to talk about graphics.Story:Nathan is on another mission to solve a 400 year old massacre of a spanish expedition. With his old friend Jason and Marisa. Jason back stabs and leaves Nathan and Marisa to find the true about what happen 400 years ago and to find out what happen to Marisa's Grandpa. As the story goes Nathan goes to the extreme and with cinematic driller cut scenes and situations will keep the player entertain.Overall:Overall Uncharted: Golden Abyss is just like the other Uncharted games but portable. The graphics and sounds are there and the gameplay is the same. the story will keep you want to play more. It takes a good amount of hours to past this game and for added challenges one could go back and find all the artifacts and pictures. I will recommend this game to everyone who has a PS Vita and who love the uncharted series. this game could be the reason you want to buy a PS Vita.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2012"}

You get giant worms leaping in the sandy desert and blinking neon in the casino.Where in Pod Racer you had in essence a land speeder that could sometimes do jumps, in F-Zero GX you have a magnetic ship. Which means that you can in essence do any twist and turn the track can do - including spirals, loop-the-loops and MUCH more. It's like a super high speed roller coaster, and you can do the jumps too!You can work your way through 20 different courses and unlock 30 different pilots. You can customize your ship as you go in many different ways. The multiplayer gameplay is tons of fun and we've spent many hours enjoying that. Best of all, if you have a real life arcade near you with F-Zero in it, bring along your memory card!

{"product_name":"B00004SVV8","reviewerName":"Soulchild'sA'Comin'","summary":"Unique Mario game!","reviewText":"Every NES sequel makes it different from the first, so why not Mario?!  This is the only few games from the console that can get away with stepping out of the box to create a whole new different game, succeed at it, and make a second sequel by going back to the original format with some added features (Super Mario 3)!  For 1988, the graphics were top notch and the game play was appropriate for all ages.  Instead of a two player game with just Mario and Luigi, the game is a one player game of which you get the choice of two other characters, Toad and Princess Toadstool.  Each of them have their own special strengths and weaknesses when it comes to speed, jumping, and picking up items and small enemies (no stomping on this Mario game).  Luigi is the best jumper, Toad has the best strength and speed, Mario is second best at everything, and Princess Toadstool can float.  For the first time, a life bar is used instead of a automatic \"one hit, you grow small\"  You do grow small, but you get two more chances (depending on how many mushrooms you collect in the sub-level).  Once life bar can be replenished by collecting a floating heart (it comes after you defeat a certain amount of enemies in one screen).  The POW box returns (of which knocks all enemies from the screen) since the 1983 Mario Bros game.  Although this game is a hack from the Japanese NES game, Dookie Dookie Panic, it stands the test of time for all gamers and has been remastered and re-released a few times and its enemies (such as Shy Guys, Sniffets, Birdo, and Bo-bombs) returned in many future Mario games within the next 21 years along with the Original Mario enemies.  Although you may have Mario AllStars and Mario Advance 2, this is a great game to have in your NES library (if you have an NES) for that nolastagic energy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00006HBTW","description":"It&#x92;s a pretty bold claim but for many,Mario Partyis the best multiplayer game series ever. No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"SleepyJD","summary":"Just another money making scheme","reviewText":"I'm sick of mario party titles.

God of War may appear to be a button mashing beat 'em up at first glance, but look deeper and you'll find one of the most richly produced and rewarding games made in the past decade.  You play as spartan warrior Kratos, and you're on a mission of revenge against Ares, the God of war.  Armed only with your dual wielding blades and a few magic tricks, you take on a horde of deadly enemies and participate in some of the most epic boss battles ever crafted; ranging from mythical creatures such as the Hydra, the Minotaur, and Cerberus.  The game is easy enough to pick up and play and the combo systems and moves are incredibly done.  The game's storyline and voice acting are incredible for a video game, as what seems like a routine revenge tale evolves into something much, much more.  Graphically, you are not going to find another PS2 title that looks this good.  These are some of the absolute best graphics to ever grace the system, and there's virtually no slowdown!  The sound effects and music score are also some of the best you'll hear in a video game as well.  As you no doubt know already, God of War is also one of the bloodiest and most violent games you'll play as well, and it earns it's Mature rating for it's content, so be warned.

Right away I could tell that the controls were a bit touchy (the x-axis is way too sensitive and you can't change it) and that the fighting was rough.  Almost every encounter was a test of my will to continue.  I stuck with it and it got easier to deal, with better weapons and armor and just getting used to the game.  The maps and submenus are also hard to get used to.  Once you get a feel for the island and specific areas, everything makes more sense on the maps and experience, once again, proves to be the best route for figuring out the submenus.  There's a lot that could've been done better on this game.  That didn't stop me from enjoying it though.  I love action RPGs and I know that usually if you can give a game a good 5-10 hours before judging it, you can start to immerse yourself in the game enough to forgive, and almost forget, most of the flaws.  Now at a bargain price, this game definitely gives you plenty of time for your money.  Expect at least 40 hours, and that's probably not even close.  I always try to do everything I can in a game so I'm sure I've been playing it a lot longer.  Overall, this game is nowhere near top-notch but it's definitely worth a playthrough for any RPG addict.

But soon afterwards, the Joker breaks free and takes control of the Asylum with Harley Quinn and about 200 of his goons from Blackgate Prison. It's a very good story, and features some of the best Batman characters, such as Bane, Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, and Victor Zsasz.  There are also Riddler trophies scattered around Arkham city, and will take a long time to find them all. You'll have to use your different gadgets and abilities to find them all, and you are rewarded with character concept art and new challenge maps (more on that later). There are also patient interview tapes to be found throughout the island, and they provide an insight into the major villains and their personalities. They are very intriguing, and you'll find yourself laughing out loud and getting creeped out (looking at you, Zsasz!) while listening to them. The main story takes about 6-7 hours to complete, maybe even shorter if you've played the game already. While that may sound short, this is at least a 2-playthrough game with the difficulty achievements, and many more hours will be put in with finding all 240 Riddler trophies, interview tapes, and easter eggs.CHALLENGE MODE:Batman: Arkham City also has Challenge Mode, where you can do various combat and predator challenges on different maps, which are unlocked after collecting Riddler trophies. It's a very fun part of the game, and there are different medals that you can get for each individual mode that require a specific task to be done. After doing the challenge, you can check the leaderboards to see how you measure up against your friends and the world. After completion of the main story, you can unlock a new character to play as in Challenge Mode.OVERALL:Batman: Arkham City is a great game, which has a great story, awesome and interesting characters, many hours of finding collectibles and solving riddles, and a fun challenge mode that will keep you up at night. I would rate it a 9.5 out of 10, as there are just a few minor gripes with the game such as occasionally weak AI and graphics issues. It's a bargain at $20, so pick it up now if you haven't already. And don't worry if you're not a Batman fan, this will certainly fix that. :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2012"}

The only game that can rival it is the original Golden Sun.  \"The Lost Age\" has some beautiful graphics and incredible fight sequences.  Although the learning curve on it can be rather difficult, if you go to some of the eb sites out there about how to use your summoned monsters, you can figure it out after awhile.  I do think you will have trouble with it though if you don't do your own research, as the in game help and the manual do not really explain the fighting system well enough.When I first got this game, I thought that I needed to play the original in order to understand it.  While it does follow a storyline directly from the original, this game is perfectly capable of holding up as a standalone game, especially since the original storyline doesn't make much sense anyway.  This game does not really improve on the gameplay of the original in any way, and it's more of a continuation. The graphics, gameplay, and strategies are virtually identical.  One problem I had with it though, is that it is fairly linear.  You won't be able to advance much if you start exploring and wandering off.  Also, when you are asked a question, many times you are given two different choices for an asnwer you can give, however there is only one correct answer, and you will basically get the same response regardless of which answer you give.  For instance, if a character asks you if you want an apple, you can say A. Yes or B. No.  If you say yes, he'll say something like \"great, I knew you would!\"  If you say no, he'll say \"What? That's crazy, of coure you want an apple, take it!\"  It pretty much makes this option pointless.Lastly, some of the dialogue canbe REALLY long.  You can't save your game during the dialogue and sometimes you'll have to sit through ten minutes of speech.  It doesn't detract much from the game play however.Overall, this game provided MANY hours of game play, unlike a lot of games that you can finish in a few hours.

Dante sounds pretty cool, despite the whole \"I wanted to be the one to fill your dark soul with LIIIIIGGGGHHTTTT!!!\" line.STORY: There are not many cutscenes to open up the story very well, but the overall concept is interesting. Dante is a half-demon who hunts other demons. He has made it into a business called \"Devil May Cry,\" and he pursues the demons that took his mother and brother away from him. He is the son of Sparda, a demon that defeated the king of the demon world, Mundus, years ago.One day, a mysterios woman named Trish comes into Dante's office, telling him that Mundus is making a return.

Dante can also transform into a demon when you use \"Devil Trigger\" and he can inflict a lot of damage. The game is ranked, depending on how fast you complete a mission and how many items you used and such. A high ranking, while hard to obtain, can provide a lot of red orbs, which are used to buy items and upgrades for your weapons. Secret mission can be completed in order to expand your health, but they are quite difficult. In fact, the whole game is challanging, and I haven't even tried the other difficulties yet. Some of the bosses can be so annoying that you might slam your controller on the ground.In other words, it's a pretty awesome action game.BUY: This game is ridiculously cheap now, so not buying is not in the question. It's a must for the aging PS2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2009"}

The reality is even greater that you can imagine.  The developers at EA have put in a TON of time and effort into this, the baby and golden child of the entire &quot;BIG&quot; lineup.  And all that time, effort, love and determination have paid off and transformed into one of the most perfect and flawless games...EVER.SSX3 is one game that everyone should own.  It offers an amazing amount of flexibility and freedom, depending on the style that suits you.  You can either take a leisurley free-ride down the mountain and go just about anywhere - or you can take on the other competitors and challenge them to races, big air contests, slope style events, and even trick challenges like rail sliding and half pipe competitions.  This game is everything to everyone, almost as if they know what we are thinking and expecting out of the game...and then they went and did it!The control hasnt changed too much from the other SSX games, but they have added a cool new feature that you can use called a &quot;board press&quot;.  Use this move to string all the tricks together and rack up tons of points!  I have even strung together a 21x combo for some serious pointage.  And speaking of points, in this game they translate into cash.  Thats right, you have to buy your stats and boards with cash.  Points are only used for ranking purposes on the big air events and trick competitions.What can you buy with all this cash? Well....what do you want?  You can get new boards, pants, shirts, hats, gloves, backpacks, bunny ears, pumpkin heads, hairstyles, accessories and even ski goggles.  There are a ton of extras to unlock...new songs, playlists, DJ options and even unlockable characters.  The list is huge, the customization is endless and the fun is unlimited.The graphics are some of the best that I have seen, the loading times are minimal, and the mountain is awesome.  Outrun avalanches, dodge trees, blow through a blizzard and soar like a bird.  You can see for miles and miles and the game clips along at a hefty 60fps.  Truly an amazing experience to say the least.  I can find no flaws with this game...none whatsoever.  Perfect control, graphics, frame rate, loading times, trick system, ambiance and music.  This game is perfection, plain and simple.  Dont rent, dont borrow...just buy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2003"}

You're a skating dude in future-Japan, getting in with the local gang.There's a bad guy in town, of course, and his dirty cops are out to harass everyone. An underground pirate radio DJ is egging you on to take them out. Your tool for drawing them out is a spraypaint can. You go around through the well-detailed world, spraying your symbols on walls to mark your territory.The interactivity of the game is great. You can skate in the road and cars will slow down or speed up. Skate through the pedestrians to watch them jump out of the way or duck and cover. Skate through a flock of birds and watch them fly up and out, looking like real birds!You can knock over kiosks and bikes, customize which character you ride as, even customize all the differently sized spraypaint designs you use.And, of course, there's the skating. You get points for different cool skating moves, from 'Farside Stab Soul' to 'Abstract 360'. Ride the rails, do moves in the half-pipe, even ping off the walls. There's no time limit for most of the game so you can really explore and have fun. Plus lots of secrets make the game worth playing over!Yes, I suppose spraypainting downtown Tokyo isn't the noblest of possible aims, and the soundtrack gets a bit vulgar at times.

It requires an absolute lack of shame, since you'll be doing some pretty bizarre things, and a wacky sense of humor.The only real gripe I have for the game is that its multi-player aspect is a weak.  The majority of the games are all \"knock out\" games.  So if your friend makes one mistake, the game is over for him.  It makes for extremely short contests unless you have a ton of people playing.

Easy and Normal give you no challenge at all, but helps familiarize you with the maps, and also allows you to obtain some of the more elusive achievements (yes I am an achievement whore).  Advanced mode is pretty challenging but expert mode offers the greatest all around gaming experience.  I have been playing this since release date, have about 30,000 kills, so I have played through multiple times and it does not get old.  On expert you do not just shoot zombies, you have to map out your path, play with intuition, listen for all subtle infected clues and pray to God your teamates are not noobes.  Make sure your back is almost always against a wall, clear rooms slowly and methodically, crouch and melee OFTEN and make sure you teamates do the ame.This game should be a shoe-in for at least Game-Of-The-Year consideration. I continue to play this, and have convinced many of my friends on my friendlist to join the fun and all continue to play regularly.  This game will still be played in February when they release new maps and not since Gears of War or Culcept Saga has there been a game that will keep my interest past the first couple of weeks (not that trashy Gears of War 2 mind you).

If you said yes then this is the game for you! So many references that go back as far as season one and current ones from last season kept me laughing out loud. As I got into the first hour or two of the game I got worried that the turn based combat, magic and weapons/armor might not be intricate enough to hold my attention. Luckily the farther you go the more customization and options you have at your disposal. Here is a breakdown of the pros and cons as I see them.PROS:+ This game is a gift from the creators of the series. It&#8217;s obvious the amount of hard work that was put in!+ Its the funniest game I have ever played+ So many characters from the series...even Lemiwinks and ManBearPig+ A very satisfying and fitting twist in the story towards the end. Classic South Park plot+ So much attention to detail brings the city of South Park alive!CONS:-Pretty noticeable and annoying lag during loading as you move from one area to another, luckily not game breakingYou can finish the game in around 10 hours. 12-14 hours if you try and finish all the side quest and collect trophies. Is that necessarily a bad thing? For me, not really. Overall, this is by far the best console game adapted from a show/movie except other than maybe the Waking Dead. I had a blast playing this game which I would equate to watching a very long episode of the show.

You'll soon find that all of the characters and levels never change, and the Tekken Force mode does very little to improve. It, just like the game, gets old.

{"product_name":"B00D6PTMSW","description":"","reviewerName":"Stephen M. Lerch","summary":"If you have a guitar/bass already, $80 is cheap to learn to play","reviewText":"To be clear, you MUST own, or have one on its way, either an electric guitar or an electric bass. One or the other is required to learn using Rocksmith. Those old plastic instruments we all came to love and adore, then ignore, do NOT work with Rocksmith.Also, be sure you get what you need. If you have a previous version of the program, and already bought the guitar/bass to USB cable, you don't need to buy the cable included edition again. The old cable works just fine.Why does Rocksmit seem to work where DVDs and books fail? It teaches you actual SONGS, real songs, not wimpy, silly lullabies or children's songs. You want to learn Slayer? You can. This is the goal of pretty much every guitar player (not to play Slayer necessarily, but play a son in general!) - you want to play like your rock heroes. The books and DVDs are good with teaching basics, getting you started, but they tend to just whet your appetite, not get you on the fret like Rocksmith does.This being said, Rocksmith isn't easy. You won't likely be playing like Randy Rhodes after an hour or two. It will take practice, REAL practice, but... this is again where Rocksmith shines. You play games that help you practice. They can be fun, to the point that you don't really realize you are actually practicing. It's brilliant.You can adjust the difficulty to suit your needs. If you've ever played, I recommend starting in the 10-20 range, if you've never played, hit the bottom and work your way up. And the most important part: DON'T FEEL BAD STARTING LOW! You WILL get better if you stick with this crazy \"game.\"Where the game excels at teaching you is the \"riff repeater.\" If you have a part in a song that you absolutely just cannot get, fire up the riff repeater. This thing just adds to the brilliance! It lets you choose the speed and difficulty of the section - ramp up the difficulty as you seem to start learning the sections.Session mode, when I am good enough at actually playing, will definitely be fun. It's OK right now, but I don't feel like I know enough to really enjoy having a band backing up my playing. And it's cool because it tries to match how you are playing with a level of randomness - it's not just the same beat and riffs over and over.And it really does start at the beginning. Really, the beginning. How to hold a pick, tune your axe and so on. I say it again - it shines the brilliance of the entire package.AND THEN there is the option to use a TON of equipment, really expensive equipment in the real world, using just the 360 to simulate the tones and so on that only certain amps and equipment can lend the guitar.A note on configuration. When the pamphlet included tells you not to include your TV in the mix, and they tell you not to plug your system in w/ HDMI or optical, they mean it. I tried it and the lag really did kill the fun and the lessons. Please make sure you have this configured for the best option to \"win\" at it before playing, or you will be disappointed.Bottom line - if you've ever wanted to learn the guitar and not have to pay for a lesson every day, this is the best $60 (or $80 if you need the cable) you will ever spend. But like anything, you really only get what you put into it, so make sure to leave your mind open and give the program a chance to teach you. They say 60 days on Ubi's website, and if you stick with it I'm sure 60 days is more than enough to make you quite a few levels better than where you are. Well, unless you are a Randy Rhodes naturally.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2013"}

First, Duke Nukem was a PC game first and foremost but this iteration suffers from a serious case of consolitis.  I don't know if it's a console port but the mouse controls have the same wishy-washy movement all console ports have so I assume the answer is yes. Second, the game is just not that clever and the jokes are really bad.  I mean everyone knows Duke Nukem 3D had raunchy humor. A guilty pleasure is one thing, lack of timing is another.  For instance, an elevator cable snaps so the elevator's going down really fast.  So guess what the girl says when Duke saves the day?  Jokes are just not that funny when you're waiting for the inevitable punchline.Still, the gameplay is about what I expected and I don't think the graphics are nearly as bad as people say.  There seems to be a lot of, \"I don't like this game and I'm not sure why\" happening.  I do agree the A.I. is, well, not that smart. It was never going to live up to 10+ years of hype but it's not so bad you shouldn't play it at all.  If you enjoyed Bulletstorm, you'll probably enjoy this too.  Just wait for a sale price.One final gripe - why is it we have to wait for the game to reload and restart the exact same level if we die?

Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired.

The plot of the game is a bit far fetched but still believable. Some of the boss fights were quite interesting and challenging depending on what difficulty level you played the game at. It could be extremely difficult at times if you let it. The maps aren't extremely big to explore a lot but you definitely have enough space in most of the battles to fight the way you want. There isn't really much stealth to the game but I think they probably didn't want it to seem to much like a crysis/deus ex game in that regard. The fact the suit would &#34;over heat&#34; a lot when doing certain things could be kinda annoying because you wouldn't be able to do to many super human stuff. The transforming gun was a cool design as well. There are a few cut scenes in this game so if you have seen some Japanese games that have a lot of cut scenes you wont be to surprised. They can be quite visually cool. Unfortunately by the sound of it the game didn't sell well so don't expect a sequel any time soon if there is one. And some of you who have paid full price (50-60 dollars) might be let down. I was lucky enough that I waited till the game went down to 20 dollars before I purchased it. I would say it was worth that much to me but I am cheap so don't take that as meaning the game wasn't probably worth more. Its a bit of a short game but its one you probably shouldn't miss out on.

After spending hundreds of dollars in the console, games, etcetera... I had to return it after it stopped working 37 days after I purchased it... 7 days after the vendor warranty had expired... long story short, I returned it and decided to try the PS3... the best entertainment system I've ever had!I remember the old days when an entertainment system like Atari, Nintendo and the like used to play games and... that was it, just games... I've been amazed of all the things the PS3 can do: it outputs in full HD (using of course and HDMI cable), reproduces almost every single video/image format (at least all the popular ones are included), it's disc drive is a BD drive that also upscales DVD and of course you can play videogames (I just finished Prince of Persia... the graphics and the music were stunning, and the game was great)Never in my life had I used a console as much as I use this one. I can watch my family's pictures on our HDTV set while listening to music (I have a one year old son who loves to watch himself on the TV), we can watch both our home digital videos and videos downloaded from the web (music videos and the like), the access to the Playstation Network is free so I can log and download free content like themes, demos, trailers and buy games.Since I got this I decided I'd start buying my movies on Bluray to take advantage of the format and the player,  now I cannot watch a DVD and not think how good it would look in BD. The PS3 also does a great job upscaling DVDs to high definition, so you don't necessarily need to buy your old DVD movies in Bluray again as the PS3 not only will play them but will adjust them to high def.The one I got has 4 usb slots so if you don't want to use the hard drive included and leave that for games, you can use an external drive (like I do), simply plug it and enjoy watching videos, photos and listening to music.Add to all this it's elegant design and the Bluetooth remote and you can't go wrong.Do I sound excited with it? I am! I am actually thankful for having to return my old XBox360!Anyways, I just wanted to post this review as the general idea many people have of the PS3 is that it's just another video game console that also plays Bluray... this console was worth every penny.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2009"}

I even made a web site about the Wii...Now here I am a year later and I've barely touched it. Sure, Mario Galaxy is fun, and to some degree WiiSports hasn't lost it's charm... and Metroid, oh, wonderful and beautiful Metroid... but alas, this system is collecting dust. It simply doesn't have any of the games the Xbox 360 has been graced with, and it doesn't quite handle Blu Ray movies as well as my PS3.Smash Bros. may get some juice into it's circuit boards for a few weeks, and Mario Kart is coming in \"Early 08 - I mean April - I mean Early 09 - I mean...\" and that will surely rock.But is it enough?The Wii seems to present a limitless landscape of possibilities for games, but unfortunately, Nintendo doesn't know what the internet is and third-parties don't want to waste time with motion controls or big budget games.The result? It's like handicap children in a playground. It's not fair. It's not fun. It almost makes you feel kind of sad.Verdict? The Wii has nothing going for it.

{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Game of the year - so far","reviewText":"Having a bit of hype surrounding it before it's release, BioShock does not disappoint one bit.  In fact, as far as first person shooters go, games rarely get any better than this.  BioShock takes the FPS to new levels thanks to it's brilliantly realized atmosphere and setting, and a story that is so engaging you'll think that you were playing an RPG.  Taking place in a secret underwater city called Rapture, you get put right in the middle as things go very, very wrong quite quickly, and it's up to you to save the day using a barrage of traditional weapons, and some newfound abilities as well.  What makes BioShock so great besides the atmosphere and storyline are the character customization options which really allow the gamer to get into the game and tinker around to your advantage.  The overall presentation, from the sound design to the wonderful voice acting to the grimy atmosphere, make BioShock one of the best games to hit the XBox 360 yet, and definitely one of the best FPS' to come out in quite some time.  If there's any downsides to BioShock, it's that the game has a lack of enemy variety and that it is a little too forgiving to the gamer.  Despite that though, BioShock is a masterpiece of modern gaming, and any and every 360 owner should consider this an essential pick up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2007"}

But then I liked Gears of War and Shadow Complex games and since this was also being released by Epic, I thought why not give it a shot. After finishing the campaign mode and trying Ecos and Anarchy modes, I have to say I am quite surprised.***********PROS.***************-AWESOME COMBAT SYSTEM: This is the best aspect of this game. You can slide, leash to pull enemies, kick them and use variety of weapons with primary and second fire and pull a huge variety of combination off of them. At first you may feel like it may get redundant, but thanks to variety in levels, there are a huge variety of things you can do. Thanks to that you won't get bored till the end of the campaign.-VARIETY IN LEVELS: Other than awesome combat, there is plenty of variety in levels. Throughout the campaign you experience a variety of environments including the space, woody greenery filled areas, abandoned factories, building high in the sky that is about to fall apart and list goes on.-SURPRISES: There parts during the campaign where you will be surprised by certain events and the gameplay that will follow it. I really don't want to spoil it for you, but trust me you will like it.-GREAT GRAPHICS AND DECENT ART WORK: The first time I saw the trailer for this game, it really looked unpolished to me. But now that I have finished the campaign, I can say that since then they seem to have refined it quite a bit. Certain levels just look gorgeous. I guess never doubt the power of unreal engine.-VARIETY IN WEAPONS: There are 8 different types of weapons and that is not including the leash. Each weapons (including leash) has devastating alternate fire mode. There is just plethora of combos you can do if you mix and match these weapons. I personally enjoyed each and every one of them. Also, while some weapons may look and sound familiar from other games, they will play very differently in this game. For example with sniper rifle in this game you can change the direction of bullet after you fire it. I personally have enjoyed the variety very much.-UPGRADABLES: To top of each weapon is upgradeable with the skill point you earn by killing enemies in creative ways. This rpg element will truly encourage you to creatively kill enemies and get as many skill points as possible. While this rpg element is not as well thought of as other games, it still adds incentive to do your best.-ONLINE PLAY AND ECOS MODE: While not my favorites (see cons.), after you finish the game, you can stay busy by playing online multiplayer (anarchy mode) or Ecos mode which has the same levels as campaign but gives you stars on your performance.************CONS************-RELATIVELY SHORT CAMPAIGN: Hate how games these days have such short single player campaigns. Unfortunately bulletstorm is one of them. While I enjoyed each and every moment of the campaign I found it to be very short (~7-8 h max and that is because I explore a lot).-MINOR GLITCHES: I had my character stuck while jumping over objects at least 3-4 times. Unacceptable. All the games have glitches, but under no circumstances your character should be stuck like this. I mean you can't even kill yourself. Restarting the level is the only option.-MEH MULTIPLAYER AND ECOS MODE: Compare to some other games these days, I didn't enjoy the multiplayer so much. I got tired of it rather quickly. Also the Ecos mode felt the exact same as the campaign. I wish they had added more varieties.-LACK OF NEW GAME+ MODE: This is a game that can really use a new game+ mode (i.e. start with all the weapons you collected etc.). Unfortunately, it doesn't have it. So there are some really cool weapons and upgrades you get towards the end of the game. Unfortunately, if you want to use them again, you will have to play the game again and you will only get to use them for last few levels. Just very unfortunate.**********CONCLUSION****************Simply speaking I am looking forward to Bulletstorm 2. Partly because I enjoyed this game and partly I have faith in the developers that they will improve the weak aspects of this game. All and all I enjoyed pulling off crazy combos in beautiful, but destructible environments, but I wish they had longer campaign and had fixed some of the things described in the con section. I give this game 8.5/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2011"}

Now, working together with Rockstar Games' New York-based production team, Remedy has combinedMax Payne's hallmark gameplay with all new innovations and unmatched production values.Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payneis set to raise the bar for action games all over again when it's released fall 2003.","reviewerName":"Michael Pappalardo","summary":"Every bit as good as the original, and more!","reviewText":"Max Payne exploded onto the scene in 2001 with innovative gameplay using the 'Bullet-time' special effect that made 1999's hit 'The Matrix' so amazing.  Incorporating that effect strategically into gameplay was unquestionably difficult, but it was done so well that Max Payne became an instant classic with its noir, indie-movie style story told through 'Graphic Novel' interface, which is basically comic book inspired images with real actors and some great voice-overs.  Max Payne 2 retains all those features and more in this new and excellent installment.Gone is Max Payne's infamous 'scrunchie face' or 'constipation face' from the original.  He also talks in metaphors alot less than he used to.  All characters have been completely redesigned and are more life-like than ever, with fully animated facial features.  The new AI system allows some people to fight along side you, which can really help in a jam.  Since the AI is good, you won't find yourself on the receiving end of your computer allies' gunfire too often.  As you progress, the enemy AI adapts to your tactics, which keeps you on your toes.Bullet-Time is better than ever, and the death scenes in this game never cease to entertain.  Many people complain to no end about the 'ragdoll physics' on the bodies, which basically means that the dead  bodies flail into extreme positions, like a ragdoll stunt double would in a movie.  While these physics can be a bit silly (and at times glitchy), I personally think they make for some very entertaining death scenes.  At some points, when you defeat a crucial enemy or the last enemy in the area, the camera will pan around in slow-motion and show you the death.  Since the ragdoll physics apply to many other objects, watching your dead enemies fall into a pile of 2x4's, sending them flying all over the place, is very entertaining.The story in this game is just as good, if not better than the first game.  The new, haunting soundtrack is also excellent and sets the mood of the game perfectly.  Voice-acting even seems to be vastly improved over the first game, even though the first game had great voice acting to begin with.  The characters all have their own distinct personalities, and the game was just a blast to play.The game isn't short, but you could probably rip through it in about 8-12 hours of actual gameplay.  Alternate gameplay modes open up when you beat the game, adding replay value.  Overall, Max Payne 2 is an excellent game that is well worth the money.  The action-packed and dramatic gameplay sequences, great story-telling and music will keep you glued to your screen until the very end.  Definitely a sequel that lives up to and even surpasses the original.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2003"}

Of course, Diablo II with it's randomly generated baddies and weapons (and drops in general) was also mentioned. Seeing as how I played Diablo II and its expansion quite a bit when they were released, and absolutely enjoyed Fallout 3 (purchasing all of the DLC and even getting into the double-digit levels for a second evil/neutral player), this sounded like something I would enjoy. One thing I wasn't sure about was the first-person aspect, having a generally weak stomach for 'twitch' games.Because of this I decided to hold off until the price dropped, after a handful of months. But as I had a coupon that I wanted to use towards a game (since I was in one of those moods where I just needed something new to play) I decided to pick this up.==What I got==A pleasant surprise. Having just beaten the game after playing for around 2 weeks (with two batches of the flu in there) this is probably one of my favorite games of the last year; definitely in the top 5.==RPG elements==Borderlands has a fairly robust skill tree, for each of the four character classes, similar to Diablo II versus Fallout 3; the former having a small set of skills, within a couple of skill trees, that you can increase in skill, and the latter having a wide variety of skills, without too much in the way of skills requiring other skills. This makes it extremely simple, ignoring the decisions you have to make when gaining new skill points, to work with this element. In fact, the decision making process is fairly flexible, as you can always reset your skill points (without losing any) to try a different style.Having played a game with a skill implemention like this, I'll honestly have a slightly harder time going back to games that don't allow you to reset (although within the story this element makes sense).Speaking of story, it's actually much better than what I thought it would be, after the various reviews. The ending seems a bit abrupt, but everything is tied together, so it may be more an issue with the open-endness of the game. Which brings us to mission structure.There are seemingly well over a hundred missions, only a small quantity of which are required to advance the story. The rest serve to help increase your level (more on this later) to what is required for the story missions. Generally they tie into the story enough that it makes sense to just do them, especially for the rewards (whether you're going to just sell them or not).Back-tracking, an essential element of RPGs, is present in this game, but isn't too bad once you gain access to an 'instant-travel network.' With enemy respawns being fairly quick (approximately two in-game days, which seems to be less than an hour) and vehicles available for most large areas, the travel isn't tedious.==Shooter elements==Borderlands is a fairly standard FPS, made interesting by the art style it uses and the plethora of weapon choices. While there are a handful of weapon types, most weapons are randomly generated, making it fairly hard in the beginning and middle of the game to choose just four weapons (the most you can have equipped). Generally you'll probably have at least one or two kept in your backpack to swap in.This randomization and weapon type scope is what really makes this aspect of the game interesting, in my opinion. But when you add in class-specific skills, you end up with something completely more. In fact, I think it's fairly easy to miss out on the importance of your core skills, often forgetting to use them. I personally didn't use my character's skill all that often until near the end of the game, and having played with others online, that seems to be fairly common for lower-level first-timers. Perhaps that just serves to show the deepness of this game.As already mentioend, I have a hard time with FPS games usually, if they're twitch. While Borderlands can be, generally you survey the area and come up with some kind of plan; rushing straight at enemies at or above your level is suicide.Which brings us to the level aspect. Each enemy has a set level, excluding one-off mission-related enemies, which is consistent throughout the game. Higher level enemies give great rewards, but are also more difficult. This is the same with the quests/missions. Thankfully there's almost no grinding required (although I should note that I did all optional missions in addition to the story-related ones). Experience also changes based on this, so targeting lower level enemies eventually becomes near useless.Death is interesting in this, allowing you to get a 'second wind' if you kill an enemy before you bleed out. Failing that, a certain amount of money is deducted and you are resurrected at the nearest 'station' (saying no more in case of minor spoilers) ready to go back up against them.==Multiplayer==Borderlands offers on- and offline cooperative play. Offline coop is okay, with the split screen (side-by-side) a little hard to use. Online multiplayer (using Playstation Network) was fairly quick and without issue. You can choose what game you join, making it fairly easy to find a group at your level (or higher/lower if you so choose). (Unlike on Xbox, Playstation owners typically don't have mics, so I can't comment on communication.)Having let my Xbox Live Gold subscription lapse a few weeks ago, online multiplayer was actually the reason I picked this up for the Playstation 3; surprising since I usually don't care too much about online play with games.==Replayability==With a new game plus mode (keep everything, replay the story again with enemy levels increased) and four classes, as well as the online multiplayer and two currently DLC (with one more in the works), replayability is pretty high. Once I finish the DLC and a few upcoming games - Mass Effect 2, BioShock 2, and probably Heavy Rain - I'll be back on Pandora.==Overall==Overall, Borderlands is, again, one of the top 5 games I've played in the last year (in no particular order, Fallout 3, Muramasa: The Demon Blade, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, and Lost Odyssey, with Batman: Arkham Asylum getting bumped). A good, long, game, with an interesting story, and high replayability means I give Borderlands 5 of 5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002I08RA0","description":"","reviewerName":"AJ","summary":"Excellent, but not enough of it.","reviewText":"To me, the story comes very close to being as good as Assassin's Creed 2. Except for a few things.First of all, it's pretty short. If you're expecting a long main story, don't. First time through will probably take you about 1 hour per sequence. I did every side mission, all collectibles, all challenges, and every main story mission, and all 5 Desmond missions with 100% sync and got 100% completion in approximately 28-29 hours. No, it's not that much shorter than Brotherhood which took about 35 hours to 100% complete, but the side missions are really lacking. That's my biggest complaint. It would have been nice to see more of them, but every side mission that was available was a blast to play. I just wish the tombs were longer. I finished both in under 10 minutes combined(one with the signature edition). The main story was stronger than Brotherhood's, which is more important to me than the side missions so I'm satisfied there. The sequences are of the same length, but what makes it short is the lack of Desmond gameplay. In Brotherhood, there was probably 1-2 hours of Desmond gameplay. In this, there is maybe 15 minutes of it, and it is all cutscenes and a little bit of walking. Overall, my only complaint in the entire package is the lack of content. Besides that, it is an excellent game. If this is your first AC game, stop now and go start with AC 1. If you don't want to play it, which I understand, at least start with 2 and go from there. It won't make sense and won't be as fun if you start here. The gameplay is pretty much the same. If you liked Brotherhood's, you will like this. I don't like the den defense though. Uh.. yeah I've ranted on for a while now so on to the multiplayer.Not much to say here. Pretty much the same as Brotherhood but with some nice improvements that polish things up. A lot of fun but won't keep you hooked forever. For AC III I hope they scrap the multiplayer and focus on making a nice and long singleplayer with a lot of side content.Overall, a worthy package for any AC fan, and a fun game for those just getting into the series: just make sure not to start with this game.9.5/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2011"}

I don't think it's a stretch to say that the programmers of this game are probably some of the best computer programmers in the world. I love cut-scenes too in videogames and always have since Final Fantasy 3 back in the day, they add an emotional element to enhance the gameplaying experience.But this is ridiculous. The cut-scenes in this game go on and on and I grew very bored. Now if the story, dialogue and voice acting were good, then maybe this wouldn't be a problem, but in FFX the characters endlessly talk about things like a blitzball tournament as if it's some life and death event, and it failed to spark my interest. LET ME PLAY THE FRIGGIN GAME ALREADY AND BE QUIET!!! It's too bad because I love fighting various enemies with different strengths and weaknesses and leveling up and managing my weapons and armor and buying stuff and exploring, ya know the whole RPG shebang. In this game it's: walk ten feet-talk-walk another ten feet-whine-walk nine feet-cry-open a treasure chest-moan.There are good points to FFX, I enjoyed the sphere grid and the tons of weapons and items and the changing of characters during battles. And of course, I'd sit there agape in awe at the graphics on my 53\" bigscreen. I just hope that videogames don't keep heading in this direction, where you watch more than play. Metal Gear Solid 2 also fell victim to this trend. Although that story was more interesting.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2002"}

A Great RPG, and great story...","reviewText":"Little changes sometimes go a long way.Final Fantasy is the role-playing series that put Squaresoft on the map, and put Sony at the top of the console world.  There is a reason for this, the games are so much fun.  Like the former Final Fantasies, FFX puts the player in the lead of a group of motley characters as they embark on an epic story, one that usually deals with deceit, war, politics, and overcoming great evil.  This series is more focused than RPGs you find on your computer - freedom to choose your characters and path is replaced with a tight, emotionally engaging story that often takes you to amazing places and unbelievable circumstances.New to the endless battles is the option to use any character in your party, with Active-time gauge to force your decision.  This allows battles to be more strategic and thus more engaging, and special skills like Mug and Green Magic, which I rarely used in past games, as now easily available in every battle.The plot for this FF is the great, and most importantly, it refreshs the old repeatative themes of Final Fantasy and makes them seem new all over again, mainly by creating some wonderful characters.  These characters are my favorites of the whole  series, and came to life thru some great voice acting.  Much of the childish themes that really annoyed me in the earlier games have been replaced by some outstanding performances by older voice actors, and for the first time, some genuinely funny humor has been added to the game.Most locations are 3D, although there are still a few flat picture backgrounds, but they don't distract too much.  The worldmap has been replaced by 3D &quot;roads&quot; for you to traverse.  I found this to be a pain, as it makes the game very linear compared to older FFs.  Side quests seemed kinda tame, although Blitzball is very fun, a mini-sports simulator, complete with franchize mode.Overall, the best game on the Playstation 2.  Buy it today.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2002"}

Having only the PC version of Final Fantasy IX as a basis of comparison, I was amazed by the graphic richness of the new game.  This is not just a matter of higher powered engines and CGI wizardry.  It really springs from the artistic commitment of the staff designing and creating the game.Character design still shows its heritage from Yoshitaro Amano, one of Japan's greatest graphic artists.  In addition, the background and 'set' design is equally imaginative.  Massive use of CGI work simply makes all this magic spring to life with movement and gesture.  No less an effort has been spent on the game's sound and music, making the experience of the game intense, and sometimes even spellbinding.Tidus, a young blitzball professional, is thrust, mid-catastrophe, into the world of Spira, where an incredible monster (Sin) is gradually destroying the world as punishment for its ecological missteps.  He meets Yuna, who is a Summoner, capable of calling up Aeons as battle weapons.  Yuna has begun a voyage from temple to temple, a quest that must end in a confrontation with Sin to bring peace to Spira.  In typical RPG style, they and their companions follow a path of ever escalating monsters and challenges, culminating in a prolonged, exhausting final struggle.The story and dialog are fine, with a few twists to keep player interest, but for the most part it is predictable.  Since people come to this game looking for different things, the creators have tried to manage a difficult balance between narrative and play, and, for the most part, are successful.  The dialog is sometimes silly and sometimes touching, but it is never unbearable.This is an incredibly large game.  It is possible to stick to the basic story line, minimum leveling up and barely make it through the game in 50 to 60 hours.  A quick perusal of a good walkthrough quickly reveals that nearly half of the game is hidden from view, and that diligent playing can be very rewarding.  My time using the walkthrough was 90 hours, and there were still possibilities left unexplored.  Obviously, the game will stand up to replay.I have to give the game five stars.  I can quibble about storyline and some predictable gameplay, but there is too much that is simply outstanding.  This will be considered one of the peaks of RPG gaming for some time to come.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2003"}

Lots of action, puzzles, platforming, and that's what makes this game so great! It really was like playing a movie and I didn't want to put the controller down. The story, scenery, graphics, and voice action are awesome. More weapons to use this time which is cool. You can save during missions after you reach a checkpoint, and I like that. I really can't think of anything negative to say about this game. There are 26 missions, and I would say the average mission was 15-20 minutes. Of course towards the end, there are a few 40-50 minute missions too. If you have played Uncharted, then you definitely should check this out.

{"product_name":"B002I0F5I2","reviewerName":"Fani","summary":"Good continuation to Uncharted 1 and a vast improvement from UC1","reviewText":"For all the hype, I found Uncharted: Drake's Fortune to be a generic and simple Tomb Raider clone with very childish platforming, hundreds of baddies everywhere in an a desolate jungle (lol) and a story taking place entirely on one island. Still, the star of that game was the dialogs, voice acting, story and graphics (for the time). It felt like a movie more than gaming.Uncharted 2 happily does away with most of those annoyances for a vastly improved game. The graphics are good, loading times are non-existent and gameplay is improved. There are stealth sequences as well and you can approach many situations stealthily first (although you cannot complete the levels fully stealthed a la Hitman).Voice acting is again superb. There's Claudia Black lending her excellent, unmistakable voice for Chloe and the dude who does Nathan Drake's voice is perfect in voice, delivery and choice of words. The locales shift now and are more exotic. The story involves lots of double crossing and keeps you engrossed. The action is a little toned down this time around but one good addition is the make shift grenades which happen when you throw gas tanks around and blow them up.Overall, great game. If you like Tomb raider, you will like this game.Final rating: 8.5/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2013"}
