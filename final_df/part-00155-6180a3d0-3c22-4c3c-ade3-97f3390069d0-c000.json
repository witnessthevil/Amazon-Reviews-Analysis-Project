{"product_name":"B00004YUWA","description":"Icoweaves the tale of a young boy trying to escape his  imprisonment in a large, vacant castle. Along the way, he discovers another  captive--a beautiful princess named Yorda. Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play. Few games are as  elegant in their simplicity as this puzzler from Sony.--Raymond M.

I'm not a fast or great gamer, it's just that Ico is very short.  Too short for $...  On top of this, one major section is a mirror image of an earlier puzzle.  Also, there is little reason to play it a second time through, so why buy it?Otherwise, Ico is a wonderful, beautiful adventure game.  You play a young boy with horns, trying to escape from a mysterious castle.  The castle itself is gigantic, with towering walls that rise 400 feet above the ocean.  As you climb level after level, you can see the levels you completed below you, making the sense of scale mindboggling.  And while Ico has many bland, low-res textures that look really ugly, there is a wonderful glow to everything, almost as if you were looking at a painting and not a video game.  This game has some very beautiful moments.  Also, the plot is fairly engaging, and the ending is very satisfying - just be sure to wait past the credits.As for actual gameplay, Ico is pretty standard adventure game stuff.  You run, jump, push blocks, and climb rope.  There are lots of easy yet obscure puzzles, as you must open doors and pull levels to get from area to area.  Most puzzles are based on exploration.  Ico's biggest twist is the addition of Yorda, a princess who you must protect and escort out of the castle.  She can't go everywhere you can, and while you are off opening a path for her, monsters sometimes come to grab her.Rent this game first, you see everything in 1 weekend.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00000DMAX","description":"Mario Kart 64, one of the first games released for the Nintendo 64  platform, is an updated translation of the very popularSuper Mario Kartfor the  Super NES (SNES). And while the game clearly takes full advantage of the graphics  power and speed of the N64, a few components that made the original so compelling  have been left out of this release.Still, Nintendo's expertise at sucking players into the game world is strongly evident, andMario Kart 64offers enough challenges to keep players (especially casual  gamers) entertained. Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a  sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race  computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks.  Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting  power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels.  Grabbing and using on-track items is the heart of the game's fun: a strategically-placed  banana peel sends the unlucky victim into a spin, nailing an opponent with a turtle shell  launches their vehicle skyward, and a rocket provides a quick boost to near-breakneck  speeds, if only for a moment.The multiplayer mode provides enormously chaotic fun for up to four players--flip it on  at a party and watch the guests congregate around the screen.--Eric TwelkerPros:Well-designed tracksSimple controlsStrong multiplayer appealCons:Computerized opponents sometimes pull off questionable feats","reviewerName":"M \"Delicious Strawberry\"","summary":"Lotsa fun","reviewText":"The original Mario Kart for the SNES was fun, and a good effort for the limited capabilities of the SNES platform.

{"product_name":"B007FMSDU0","description":"","reviewerName":"Stacy \"Amazon Junkie\"","summary":"A Worthy Successor","reviewText":"As with the prequel to this game, Zero Escape is not for children. There is strong language, sexual innuendo, and a dark plot that could frighten/confuse younger players. While it is up to each parent to decide if their child is mature enough for a game, I seriously recommend that parents read the rest of this review before handing the game over to little Timmy or Susie.About a year ago, Aksys released a game called 9 Persons, 9 Hours, 9 Doors (999 for short). I reviewed that game and gave it high marks, and even now it remains my favorite game for the Nintendo DS system. You can imagine my excitement when I learned that a sequel was being released this October. As soon as I found the product I placed my order; I managed to finagle a 3DS, and to my immense happiness this new title would be compatible (indeed, the 3D rendering is very lovely, but I will cover that further down). With baited breath I loaded the cartridge into my 3DS; a software patch was required, but fortunately it did not take long to install. Within five minutes I loaded up the game and started my adventure in the realm of Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward.GameplayZero Escape, like its predecessor, is a puzzle game crossed with a survival story. The plot is simple: a group of people are kidnapped and forced to solve a series of puzzles in order to escape their captor, the mysterious Zero. Each character wears a wristband that guides the course of the game. Any attempt to remove the bracelet will result in the death of the wearer; it will only deactivate if the person dies or if they escape through the door with the large number 9 on it.In 999, players were introduced to the Nonary Game. Zero Escape also features the Nonary Game, but the gameplay is markedly different. To compare to the previous title, here are some key aspects of the gameplay. This list is informative for both fans of the series who played 999 and newcomers who are intrigued by the game description:1. After you \"beat\" the game/arc the first time, you can skip both the dialogue AND the puzzles. This is a vast improvement over 999; while you could skip the narrative, you had to solve the same puzzles over and over again for the playthroughs, a tedious and boring task by the third or fourth attempt. As an additional bonus, you can select an autopilot feature so that you will not have to hit the A button after each sentence. If there is any action on the screen you will need to reactivate the autopilot, but this is a minor inconvenience, at best.2. The possible flow of each arc is represented in a flowchart that you can access at any point from the lower screen menu button. This is WONDERFUL! One of my biggest frustrations with 999 was the relatively random aspect of finding the ultimate endings in the game. Zero Escape has a whopping 24 possible endings, and having to flounder through the different paths and trying to find each ending would be a nightmare. Combined with the game highlighting previous choices that you made, you can easily see which path that you are following and how far down which arc you are traveling. You will still need to repeat certain sequences, but with the improvements made in my point 1 above, it is far less time-consuming (and frustrating).3. The story is just as dark as the first game! 999 was known for the intricate storyline that drew the player into a world of intrigue and mystery. Zero Escape is no different, with each decision drawing out more and more details about both the story behind their capture AND the backgrounds of the people who are your fellow prisoners. In tandem with my first point, there is a robust menu option that saves each piece of information that you find (and has empty places so you know what you are missing, although you do not know where that information will come from). This information is still accessible even when you complete an arc and start over again from the elevator (the puzzle that starts the game). For example: each room has a safe. These safes are the key to beating each puzzle. While you have the option of re-solving puzzles that you have previously beaten, you can also just reference your notes for previous passwords to the room safe, open it, get the key, and move on to the next scenario.4. There is more than the Nonary Game factored into your gameplay. Unlike in 999, there is also a secondary set of challenges that are completely \"random\" (insofar as the personality matrices of NPCs can be). While you still have to divide into groups and visit different rooms and solve puzzles to escape, after each room there is a Vote. You will enter a room with either a partner (if you have one that round) or solo, and cast a vote: will you Ally with your other team (each person has a Yin to their Yang), or will you Betray them? There is no action to each option; the vote is basically a Yes/No type question. But... the input is CRITICAL to your survival. While failing to solve a puzzle will not immediately kill your character (as in 999 there is an infinite amount of time to solve each room, but you cannot progress unless it is solved), the choices that you make AND the NPCs severely affects YOU. If they Betray you, and you have lost enough BP (Bracelet Points), you will die. Conversely, you can also EARN points. If you reach 9 points, you can walk out of the warehouse and on your way to freedom (... I have not beaten the game, so I say that with a ominous tone... oooooh).5. Bracelet Points are separate from the room puzzles. Every character starts out with 3 BP. You can only earn/lose BP through the voting, which only occurs after the puzzle element is completed. So basically the progression is: Story/Narrative Mode --> Puzzle/Escape Mode --> More Story/Narrative -->Voting --> ??? The voting aspect of the game is random, and you really have no way of knowing how your opposing team/person will vote. Could you buy the vote? Maybe... Can your vote be bought? Maybe... The only way to find out is to play the game!Puzzles in Zero Escape are similar to the puzzles in 999. You use your stylus to select objects. Items that you pick up can be examined in the menu, and some objects may be combined with other items to create new ones. The only complaint that I have about the room search is the minor difficulty in navigating each room. You are able to use your stylus to move around and view the room. This is tricky, at best. There are times that I became so frustrated trying to use the stylus to look UP that I wanted to chuck my 3DS. I ultimately used a combination of navigation options: I used the toggle to look around and selected specific things to investigate with the stylus. Gameplay was much smoother using this method.Overall, Zero Escape improves upon the successful formula from 999: you can now skip both narrative AND puzzles when playing through the game again. In addition, you can reference previous finds from rooms and also use a flowchart to see how you are progressing toward the endings in the game. These new features work to make Zero Escape even more addicting than 999!Sound & VisualI am playing this game on my 3DS, so I will comment upon both the 2D and 3D views. The flat 2D view is roughly the equivalent of 999: the game is colorful and the atmosphere is suited to the storyline. The warehouse setting is full of steel walls/doors, and minor details such as rivets and rust help to bring the world of Zero Escape to life. The 3D view is nice: the character models are rendered in such a way that they look better when viewed in 3D. Their faces are smooth and designed to move around in a 3D environment. In terms of the atmosphere in 3D, the game is nice and it adds a certain element of realism, but is not really necessary to enjoy the game. While not quite gimmicky, the 3D aspect is a nice feature to help add depth to the story.Sound-wise, the game is excellent. One of the bigger complaints about 999 was the lack of voice acting. Zero Escape features extensive voice casts that are professional and suited to the character. If desired, the voice acting is skipped along with the narrative side of the story. Also the voice acting is muted during a lot of the Escape scenarios. That being said, there is a LOT of text to this game. You will realize that the first time that you set the game on autopilot for another playthrough.The music for the game is suited to the atmosphere, and is well-done. It is ominous and a little creepy, which suits the environment of Zero Escape perfectly. That being said, it is nice to listen to but at times I turn off my volume and play in relative silence. The text of the game helps fill the rest of the \"creepy\" atmosphere, so while the music is an enhancement it is not a prerequisite.OverallZero Escape has lived up to my expectations and I would imagine those of the fans of 999. Be forewarned! You will get sucked into this game for hours, dutifully trying to find each ending and further filling out the backstory. Why are they there? Why are some of the characters from the first game being forced to play the Nonary Game again? Who is Zero? What is Radical 6? All of this, and more, can be answered by playing Zero Escape. If you want a great puzzle game with an engaging story and a more mature storyline than most DS fare, this is for you. Sit back and prepare to solve the new Nonary Game and escape from the warehouse!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005MO5G","description":"Although the game will seem very familiar to Sonic fans,Sonic  Advanceis an entirely new creation that's been built from the ground up.  The gameplay, graphics, and sound borrow from the classic Sonic games on the  Genesis and are successfully translated to the Game Boy Advance. The game's  single-player modes are relatively short 2-D platform rounds--each run takes two  to three hours--but replay value is added through the game's various characters.  Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy each have different abilities that make getting  through the game a unique experience.The real star here is the game's link capabilities. The Chao Garden allows you  to raise your little critters and upload them to the GameCube via thelink cableandSonic Adventure 2:  Battle. Having one cartridge lets up to four GBA players compete in one  minigame. Gamers can play two additional minigames if each player owns a  cartridge. Although the single-player game is quite good, the link options give  the title tremendous value.The only notable problem stems from the series itself: There are still entirely  too many cheap deaths resulting from the title's high-speed gameplay. You'll  find yourself zipping along a level only to be hit by an obstacle you had little  chance of seeing, let alone avoiding. Ultimately, the only way to get past these  hazards is to memorize where they are.

You must collect golden rings for energy, and when you get hit, the rings shower out from Sonic, forcing him to collect more. For those of you who know about the Sonic games, this game goes back to the old Sega Genesis side scrolling adventure types, only with the Gameboy Advance this makes for better, more detailed graphics, more incredible landscapes for Sonic to zip around and four playable characters (Sonic, Knuckles, Tails and Amy). There are six \"zones,\" with two \"acts\" and at the end of each zone is Dr. Robotnic in a different killing machine each time, such as a giant swinging hammer, a giant pogo, a floating machine that makes spikes fall from the ceiling and so on.

It's the spiritual successor to the True Crime series and is a Far East take on the GTA series.The game, unlike the GTA series starts off with a big bang and also attempt to streamline some of the GTA elements by keeping you focused mostly on the missions at hand.  So far from what I have experienced, the game itself has great writing as well as great voice talent as it tells a not so common story of an undercover cop trying to infiltrate the Triads in Hong Kong.One of the big aspects that I like in this game is the ability to incorporate some RPG elements in the game a'la SWKOTOR style. You get XP in 3 areas:  Face XP (general public opinion), Triad XP (Triad devotion) and Cop (Cop devotion).  You earn these in varying degrees based on how much or how little damage you do as you rampage through the streets of HK on your missions as well as your side missions.Another aspect that some may enjoy is the combat style which was lifted from the Batman: Arkham series.  You earn points by the number of combos and counters you pull off and while its nice on paper, occasionally it doesn't always work in game as sometimes you almost have to wait for enemies to attack to pull your moves.  Another aspect to these attacks are enviromental bonuses you get for things like throwing enemies into dumpsters, electrocution and other sick moves and these moves can be leveled as you rpogress in the game.One of the best ways that Sleeping Dogs has taken at trimming the fat from the game is that within a few hours of playing you can earn a lot of cash for things like wardrobe, cars and other items to get your gangsta on as opposed to the GTA series where earning certain perks takes a lot longer to get.As far as the environement itself, it's very lifelike and you will hear English mixed with Cantonese and the city feels alive and spawling.  Even the passersby have a somewhat more lifelike feel than what I have seen in GTA.Graphically, in some areas, the game does feel a bit dated as if this was done a few years ago, this would have been a great answer to GTA and Saint's Row but for what it is with tight story telling and action, this game really is what Stranglehold (another great Far East crime game) from 2007 should have been.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants.

So why four stars?  Mostly because of some systemic issues that I came across and one thematic reason that didn't fit well with me.  Other than that this game is simply brilliant.  Taking Star Wars into the realm of role playing was obviously a great idea.  The tabletop game looks fun as it is, but to branch into the realm of video games, I suspect, is just as fun.  I've played Star Wars games on and off since \"Dark Forces II\" came out years ago, but I wouldn't say I'm an absolutely die hard fan of them.  However, I'm hoping \"Knights of the Old Republic\" will spawn a long running string of similarly designed Role Playing games!RPG's are probably my favorite format for video games (I still haven't decided if I really like them more than FPS or if they simply tie).  The game that really got me into RPG's was Diablo and it's because it didn't use the very common turn based system that was used in games like Final Fantasy.  Now a huge amount of RPG's released over the years have followed this kind of methodology in copying the fast paced Diablo format where the user gets to hack away at enemies in a button mashing frenzy.  \"Knights of the Old Republic\" uses more of a turn based combat system.  Which I really didn't think I would like at first, but I didn't mind it to much in this one.  It gives you the time you need to setup your attacks and choose force powers if you want to use them in combat.  Some people might find this boring because you don't have to really physically participate in the combat, instead simply watch your character execute the moves, but I still managed to enjoy my time in this game.  At least I get to manually control where my character goes and whom I interact with.  I personally found the game play enjoyable.Another major plus for this game is that you definitely get your moneys worth!  I logged nearly 60 hours in my process of completing this game and you can play the game multiple ways!  Basically if you play it as a Dark Side character you get different options than you would a Light Side character, and each side has different endings.  This at least makes it worthwhile to play through the game twice logging approximately 120 hours of game play in all!  This, of course, is provided it doesn't go faster the second time around... which it probably will take less time.Anyway, I played through the game as Dark Side and this is where my initial hang-up came in.  Based on the movies and other things I've read in the Star Wars universe I just didn't feel like they really captured the ethos of the Dark Side.  In this game you had to do randomly cruel actions in order to earn Dark Side points and I really didn't like that.  While the Dark Side is unforgiving and cruel, I don't feel it's a chaotic cruelty.  It's more of a measured cruelty that's motivated by a need for power.  Arbitrary cruelty doesn't really have much of a result in this game, you don't gain anything from it (other than Dark Side points) and I just think that doesn't work towards the true Dark Side motivations.  Now I've played both \"Knights of the Old Republic\" games and I really liked two better in this regard.  I think it captured the Dark Side much more correctly.  Whereas in this one it's very difficult to actually play as a Dark Side character most of the time.  In some situations I didn't have any option, but to give an answer that yielded me Light Side points and this just seemed stupid to me because my character was so heavily weighted to the Dark Side at that time.  Not to mention one of the major ways you earn Dark Side points is by being mean to your own team, this just seemed foolish.  If you were really Dark Side you wouldn't be blatantly mean to the team you were leading, you would coax them into wanting more power or vengeance etc.  This doesn't come into play until the second half.  The only time I really felt like I was truly playing a Dark Side character was when the big plot twist was revealed, after that I got very heavily into the story line and moved this game up a notch in my rating scale.  (Very very VERY awesome plot twist by the way!)The second issue I had with the game was how heavily laden the game was with glitches.  Now I tried playing through it on my Xbox 360, so you'd think the game would actually process smoother, not so at all.  It is especially jumpy during talking sequences between characters and it has an extremely difficult time processing a battle with a large amount of enemies.  This becomes detrimental in the later battles on the Star Forge where you have to fight through so many Sith that the system can barely process all the blaster fire and light saber duels!  Now, I also tried playing this game on my original Xbox a long time ago and basically what happened there is it had an in game error and crashed the whole system.  My original Xbox never worked again and I had to purchase a new one, thus I played this on the 360 to hopefully avoid that.  Well, the glitches are still rife throughout my game play, but at least it didn't destroy my Xbox this time.  (Please note:  The game more than likely didn't destroy my original Xbox, but probably had more to do with its age and the amount of use it had received over the years.  I just have a natural fear now that it happened!)Overall this is an incredibly good game.  It's pretty well thought out and probably a superb game if you play as a Light Side character, because the story-line probably has a much better flow.  You visit multiple worlds throughout this game and each world is simply HUGE.  It's one of the reasons it takes so long to play the game, especially if you like to play a game thoroughly like me (i.e. making sure every inch of a map is shown).  Again, the major flaw, to me, aside from the programming glitches, was the Dark Side story line is lacking.  Anyway, I think the processing would have been superior on a PC at this point.  I would definitely list this as one of my must play RPG's, because despite it's flaws it really is that fun and if you're a die hard Star Wars fan, I doubt you'll be disappointed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2008"}

Most of them have been flight simulations that, while decent, get stale very quickly.  Knights of the Old Republic changes everything.  Not only is this one of the best Role Playing Games in a long while, it is quite possibly the best Star Wars game period.You start out by choosing your character class.  Depending on the class you pick, you will have a certain amount of hit points, number of skills, and unique abilities when you level up through the game.  For example, the soldier class will yield a stronger character with more hit points, but a scout character will start you out with points in abilities like computer hacking and repair, and you will level quicker and possibly gain more 'feats' (special abilities) per level, but ultimately be much weaker in hit points.The game itself is somewhat typical of an RPG.  Talk to NPC's and get quests.  There is a main mission throughout the entire game but there is a vast number of side mission for you to complete.  Combat is real-time, though it is a form of turn-based real time in that you will input a command and wait for your action to be performed, but the action will never stop.  When you finally gain the use of force powers, combat will be taken to a whole new level of fun and challenge.  Chances of hitting are based off 'D&D;' rules with rolls of dice.  It is computed randomly, and there is good chance of scoring a hit, but at the same time there is every bit as much good of a chance you will miss.There are some mini-games, such as a card game called Pazaak, which is basically a modified game of Blackjack.  Other games include Swoop Racing, quite similar to the Pod Racing popularized in Episode I and its respective games.  There are also brief stints where you must face ships in combat in outerspace.  It is basically a shooting gallery, and is very easy.  The core gameplay revolves around the RPG game.The story is very intriguing.  There are many characters who will join your group as the game progresses.  Some are optional, some you might just pass by, and some you might inadvertantly kill before they join you if you aren't too careful!  The characters all have their own little stories and even sidequests that will open up as you talk to them more and more.  Some of the characters, like Canderous Ordo, a grizzled Mandalorian veteran, add a distinct personality to the game.  There are also shocking and surprising twists towards the end of the game that will completley blow your mind, and it keeps the game exciting.  The ability to lean toward the dark side or light side of the force is a fun little aspect of the game as well, and it does have a direct effect on the game's storyline and outcome.  As a fun bonus, as you lean more towards the Dark Side, your skin will become ghostly white and veiny, ala Emperor Palpatine from the movies.  You will also get more vicious, with evil and manipulative responses for conversations.  You earn Dark Side or Light Side points by making decisions and triggering events in the game.  You must be careful...if you lean toward the dark side you will inevitably bar yourself from more of the game's features and easter eggs...but being evil is so much more fun.Some of your characters will also interact with each other.  For example, having two characters with similar backgrounds in your group for extended periods of time may yield a conversation between the two of them.  Often times the conversations could be heated and negative, other times the characters will get along quite well and be very friendly.  It is little bits like that which make the game a blast to play.  Talking to NPC's can get very boring, however.  Since many aliens don't speak English(Basic, for SW fans and game terms), they repeat the same gibberish over and over and over.  And it also takes them about 30 seconds just to say 'Thanks and goodbye' since they talk so slowly and mutter so much gibberish.  I often found myself speed-reading through the text and skipping along since I had no desire to listen an alien spout 'jibba wubba flubba bobo' 7 times in a row.Despite the game's pros, it is not without its faults.  For starters, it is extremely glitchy.  Many times the game would momentarily freeze, and then start up again while in the pause menu.  Other times during combat the character would suddenly warp to another part of the area, leaving your other teammates to fend for themselves, often times unsuccessfully.  Sometimes you will freeze during combat, unable to move or execute commands (from a glitch, not from a gameplay status).  Sometimes, characters will die in the middle of a conversation, ending the game.  How or why that happens I don't know, but it is particularly annoying to be in the middle of an involved conversation, and then mysteriously drop dead for no reason.  Other glitches include your teammates wandering off, leaving you to fend for yourself, most of the time unsuccessfully.  They will either become stuck on a corner or will just not participate in the fight, making them useless.  This game easily could've spent another month, maybe even 2 months, in development.  I'm surprised it was released with so many obvious and detrimental glitches.The game gets extraordinarily hard at the end.  While it is to be expected, since it is the end of the game, there are some parts where it is just too overwhelming.  This adds easily another 5-15 hours in the game, dying and restarting.  Thankfully, you can save anywhere, at anytime.  And saves are unlimited.  This makes for an excellent gameplay experience.I highly recommend this game to any Star Wars fan.  Even non-Star Wars fans may be intrigued by the game's sheer excellence.  Despite its problems, SW:KotOR stands out as possibly one of the best games i've played, and definitely one of the best games on the X-Box.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2003"}

Mcmahon","summary":"Great game, but quickly over","reviewText":"I've got all of the Call of Duty series games for the PC and this one holds up as one of the best. There are many action sequences in CoD4 that are very reminiscent of the previous games and a few that are a complete departure from the past. Since the plot line for Call of Duty 4 is fictional, some of the realism is missing, but you do get the flavor of modern combat revolving around special forces operations and the Marines. There are some missions where there is a \"joint\" operation involving the British SAS and the US Marines. This is far-fetched and a bit silly, but the missions are still fun to play.I found the most interesting, replayable, and just plain fun missions to be outside of the main plot lines. These are specifically the AC-130 Specter, sniper in Chernobyl, and the Epilogue VIP rescue on a flying passenger jet missions. These missions are are either not part of the main plot or are in the past, or in the case of the AC-130, a 10,000 foot view and playing God with huge firepower.The only problem with CoD4 is that if you're pretty good at not getting killed, the game is over rather quickly. There are some difficult situations to get by, especially in the higher difficulty levels. The game seems to rely on the player having to repeat the same sequence over and over to stretch the game play out. The reality is that if you don't have to replay the same spot over and over to get by, you can finish this game in about 4 hours. You have the feeling of having seen a lot, but all the same, not enough.The multiplayer game is quite good, although there are a lot of hacks out and even with punkbuster you'll run into cheaters racking up huge numbers of kills. Leveling up in multiplayer unlocks many perks and weapons over time. There are 55 levels and by now nearly all players are level 55. The multiplayer maps are not well varied, they are all nearly the same with narrow streets, spaces, and alleys. Very few have any open terrain at all and those that have a little don't use the space where you can play tactically (e.g. steep open trench or canyon with high ground and cover on all sides). This is very much of a street to street brawl with short life-span type of game.Overall, I give the game 4 stars because the single player aspect could be much better if it was longer. The multiplayer could do with some open terrain and the larger maps from the single player game. It's a lot of fun and definitely worth the purchase price.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2008"}

This is the first FF to feature a submarine, and soon you will get an airship that can be used as a boat and a sub. Cool.GRAPHICS: Very good for the time. Not as good as FF6's, but still decent.MUSIC: Not as strong as others, but this game still has some memorable tunes, like Gilgemesh's theme.STORY: Not the best FF story, but it has a great plot filled with twists.ADDED EXTRAS'S: Just FMV's at the beggining and end of the game.

This and FF7 are arguably the best entries.GAMEPLAY: This game is the first FF to have a long range of characters and hidden characters, and it is the first FF to allow you to switch them. Each character has a unique ability and you learn magic through summoned Espers.About halfway through the game, the gameplay becomes sidequest-filled and non-linear. Once you get the airship back, you can go to the main villians lair, but if you do and don't bother with the secrets and sidequests, he will defeat you quite easily.Also, who can forget the infamous opera scene?GRAPHICS: Very excellent.MUSIC: Another high point. From the boss music to Kefka's theme, it all rocks.STORY: A very great story with lots of twists. Kind of reminds me of Star Wars in some places.ADDED EXTRAS: Just another FMV scene and they didn't get Terra's hair color right. (It's green, not blonde!)OVERALL: An RPG masterpiece, no questions asked.OVERALL FOR PACKAGE: You can probably find it for $15. And it's a steal for 2 epic RPG's.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2005"}

I'll just share my initial reactions after unboxing my Wii U Basic last night.The box for the Wii U contains an owners manual and \"Quick Start\" guides in English, French, and Spanish. There's also a card advertising Club Nintendo; you'll get a hefty 160 points for linking your Wii U to your Club Nintendo account, which is more than halfway to Gold Status (you'll get a calendar or some other crappy gift if you hit 300 points in a year). Nintendo giveth and taketh away; unlike previous systems there's no warranty extension for registering a Wii U with Club Nintendo.You'll get an AC adapter for the Wii U console, as well as a charger for the GamePad. You'll also get an HDMI cable to attach to a TV (if you prefer to use your old component (YPbPr) cable or composite (RCA) cables from your Wii, you can do that as well). Finally, you get a new Wii sensor, but no Wii remotes. The Wii sensor is the same as on the Wii, so if you it set up for your Wii already, you can just swap your old one out and swap this one in (you can save the sensor in the box in case you need a replacement or you want to resell it).The Wii U itself is sleeker than the Wii, with rounded corners and a slightly longer body. It's still much, much lighter and more compact than either the Xbox or the PS3. The unit has four USB ports and an SD card slot. A lot of people are decrying the fact that 8GB won't hold a lot, but you can effectively expand the memory by using USB jump drives, SD cards, or even USB hard drives that you probably already have for your camera or PC. From that sense, I didn't see the memory size as as much as a downside as others.I wasn't sure what to expect from the GamePad, but my first impressions were very good. It's comfortable to hold, and the joysticks and buttons are easily accessible by your thumbs. I was impressed by the crystal clear picture quality, and the surprisingly loud and clear sound coming out of the two stereo speakers. There's a little slider on the back of the unit where you can adjust the volume, and there's a headphone jack. Something I missed at first was the stylus at the top of the unit that pops in and out of it like on a DS. While you can use either your finger or the stylus for most touchscreen interaction, the stylus does keep the screen free of fingerprints, plus it gives better precision on certain games.There's also a camera and a microphone built in--a clever differentiating move considering that Xbox and PS3 cameras are usually on the other side of the room. It'll be interesting to see what applications developers come up with for these. Nintendo has already released a small handful of cool applications that make use of the camera such as Video Chat and the ability to make a Mii from your real face (similar to the 3DS). One of the most anticipated features of the GamePad will be the ability to use it as a TV remote. RIght now you can turn your TV on and off, but in the future the TVii app (which will be a free download in December) promises to let you control your TV from your GamePad; if this means the end of confusing, esoteric universal remote controls, I'll welcome it.Setting up the hardware was pretty simple, just plug in the AC adapter to the console, plug in your HDMI cable to the TV, and plug in either your existing or your new Wii sensor.I wish I could say the software setup was as simple. Let's put it this way: I started the process at about midnight, thinking it'd take about 5 minutes. I ended up going to bed at 3 AM. It's not a terribly complex process (you actually get your first taste of \"two screen action\" as you use the GamePad to make your choices, while detailed instructions can be read on the TV), but it does drag on and has a few awkward moments. But it's critical to make sure the process completes without interruption; some people are reporting their units are getting bricked if they power down in the middle of the update.You start out by syncing the GamePad to the console, which is simply a matter of pressing the red \"sync\" button on front of the console and the same kind of button on the back of the GamePad. Once you do this, you'll be able to control the console from the GamePad (including turning it on and off).You start by setting the time and date, which was disappointing to me; it's the 21st century, and there's no reason they couldn't have put the Wi-Fi setup up front so the system could pull this from the Internet. You then confirm the resolution of your TV, which read a glorious 1080i. You can configure your GamePad to turn your TV on and off (I decided to hold off until TVii becomes available), and then as with the Wii you designate the position of your sensor bar. You, of course, have to accept the obligatory legal stuff, and then you get to the Wi-Fi setup.Wi-Fi setup was a snap. The system found my Wi-Fi network right away, and unlike other devices I could walk my GamePad over to my router and key in the WEP key without running back and forth or using up Post-It notes. You do all your typing on the GamePad; the digital keyboard was a little small for my fingers, but I made do.The next step is when the system asks you to connect to the Internet and check for updates. It took, I kid you not, a full hour for it to download the latest update and install it. So if you're giving the Wii U as a gift, you might want to open the box and set it up for your recipients first if you plan to play it with them.The next step is setting up your user accounts. I found this part very, very confusing, but I figured it out. Basically, you have to create your personal account on your console first, including creating a new Mii with a nickname and month and date of birth. Once you're done with that, you'll have the option of linking that account to what's called a \"Nintendo Network ID\", which is a completely separate process where you set up a username, full date of birth, and e-mail address, and you have to confirm the account via e-mail. The Nintendo Network ID is optional and not required to play most games, but to get the most out of the online experience, as well as be able to download apps and make purchases, you'll need to sign up for it.Now the burning question I had, which I couldn't find an answer to easily, is how can I get my Mii from my old Wii? After all, I spent a long, long time getting him perfect and I've grown quite attached to him (I tried to re-create him on the Wii U but it didn't quite look the same, and when I tried to create a Mii from my photo, it was a cool process but a little too lifelike for my taste :P). The good news is that it's possible to grab your Mii's from your old Wii, but the bad news is that it's a pretty convoluted process. You basically have to go to the \"Wii menu\", go to the Wii Shop Channel, download a Channel called \"System Transfer\", and follow some pretty complicated steps to transfer your old system data to a SD card (512K or greater) with both consoles attached to the Internet. I ended up doing this a few days later and it took yet another hour, which I wasn't thrilled with.Which brings me to the second thing I found a little off, which was the fact that there's a \"Wii U menu\" and a \"Wii menu\". My guess is that they're trying to relegate all the gaming related stuff to the \"Wii menu\" and start positioning the \"Wii U menu\" as more of a general entertainment console (there are already pre-installed icons for NetFlix, Amazon Video, YouTube, and Hulu Plus). But I wasn't thrilled at having to deal with two menus and figuring out what goes where. Surprising, as Nintendo has usually been pretty good at user interface design.One other annoyance is that there are times that the system will appear to hang for many seconds, even minutes at a time, particularly when going from Channels or games back to the Wii U menu. At first I thought it was something I was doing, but many others appear to be experiencing the same thing. Hopefully Nintendo is working on a fix, as this behavior can get really annoying really fast.Since this review is on the console and not the games (which I'll post reviews for separately), I'm basing my review on my impressions of the hardware, the software, and the setup process. The hardware easily gets 5 out of 5 stars from me; you can see right away that the GamePad was an impressive feat of engineering, although there is a part of me that is disappointed that they didn't see fit to improve their motion controls (the MotionPlus is evidently the most advanced they'll take the Wiimotes for a while). My initial thoughts with the two-screen approach is that it's going to take some getting used to (I found myself fixated on the GamePad for most of the setup process and ignoring the TV), but they've proven with the DS that it can enhance gameplay.The setup process and the user interface, on the other hand, could have been improved. Not to say that features are missing, but the interface is just a little confusing for my tastes, and since I work with user experience for a living, I think I have a higher tolerance than most. The good news is that since these flaws are in software and not in hardware, they're certainly things that Nintendo can improve over time.A lot of people might be wondering whether to get the Basic unit, or to splurge and get the Deluxe unit for an extra $50. With the Deluxe unit, you get more built-in memory, the Nintendo Land game, and a charging stand for the GamePad. As I mentioned, you can easily expand the Wii U Basic with USB drives or SD cards at very low cost to meet or exceed 32GB, so that's not a huge deal. A lot of people are saying that New Super Mario Bros U is by far a better \"showcase\" game for the Wii U than Nintendo Land is, so I don't think missing that is a huge deal breaker either (especially considering that in a few months the secondary market will likely be flooded with used copies of Nintendo Land). And finally, a charging stand is a nice thing to have, but certainly not necessary. So at the end of the day for me, it came down to color: did I prefer white or black?To sum up, I'll give the system in itself a solid four stars--it didn't give me the knock-my-socks-off experience that unboxing the original Wii gave me, but I see a ton of potential if game developers can truly use the new features that the GamePad (combined with other peripherals like the Balance Board and Wiimotes) offer. I will definitely be a fan.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2012"}

Recht","summary":"Still wailing on my fun-sense with a piece of bent rebar!","reviewText":"This is the last title I got to play before my 360 broke down and died at the ripe old age of 9 months. (I know, pathetic, isn't it? Heck, I still have my Sega Master System from 1984 and it works GREAT! ...yeah, so I still play it sometimes.) Luckily, it was a really, really title to end on. At least for the time being. Until I fix it.Anyway, let's get down to brass tacks. Bloodshot.Creepy, creepy, creepy--that's the name of the game here, Bubba.Different in subtle ways from the original Condemned. How so? A bit more depth. I loved the added element of receiving rewards based on how well you perform in each level. You can accumulate all sorts of (permanent!) goodies, such as brass knuckles to increase your punching power, a kevlar vest to halve the damage you take from gunshots, and--my absolute favorite--the holster.In the original Condemned, you could carry one (1) weapon with you. It added tension and not a few frustrating moments when you found yourself with a single bullet and had to decide whether to toss the pistol for a 2x4 with rusty nails in it, or keep the firearm, knowing that--placed correctly--that one bullet could dispatch an enemy at range with no risk to yourself.This time around--providing you perform well enough--you can be granted a holster. This'll let you tuck away a pistol for later, and pick up a second weapon to wield in the meantime. There's at least one level where I know I made it through because I had that backup saved.The story, alas, alack, has become akin to Lost: rather convoluted and confusing. (For example, some people in the world have a very special ability: they can explode your body by yelling at you. Yeah, I know. I was thinking, \"Huh?\" too) Still, the atmosphere hasn't changed at all. I focused on that and had no problems.There are changes to the crime scene investigations, too. Now you actually have to look at the evidence and infer what happened based what you, the gamer, see on the screen. You have to be good at this to get those rewards I was talking about. I suppose you could get by on trial and error--the inferences are multiple-choice--but where's the satisfaction in that? I enjoyed studying those vicious, creepy crime scenes. Take your time. Soak it in.I have to admit I also enjoyed the personification of your character's inner demons. Twisted versions of yourself, they show up from time to time and represent different fears and vices--read the scenes for cues as to which demon is there at any given moment. Most screen time is devoted to Alcohol, the demon that seems to be the strongest.And speaking of alcohol, I'd watch your young, impressionable kids around this game. Just like the questionable morality of showing plumbers eating random mushrooms in order to grow big and strong, this game causes you to sate your character's addiction by chugging bottles of liquor from time to time. Without it, your hands shake badly, and you can't aim a weapon to save your life.Was there anything I didn't like? I'm not sure I liked the survival of an important evildoer from the original (not spoiling anything with names). I would have been much more satisfied with him having died. It just doesn't seem likely that he wouldn't have.And there also seems to be an overabundance of firearms in this title as opposed to the original, which gave it less tension and worries over your character's health.Still, those are very minor things, and should not in any way dissuade you from giving this title a shot. I thoroughly enjoyed it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2008"}

The graphics are fabulous and the game of finding words in a screen of tiles before the hot tile starts a fire is a blast.I have really enjoyed this game and don't see myself getting tired of it. As you play and create words with the tiles you also create books that are made of categories of words such as bugs, colors, numbers, etc. You also decorate rooms in your house as you make words. The more words you make the more stuff pops up in your themed rooms. It's really a nice twist on the game for the DS. My kids and I both love the game and can play for hours. There is a challange level to play with others and there is also an action level that includes more burning tiles for tougher game play.This is a wonderful game that makes you think so it's like exercising your brain at the same time that you are playing. This is one of the top games in my collection and the worm is very cute - he also gives you definitions of words as you create them.

{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"L. Sun \"Sun_Jot\"","summary":"This game is a downgrade from UC2 and here is why","reviewText":"The camera, I don't know what changes they made to the cameras and I even almost attended one seminar session they held for camera system for UC3. The new camera system is dizzy compared to UC2 and (if you are not sure what I mean, you can play Batman series. It's something like that). It is supposed to be realistic and yet the outcome is confusing at times and make some people dizzy. A third person shooter game should keep it's originality (like UC1 and 2) and stop this \"approaching reality\" camera design. It is my opinion and from this point, I feel it's a worse add-up.The shooting mechanics. I don't play to write a lot. The new game feels more difficult to aim than UC2 and the camera is maybe a reason for that.The fighting mechanics. I don't have complaint about this except for few times it feels unrealistic. Nathan and the enemies move much quicker and change position faster than what it seems. This could have been improved in later game design.The story and everything else is basically the same as UC2. I do agree the graphics are awesome and the detailing is unbelievable.  For a  game that plays like a movie. It's hard to pick on.Now come to my final point. UC3 is a decent game. But the changes they made seem not to make the gaming experiences that better than the old series. UC2 was perfect in almost every aspect. The camera change is totally unnecessary in my opinion. I lost the feeling of controlling my character in a 3D environment. But with this weird \"in-game\" type of newly designed camera system it's distracting at times and I lose my focus (and get dizzy).UC2 is a 6 star game (out of 5), So I am willing to give this a game 5 star but keep in mind I am one of those gamers who get slightly disappointed. I hope UC4 would have a smoother camera system with better shooting/fighting mechanics and I will be ready to crawl back and be a die hard fan.Edit: I am changing the score to 4 star , the second play through I encountered this glitch. It won't let me load and freezes constantly. I deleted the game data several times finally get it to work. This has been reported by a lot of people. The game feels like a rushed product.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2011"}

I think part of what makes this game so fun is how smoothly it integrates the game experience and imagery of Metroid Prime with pinball. The sound on this game is topnotch and is icing on the cake of a very fun pinball experience.The tables and goals can be rather challenging, which is a good thing.  I have yet to open up the other tables for play, but it is already a very enjoyable game.  I have a feeling that young players may not be as enthralled playing this game as both screens are taken up with the rather statick pinball tables.  However, for slightly older players, and especially those who are pinball fiends, there is a lot of enjoy and a good amount of depth and variation.As a second or third game to own for the DS, this is a definitely sweet game.NOTE: This game also comes with a Rumble Pack for the DS.  It is inserted in the GBA slot of the DS.  It is rather noisy in my experience and doesn't provide the more solid rumble feel of the Gamecube controllers or even the standard GB.  However  it is a good tactile enhancement for the DS.  Chances are it will not be offered in conjunction with other games (probably just offered seperately).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2005"}

{"product_name":"B001D7T2VC","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"3.5 stars - a fun action/adventure hybrid","reviewText":"I should start off this review by saying that I'm not the biggest fan of the modern day action/hack n slash type of games.  I do like to play them every once in a while, but they are far from being my favorite genre of video game.  Having been several years since I last played a game of this type, I was excited to jump into the fan-favorite Darksiders and see for myself what it was all about.As incredible as this generation of video games has been, true originality and genuine innovation is becoming more scarce than in previous generations, and Darksiders exemplifies this even more than most other modern games.  The combat and the weapons & inventory systems are very reminiscent of the God of War series on Playstation.  The layout of most game's areas, and the ways environmental puzzles are used in order to progress through them, are very reminiscent of Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series.  There's even a portal gun item that is nearly identical to the one in Portal (even the enter/exit portals have the same orange/blue color scheme as the Valve game!).  Strangely though, these elements all combine to create something that does not feel unoriginal at all, even though on paper, it is.  The fast and furious combat meshes well with the calmer puzzle solving segments and gives the game a very nice sense of pace.  There is a huge world to explore and lots of secrets to be found, including certain areas that can only be found by backtracking and using items acquired later in the game (again, very much like the Zelda games).  It's all quite enjoyable.The major weakness for me was the game's length (it took me 23 hours to beat), which I felt was a bit too long for a game of this type.  Despite the different weapons and the ways both the weapons themselves and your abilities with them can be upgraded, Darksiders still exhibits the fundamental weakness (to me) of other games of this genre, and that is that the combat is not very deep.  You can pull of all the combos with all the weapons in a single battle if you want, but it's entirely unnecessary.  The game can be beaten for the most part by dodging and pressing the attack button repeatedly.  I don't mind this at all for a game that 8-14 hours long, but by the time I got to the last quarter of Darksiders, I was really ready for it to be finished.  Again, for fans of this genre of game, I would say that Darksiders is a must buy, because there is plenty here to deliver their fix.  But for those who are seeking deeper combat, I would advise them to look elsewhere.Still, Darksiders is still a very fun game.  It does what it sets out to do very well.  The story details are confusing, but overall it's easy to get the gist of what's going on.  The game was solid technically.  I did experience screen tearing on several of the levels, but not too bad.  Frame rates are solid and load times are short, which was great (and rare)!  The graphics and sound are quite good, if unspectacular.  One of the highlights of the game is the excellent, comic-book inspired art design.  Joe Madureira's genuinely unique vision of earth centuries after the Apocalypse is really something to see.  I approached each new area of the game with real excitement to see what kind of sights it would hold.In all, I would say that Darksiders is a very fun game, even if its not one of the essential titles of this generation.  Surely, devoted fans of God of War and the games its combat inspired will enjoy this more than I did, and fans of both God of War and Zelda series will be in heaven.  It was a fun, simpler (yet still challenging) diversion to the other more serious games I seem to have been playing lately.  One more thing...I will definitely be keeping my eye on this developer, Vigil Games, in the future.  Darksiders is the first project from this new studio, and just by playing the game, it's obvious that these guys have a deep passion for gaming in their blood.  I am curious and excited to see what they come up with next.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2011"}

For example half of the word would be in the top sentence and the other part of the word would be on the bottom part. Its not that big of an issue since it corrects itself once the message is sent. I am sure it will be fixed in a future update.I love how getting in and out of the store is a breeze and downloading now is much improved and so fast. Also getting in a game and out is super quick its very nice that in about 1 sec you can jump from in game to the main menu an than to the store and less than a couple of seconds.The console itself is super quiet you really have to listen to the fan to actually hear it. The design also is pretty slick I just wish the whole console was glossy black instead of half glossy half with no shine.The dualshock 4 is amazing finally Sony has done the right thing and made an amazing controller it feels so great in your hands and its a huge improvement over the dualshock 3.Something I have noticed which Supposedly Sony doesn't even know about is that the console is light activated. If the lights in your room are on your tv will be bright once you turn off the lights in your room the tv screen will become dimmer. I called Sony and they were clueless about this feature. At least the person I spoke with didn't hear about it. I than asked a friend of mine to try this on his PS4 and it did in fact do the same thing. Brighten when the lights in the room are turned on and dim the screen when the lights are turned off. I don't really like that feature since I always like my screen to be bright and I am hoping there is some way to turn it off.Something else that is strange is a game like sound shapes in the store says it is a 4GB download onto PS4 after downloading I think it was 1.7 or so GB so why the discrepancy? Has anyone else noticed that. Both that game and Flower the same thing.Overall The launch of the PS4 was rough on Friday it took me 3 hours just to Sign into PSN but eventually it worked but now all things are go.

When I heard the console version of the game did not have the auction system, my son and I rushed out to get ourselves a copy. After beating the game multiple times with different characters playing cooperatively with my son and by myself, I can say the game was well worth its $60 price tag. Diablo's wrath is back, and our button-mashing heroes must defeat him and his &#34;endless&#34; army yet again. While the story does reference the previous titles (Deckard returns!), Diablo 3 shines with it's simple yet incredibly addictive gameplay. You pick one of several classes that range from the Witch Doctor (summoner of pets and uses poison spells) to the Monk (the Chuck Norris class who punches and kicks baddies). Diablo's system begs for you to play the game several times through with each class, as you won't see every skill each class has to offer without multiple play throughs. And the thing is, you'll WANT to play multiple times. Every play through is different thanks to Blizzard's algorithm of making every player's world a new and random one. The game is also is very impressive in the graphics department, looking ahead of it's time with gory visuals and excellent lighting.If you're a fan of this franchise, I'm pretty sure you've already bought this game and beaten it on &#34;Hell mode&#34;.

In the Peace Keepers world, for example, Spyro must burn down the monster soldiers' tent, sending one of the minions running out, quaking with fear or, if you're lucky, dropping his drawers and shooting a moon.Spyro's movements (fire breathing, gliding, jumping, and climbing) require entry-level gaming skills. For this reason,Spyro the Dragonis an excellent title for youngsters or less experienced players, who want to play without having to master complex movement combinations.--Kasty ThomasPros:Large worlds provide hours of game playingVariety of scenariosEngaging graphicsCons:Low game skill requirements may prove less challenging for expert players","reviewerName":"Steve F","summary":"Classic","reviewText":"I know this is an old game, but this is definitely a classic to have.

As with all releases in theDead Risingseries, it is a survival horror game. Players take on the role of an all-new character, with equally new motivations to survive and resources to do so. These resources include new weapons, expanded weapon combination/creation possibilities, and even two-player coop functionality. The game also features a 4-player online multiplayer mode, an optional prologue to the game available as downloadable content and a dramatic increase in the number of zombies that can be faced at once.","reviewerName":"Matthew Lawson \"sleepyteacher\"","summary":"$25 game of year! A great leap for the series.","reviewText":"I thought the first game had a lot of potential and this sequel improved on a lot of issues it had. This series is not try to be left for dead or anything else. It is a unique, 3rd person experience where the world is your weapon and the world is full of zombies. What does this mean? If you are in a pinch, chuck that nearby vase at them, beat them over the head with a purse or a store display, naturally there are also guns, knives, bows and arrows, and all types of bludgening tools, but the ability to pick up a lawn dart and kill a zombie is cool.The expected: Similar to the first game, you are set in a strip mall, rather than just a mall, and you have everything from construction sites to casinos to...oh yeah, every type of store you have ever been in. The map looks daunting when you view it, but traveling takes less time than imagined and in this sequel, it is a lot easier to reach save points(bathrooms) than the first.Good improvement: you can combine weapons!!! the boat paddle and chainsaw is on the cover, but my favorites are the axe and sledgehammer, the bat and nails, and the knives and gloves(giving you a wolverine feel). You can also upgrade wheel chairs, shotguns, and motorcycles, but these come more from being in the right place at the right time than out of convenience. I was a little disappointed, because I thought that most weapons could be combined, but only certain weapons in a correct combination can be combined. Along the way, the game will give you \"combo cards\" of combinations you can make, but you don't need the cards to make the combo, they just point you in the direction. If your binding instincts are correct, you can create the combo card.Not improved: \"Leveling up\" is still ambiguous. You reach level 7 or whatever and you ask, am I really running faster, hitting harder, jumping farther? I wish the player had more control over what they leveled up and that leveling up had more meaning.Definitely not improved: Bosses are so difficult! Not even the main bosses, its the side bosses that suck. They are typically very fast and will do a lot of damage to you in little time (a big deal since you normally only have upto 5 bars of health), so save often.The improvement that could have been: Money plays a bigger game in the sequel, which I thought would be fun, but it hardly matters since everything is so expensive and can be found for free (or an weapon of equal destruction can be found) if you just walk an extra 20 steps. I am over halfway through the game and have not spent a single dollar or felt the need to.Guns and ammo: You can find some pretty helpful guns: automatics, pistols, shotguns, but you can only carry so many items (weapons and health) at a time (a challenge I enjoy), but why do I have to drop my pistol with 12 bullets and then pick up a pistol with 20, can I not just reload or carry extra ammunition?Environment: I have killed over 1500 zombies and you couldn't tell it. If you pick up a weapon or food item, they regenerate pretty quickly, except for one item that I have noticed and Zombrex does not regenerate, you use it once and it is GONE!Still, I bought the collectors (Zombrex Edition) for $25 and it is hands down the best videogame purchase I have made since I bought Oblivion for $10. I actually got the Zombrex Edition for (at the time) a cheaper price than the game by itself, so it was worth it. If you can do the same, do it, if not, the art that comes with it looks awesome, but there is a drawing of one character I have not seen yet and I really hope to. I will never use anything else from the box.Overall:Graphics: 4/5Controls 4/5 (picking up an item next to others can be annoying)Play: 4/5 (a little repetitive, but few games are not and at this point I know the weapons I want and where to get them, so I am not venturing out as much as I was.)Difficulty: 4.5/5Price: For $30 or less 6/5 stars!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000ZKA0J6","description":"","reviewerName":"D. Allen","summary":"Very competitive gameplay but not very newbie friendly.","reviewText":"Blizzard's products always been very big. World of Warcraft is probably the most recognized game in the world. Starcraft is a close second as it is in tune of a national sport in S.Korea. As a matter of fact when I visited Korea in Winter 09, I was just amazed by the fact that a high end TV station actually has daily one hour segments dedicated to Starcraft reviews.I'm going to break this review up in two sections: Single and Multiplayer. The reason why is that the two are so drastically different that they need their own review.~Single~I picked up SC2 when it came out. I was extremely excited about single player as I never really enjoyed multiplayer RTS (until after this one). Looking at SC1 and Blizzard previous real time strategy game (RTS), Warcraft 3, I was most excited about the things SC2's single player would offer. Overall I have to say I was disappointed. I'm going to compare a lot of the single player element to Warcraft 3 because I think Warcraft 3 was Blizzard's best single player RTS to date in terms of storytelling and integrating the main characters into the story and gameplay.The first problem with SC2's single player is the story and main character. The way the story is presented is just so detached from the actual gameplay that I felt like I was waiting on two things to happen. The game plays you as Jim Raynor who was the main hero of SC1 and he continues on this version. If I remember right, in SC1, you had control of Raynor in a lot of missions although he didn't really do anything useful. Since WC3, I felt that he should have been in game more in the form of a \"Hero\" unit that is able to level up, gain power, and that you can control and use to really feel like you're with the character and his struggle. The fact is that you don't get to use Jim but a few times. I think in total I only remember using him in maybe 3 missions. The only mission that has a good \"hero unit\" is the Nova mission, but even then you never get to use her again and she didn't really feel any different from the other units.Besides the detachment from character, the game sort of holds your hand through the missions. What I mean is that in the first SC and the Warcraft 3, it just sort of threw you into the mission and you do what you have to do to complete it. With Starcraft 2, nearly every mission had a mechanic behind winning it. Let's say the game introduced a Tank. Now the entire mission is based on that tank in order to be successful. You can ignore it if you're really good, but that would only make the game longer than it has to be. The point is every mission has an new unit that is used to complete that mission. After that mission, that unit is mostly useless. For example, the one mission where you have to use a diamond tank. I thought that was awesome, but then that was it. Every other mission, the diamond tank is completely useless and unneeded. Overall I felt the game is like C&C; where every mission, rather than through strategy and thinking, you have to use a gimmick unit to complete it.The flow of the game is rather unique. You flow like this: Scene -> Look at your ship -> Select mission -> Repeat. You get a cool ship too that has multiple areas to look in. It has a bar where you can watch these news report which are sometimes funny, especially the last one. You can also upgrade your units. Again you can't upgrade the abilities of any hero unit as they're non-existent, but you can upgrade your normal unit. Some of them are rather useful like having multiple scvs building a single unit, or combining your barracks reactor (produce 2 units at once) and tech (produce higher units like medics). Those are useful but that is it. Otherwise it they are completely useless as they upgrade units that you no longer need since they're past the introduction mission. The upgrades cost money which you can get in game. Also, you can get research points to upgrade technology which can unlock units or special abilities. That was pretty cool, but it's very limited in what is useful or not. One thing I liked about the ship is the level of detail in each area. My favorite place is the armory as you can see many of your units there and even get a brief history on them. Otherwise, the ship is worthless.You can select the missions you want to go on in this game. It's limited to only the Terran which are humans struggling against a threat known as Zerg. There is the Protoss too that is this advanced race of strong, religious background. You mainly play Terran with a side mission of Protoss. The side mission has nothing to do with the main story and I think they can be skipped if you never opened it. Blizzard is planning to release each race's gameplay in the form of a addon in the upcoming years. Those of you who played SC1 would know that you can play all three races from the start. The expansion, Broodwar, was released with another set of missions for all three races. This is in my opinion a bad business practice. The upgrades should be adding to the story, not unlocking the actual story. So this will be interesting.Overall the single player was fun. I just hope they can return the Hero Units and you can upgrade them like in Warcraft 3. That would just make it perfect and fun to play. Also, I hope they get rid of the gimmick units. It's not fun to have to win by using one unit in a mission. I want to just jump in, think of a way to defeat it, and just go with that rather than having the game hold me through. I heard the next expansion will feature the Zerg missions and you can have control of their leader Kerrigen. Hopefully it can have a bit of leveling or some sort of control beyond what SC2 did.~Multiplayer~After playing the single player of SC2, I became lost. I wanted more but felt single player wasn't cutting it and I have to wait for a long time before the second part of SC2 becomes available. So I jumped into multiplayer.At first I was just blown away by the difficulty. The multiplayer is just not newbie friendly. Unlike single player where you can just make a number of single units and win, multiplayer takes it to a whole new level. My favorite is 1vs1 so my review will mainly focus on that aspect.In Multiplayer you can play one of three races: Zerg (alien swarms), Protoss (powerful alien race), and Terran (humans that's kinda between). Most people will start off with Terran as it is the race they played on Single Player and also it's related to you. Later on I grew attached to Protoss as it fits my gameplay style.The only thing Starcraft is praised on is balance. I was confused by this because to me balance means that no matter what you do, it won't be outweighed by what someone else does. This isn't entirely true in sc2. If you have tons of one unit, someone can easily defeat it with a combination of another unit. No, I think balance is the fact that no one race, Terran, Zerg, or Protoss has any sort of distinctive advantage that makes it outstanding. Each race has its own unique trait and which one you choose depends on what you like and how you play.Overall the muliplayer is extremely difficult. Since I'm new to multiplayer strategy, I had to do a lot of research outside of the game just to become better. This is unusual for me as I'm used to game with easy rewards and more laid back. Starcraft 2 you have to focus on what you're doing, when you're doing and what you're doing otherwise you're going to lose badly. The game is relatively easy to set up what some refer to as rush builds, or cheese. For example, a Zerg player can do a 6pool rush where they sacrifice any chance of gaining an economy to just to build a larger army than you early. This works a large amount of time against a new player. It's very easy to do, but it requires work on the other side to effectively disrupt and win against these type of tactics. It isn't obvious in the game like other games where cheap tactic can be employed.The beauty of multiplayer is that you have to learn to do better. It's just not mindless fun. However, it is very competitive and it is not something that can just be taken lightly. As such it can be very stressful especially to people who are used to more laid back, high reward. With SC2, you gain very little, but can lose so much.Blizzard is actively fixing SC2. The online is free and Blizzard is making regular updates on balancing and other aspect to make it easier. This is unusual for a company to pay such attention to a game, but I suspect that the only reason why Blizzard is so down on fixing it is because of its large professional following. I don't know how much Blizzard gets for all these game tournament and other events, but I can imagine it is enough to where Blizzard doesn't have to actively pump out new games each year. They're more focused on one title and making it really good.Overall the multiplayer is where this game is at. It's not hard, or difficult to get into but it does require that you do a lot of careful planning and thinking. You will have to read up on it unless you're one of those rare people capable of just jumping in and playing it (perhaps veterans of the first Starcraft).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2011"}

I thought I would get sick of the game, but it really is different when you're playing. There is a long introduction/tutorial to the game to show you how everything works. I play the PC version with the XBox 360 controller, and it works flawlessly. (I downloaded directly from Origin because of the 24 hour Great Game return policy)My friend refuses to invest in a gaming PC, but he keeps coming over to play. He tells me that this game is REALLY fun. I have to admit I agree, but the videos you may see on the internet may make it seem boring, as I have to admit I wasn't too enthused. It's not a BF3 or BF4, but it surely blows COD out of the water, as COD is VERY stale. Most of the people on Titanfall play Capture the Flag and Domination. Those are pretty much the most popular modes.It's hard to recommend to someone though that may not have the money, but since I have a little disposable income I decided to try it out. If you're unsure, I'd say wait until the price drops, but you must finish the campaign if you want to play with the big strong titan or the skinny fast titan, so it's one of those things if you wait there may not be enough people playing the campaign. Games in the classic(standard multiplayer) mode fill up within a matter of 5 seconds, but I think in a few months there may not be enough players to play the campaign.The biggest positive I see is that the game promotes movement, and the pilot on the ground with the smart pistol usually wins against the pilot bunny hopper in the air, which is totally opposite from COD. The smart pistol with the active radar perk detects campers before they detect you. This was one of my biggest gripes with COD which promoted camping and bunny hopping.

Before Kingdom Hearts came around, I haven't played any games that had a really good action-RPG battle system.  All action-RPGs on the PC had rather lame battle systems, such as Diablo (point, click, click, click, point, click, etc...), and, admittedly, I wasn't much of a fan of how the Dark Cloud series handled battles.  Oh, and don't mention Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, as I don't exactly consider it a \"true\" RPG.  Kingdom Hearts, however, had something a bit more freeform and fun than other supposed \"action RPGs.\"But it still wasn't quite what I'd wish for from an Action-RPG's battle system...Then, a couple of years later, Kingdom Hearts 2 comes out, and it... okay, it's still not all I'd wish for, but dang if it doesn't come really close!To give a little background of the story setting, the Kingdom Hearts series is a mixture of Squaresoft (now Square-Enix, which I will refer to as Square hereafter) and Disney properties... though the Square portions aren't much more than glorified cameos.  Square's better stuff in this game comes from their new creations, such as Sora, Riku, Kairi, and many others.  Surprisingly, all the characters combine quite well, and the plot is surprisingly good for a game that is rather cameo-ridden.Now, lets talk presentation.  Personally, the first game I thought was a mixed bag in this department.  Well, this one is too, though they've done noticably better.  Graphics-wise, the game is very pretty game, as was the first.  Though it's roughly the same as the first in the technical department, they seemed to improve quite a bit in the artistic department.  Fights are beautiful to watch, even more so as the game progresses and you acquire more abilities.  My only complaint with the visuals is how the characters aren't handled so well during some dialogue sequences (somewhat robotic movement) as well as how the game seems to switch between low-res and hi-res character models for dialogue (hi-res = CG style lip syncing and eye movement; low-res = textured face, minimal/no lip syncing, and minimal eye movement).  However, in my opinion this is relatively minor, considering most games don't even TRY to have good all-out cinematic presentation.Voice acting is where I have my biggest problem with this game.  First, what was done right.  All of the original characters, such as Sora, Riku, and all of the others are done very well.  Disney characters are hit-and-miss.  Characters like Donald, Goofy, Mickey, and even those from Tron are done well, and the voice actoress for Maleficent is back yet again with a voice that is eerily spot-on with the original voice!  But some of the others... personally, I wasn't a fan of what they did with some of the voices and presentation for the Pridelands (Lion King), and is it just me or does Johnny Depp (Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean) not do as well when voice acting?  Square's cameos are also a mixed bag.  Aeris' voice is appaulingly emotionless, and Setzer's voice just doesn't seem to fit the character (he looks pretty awesome, though).As for sound in general, the music score is pretty great.  I'll have to admit it's a tad less amazing compared to the first one, but a good many of the tracks are great by themselves, or at least meld well with the game.  Oh, just a warning, in my opinion they completely HASHED the theme music in the world for Pirates of the Caribbean.  Rather than the great orchestrated sound of the movie soundtrack, it looks like it's been strained through a low-quality MIDI synthesizer.  Other than that, the score is great.Sound effects I have no complaints for.  Nothing all that amazing, but there's nothing that really got on my nerves here.Now, lets get to the battle system.  This part is quite an improvement over the first game.  Admittedly, it's still very much a button-masher (repeated pressing of the attack button), and maybe even moreso than the first game, but somehow I found it more fun.  I believe part of that has to do with how much you have to pay attention to certain things.  For instance, the game utilizes a new system that I will refer to as \"triangle attacks,\" which I name after the fact that it uses the controller's triangle button to execute.  These attacks are easy to use.  When you see a green prompt appear above the command menu, a triangle attack is usable.  Most of the common ones are specific to which enemy you are attacking and tend to only appear for a short time as the situation dictates.  Some examples of these are one called Reversal that lets you dodge an enemy attack, or Berserk which lets you take an enemy's sword and use it against him.  Other forms of triangle attacks give you quick access to devastating combination attacks that are available later in the game that can be used in conjunction with party members such as Donald, Goofy, Simba, Beast, and many other characters.Bear in mind, battles tend to have a semi-automatic nature.  No, this has nothing to do with guns.  What I mean by semi-auto is that several actions have a predetermined effect.  For instance, if you land one attack on an enemy, repeated pressing of the attack button focuses in all of your attacks on that enemy.  Given the nature of the game, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but for those looking for something where they are more directly in control of all the character's actions, such as the recent Legend of Zelda games or most action games, you may be a bit disappointed.Depending on the type of gamer you are, you may find Kingdom Hearts 2 to be rather easy.  I played the game on normal difficulty and only had problems during a small amount of boss fights.  For those who don't want it to be too easy, I might recommend starting out on the highest difficulty, though be warned this may make some boss fights almost impossible.On the whole, I liked the game.  What minor misgivings I had about this game didn't hinder me from enjoying it.  I certainly recommend it, though make sure you know whether or not you'll like the gameplay elements.  I thought I'd hate the somewhat repedative nature of the combat after reading reviews online, but a rental convinced me I should buy it.(P.S.  The title of this review isn't exactly mocking the game.  I just couldn't think of anything wittier).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2006"}

{"product_name":"B007TYC8MI","description":"","reviewerName":"JWink","summary":"The series is so good I am playing it twice","reviewText":"Having played all the God of War games and sequels and enjoyed them very much.  I have looked foward to the new edition to the series Ascension.Ascension begins with the protagonist Kratos, chained atop a stone column, tortured by one of the Furies.  No subtility here.  The game starts in your face like all the GOW games.  You can collect artifacts in the game and you can obtain infinite rage or triple the time on your combo meter.  The combat manages to maintain a certain slickness despite the huge array of offensive options. The animations are fantastic and dazzzling and come together nicely. Enemies give you clues to help you when they are about to attack. This gives you the chance to roll away with just a movement of the joystick.Part of Ascension's fun is in the puzzles with vast architectural conundrums that must be solved before you are allowed to move on. In the beginning these are routine crate-moving exercises , changing the game's tempo without offering much challenge or interest. But later, you can obtain the Amulet of Urobotus, which allows you to highlight pieces of scenery and either restore them to their former usefulness or reduce them to useful rubble. To me this is some of the best and most challenging in the game.Gorgon eyes and Phoenix feathers make a return as collectible items. Find five of each and you'll increase your health or magic points similiar to the past games.  Enemies and objects release red orbs when destroyed, which you can collect and spend on upgrading your weapons or abilities - increasing the damage of your Blade of Chaos or the range of the Amulet of Urobotus, for example, or unlocking new special moves.Ascension contains multiplayer features and various modes of play. Ascension's multiplayer component is weighty and distinguished, and the battle system's range and flexibility shine in this competitive context.  So it has something for the multiplayer as well as the single adventurer. As well as the full assortment of abilities from the single-player game, a number of additional items and rules enrich competitive play. For example, characters flash red when executing an unblockable attack, white when they're momentarily invulnerable to attack and blue when they're recovering from a special attack and are open to a counter. Temporary halos appear over opponents' heads when they're open to a grapple, while special 'god items' help players escape combo attacks and provide a shot-term battle advantage. Maps contain traps, which can be triggered against the opposing team, as well as temporary torrents that restore magic and vitality.I have to say I do like Ascension but I do feel that individual campaign is a bit uneven and sometimes fails to match its predecessors.  The multiplayer does add something though and broadens the game's aspirations and its appeal.  Overall it is a worthwhile purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2013"}

I would probably pick star wars over this one, simply because the franchise lends itself a little better (can't do light sabers, laser blasters, and the force with indy!) and there are a couple quibbles -the heavy reliance on hand to hand, a lot without the whip, gets annoying.  However, the puzzles are fun, some of those pieces are hard to find, and some of the levels are classic (my favorite is the final grail chapter).  The tie-in to the movie is fun - hard to believe that raiders is now over 25 years old.  If you like the indy movies and like lego star wars, pick this one up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2009"}

I actually prefer it over 11, 12 and even 13. It's just more polished. Make sure you patch it if you can. I was worried Sony couldn' patch this old game, but if you put the disc in and play, it should automatically patch it up before you play. Mind you, without the patch, this game is pretty buggy, so it's pretty important you to patch it. If you need to patch, I recommend doing it on auto. Setup your auto patching in the system settings of the PS3 and let it do automatically. I have mine to setup autoupdates at 2am in the morning. I tried to install this patch manually and it never would complete. So keep that in mind when wanting to patch. auto is your best bet. Or doing it very early in the morning with less traffic.The game plays smoothly, graphics are great, commentary great and it's just a great playing football game.

{"product_name":"B0000TSRA6","reviewerName":"New Boy","summary":"I love this game!","reviewText":"If you're a fan of RESIDENT EVIL, you gotta give the Outbreak series a try. It's got 8 different playable characters, all ordinary, everyday citizens of Raccoon City, and 5 different scenarios to explore. It's fun to just explore the different possibilities and to master the different characters. There's also 4 different difficulty levels for those looking for a challenge. It can be quite challenging figuring out what to do in each scenario, but if you read the files then you should be able to figure it out. This is most likely my favorite Resident Evil game, because you're not completely screwed if you run out of ammo. If you find yourself stuck in a room with a zombie and no ammo, you can either tackle or dodge your way out, which definitely helps you get out of sticky situations, and it is of great help when saving your ammo for the last boss.Also, this game has one of the most beautiful and memorable intros of any RE game to date.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000K9K9AC","description":"WarHawk Bundle with BlueTooth Headset PS3","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"Online Mayhem","reviewText":"First let me start off by saying that if you're a fan of online shooters or a fan of any fast-paced game, Warhawk is the game for you. For a game with no single player campaign you'll cut your teeth online immediately. Warhawk features a very basic story - two civilizations at all out war - what basically boils down to red vs. blue. From there you're free to play whatever you want - Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Zones (control parts of the map with your team to win), and Capture the Flag. Whatever you choose you'll notice that the game features relatively few maps - only five of them - with several variations and sizes. While this may sound short lived, its actually the opposite that holds true. You'll quickly realize the game offers something different for everyone - do you play defense and guard your base or do you jump in a tank for a frontal assault against the enemy? Or you could jump in a Warhawk (the games namesake and aircraft) and battle in the skies. Really, no two matches I've had have been identical. Warhawk features a terrific stat tracking mechanism to keep track of every kill, death and shot you've made in the game. It also features a leveling system that will literally take years to achieve the top ranks and a reward system of badges, ribbons and medals. Graphically the game is not the PS3's best looking game but its gorgeous in its own way. The impressive fact is that the game runs at 720p while having 32 simultaneous online players. The only shortfall to an otherwise very solid game would have to be the occasional network problems that seem to restart servers at random and some problems with players being promoted to higher ranks without earning the necessary points. On both counts the developer has made major improvements with the release of a patch.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2007"}

However, I do want to clarify now that, while the controls did take a bit of getting used to, once you were used to them, they were quite easy and comfortable, and to be honest, I can't imagine playing the game any other way. So, the controls were great, graphics and sound was superb, the acting was wonderful and the story was enjoyable. Overall I would have to say Alan Wake was a pleasurable experience.Although, pleasurable as it might be, it was far from perfect! I've given you the pluses, now it's time for the negatives.To begin with, the game felt like a long playable commercial for energizer and Verizon. I think I saw \"Energizer\" more times than I saw and heard the name \"Alan Wake\". Perhaps they should have just called the game \"And going...and going...\"? I am seriously surprised that at some point the energizer bunny didn't come beating his drum across the screen.Next, the game is way too short! The game is divided into 6 \"Episodes\" which is basically 6 levels. each episode can be finished anywhere between 1 to 2 hours, depending on how hard-core you are playing and how throughly you are investigating the locals. However, what this means is, you could in theory beat the game in about 7 or 8 hours. Now, normally that's not a huge thing, since most games feature an Online play mode, however Alan Wake doesn't offer any online play. Your gaming experience is just those 6 episodes. Although more \"Episodes\" will be arriving soon in the form of downloadable content(More on this later)Another thing I dislike about the game, is that many of the \"Action\" segments take place in the woods. Now during the first 2 \"Episodes\", that was kind of cool! The woods are a scary, and creepy and offer plenty of places for monsters to hide. After awhile though? Come on! It gets old! There's only so much running around trees a person can do before they start to lose interest! Once they get bored of the same repeating settings, then they are going to start getting bored of the game!The next negative? Well, that would be the ending! Now, I am not going to include any spoilers for anyone, but what I am going to say is that the ending is lame. It's one of the worst game endings ever. It doesn't even seem like an ending at all really! There's so much just left hanging and in the air, and what little excuse of an ending there is just leaves you scratching your head dumbfounded.Now, granted! Maybe the ending wasn't really an ending, but instead left open to leave room for the downloadable content. Maybe the \"Huh?! Factor\" will be resolved with the coming episodes. Possibly. However, I feel that it's kind of a rip off. Like they sent out an unfinished product, expecting you to pay the amount that one would pay for a full length game, and instead they receive an unfinished game, and a code to get the next episode free, however the second DLC you are of course expected to buy. In essence, you have to pay AGAIN to finish the storyline that SHOULD have been finished in the final product! It's ridiculous! It's like they are trying to milk you out of more money than their game title is actually worth.Yes, I know other companies have DLC as well, and to be honest, some of them I think are ridiculous, for instance the modern warfare DLC map package.However, some companies like Rockstar actually provide QUALITY DLC items! For instance Grand Theft Auto IV actually finished! It had an ending, then they released 2 other DLC packs that contained whole new storylines, that were connected to the first, but could be played separately and enjoyed and felt that you had a quality gaming experience with an actual ending.Would I recommend the game? I would recommend renting it. Like I said, it's a pleasurable game, but it's also a quick game! You probably will finish it during a rental period and most likely won't have a need to replay it since there's no real online play to extend the replay value.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2010"}

I love the Elder Scrolls and I've been playing them since the first time I tried Morrowind at my brother's house on the Xbox. I can't say that I originally loved Morrowind, but I gave it more than one shot. It was very difficult to start playing that game.I purchased this game on Steam back in November, and I'm still playing it.I like that they did away with the \"easiness\" of Oblivion, but it's still a bit easier than Morrowind in my opinion.Storyline - Great. I won't spoil anything, but these guys did an excellent job engrossing me in the storyline. The Nords are facing the Empire. The Empire fought the Aldmeri Dominion, but now they have a truce and the Elves seem to have a subtle hand in the affairs of the North. The dragons are coming back for some mysterious reason and it seems everyone is searching for the answer.Graphics - The graphics are beautiful as expected, but it doesn't seem like that much of a step up from Oblivion.Sound / Music - Excellent score. I find myself humming the music sometimes.Gameplay - Pretty great. They got rid of chameleon, which made me find other ways to kill like a boss. It wasn't that difficult to find new alternatives and you can really use some skills to become a shadow master anyway, but it won't really rival the ridiculousness of 100% chameleon. I enjoyed the new leveling system as well. I'm almost level 80 as I write this. I had a few games to play, so I've put that on hold for now. MW3 is finally on my radar and I just completed it, so I will likely give Skyrim a rest for a few days.Overall, if you enjoyed previous Elder Scrolls games, then you will likely love this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2012"}

To make sure Clockwerk never turns up again, he and his partners in crime will go around the world to pull off a series of daring heists.","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A worthy sequel","reviewText":"The Good: Excellent graphics, great new characters and story, fun mission variety,  a lot of great abilities to purchase, sandbox style makes the game feel more openThe Bad: Navigating the hubs is a real pain, starts to feel repetitive towards the end, camera still needs work, no extrasSly, Bentley, and Murray return in an attempt to obtain the stolen Clockwerk parts from the Klaww Gang. After defeating Clockwerk in the first game they were obtained illegally and the gang must get them back to destroy them. Along the way Carmelita Fox is still trying to capture them while a few new faces show up. The game is the same at the core, but everything around that has completely changed. This really feels like a whole new game.For starters you will notice there are no individual levels anymore. The game is more sandbox with various missions you can take on when you want. You can play as all three characters this time around, and each one has their own specific missions. Each character feels different, Murray is a huge lumbering hippo who can't use stealth and instead whacks away enemies in just a couple of hits. Bentley is equipped with a sleeping dart crossbow and has various gadgets he can use to get around. In fact, they all have gadgets and abilities you can purchase with those coins that were useless in the first game. 100 no longer gives you a life because that whole system is gone. Instead you now have a life bar and when you die you restart at the last checkpoint. This games playing a whole lot easier and relieves a lot of the frustrations from the first game.Additionally, the interior areas of the game are mission specific so you won't be going back. I honestly preferred the individual levels because navigating these hub worlds can be a pain. Getting to certain places requires climbing around certain areas to get to. Some areas are a real pain and you have to figure out how to get there. Just to get to a main mission, this is pretty lame. I don't want to spend 5 minutes climbing around a confusing level just to start a mission. It doesn't help that enemies respawn all the time when you kill them and they are everywhere. It gets really frustrating when you just want to get to a mission and you have to keep killing the same enemies all the time. Thankfully some abilities like smoke screen, shock cane, and the paraglider help Sly get around easier, but the other two have to find their way completely via the ground which means long round about ways to get to a mission marker.When you start a mission you will notice they are varied and pretty fun. Bentley has a new hacking mini-game that is a dual stick shooter, Murray punches things a lot, and Sly has a new pickpocketing ability which he can use to get coins and loot from guards to sell for abilities and to get those keys. A lot of the gauntlet style levels are really fun and require quick reflexes. There are 8 episodes and the game is just as tough as the last one. Boss fights now have meters and don't go down in a few hits anymore. You have to slowly chip away their health to beat them and it requires patience. Overall, the game feels mostly the same with missions just varying from hacking mini-games, beat this or that up, or pickpocket X amount of keys. It starts to feel old towards the end, plus the navigation of hub worlds will just drive you nuts after a while.There are still clue bottles and vaults to be found, but they just have extra abilities in them and really aren't worth searching for. The clue bottles will take over an hour to find in each level because the hubs are so difficult to navigate. There are 30 in each hub, but good luck finding them all without throwing the controller. Besides this there are no extras in the game like the last one which is disappointing. Despite all this, I think the large open hubs are what hurt the game the most because of how annoying they are to navigate. The mission variety is really nice, but by the end they just repeat themselves.The graphics are upgraded greatly with better physics, better looking textures, and higher resolution models. The controls are a little tighter and the camera was fixed a little, but it can still get stuck or lost some times. Overall, Sly 2 is an excellent game, but just feels too similar to the last game. With the whole sandbox idea I feel they are hard to navigate and get in the way of the getting around to different missions.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}

But it comes at a price of maximizing PS3's CPU and Video Card, and there is some lag in response times which doesn't exist in other \"lower quality\" graphics games.For example, the main character is very limited in the speed of his movement. And the response times between his movement and the gamepad is sometimes significant, especially during the fighting scenes.The game also gets very repetitive. You will probably not want to finish this game more than once, which to me is the ultimate test of a game. If you want to play the game repeatedly, that is a hallmark of a good game. This game fails that test.You will be enthralled with the graphics, storyline, and gameplay for the first 5-6 hours. After that, you will probably end up playing something else, like I did.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0045FEEAS","description":"","reviewerName":"Adrian Cooper \"That Guy from Venus. :D\"","summary":"The Wii--like all of Nintendo's previous consoles before it--is worth owning especially alongside a PS3 or an Xbox 360.","reviewText":"The fifth generation of gaming ended years ago and the sixth generation which brought in the PS3, Wii and Xbox 360 is almost on its way out thanks to Nintendo who is bringing in the Wii U some time next year. But since this a review specifically about the Wii, we'll get to it right about.....now.Nintendo's Wii is an interesting console although like most of the others before it, it is underpowered compared to the other two consoles currently for sale. For some reason, Nintendo thought it was best to go with a very similar graphics engine as the GameCube which was definitely last generation's console. Not a good idea if you ask me. However, it doesn't make this offering a lost cause. Once you set things up, you find out you can hook this bad boy up to the internet. You can access online features just like you would on a computer through the myriad channels Nintendo provides--this one in particular--titled The Internet Channel. Other channels you can use are the News and Weather channels (which keep you updated on their respective themes), the Nintendo channel that let's you watch different video clips specified to either give you information on games or show you specific tutorials on how to beat certain parts of a video game or to find something that's well hidden, etc. or the Wii Shop Channel which lets you buy games specifically for the Wii's system called Wiiware or other classics for the Virtual Console. The Wii is also backwards compatible with ALL GameCube discs so that should be an added facet that pleases fans.Another thing from the get go that makes this console intriguing is its controller. Playing a game like Wii Sports for the first time could damn near well be enlightening. At best, the games are fun and super intuitive. My favorites are Tennis and Boxing. You see the Wii uses motion controls that are picked up by a sensor bar. Some have called them \"gimmicky\" which to an extent, I can agree but for many games out there they really, really work. And they work well.Lastly, I'd like to touch on the games. The Wii has a bunch of first party games and some third party games as well. I still haven't experienced nearly enough of them to my liking, but maybe I'll get there one day since the next system is backwards compatible (Thank God. Nintendo, never stop doing this for your systems! I don't know why Sony doesn't make all of their systems backwards compatible. It just makes more sense and is more convenient for us all!). OK. Rant over.Some of the really good first party titles are as follows: Super Mario Galaxy, Kirby's Epic Yarn, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Mario Kart Wii and New Super Mario Bros. (Sorry. That's pretty much all I played that I was impressed with). Other titles I hear are great fun are Muramasa: The Demon Blade, Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Little King's Story, Sonic: Sega All Star Racing, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Punchout, Metal Gear Slug Anthology and Donkey Kong Country: Returns.I happen to appreciate the system because it dared to be different in some way. I wasn't super crazy about motion controls at first, but I got the hang of them eventually. It also has a web browser, a shop for new and old games alike and various other things to take up some of your time. I must say although I don't play it as much as I would like to, I do love my red Wii. ^_^Final score ------> 4.25 stars.This review can also be found on gamespot under the name darksongbird.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005NN5A","reviewerName":"Mark Hills \"Nobody gets me, I'm the wind, baby!\"","summary":"Get the DVDs instead- more laughs, better value","reviewText":"Anyone from Minneapolis or Montreal is likely to play this game and think it's a simulation of driving in either of those cities with the added attraction of extreme property damage. I had debated buying this game for many months and while I am a huge Simpsons fan, many of the PS2 games I have played have been really awful. In fact, from where I stand, about one game in ten is worth playing, much less actually own it. I also usually try to never pay full price of a PS2 game if I can and if that means waiting for it to be reduced in price or made a `Greatest Hits' title, then so be it.`The Simpsons: Road Rage' is one of those games. I can't imagine anyone paying full price for this game, playing it and think it was a good bargain. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad game on the same level that `Time Splitters' was a bad game, rather there just isn't enough to do but pick people up and drop them off somewhere else as quickly as possible or running things down in the so-called `Mission Mode'. Destroying stuff would be at least be visually pleasing if when you crashed into something, instead of the polygon model breaking apart, it exploded like most things in the Simpsons (rabbits, Chief Wiggum in a garbage can), I mean, how many times has a car crashed in the Simpsons and NOT exploded? Right, about 4 times.What's worse is it isn't even that funny. The dialog never seems strained, the actors do their part wonderfully, rather what they say isn't going to win any Emmies. My question here is, in 14 seasons of the Simpsons there have been about 10,000 really funny lines and even if only 5% pertained to cars and driving, they could have just sampled them and stuck them into the game. But no, we get lines like \"Everyone's a psycho but me.\" from Lisa or \"You'd make me the happiest Christian in the world if you could take me to the church!\" from Flanders. Would have been so hard to go to Gracie Films and borrow some of their writers for this game in order to get some GOOD lines? Funny video games are possible, anyone remember `Sam and Max Hit the Road'?Also, the game presents some funny glitches, like two Apu's standing on opposite sides of the street waiting to be picked up. Or the time when driving as Bart I dropped Marge off at the `She She Lounge'. I found Marge waiting to be picked up in the middle of Lake Springfield standing on an island. Later, I found Krusty waiting there as well. Graphics are so-so. A mixed bag of great character models and detailed locations seen in the show, but almost everything else is pretty low-rez and over anti-aliased. Some buildings don't even have textures on all sides. The physics model actually isn't that bad and I wish cars in Gran Tourismo handled as well as the ones in the game do. In that vein, all cars drive and handle the same- whether it's Bart's soap box racer or Marge's Canyonaro.As a Simpsons fan I can barely justify the twenty clams I laid out for this game. It will actually be worth it when it gets to half that.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2003"}

Rossi","summary":"This device is not ready for sale","reviewText":"I bought Wii Sports Resort about 2 weeks ago.  When I first got it, it was really fun.  There were a few shortcomings, but basically it was pretty good.  My motion plus is already broken.  It only stays calibrated for 60 seconds at a crack.  I don't know if the piezoelectric crystal came loose, or if something broke.  The device is complicated, and needs to be re-calibrated every few minutes.  I accept that.  However, it's degraded.  There is a sword fighting game which seems to be the favorite and it's pretty much unplayable at this point.  I'm not going to throw $20 at another device with a lifespan of 2 weeks.  Judging from the other reviews I'm not the only one with this problem.  I recommend waiting for something much more robust.  If not, good luck.***Edit***  Update:  I don't know what happened, but the motion plus started working properly again.  Mind you, it still has shortcomings. If you swing very hard it will un-calibrate, but it is much better than the night of the original review when it was unusable.  Weird...***Second Edit***  Update#2:  It quit working again about a day later.  It's about as robust as a toy one can buy at the dollar store.  This never got ANYTHING but normal use and it was broken.  I don't think we got a bad version of it, I think the design is flawed.

Then again, my B-Spec driver is in a lengthy race, so no harm done.BUT ANYWAY!This game features your Arcade mode, a track creator, Gran Turismo T.V., and a Career mode.  I haven't tried the T.V. mode (and can't right now because PSN is down), but the Career mode is where the bulk of the gaming is.  The Arcade lets you try out some cars...keyword: SOME, and you go through the Career to unlock the rest.  Some cars are fairly cheap and still perform well, i.e. the Corvette ZR1 I have with race mods.  Race mods are modifications to the car that turn it into a race car.  The interior, exterior, and some performance parts are upgraded to racing specs.  Thing is, only 11 cars can be modified to race specs.  That doesn't mean those 11 are dominant cars, however.  The EVO IX (or VIII...don't remember) wouldn't beat my GT-R SpecV, considering both are fully modded and tuned properly.  The only cars that are completely dominant over the others are (as they should be) race-built cars, like the Formula One car Ferrari uses or the LMP1 Audi R10 TDI, which was Audi's old LeMans car before the R15 was introduced.In this mode, you have plenty to do.  You can participate in License challenges which get harder as you progress, you can try your luck in A-Spec races, or teach a driver to perform well in B-Spec races.  A-Spec puts you behind the wheel in the races while B-Spec puts an A.I. driver behind the wheel.  Eventually you begin to unlock special events that you can complete to level yourself up.  The game splits the leveling system into A-Spec and B-Spec levels.  A-Spec leveling is affected by License, A-Spec, and Special Event challenges, while B-Spec can only go up through B-Spec races.As everyone already knows, Gran Turismo has always been a simulation game, and was first released on the PlayStation.  However, my first simulation racing game was Forza Motorsports on the original Xbox, which led me to the sequel on the 360.  Since I no longer have a 360, I decided to check out GT5: Prologue, which, obviously, was the preview to this game.  I liked it, and picked this up.I have to say, I haven't been playing anything else but this game.  It's that amazing.....the gameplay, I mean.Let's start with the good things first.One thing I LOVE about the game is the realism.  Even though I only played the Forza 3 demo, it failed to hold my attention the way Gran Turismo 5: Prologue did, and helps to the fact that I can hardly put this game down.  It seriously feels like you're in the car, feeling every twist, turn, bump, jump, braking, oversteer, and understeer the car dishes out at you.  If you're losing traction in the rear tires, you're going to feel it through the vibration and how your car handles while you're trying to control it through a corner.  You can also feel whenever your car is going over a bumpy surface, and the sense of speed is simply amazing.  I have yet to play a game where it actually scared me to go too fast because it's like the object is very far away, and suddenly it goes \"SURPRISE! I'm right here! :D\", which makes you drive more carefully when trying to generate a hot lap.Another thing that's wonderful is the cars.  While I still missed the Tuned Corvette from Prologue (hardly now thanks to the ZR1), I love driving in a GT-R SpecV, or the Zonda R around Laguna Seca, just to see if I can beat my old times.  Though this game features a total of 1,034 cars, only 220 of them are premium, meaning that only 220 cars in the game have damage and in-car views.......among other things, but I can't remember them right now, and they're really not that important, anyway.  One I DO remember is standards only have one light setting (I think) while premium cars have two.....wow, how cool, right?  Something I'll never see on my car unless I'm watching a replay or I'm ALWAYS looking behind me.There really isn't much I can say that would make anyone think differently about Gran Turismo, but is also good.  It's almost impossible to not understand how realistic this game really is, from the tuning options (though no upgrading brakes.....weird) to being placed into the driver seat of (some of) the cars, you should already know what it has to offer by now.  None of that has changed.  But if you're new to the series, be warned that it is heavily aimed at enthusiasts and people who love cars.  Everyone else is just going to see a big mess and won't understand it.Now for the bad...The menu, while it looks nice in some parts, can get a bit confusing when you're trying to look for something in the Career mode.  It's not a huge issue,especially for me, since I can figure out almost anything pretty quickly, but it's not exactly the most user-friendly menu, either.  Another thing I don't like are the standard cars.  They spent around 6 years on this game, but only 220 cars are \"premium\"?  There shouldn't even be a difference between them if you're going to spend 6 years on a game.  Then again, Sony did want to heavily push the PS3's 3D capabilities, which isn't Polyphony Digital's fault, but it wasn't a good idea to have 220 cars be \"better\" than the others.  Again, not a huge deal, but noticeable.  I also don't understand why my B-Spec driver is sometimes incredibly stupid, even in situations where I would be able to come out in first place.  Sometimes he won't shift properly, and other times he'll spin for no reason.  They are programmed to make mistakes if they become too excited or too relaxed, but for being level 20, it seems as if some of these shouldn't happen.  Maybe I'm not 100% understanding the system as of now.....but again, can't see why they would make foolish mistakes.Another thing I didn't like (and this is actually my fault) is I bought a car that I ended up winning a few races later.  It's pretty sad to buy a 2.6million credit (credit is the currency used in this game) Zonda R, only to win it a half-hour after you bought it.Overall, I love Gran Turismo 5 for its gameplay, but some of the mistakes in the game shouldn't be there, considering it took them 6 years to develop it.  Nevertheless, this is a game I'll be playing for a while, and won't leave my library any time soon.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2011"}

Set 2,000 years prior to the self-titled first game in theSacredseries,Fallen Angelis prequel to the events and quests of earlier RPG hit, that drops players in the midst of an epic struggle for control of elemental power on the grandest of scale.Caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Sacred 2: Fallen AngelPlayers:Offline 1-4; Online 1-4Other:Co-op multiplayer; HDTV 480p, 720p, 1080i; 16:9 widescreen; In-game Dolby Digital sound.6 stunning character classes.View larger.Battle using brute force &amp; steel.View larger.A massive weapons inventory.View larger.Master the lore of the ancients.View larger.Classic RPG character leveling.View larger.The StoryT-Energy has been flowing through Ancaria since time immemorial. This mysterious power forms the beginning of all life, is the source of all magic and the origin of all thought. For eons the angelic Seraphim watched over the T-Energy and therefore over the fate of the entire world. But eventually tiring of their burden, they passed their knowledge on to the High Elves. T-Energy helped the realm of the High Elves to experience an unimaginable boost of prosperity, making it the reigning culture in Ancaria. But a force as powerful as T-Energy carries great dangers. Not taught how to deal with this, no sooner did the Elves take control, then a heated dispute erupted among them as to how and to what purpose the T-Energy was to be used. Dispute morphed into irresolvable conflict, then rift and eventually to a civil war among the High Elves, where all participants were losers. Their realm collapsed and with it the entire power structure of Anacaria. In the turmoil all the peoples of Anacaria coveted the right, either openly or in secret, to wield the power of T-Energy and in the end, unmanaged, the T-Energy raged out of control warping creature and lands alike. Can anyone regain control over the T-Energy. And if so, will he/she strive to prevent the world from lapsing into final chaos, or deepen it?GameplayGameplay inSacred 2: Fallen Angelin divided into two campaign paths: Light and Dark. As the game begins players choose and customize their character and choose the path they will follow. This choice determines the ultimate goal and intentions of their character, and as the game progresses through literally hundreds of quests and side quests, the paths of different characters intersect at different junctions. Choose one way and you may be tasked to defend a town and its people, while another path could result in you attacking the same town. The choice is yours and the fate of the world and your well-being are at stake.Key Game Features:A massive, seamless and dynamic world delivering hundreds of hours of freeform exploration.Two deep campaigns: play as the 'Light' or 'Shadow' side, complete with distinct skills, rewards and story-elements tailored to the chosen path.Six exceptional, playable characters, each with a distinct look, capabilities and in-game motivation.Modifiable combat arts: change, upgrade and link together your alter ego's combat skills to match your playing style.Fight effectively from the back of a number of mounts under your control; equip and upgrade your character's unlockable special mount.Deities offer unique combat disciplines and unlock additional quests.Seamless transition between single and multiplayer gaming modes via Xbox LIVE.Captivating online modes of play challenge gamers in cooperative, PvP and PvE play.Extraordinary, cutting-edge graphics and Dolby 5.1 channel surround sound utilize the latest technologies for a truly immersive experience.Character ClassesInSacred 2: Fallen Angelplayers assume the role of one of six characters -- five of which are new to the franchise -- and delve into a thrilling story full of side quests and secrets that you will have to unravel. Breathtaking combat arts and sophisticated spells are waiting to be learned. A multitude of weapons and items will be available, and you will choose which of your character's attributes you will enhance with these items in order to create a unique and distinct hero.SeraphimOften referred to as 'Fallen Angels,' these mystical and angelic creatures are the oldest inhabitants of Ancaria. Fast, elegant and acrobatic warriors from a technological future they fight with light to medium weapons and, if required, with massive technological support. Players can assume the role of a Seraphim and protect the world from chaos.Shadow WarriorShadow Warriors were originally humans trained as elite soldiers in service to the High Elves. Upon their death their souls were stolen by an Elven general, bound to lifeless bodies and imbued with T-Energy. Now free, they travel between this world and the next as undead beings with only the desire to return to the peace of the golden halls of Elysium.High ElfThe best student at the ancient academy of magic in Thylysium, the High Elf character lives and breathes magic. Her hunger for adventure and her insatiable desire to increase her personal knowledge and the influence of her once-powerful house are the driving forces as she sets off into an Ancaria boiling over with turmoil.DryadMasters of the hunt and akin to the Elves, The Dryad are in tune with nature and are equipped with the strength of the forests. The most powerful and the strongest among them are knowledgeable of the dark art of voodoo and were chosen in order to save their peoples from extinction. All are expert with the bow, traps, poisons and lore of the forest.InquisitorThe Inquisitors are the High Priests of the High Elves. Arrogant and deadly, they are only committed to themselves and their ultimate goal of assume control over the T-Energy. Proficient in close combat and able to gain increasing power as damage is taken, their manipulative spells make them powerful fighters from the shadows.Temple GuardianSince the beginning of time the purpose of Temple Guardians were to maintain and protect the Great Machine, so that it could keep the world in balance. Neither fully flesh or mechanical, they are half human and half machine. Propelled by T-Energy and devoted to protecting it, they are part of the Great Machine and so able to use the T-Energy for their purposes.A Wide Variety of MountsAcross Ancaria you will find many horse dealers. They offer all kinds of animals, from the simple nag up to a real war horse. You can equip a war horse with bridle, saddle and even special armor. These special items can be found in the game just like player items, ranging in quality from regular to rare and even unique items. In addition, every character also has a unique mount created specifically for their character class. This mount not only fits the personality of the character, but also complements the various aspects of the character's playing style perfectly. All character classes can fight from a mounted position using a variety of tactics that the player chooses depending on the terrain and battle conditions.","reviewerName":"Raul Duke \"Gonzo HST\"","summary":"the massive fantasy action rpg that consoles have been needing","reviewText":"Not since Oblivion have i been so locked into a console rpg. the map is simply huge. it is literally at least 2 times the size of oblivion. the easiest way to explain the gameplay: Diablo II style loot grind set in one of the largest open fantasy worlds on home console. you're almost constantly rewarded with new armor, weapons, and skills.controls are simple and everything from combat to item management is extremely user friendly. from your menu you can hotkey items and skills to the face buttons and use them by simply holding the corresponding face button.you can take the quest online in 2-4 player online co op, and the co op is so fantastic, the best co op in a console rpg. forget what fable 2 did, keeping you within 10 feet of eachother. you can travel to opposite ends of the map if choose, and everything runs generally smooth.ive experience some noticeable slow down at times when playing online, but nothing that breaks this epic game offering hundreds of hours of rpg goodness. for thirsty fans of the genre, this game is a total blast thats going to take over 99% of your free time over the next few months.graphics are colorful and inviting. considering this is a relatively up and comming developer im impressed by the level of detail and attention paid throughout the world: fish swim through the rivers, cows fill the fields near farms, you find deer in the woods, ect. you're constantly finding new sites. the exploration element is fantastic.a few technical flaws hold it back from perfection, the draw distance leaves a lot to be desired with heavy fog effects within 100 feet and there is semi frequent pop up.the only other complaints i have are the voice acting (not the worst but pretty mediocre) the fact that the story is pretty run of the mill, and some mild slowdown/freezing issues occassionally, but i cant say enough to encourage rpg fans to purchase this game.to summarize, this game offers one of the biggest game worlds in the history of console gaming with 6 races to choose from and hundreds of hours worth of quests set in 2 campaigns (Light/Dark) - aka - console rpg heaven.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2009"}

Ever since then, most racing game, for me, have been typical and boring.  And here recently, Need For Speed has been making a huge fool of their IP's.  An example of this would be the 2012 revamp of Most Wanted, which I believe was terrible.  I did however like Burnout Paradise and Need For Speed Hot Pursuit (2010).  But this game beats them all for me.  I was never a fan of Project Gotham Racing or Forza Motorsport games because I can't stand the closed circuit tracks and such, but this game is such a relief.  It bridges the gap between simulation racing and arcade racing styles perfectly and is a joy to play.  The only downside to it is that it can be short if you don't let yourself relax and get sidetracked here and there, and there is no way to keep your garage and start a new save, but I think it's about as perfect as can be and with the Forza team of Turn 10 Studios and the conglomeration that is Playground Games both having made it, you can tell.  There are evidences from many other racing games present in this one game such as a DiRT style menu and the Forza feel and physics along with the styles from teams like Criterion.  This game is a 10/10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2013"}

I figure it's the best way to avoid the hype machinery that can lead to disappointment.  I didn't have high hopes for F.E.A.R., but I have to say, this is a game where the demo is the best part.I played the demo of F.E.A.R. and saw some excellent things: eerie supernatural events that would startle and occasionally terrify you, gorgeous graphics, and a feel to your movement that might give some people motion-sickness, it's tied that closely to your \"body\".Unfortunately, once you start putting serious time into the gameplay, you quickly realize that the devil is in the details.  For one, the \"horror\" elements turn out to be few and far between.  They quickly take a back-seat to the core concept of \"I'm running through a factory, an office, or an office in a factory, and paramilitary squads are trying to kill me.\"  But what really dropped the disappointment-bomb was the \"AI\" of your enemies.  Even on the \"hard\" difficulty level, enemies do the following:1) Shout loudly (at times they sound like they have shoulder-mounted bullhorns)--telling you exactly what they're going to do, where they are, and whether or not they know you're there2) Run directly at you3) Duck behind something--say, a desk--and stay there until you clear the room, lean over the top of the desk, and shoot them at point-blank range4) Throw grenades at just exactly the right angle to make them bounce who-knows-whereI'd like to say the badness stops there, but let's just say that, despite some good voice-acting, great dialogue, and a premise that reminds me of the days I used to like The X-Files...ultimately, it goes nowhere.  The goal of your first mission turns out to be the goal of the entire game:  every level begins with \"Find and eliminate Paxton Fettel.\"Good points are, the game has very good graphics.  It balances settings pretty well to try to give you the best performance, and will even do a \"test flythrough\" and generate a report on how well your settings work.  This is a good game for multiplayer.  It would also be decent for moments when you just want to load something and shoot dummies:  jump in, play a level, and come back when you're bored with everything else.  Otherwise, there are a lot of good ideas that ultimately miss the mark.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2006"}

{"product_name":"B000FW87AI","reviewerName":"Goldenroom","summary":"The most brutal version yet","reviewText":"When THQ first started the smackdown series, I have to admit that I was not a fan. Smackdown \"just bring it\" was awful. I thought I would never play another one, but I decided to give \"shut your mouth\" a try, and it was a big improvement. Since then every version seems to get a little better.What I like most about the Smackdown games is... well, laying the smackdown. I love giving a good beating, and this game allows you to lay the ultimate smackdown. I love the hotspots: being able to slam my opponents head into the steel steps, or rubbing his face into the steel cage. Also, for the first time since \"just bring it\" you can now carry the fight into the crowd (kind of). However, the best smackdown comes in the hell in the cell. You now have the ability to throw an opponent off the cage and through the announce table. Imagine seeing the great khali choke slamming his opponent off the cell and through the table. you can do it!Yes, there are a few drawbacks. no bra and panties matches for the divas. Also for some reason its harder to stomp on downed opponents. Many times you will try to kick a downed opponent and the kicks don't connect. Also, the commentary has a few glitches.Drawbacks aside (and there are only a few), this is the best smackdown game yet, and I love the addition of Mr Perfect to list of legends.However, one thing I can't understand is why THQ adds new elements to the series and takes them away, such as the pre match mini games that we got in 2006. Another great element which was taken out after \"shut your mouth\" was the after match option where you could push a button to attack the opponent after the match.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2007"}

Of course, on the other hand, it's a little distressing to realize how much I DON'T know!!  Nevertheless, an excellent tool for students or really anyone who wishes to expand their vocabulary.  As a writer, this reivewer finds the experience invaluable - kind of like forming your own thesaurus in your own mind!I only gave this FOUR stars on fun simply because it IS learning and sometimes the games can be a little difficult, especially when presented with several unknown words.  That IS a good thing, it gives an opportunity to learn these words.What is very nice is that immediately following each mini game, the words utilized in the mini game are presented again along with definitions.  Also, some of the same words will be used in subsequent games (especially those which the player \"missed\"); this is a wise thing to do in my opinion, what has one learned if the \"missed\" words are simply missed and the player simply goes on to new words?  This at least will help the player (hopefully) retain the new words, even the \"missed\" ones.I DO wish that the game gave the player a little more time on the falling block games - it's one of my favorites; however, I almost always get a time PENALTY.  Just a hint, to go a little faster, tap the down arrow and more letters will drop so you won't waste precious seconds waiting for the correct letter - you may have to use the bomb a few times but you won't get as much of a penalty.  The penalty does not really mean anything other than your pride...  You still get credit for correct answers.The handwriting recognition is certainly decent.

So Hori has a history of making quality accesories for several game devices, I know them mostly for making the best Nintendo portable screen protectors. But here we are and now Hori has provided a screen protector for the Wii U gamepad.The protector is just as great as all their other screen protectors so you can't go wrong with it.However I do have to warn you about a few things:- I read a review that once they applied the screen protector the Gamepad went nuts and wouldn't recognize input properly and just stopped working as it should. This also happened to me the first time. However, I simply removed the protector and placed it again and the problem was gone. I don't know exactly what caused it, maybe the screen took the protector as input when it really wasn't. But anyway if this happens to you, just re-apply the filter and you'll be fine.- The filter is obviously larger than your typical DS filters, so if you manage to get air bubbles and dust in while applying it, it might be more difficult to remove those. But, it is not impossible either so, just take some time and be patient to clean everything, re-apply carefully, and push out the air, and you'll be fine.So yeah there may or may not be some extra hurdles but ultimately it is still your better option to protect the Gamepad touchscreen.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2013"}

So, I won't be comparing this one to the original DS.  Anyway, the DS is a great system, and I've thoroughly enjoyed having it, although I have some minor quibbles.  Let the review begin!First off, the DS Lite is well-designed for the most part.  It's sleek, sassy, and attractive.  The screens have a built-in brightness adjustment feature, which is nice.  Overall, the design is good.  I do have one complaint, though.  I have the black version and it seems to be a magnet for fingerprints.  I don't know if it's just the color or the material or what, but I can just wave my hand over it and fingerprints will appear.  Oh well, a nice decal will solve that problem!Now, as much as I love my DS Lite, the fact remains that the PSP has way better graphics.  So, the PSP is the more technically impressive machine.  However, the DS has a better game library, which is why I chose it.  Truth be told, if the PSP had the same game library available, I would have chosen it.  Not necessarily because of the graphics (which don't matter all that much to me), but because of the touch screen.  You heard me.  I really don't know how to feel about the touch screen.  On the one hand, point-and-click adventures make really good use of the touch screen and are fun to play that way.  On the other hand, because a touch screen is available, game developers feel the need to shoehorn in as much touch screen functionality as possible, even when it hurts gameplay.  For example, Sonic Chronicles forces you to do everything with the touch screen, including moving your character when it would be so much less tedious to use the d-pad.  I suppose that's the fault of the game developer and not the DS itself, but the PSP won't suffer from such things since it has no touch screen.  Oh well, this argument is kind of pointless, but I thought I'd mention that little quibble anyway.Overall, I highly recommend getting a DS.  It works well, and the game library is great.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2009"}

TWO STEPS BACK","reviewText":"That's generally how I feel about this game overall: They made a few improvements but at the same time they neglected some aspects of the game that would have made it more playable.PROS:1) I love the 3D globe! Here's a feature that I was dreaming about when I played countless hours of the first Civilization game and Civilization II. It's nice to be able to see all your cities at a glance and what they are currently building, what their defense bonus is and watch your cities sprawl over the countryside.2) No more \"cavemen defeats battleship\" syndrome. If you played the first Civilization, you know what I mean. Basically, the combat is more realistic when two different units fight.3) Religion. I must admit, this added a whole new dimension to the game.4) More automated commands that come in handy when you don't want to micromanage every little unit or city.CONS:1) WHERE'S THE FUN? I'm sorry, but I've played 3 or 4 complete games of Civ IV on Epic timeframe and I find myself getting bored by the year 1900 (which is when things SHOULD be getting more interesting). This boredom never happened to me with the first Civilization. Here are some possibilities why this might be:2) If you build a city the VERY first turn it will then take you a whopping 38 TURNS to produce a \"Settler\" unit. But here's the kicker: 38 turns means 1500 years have elapsed. Oh PLEASE! You can't be telling me that it takes 1500 years for some cavemen to learn how to put some twig buildings together (the cast of Survivor could do better than that!). In short, EXTREMELY unrealistic unit production times.2) In the first Civilization, I accepted the fact that each city can only work on one project at a time (build a barracks, train a diplomat, etc). But seeing as this is the FOURTH game in the series, I find it unforgivable that a city of half a million people can't MULTI-TASK (make a barracks AND train a unit at the same time, sure would be nice!).3) The enemy AI is suspect. I remember playing Warlord difficulty in previous Civilizations and having a breeze of laying waste to my enemies. Now . . . It seems that every time I get ahead the enemy is not too far behind me or even ahead of me, technologically.4) As a result of the long unit production times and the fact that cities can't multi-task, I found it rather pointless to build large armies (you could do it, but your cities wouldn't have any vital buildings to speak of). Therefore, combat simply wasn't fun, I was too busy building harbors and other stuff to improve my city so I could in turn improve my economy, my military . . . vicious circle.5) I researched COMPUTERS but I couldn't go further until I researched something as ridiculous as HORSEBACK RIDING. The progression of research is deeply flawed, in my opinion.OVERALL: One thing I'd like to add: I did not have any installation problems with this game or any other bugs or glitches--I would have rated it much lower if it did. But even being a fully-working product, this game just didn't deliver. I would get bored by the year 1900 and would start wishing I could be playing the original Civilization or the second one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2006"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Realizing potential","reviewText":"When Microsoft pumped out the XBox 360 in 2005, I looked at it with hesitation.  Was it too much too soon?  How long would it take Sony to reclaim the top spot with the PS3?  Well, it's 2007 now, and in that span of time, things have changed.  Though it's launch library hardly did the console justice, the XBox 360 is a marvelous machine, and now, there is a steady stream of excellent games coming out for the system that really make it worth buying over competing consoles.  Not to mention that XBox Live can't be beat, and the XBox Live Arcade (which just added the masterpiece that is Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, as well as the excellent Alien Hominid HD) service is spectacular as well.  Microsoft is also (thankfully) expanding the backwards compatability with old XBox games, much to fans' delight.  The only downside to the XBox 360 are the technical issues that many have reported with the system.  The \"three rings of death\" are real, but hopefully that will be something Microsoft can correct with the next line of systems.  This XBox 360 Elite console comes with a much larger hard drive, which automatically makes it worth owning if you don't already own a 360.  More and more, the 360 is realizing it's potential, and with Halo 3 and Grand Theft Auto IV on the horizon (along with one time Sony exclusives making their way onto the system as well like the new Devil May Cry), the future of the 360 is looking brighter and brighter every day.

But then I heard that the new company was basically all the Kotor I people that had branched/left Bioware.  I found this sequel to be absolutely great, and, in many ways, an improvement over the first game without trying to be better than the first game.  It basically is more of an expansion than a squel.  It uses the same system, many of the same voice actors (some of them for obvious resons), similar character models, same ship Ebon Hawk.Pros:Excellent story!Customizable characters and customizable equipmentDecisions made actually influence the gameMultiple quests, each sending you down a light/dark side pathGoals often have multiple methods for accomplishmentCons:Prone to crash due to video card strainsOpen ended quest system not good for non-exploring playersThe Companion conversations are slimMany areas seem slim (i.e. Dantooine), others filled with much unused space (i.e. Nar Shaddaa)Certain glitches prevent progressComparisons to the first game:Containers now indicate if they are emptyUpgrades to armor, weapons and lightsabers have been completely expanded.Ability to create items was added.You can affect the alignment of your party members.Space walking is faster !!!Epic characters, prestige classes for the main character, more challenging swoop races, more feats, more force powers, lightsaber forms and more.Ok, for those that have not played the first game, go and play it.  This sequel makes so many references to the first game that you'd probably be pretty lost in the game if you haven't played it.  And playing this game could totally spoil the first one for you, and that would be a crime, believe me.  But one of the good things about these two games is that they are not so far appart that one appears to be the \"lesser\" (as with Soul Calibur I&II;).  The second game definitely has more in it and expands beyond that of the first game.  If you play them out of order the first game might seem thinned out as far as gameplay is concerned.Companions:This is a nifty part of the game.  The influence system with your companions determines what conversations you can have with them, not how long they were in the or walking around with you.  Your companions play a major role in the experience of the game.  But not only that, you can effect your companion's path and class progression.  This does have its drawbacks.  For me, I managed to finish all of one party member's conversations fairly early in the game (Handmaiden's).  For the rest of the game there was little interaction between and that party member, excpet for the few and treasured comments and questions made in response to certain actions out on the field.  But it was nice to get away from the Never Winter Nights idea of \"gotta level up before they'll talk to me again\".  As well, you can influence your companions and sway their opnions about you.  You do this by the way you talk with them and by making decisions that are more in line with their ideas and beliefs.  Certain party members favor compassion over cruelty, honesty over deciet, etc.  This doesn't really have any other ingame value that I've noticed so far (having played through it 3 times).  But developing your companions and getting to know them, share experiences with them can give you in-game bonuses or perks.  And there is the return of HK-47 and T3.  Also, character-character interaction usually takes place on the Ebon Hawk after you board it each time.Upgrades:Items could be upgraded in the first game, armors, blasters, melee and lightsabers.  But this time around there's more, instead of just the same type of upgrades, there are multiple types of the same upgrade that effect the items differently.  Lightsabers also have more than just crystals to upgrade them.  On top of this, you can make your own upgrades.  Anything item can be broken down into components.  You can then create other items.  The same thing goes for medicals, mines, grenades and the like.Feats, Force Powers, Classes, d20 stuffThe new feats are not your typical d20 stuff.  The first game didn't have all that much in common with the d20 Star Wars setting.  Kotor II does not change that.  It adds a few new feats, such as Dual Strike, and improves a few others (makes Power Shot worth taking).  The force powers are also expanded upon, more so in the dark side range.  The use of force powers from opposing alignments is effected by your charisma score, which can lessen the Force Point cost penalty for using them.  There are also new Force Powers only obtainable through companion quests.  As far as skills are concerned, crafting the items depends on your skill level.  So being well rounded can have its advantages.  As well, more choices in conversations pop up due to having invested in skills, though Persuade is still the most frequent one.  Even attribute scores can give conversations new direction.  The classes are still pretty much like the first game, no multiclassing for you!  However, this time around you start off as a jedi class and can eventually end up in a prestige class (main character only).Over all the gameplay is pretty much the same.  Those that played the first game will find that this one fits like an old glove.  And if for some reason you are playing this game without having played the first one (shame on you) then you'll find that it's easy to learn.  There were only a few true gripes I had about this game though, 1: shortage of lightsabes and an abundance of people that can use them, 2: many glitches that just mess you up ( Iziz swoop glitch- you never \"finish\", random companion conversations that pop up without reason, sometimes they are keyed with the Dark Side and you have no way to NOT get out on the good, glitch that kills PT members), and finally 3, the ending.  I won't spoil a thing, but I was left a little hung, kinda like the ending of Empire Strikes Back.  The first game ended well and rounded (alignment depending).  A few really cool things is that if you have played the first game you get to explain Revan's fate (which alters voice acting for the rest of the game), the appearances of the first game's characters are also small treats (esepcially the ones that are still in the party).There isn't much in the way of character romance but more tension.  There are mutliple paths in the game so enjoy.  I've discovered some really different paths and differences in several battles beucase of them.  TIP: keep the bombs you get in Korriban and use them later in Dxun.  And level 12 is the farthest you want to take any of your jedi friends in their non-jedi classes.  And yes, the cheat system is still pretty much the same, and it still brands your save files.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2005"}

As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive. Japanese  actor Takeshi Kaneshiro lent his voice to the main character, and a  200-piece orchestra delivers a dramatic score.Call over any PS2 skeptics in your neighborhood, then load upOnimusha: Warlords.

The first of a small handful of PS2 games that genuinely look good. The voice acting is a bit too quiet though, and if you're dumb like me and turn the subtitles off you miss a lot of the dialogue. The overall story, however, is great. I rather enjoyed the way the story tried to tie into real Japanese history the way that White Wolf games try to tie the World of Darkness into our own creating a somewhat believeable horror story. The best part of this game, however, is it's fully orchistrated sound track, simply put it's one of the most amazing soundtracks ever written for a game.The puzzels and fetch quests are managable and you will not likely need a strategy guide for this game, not that it's easy, but if you take a few minutes to stop and think about what you're doing you can figure it all out on your own, which is nice. You feel so much smarter when you figure a game like this out on your own.For it's merrits, there are however some major flaws. The control scheme, once again Capcom refused to abandon the archaic Resident Evil style controls, which makes combat a little more difficult than it needed to be, but thankfully once you adjust to the agonizing control mechanics and build up your weapons and learn the magic spells and special moves it becomes easier, plus you can block and perry which is helpful. Devil May Cry is much better, but this was a good prelude. The game was also the first in what seems to be a trend in hotly anticipated titles that present a strong story, great graphics, great sound, but can be beaten in less than six hours, and is just flat out too short, way too short. I clocked in at about 2 and a half hours. I'd like developers to start making longer games again. Here's hoping for a longer sequel, and one that will play less like Resident Evil, and more like Devil May Cry.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2001"}

It was the beginning of a new era- the Cold War.October 16, 1962. The President of the United States received word   that the Soviet Union had deployed nuclear missiles in Cuba. The world    trembled in fear as the prospect of nuclear war loomed ever closer.   After days of tense negotiations, the Soviets finally agreed on the 28th   to withdraw their missiles from Cuban soil. With the resolution of this   incident, later to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it    seemed that humanity had survived yet another threat to its existence.However, there was a secret condition in the deal that put an end to   the crisis. Nokolai Stepanovich Sokolov, a Soviet scientist who had   defected    to the West, was to be sent back to the Soviet Union. The U.S.   government agreed to this stipulation, and returned Sokolov back to his   native    land. Little did they know that Sokolov was to be the designer of a   nightmarish weapon.

{"product_name":"B00319DX4M","description":"Enslavedis a post-apocalyptic retelling of the classic 400-year old novel &lsquo;Journey to the West&rsquo;. Set 150 years from now, the world has been ruined by war and ecological disaster with only a handful of survivors remaining.End Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Uncharted 2 fans will like it","reviewText":"Ninja Theory, the creator of Heavenly Sword, are the minds behind Enslaved. Since I liked Heavenly Sword for the most part, thought why not give this one a shot. At least the trailers looked good. After finishing the game once and replaying few chapters, here is my impression.PROS.ADORABLE CHARACTER DESIGN: One thing Ninja Theory knows how to do is character design. The main characters (while not many), are really beautifully designed. While the facial expressions of characters are not as remarkable as say in top notch games such as Uncharted 2, they are still very good. Other than character's aesthetic looks, the Ninja Theory has also done wonderful job portraying character personalities. Little quibbles and exchange of emotions between main characters Trip and Monkey make the story very touchy and enjoyable. You have to play it to feel it.GORGEOUS LEVELS AND WONDERFUL GRAPHICS: Again not as gorgeous as you may see in games like Uncharted 2 or God of War 3 nevertheless they are some of the most stunning graphics you see in games these days. The game is set in post apocalyptic setting; however, Enslaved has much different view of post apocalyptic settings than games such as Fallout 3 or Rage. While surroundings are barren and filled with enemies, they still have greenery and majesty to them. Each level (chapter) has different types of settings. This variety truly prevents the experience from being repetitive.TACTICAL BATTLES: Compare to their previous game, the Heavenly Sword, the battles are more tactical. Pure button mashing will easily get you killed on normal or higher difficulty mode while proper use of dodge, defend and combo hits will give you edge over the enemies. Thinking and executing commands will feel very rewarding and keep you engaged in the gameplay.ACROBATS AND STRATEGIC GAMEPLAY: In this game to get through a level, you will have to travel from one structure to another. For that you will mainly utilize Monkey character who can acrobatically jump from wall to wall, climb upward etc. However, you will also have to make sure that you help out the side character Trip by making a way for her, assisting her to reach high places by throwing her etc. (kind of like Prince of Persia 2000 game and Uncharted 2). The side character Trip is not as useless as she sounds though. She will create decoy for you so you can safely go past machine guns, upgrade your weapons and even heal you. So honestly it is pretty fun controlling both characters.ENGAGING STORY AND UNIQUE ENDING: This is what I loved the most about this game. Almost every action you perform has something to do with the story. While a lot a games these days make the gameplay repetitive by mindlessly forcing you to perform the same actions repetitively, in this game there is a clear story related motive behind each of the objective. Also, the ending is mysterious, unique and deep.UPGRADABLES: You can upgrade your moves, weapon, defense etc. Doing so will give you an edge in combat and make the battles more enjoyable. Love how majority of games are adding RPG element to them. This is one of the few things that make this game somewhat replayable, unfortunately.CONS.SHORT GAME AND LITTLE OR NO REPLAYABILITY: The game lasted me about 13 hours, but I am one of the people who will walk to each and every corner of a map during the very first gameplay to get majority of collectibles, so it always takes me longer than average player to get through the game. Unfortunately, once you finish the game there is not much to do. The game does give you option to play your favorite chapters (so you don't have to play the whole game again), but honestly that's only good for unlocking particular achievements.RIGID CONTROLS:  While they work well for most part, compare to games like Prince of Persia, jumping wall to wall and climbing wall controls feel quite rigid. You have to wait few milliseconds before you tap the button again jump from wall to wall smoothly. Wish it were as fluid as Prince of Persia games. Same thing with combat, if you have played Heavenly Sword and Devil May Cry 3, the difference is the same. Action is not as smooth as in games like Devil May Cry 3.  This is particularly concerning to me as the Ninja Theory is not directing Devil May Cry reboot. Hope they fix these controls by then.LACK OF VARIETY IN ENEMIES AND BOSSES: While they do have few different types of enemies and bosses, majority of small fry enemies look the same and major bosses simply reappear in later levels. Disappointed.CONCLUSION:All and all it is a pretty good game, but I truly wish it were a bit longer. Nevertheless, I truly think fans of games like Prince of Persia (2000) and Uncharted 2 should at least give it a rent. Chances are you will like it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2010"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Rockstar's Labor of Love","reviewText":"One full Blu disc (or 6 Xbox DVDs eventually compressed down to 3), 21 hours of voice acting, 60 blocks of 1940's L.A. mapped and reproduced in exquisite detail, 400 actors, took several (six?) years to develop, MotionScan technology using 32 HD cameras to capture face expressions... All impressive but in the end it comes down to \"is it fun to play?\"The short answer is: my first 8 hours of L.A. Noire sleuthing exceeded my expectations and it was hard for me to put down the controller and write this brief review - except that the kids wanted to take their turn too :). There is no consensus yet but anyone who wants to make the case that 'games' are 'art' could definitely use Dead Red Redemption and L.A. Noire to support their case. So, here is my quick overview.THE STORYWorld War 2 just ended and L.A. is in full transformation. 'The car' becomes increasingly important in an expanding city without boundaries but as the Hollywood-dominated city grows so does crime - drug trafficking, individuals all too eager to exploit the would-be actresses. Add to that thousands of recently-discharged soldiers looking for jobs and a new life and a sometimes too brutal and corrupt police force and L.A. clearly needs Cole Phelps, a Silver Star decorated war hero turned cop, determined to do the right thing and fight the crime waves.You play Cole, starting as a rookie cop, handling cases specifically assigned to you or responding to calls for help while on duty. As you and your partner solve cases - and there are 21 'main story' cases plus 40 street quests - you advance in rank and you are trusted with solving the more complex puzzles.THE WORLD AND THE INTERACTIONSYou have a choice between the 'noir' style black and white or 'colored', mostly brown and grey visuals. Either way, there is an unbelievable amount of detail and, it seems, historical accuracy when portraying the 1947ish Los Angeles. You can drive your car yourself following the accurate street map or you can ask your partner to drive to your next destination, which is the equivalent of a 'teleport'. Once at or near the crime scene or out investigating you can enter buildings, examine and file what seems to be evidence, talk to people, engage in brawls or shootouts and so forth.This is not an action game but there is quite a bit of action - shooting, fist fights, car chases - only the actual fighting is not at the core of the game. What really moves the game forward is the gathering of evidence, the questioning of suspects and your ability to solve the case based on the information you gather. The questioning part is one of the more innovative aspects because you need to decide whether you trust an answer based not only on what the suspect or the witness is saying but by examining their body language and their facial expressions because whether you see a lie for what it is has an impact on what the next steps are going to be.Whenever on foot, the game offers both audible and 'rumble' feedback when you are near of objects that you should probably examine. There's also some special scene music that tells you when you are probably done at one specific location.Driving recklessly can and does get you into accidents and you can damage the surroundings, including innocent bystanders but, as far as I can tell, that does not affect the game much.INTERACTIVITYThis is by necessity a single player game and everything is scripted so I was surprised that, from time to time, you CAN contact 'the community'. It's not often but if you have what it's called, I believe, an 'intuition point', you can use it to check what action the majority of players took in a similar situation.Then there is, of course, your interaction with Rockstar. My game came with 2 bonuses, because of my Amazon pre-order but I can't get them because the Playstation Store needs to be up for me to enter the code. I was able to get some other bonus for jointing the Rockstar Games Social Club. By the way, attempting to access the Playstation Store from within the game caused it to crash hard - had to manually turn off the PS3 because it froze and it became unresponsive.MY RATINGI've had a lot of fun playing L.A. Noire so far. Unlike some of their competition, and they know who they are, the last 2 Rockstar games this one and Red Dead Redemption are extremely original and entertaining to the point where you don't want to stop playing - and I do want to stop playing because I do have a real job and I don't want to take another day off. Also, unlike their competition products, this game did not crash (except when trying to get to the PS Store), you don't see cars floating 3 ft. above the tarmac or people walking or punching through walls. All is perfectly polished.Eight hours into it, I am nowhere near the end of the game. The first assignments were not overwhelmingly difficult but I can see how they missions are getting harder. The crime-solving part, not the combat which is only 'fun'. I hope the cases get a lot harder because I don't want this game to end too quickly. From what I've read, the main story line should take about 20 hours to complete and that should be 40-50 hours in my time. You add the side quests or street cases and it should be a substantial game.Based on what I've played so far, this is how I rate it:- GRAPHICS - 5/5 - exquisite is the proper word. As I said, you can select black an white if you want and set the proper level of brightness.- SOUND - 5/5 - you get audio clues and then there is this great atmospheric music and, if you are in the right place at the right time, you get to listen to some great jazz.- QUALITY - 5/5 - as in bug-free. It's one of the cleaner games.- ACTING - 5/5 - the characters are real actors and MotionScan's ability to show 'expressions' makes all the difference.- PLOT - 4/5 - while each case is different, there is a more or less fixed pattern: you get the case, you investigate and most of the time there is some shootout of fist fight, then you take the next case. I don't believe you can put one 'main story' case on hold and pick the next one. You can only do opportunistic 'side quests'.- WORLD - 5/5 - the rendering of a city couldn't have been done better, giving today's technology.- OPTIONS - 4/5 - you can tweak the difficulty a little by giving yourself the ability to 'skip and move forward' if you can't win a fight and you can pick between color/b&w; and brightness. Not to many other major options that I'm aware of at this time.- COMMUNITY (or multiplayer) 3/5 - you can get help from the community from time to time but it's not an essential part of the game.- NICKEL-AND-DIMING - 4/5 - can't tell how the game is going to evolve but Rockstar's ability to nickel and dime the players should be quite limited. The game menu does have a 'downloadable content' section but, this being such a highly scripted and hard do make game, I doubt that major extra content is likely to be made available soon. I have 3 free bonuses so far and the Social Club membership promises more and I hope that they stay this way - free, that is.- REPLAY VALUE - 2/5 - this is a highly scripted game, it's not likely that you are going to play it again.- RESELL VALUE - 4/5 - there are some bonuses that came in the box but they should not be missed much by the next person playing the game.L.A. Noire is a 5-star for me. I am happy we bought it and we are happily playing it._____________________________________NOTE - just in case someone didn't notice this, you get a $15 Amazon certificate if you order the game which effectively makes it a $44 game.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2011"}

If you like playing detective and solving cases than this game is for you.  I remember playing the police quest pc game back in the day and this game reminds me a lot of that but you got a lot more cases and more to do.  Since  you get a $20 credit with the game, buy the strategy guide with the credit.  Trust me its worth it.Most of the cases take about an hour to complete and theres is about 21 cases plus 40 street crimes.  Which you can respond to while driving to the main case.  The street crimes are like bank robberies, gang fights, suspicious activity, or someone just going crazy and shooting at people.  The cases are very detailed and graphic.  In some cases, you'll start off at a crime scene in front of a naked dead girl covered in blood.  Overall, the game is pretty awesome.

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Miranda Prince \"Punky Monkey\"","summary":"Not Very Interesting","reviewText":"I rented Super Mario Sunshine instead of buying it, and I'm glad. (It's always a good idea to rent a game first...The graphics are gorgeous, and the sound is good too (I don't usually pay that much attention to sound in games, so I can't really evaluate it).This is probably one of those \"love it or hate it\" games. I found the premise -- Mario is falsely accused of splattering a resort town with paint, and is sentenced to community service cleaning up the mess -- cute but not compelling.The camera drove me crazy. Yes, it's (usually) 360 degrees, but it's also almost always pointed the wrong way. I liked it better when a game's camera would automatically point in a logical direction, even if that meant I couldn't control the camera.Lots of people love this game. If you want a traditional \"kill monsters and pick up trinkets\" platform game in a 3-D environment, you'll love it too...","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2002"}

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Cindy Mcgee","summary":"So Stupid!","reviewText":"Now, before you say anything, I have played this game and beaten it in the week provided by blockbuster(grudgingly playing it though)and now for the unbaiased opinion.

It isn't a sequel, it isn't a shooter, it has no expensive star power backing it and the studio it comes from is almost unheard of. Yet I have never played anything like it. It brings back faint memories of Deus Ex, but it is far different, and in it's own right, an extremely intelligent, very well executed video game. This game kept me hooked for over 13 hours. Once I was plugged in, I couldn't let go. When I wasn't playing I was wishing I was, and constantly wondering what would happen next, in the same way a good book can keep you hooked for hours on end. With all this praise, you are probably wondering just what exactly the game is about. Well, the synaposis above does an admirable job of explaining the nut-shell version of the story, but it goes far deeper. Between premonitions, cult-ish murders and an ever lowering temperature, all wraped nicely in a story where you play not only as a seemingly possesed murder suspect, but also as the detectives who are hunting him... we find our plot. To be honest, I really did start to care about the characters in the game, felt as if they were real people, whose personal problems really did effect me (cheesy, I know, but that is the strength behind this game... the emotional involvement of the player him/her self). And when it came time to start favoring which side I help more (The murderer, searching for answers or the cops, looking to put away a psycho) It really was a very difficult choice to make. In short, If you are tired of the mindless shooters, hack-and-slashers and games that throw nothing but cheap thrills your way, you owe it to yourself to at least rent this title. It isn't an action game, it's not an adventure game, it's really not like anything else on the market, but it features a story that will have you hooked from brutal start to amazing finish, emotionally charged characters, some of the best voice work I've ever seen, great music, and a ton of extras. The only complaint I can muster are the graphics (which, while ugly, suit the game in a grim, grainy type of way that will remind you of silent hill). This is the form of media that finially bridges the gap between game and movie, and you owe it to yourself to witness Indigo Prophecy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2006"}

The story is just as ambiguous. Never once did I feel attached to my character, nor did I care what twists or turns the plot would make. TheFinal Fantasygames are renowned for storytelling, but it seems like an afterthought inCrystal Chronicles. Cinematic flair is also noticeably&nbsp;absent.The gameplay is just as careless and jagged. While the quest can be played single-player, it's meant to be tackled by a group of people (preferably four). Since each player utilizes menu screens often, Square and Game Designer's Studio decided that you could only play multiplayer with a Game Boy Advance attached to the GameCube. Hence, all menu management is done on the GBA screen, and the action on the TV is unaffected. In theory, this is a just solution. As it turns out, though, I found it to be more detrimental to the quest than anything.When a player accesses the GBA, their character on the TV cannot be controlled. Not only does this leave them open to attack, it more or less halts any progress that the group can make. So basically, you still find yourself sitting around waiting for your buddy to make preparations, but instead, you're doing it with a controller that has fewer buttons and dying batteries.To make matters worse, players must also keep an eye on a bucket. To prevent characters from scattering and trying to run in different directions, the bucket emits a field of energy that covers roughly 80 percent of the screen. If you go outside of this barrier, you'll take damage. So you basically must stay huddled together as one person carries the bucket throughout a stage. Without question, this is one of the stupidest ideas in the history of video games.When it comes to the basics of gameplay, the combat is respectable, but by no means great. I really like the timing-based combo system that accompanies both magic and general hack n' slash, yet I absolutely despise losing all of my magic with each new area that I enter. Hence, classes are not defined, and you never really get the impression that your character is growing in power.There's little here that truly excites.Crystal Chroniclesplays like an experiment gone awry, and is unfit to bear the sacrosanctFinal Fantasyname.Concept:A hack n' slash with inventive, yet highly aggravating GBA-based multiplayer connectivity, and a worthless bucketGraphics:Stylish character designs, gorgeous particle effects, and awesome boss designsSound:Not the familiarFinal Fantasymelodies, but memorable nonethelessPlayability:Steers away from button mashing with timing-based chains, manual spell aiming, and multi-person combosEntertainment:A cookie cutter adventure with a lackluster story, poor character growth, and frustrating playReplay:Moderately HighRated:7 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Crystal Chroniclesis here to remind us that every so often, Square Enix actually puts out an average game.

Combining spells with your teammates is awesome, but half the time it's less effective than two individual castings, and you lose all of your magic between areas.

Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is NOT a Final Fantasy game.  It doesn't even come close to the Legend of Zelda in terms of action/adventure.  It is a waste of time, space, energy, and money.  All together.I made the regretful mistake of putting this product on my Amazon Wish List when it first came out.  After testing it at stores and reading about it, I quickly realized the game was cheese.  I forgot, however, to remove it from my Wish List.  My brother and sister bought it for me for my birthday one year!  Aye yie yie!So because of the $50 they scrounged together in my honor, I figured I'd give the game a thorough shot.I couldn't take it anymore by the time I got to the second level.  It was atrocious.  I felt sorry for the Final Fantasy name and for my relatives for dropping the cash.Enough of the emotional banter.  Let me try to give an analytical review of this game.First of all, it does not meet the definition of a classic role-playing game.  (Within the last couple of years, however, I have noticed \"RPG\" taking on a new meaning.  Now it means simply playing as someone else.  Grand Theft Auto, for example, is now classified as an RPG.)  But with today's loose definition of \"RPG,\" you can call it that, I guess.  But I grew up with real RPGs, like Dragon Warrior, the Final Fantasy titles, Lufia, Breath of Fire, etc.  (These were all turn-based RPGs.)Second, FF:CC does not develop your characters sanely.  Sorry, but whoever programmed this atrocity embarrassed the genre of action/adventure.Third, I recommend you boycott any GameCube title that requires the use of the Game Boy Advance to play multiplayer.  It is asinine to expect people/kids to pay money for such an inconvenient, expensive, and improper method to simply play with your friends.Lastly, this game is best suited for gamers who do not like real RPGs but prefer an action game with unique challenges in gameplay.  Yes, FF:CC is an action/adventure, but unlike most others, the gamer will simply have to learn this somewhat different style (it is more hack & slash than anything - the multiplayer functionality should have saved this game from a bad review, but it was disappointing at best).  But other than that, the game will offer essentially ZERO to true RPG gamers, especially those who love the Final Fantasy series.  Stay away from this game if you love Final Fantasy titles.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2006"}

If you go outside of this barrier, you'll take damage. So you basically must stay huddled together as one person carries the bucket throughout a stage. Without question, this is one of the stupidest ideas in the history of video games.When it comes to the basics of gameplay, the combat is respectable, but by no means great. I really like the timing-based combo system that accompanies both magic and general hack n' slash, yet I absolutely despise losing all of my magic with each new area that I enter. Hence, classes are not defined, and you never really get the impression that your character is growing in power.There's little here that truly excites.Crystal Chroniclesplays like an experiment gone awry, and is unfit to bear the sacrosanctFinal Fantasyname.Concept:A hack n' slash with inventive, yet highly aggravating GBA-based multiplayer connectivity, and a worthless bucketGraphics:Stylish character designs, gorgeous particle effects, and awesome boss designsSound:Not the familiarFinal Fantasymelodies, but memorable nonethelessPlayability:Steers away from button mashing with timing-based chains, manual spell aiming, and multi-person combosEntertainment:A cookie cutter adventure with a lackluster story, poor character growth, and frustrating playReplay:Moderately HighRated:7 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Crystal Chroniclesis here to remind us that every so often, Square Enix actually puts out an average game.

Combining spells with your teammates is awesome, but half the time it's less effective than two individual castings, and you lose all of your magic between areas. The effects and character models are cool, but downtimes really drag and many cutscenes look awfully similar. The worst part, though, is that character advancement is the slowest I've ever seen. Beat a boss and get your choice of +1 to one of your stats! Thrilling. There is certainly some enjoyment to be had here, but it's sprinkled somewhat thinly among all of the lame and boring parts.

The game is one of the best of its kind.  Challengeing, fun, and a perfect learning curve.  But this comes with time.

Features like demands, towns turn over to a another empire, ect.The games A.I is great, the best I have in a turn base game.  Just has impressive is the trading.  Things you do at start of game will come in play with trading.  Say you wipe out the Rome(for no reason) at 2250 b.c.  Later at 1955 a.d civilations will view you has a hostile empire and not trade.  This is very annoying but make you rethink delcaring war.  Another great bonus is the good graphics and good sound.I highly recommed this game.  But if you don't have time it is shoveware.

You'll need to fight for your life with incredible weaponry and special moves that will keep you on the edge of your seat as you battle it out with malicious opponents. This is an immersive, action-packed world of dark hallways and darker intentions.","reviewerName":"ACEMAN1 \"HERE TO PISS YOU OFF\"","summary":"TRIGGER-HAPPY FUN  8.75 OUT OF 10","reviewText":"Unreal Championship is a game based around team games like team deathmatch capture the flag, and more. Although this game seems more designed towards use on Xbox Live (A system I never used nor wanted to use), it's still a great game to play in single-player or with a buddy.WHAT THE GAME IS: An arena title in vain of the Dreamcast classic Quake 3: arena. In the future there is only one sport known as the Championship, in which you select your team members, name your team, and kill the competition with your many weapons.GRAPHICS: Time has not been kind to this game since its release six years ago, it's not awful to look at, it's just not very impressive. It doesn't stand the test of time like the DOA games on Xbox.MUSIC: Heavy metal music fits in perfectly with this game, and it's done quite well.SOUND: The quality is good. The weapons have good sound effects and there's even some good voice-acting. The explosions are nice touch.GAMEPLAY: This game is technically a first-person shooter, and as you'd expect from Xbox, the controls are nearly flawless. Most of the weapons you get are pretty awesome to use, but there are a few that totally suck and that you'll hate using. The arenas you get put in aren't just inside, they are also set outside and are fun to kill opponents in. When it comes to the rocket launcher, it would have been nice to have a lock-on system than hoping it hits an enemy. Most of the modes you get to play in are great like I love team deathmatch and capture the flag, but there's one mode I absolutely despised playing in... Double Domination (Worst. Multiplayer. Mode. Ever.). In this mode your team has to have two areas marked and they have to remain marked for ten seconds. This is a huge problem because the teams are constantly stealing these areas from each other. I also didn't like the fact that I was timed for certain modes. It works in deathmatch, but it shouldn't be in capture the flag. It also would have been nice if this game had a map maker mode like Timesplitters, but sadly it doesn't. Negatives aside this game is quite wonderful to play with a friend or even by yourself.OVERALL: If you own an old Xbox this game is worth a buy, even if Xbox Live is void on the game now. Just invite a friend over if you want to play with a human opponent.THE GOOD: Nearly flawless FPS controls, lots of weapons, decent graphics, good heavy metal music, lots of blood, good arena designs, most of the modes are good.THE BAD: One mode sucks, some weapons suck, and there's no option to build your own arena.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2008"}

If you have not played any of the previous games then you won't be left behind with the storyline.  This makes this installment of Star Ocean very friendly to both die hard fans and new-comer's to the saga.Gameplay:Star Ocean has always been a great franchise that gave RPG's a nice twist for me.  This was the first RPG saga I played which had a really good sci-fi edge to it.  This installment is no different having you blast around the galaxy exploring planets, meeting new aliens and cultures etc.  Combat in Star Ocean is extremely enjoyable.  Battles are encounter based where you have to run into a mob.  When you trigger the mob you go into the battle screen w/ almost no load time.  Depending on how you ran into the mob (did it hit you from behind? did you run into it from behind, from the side etc) determines the battle mode.  Is it a surprise attack by you? by the mob?  Perhaps two mobs were close by and the second the first battle finishes you get jumped by more mobs.  There is some variety to the battles.  Ontop of that, you can earn \"bonus\" tiles during combat which boost XP, Item drops, SP earned etc.  Combat is also real time .  Once you are in combat you can control 1 of 4 characters, able to switch toons on the fly, and pretty  much map skills and attacks to buttons on the controller.  I kind of see the combat system as like RPG meets Hack n' Slash  without the button mashing.  The nice Sci-fi elements and storyline mixed with a very fun combat system make for a great adventure!!StoryWithout ruining the plot, pretty much humanity is just starting to venture out into the galaxy.  This is the first trip being taken by Humanity so a bunch of ships are sent off into deep space to explore and either find planets to colonize / harvest or perhaps even meet some aliens!  no shocker, along the way some evil force exposes itself threatening the galaxy!  The storyline is a tad cliche but enjoyable .  There are also elements in the game that will influence the storyline.. kind of little side events that will gain favor with your crew.  More favor you have the more chance you have at viewing certain cut-scenes and getting their true ending.  It also adds to their back story a little.Sound / GraphicsThe graphics are not bad at all.  This game came out for the 360 originally and was then remastered for the PS3.  All in All both versions look identical from the standard view... if you zoom in on objects you'll notice the PS3 has more colorful, detailed map design but the characters themselves are a little faded (especially the eyes).  The audio is actually very good in this version. Unlike the 360 version where you had English Dub, this version contains multiple languages including the original Japanese.  The English voices weren't bad but... *shiver* some characters were just down right ANNOYING.  I played it using Japanese w/ English Subtitles and found the voice acting to be very high quality compared to the English.Replay Value / LengthThe game itself easily kept me occupied well over 50 hours.  It was a lot of fun, and once things kicked into high gear I began bouncing between planets to do side quests and all sorts of bonus objectives.  Crafting, optional bosses etc.  There is plenty of side and end game content to keep you busy for an insane # of hours.  I beat the game at level 73; however the level cap is 255  that should tell you just how much stuff is to do on the side (getting to 255 will take quite some time)  However, once you beat the game and run through the content there is virtually no reason to revisit this game except if you want to get a Platinum Trophy (might need 2 or 3 runs of the storyline for it). However with well over 50+ hours of gameplay in a single playthrough you are getting great value here.OVERALL (86% 8.6/B+)I give Star Ocean: the Last Hope International  an 86% (8.6 / B rating)  This isn't anything new as the game came out on the 360 a year before this released.If you never played this game before, or don't own a 360  it is worth picking up now.  If you own a 360 and a PS3  the PS3 version is the better version to own actually as I will list below.  If you are big into Sci-Fi themed gamed and also love a good RPG  this game is def. for you.  It will make you feel like you are traveling to distant worlds and exploring the galaxy.360 vs PS3 editionsthe versions are visually identical for the most part (the differences are not worth arguing over)  HOWEVER the PS3 version contains many additional perks the 360 version will not1. Multiple languages (english and japanese) w/ multiple subtitle options2. Additional content by having new playable characters3. No need to disk swap (360 requires a disk swapping)4. New UI layouts.  You can pick between a more anime style  or CG style.  I actually liked the new style over the original as it organized better and text was more legible in my opinion.5. Revamped crafting system (Fixed exploits in the crafting system and added a few new recipes.... also changed the recipes of the best armor and weapons to avoid being able to craft them really early on)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005ME8S","description":"Originally released in 1998, the PC version ofHalf-Lifechanged  first-person shooters forever by proving that a compelling story can be told within  the genre. Prior to the game's release, first-person shooters were mindless  action games.Half-Life, while containing its fair share of action, also  contained plenty of exploration, puzzle, and story elements. Now released as a  PlayStation2 game,Half-Lifehas never looked or played better. This  version contains the outstanding single-player story mode, as well as a few new  ones. While the new additions aren't so great, the story mode is one of the best  escapades available on the PS2.The game follows the adventures of Gordon Freeman, a young research associate at  the Black Mesa Federal Research Facility. A typical day at the office goes  completely awry as numerous alien life forms invade the facility. The fate of  the facility, and quite possibly the world, is in the hands of an unlikely hero.The graphics here trump the original's (understandable, as more than three years  have passed). The character models have four times as many polygons, as well as  smoother textures and animations. The sound is also very good, with some of the  funniest voice acting yet heard in a game. Of course, the single-player gameplay  is excellent, thanks to some very well-developed enemy artificial intelligence.Unfortunately, the new modes aren't nearly as brilliant. Decay, the new  cooperative mode, seems like an afterthought and pales in comparison to the  cooperative modes inPerfect DarkandHalo. Deathmatches only  support two players, which is incredibly lame considering many PS2 first-person  shooters support four. Despite these flawed modes, the single-player story is so  superb that it totally warrants a purchase.--Raymond M.

I truly did.  I would typically play it for about a half an hour at a time because I kept turning it off in frustration.  The controls are not fluid, objectives are blurry and the graphics are sub par for a next gen console (I played it on the PS3).  The original Splinter Cell, Pandora Tomorrow and Conviction are all great games.  This installment sucks major balls.UPDATE - Ok, so I'm the type of reviewer that will definitely admit to making a bad call on any review I publish.  My initial review of this game was a bad call.  Yes, initially I did continuously turn it off in frustration.  However, I kept hearing about how good the game was, so I decided to sit down and work through my frustrations and really try to get into the game.  Well, that was a great idea.  It took some patience, that's for sure.  But once I got over a few initial frustrating points and actually got into the game, I couldn't put it down.  It really ended up being a great game.  I played through it all the way to the end (which took quite a while) and I must say, it is now one of my favorite games.  Just goes to show that sometimes you just have to be a little patient when a game has promise but starts out a little more difficult than you're used to.  Now, I stand by my comments about the graphics - they could be better.  However, once I got used to the control scheme, it worked great.  I'm a huge fan of this series, with Conviction being my favorite.  Double Agent is now my second favorite.

So, if you install it you will be reluctant to uninstall once finished and will have to carry those 9GB on your HardDrive for a long time. On top of that, its resale value is down the drain the moment one pops the box open...Even after the patch that removed the activation limit, uninstalling still leaves behind certain irremovable folders that will make sure it can be re-established in the future.So one has to ask: even after paying $50 for it, WHO ACTUALLY OWNS MY COPY?UNDISPUTED FACT:The game utilizes an overzealous version of SecuROM 7+. They either activated all its available options or had a special version custom made. No other game company dared behaving in such heavy-handed way. This means that if your computer has more than one disc drive (or even one but non-DRM certified) it may block them, whereas the game may not even install if you are running virtual drives or have certain media-burning software installed (even NERO has been known to be considered ...\"pirate-ware\"!)DISPUTED FACT :It has been widely reported that BIOSHOCK installs a RootKit. Both MICROSOFT's ROOTKIT DETECTION TOOL and AVG ANTI-VIRUS detected either the RootKit or its actions. Recently, AVG was made to release a special update (just for BIOSHOCK) to ignore this alert.In hacker lingo, to \"take someone's Root\" means to insert a procedure that \"will allow the intruders to maintain root access (highest privilege) on the system without the system administrator even seeing them\".Official BIOSHOCK announcements (and their \"unofficial\" reviewers here at AMAZON) will try to persuade everyone who would listen that there is nothing there, so stop looking and don't even mention it.Understandable reaction since, the existence of a RootKit would be a solid basis for class-action litigation.Weight the facts and judge for yourself.UNDISPUTED FACT:BIOSHOCK effectively revokes our Administrator rights on our own computers. Here is what happens: even after completely uninstalling the game there is a mystery folder that canNOT be removed, no matter what!On WinXP it is located here:\"C:\\Documents and Settings\\[User Name]\\Application Data\\SecuRom\"As administrators, we could (unwisely) delete even Windows System folders - yet BIOSHOCK's mystery folder apparently claims a higher authority level? What this folder does and why should it get placed into OUR computers so that we cannot remove it even as Administrators, is beyond me. And I, for one, do NOT appreciate it one bit. (A quick internet search revealed a number of suggestions on how to get rid of it, ranging from clearly unsafe to catastrophic...)True, almost every game leaves one or two folders behind after uninstalled - but this NEVER REVOKES OUR ADMINISTRATOR RIGHTS to delete them!I do understand that there are production and publishing costs to get recovered as well as profit projections to be reached. Companies that wish to protect their investment will always try to fight piracy. This is only reasonable and expected.However, with BIOSHOCK, as it is currently available by 2K GAMES, it gets WAY OUT OF HAND & WELL BEYOND RIDICULOUS!!No one in the game-publishing industry seems to learn from past mistakes: every security system eventually gets cracked and every \"OnLine activation requirement\" eventually gets bypassed. So, utilizing an overly intrusive, inconvenient and possibly dangerous security kit only serves in penalizing the people who actually paid good money for their product - and manage to shoot their sales in the foot at the same time.Look what happened with HALF-LIFE 2: legitimate buyers still have to put up with activating the game every time we want to play - and of course VALVE paid the price: unprotected HL1 had sold TWICE as many units as STEAM-\"secured\" HL2 ever did (8million and 4million respectively, Source: THE WASHINGHTON POST)Since I would NEVER install a contraption such as BIOSHOCK onto my computer and wished to have hands-on experience before I reviewed the game, I asked around and a colleague of mine had already made the mistake of purchasing it and installing on his laptop.THIS IS NOT A BAD GAME.The environments are well designed and have a pleasant retro patina; the graphics are very nice, even though they do not meet the hype. They are comparble to older games such as HL2 (not to mention STALKER).You see, dark is not always moody, and blurry cannot always be mistaken for dreamy.I did love the music though! Both the collection of happy-go-lucky and Big-Band romantic 1940's songs (contrasting with the bleak environment) as well as their smart timing, added to the overall experience.It was the gameplay I was the least impressed.Totally linear - as it is has come to be expected from any FPS today I am afraid. To be fair, I cannot imagine a Single Player holding a storyline without being more or less linear (even \"free\"-roaming FAR CRY did not escape this curse) - but then again, that is why I am not a game designer. And unless the publishers release their creative suffocation of the true game artists, there is no hope for a worthy successor to SYSTEM SHOCK 2.The controls are not hard to get used to; if not, they are completely remapable; nevertheless, I would love to have an real inventory: cycling between which plasmid and which ammo for which gun can get pretty frustrating. Fast.Not that hitting your enemies does any good. For a game that is based on an alternative reality scenario and counts in immersing you into that world, the damage dealt by the guns is pretty unrealistic. A double-barreled full blast with the (augmented!) shotgun in the head of a generic splicer will NOT take him down.And what's with the scarce ammo!? I ended up using the 1-2 combo (electric plasmid shock followed by quick ...wrench hits) one picks up in the first 10 minutes of the game throughout because the ammo was either of the wrong type or too expensive or nowhere to be found. Only at the very end was there an abundance of both money and ammo but by then they were pretty useless: a fully charged electric plasma gun and some propelled grenades is all one needs.And, finally: dying. Regeneration chambers turn the game into a check-point one - and I hate checkpoint-games. Most often than not, they are chosen in order to artificially augment the gameplay duration (having us replay the same segments over and over - instead of saving wherever we feel like it). Moreover, when progressing, you usually end up getting killed just before the next regeneration chamber (and having to repeat quite a distance from the previous one) whereas, when facing a Boss, regeneration takes away all the suspense. Keep respawning, you will eventually get him, his health does not increase if you do.So, all in all, BIOSHOCK is a good game BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO BE WORTH ITS EXCESSIVE DRM TROUBLE.It is only a slightly above-average game; and if 2K GAMES did not have the guts to publish it for PCs (and is hiding it within an intrusive security Kit) it should have stuck with Xbox.Even BIOSHOCK designers acknowledge there is a serious issue with the security measures forced upon them by the publisher. These measures are hurting their game and, so, THERE IS AN UPDATED VERSION COMING IN THE NEAR FUTURE TO FIX THIS!Don't take my word for it. Google for \"Ken Levin-Interview\" and \"BIOSHOCK-Fixed-Version\" and see for yourself. (I tried to add links but Amazon, apparently, does not allow them)BIOSHOCK has it all: SecuROM 7, temperamental and Limited number of Installations, overzealous Drive-Blockers, possible cloaked RootKits, irremovable folders...NONE of which is Clearly marked on the product description!!As it is, it will come NOWHERE NEAR MY SYSTEM!I would advise waiting for 6 months, they will either clear it up or it will find its way to the clearance bins...Just last week I bought RISE & FALL: CIVILIZATIONS AT WAR for $2.99 (less than 8 months after its release) - and that nugget featured STARFORCE of all things!- -- --- ----- -------- ------------- --------------------- -------------------------UPDATE:By now there are over...130(!) Comments on this Review (pages 1-2 & 9-10 are especially...informative). Over these weeks, there have been numerous attempts to suppress my review with either negative votes (that appear overnight in bursts - over...140 in the last three days alone!) or overly insulting comments - with my replies to them \"mysteriously\" receiving enough negative feedback to get folded as \"not helpful\" within minutes. The same happened as well to supportive comments posted by other customers.When this was not enough, a \"shady character\" (who constantly changes her nickname) managed to become enough of a nuisance to have AMAZON REMOVE this review...TWICE(!).Amazon decided to split the baby in half: it restored but kept from the first page no matter the customers' feedback. Not until the introduction of the Amazon's New Rating system was this review fully restored.Even after the partial restoration of this Review, AMAZON's voting system is still getting abused in order to hide as \"not helpful\" comments posted by anyone else even remotely mentioning the serious issues of this game.We can only guess what affiliation this individual has with the game publisher or SecuROM...My special THANKS to: H.LE, BIBLE&SWORD; & SEGA-SLAYER - and to ALL OF YOU ANONYMOUS FRIENDS who supported this review during the weeks the Dark side seemed to  prevail (and managed to bury it in the last pages) - and continue to do so.Do not hesitate to let them know what you think of their methods...","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2007"}

One question might be about an album that came out in 2008, another might be about a TV drama that was on in the 70's.There's also a nice blend of categories, so the music or movie buffs you're playing with aren't going to run the game, if you're a sports fan.Online play is great.

Maybe a picture or two in an entire game, maybe a song or two. Compared to SceneIt? pushing loads of video from a DVD, it's disappointing that Buzz! didn't come close to utilizing Blu-Ray.The game itself could have used some more quality assurance work. While you'd expect the host to say a bunch of canned phrases, some of the things he says may be completely different than how the game is running. (For example, Player 1 has a huge point lead before a round, and gets every question wrong in a next round. At the end of that round, the host may say something about how well Player 1 played.)THE UGLYThe wireless controllers are really cheap, and the buttons have no tactile qualities whatsoever. Getting them all to sync with the included USB dongle can be a bit of a pain, too. They're bad if you've never used controllers like them before. If you've used the SceneIt? controllers (which have the same number of buttons for the same purposes), the included controllers are complete trash.The few bits of music that tie in with the questions are all re-makes.

I remember playing the NES version when I was a little kid, and I loved every other version that came out following it. When the first 3D Mario game, Super Mario 64 came out, I was blown away. It had good graphics, a great challenge and definitely made you get your money's worth. Fast-forward to 2013, and we are given Super Mario 3D World for the Wii U. In my opinion, it is the best game for the Wii U, and is the main reason to buy a Wii U (along with Wind Waker HD).

I loved the demo and was looking forward to playing the full game. I just today rented it and started playing it and was truly enjoying the game.This game could've been great. It should've been great. It had so much potential. And it is different. It truly is unlike most games that come out. It has the player utilize the environment to escape the ever vigilant waves of police, both on foot and in the air via helicopter. The emphasis is on exploration and evasion.Unfortunately this is one reason why combat is so short-changed. On the times when the only options are to fight or die (and there are plenty of them) the combat is extremely difficult. Many fights can be avoided but for some the only way to avoid being ventilated is to take down the enemy.And as I write this I do so after attempting to escape the mall. There is a section which no matter what I do, I die. If I fight the SWAT, I die. If I try to wall run to the pipe I am supposed to swing from then leap to the catwalk above and then the next section, somewhere in there I die. Either I miss because there is so much gunfire and small, minute changes in direction that are crucial to making the jump successfully are impossible to make (you'll get shot since Faith, the lead character, can't seem to shimmy over on the pipe any faster) If I actually do make the jump and land, it doesn't matter because I become a lead sponge.Another large problem that bogs this game down is the simple fact that the shooting never seems to stop. There are far too few respites and these all stop far too quickly, forcing the gameplay to be relegated to repetitive and annoying. I was hoping to be able to explore and look at the city in all of its beauty. Unfortunately the constant gunfire makes this goal impossible.Speaking of repetitive, the game would've been far better if it wasn't so linear. The devs hint at looking for alternative paths. Don't bother looking for them. They don't exist. The game has one way it wants you to complete an area and it will beat you over the head until you figure out what that one way is. Until then you will see \"Loading\" many, many times.And it's a real shame too because some of the most exhilarating gaming moments that a player may see can be found in this game. Without giving anything away, the subway has one such moment, as does a construction level. There's a really good chase scene fairly early in the game too. Immersion is handled extremely well. For years gamers could never see their hands or feet. In this game they can and the camera never pans out. Ever. If you make a roll, the camera will do a very fast 360, just like in real life. As you run you see your hands moving back and forth quickly and they change position as you gain momentum, and Faith's breathing gets heavier as she runs faster and for longer periods of time.Dice, in the slight chance someone from your company reads this, in the future, don't just test your game for bugs and glitches. Test the game to ensure that it will be fun. Don't give us a great concept and bog it down with terrible, frustrating gameplay. I do understand that you're owned by EA Games, the Walmart of the video game industry but I am sure that even they are willing to give you a little more time to work on the game and ensure that gamers will thoroughly enjoy what you have to offer.In all honesty Dice, I truly do want to see a sequel to this game. I do want to see this franchise succeed. I want to see you take video gaming in a new direction and I believe that this game is that first step, so I am saying all of this in the hopes that when you take that next step, it will be a good one. I really did not want to write this. I did not start playing Mirrors Edge hoping to find things to criticize. I really wanted to enjoy this game and I am truly saddened that I simply cannot do so. Please make another game that is like this one, only without the needless frustrations. If you do that, and you can find ways to improve on what you did right, and you did do a lot right, then perhaps my future reviews of your games will look more like the other two that are here on Amazon as of the time of this writing.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2008"}

The story follows Faith, a messenger in a Orwellian touched future, were surveillance is everywhere and the police overwhelmingly an arm of powerful corporations. After nearly being gunned downed while delivering an innocuous message, Faith encounters her sister Kate, who has been framed for the murder of a Mayoral candidate.The mechanisim of Mirrors edge is entirely first person, with stomach dropping leaps and parkur acrobatics carrying Faith from rooftop to rooftop. The voice guiding her is Merc, who at provides more commentary than omniscient directions. The path forward is given an overall tone, and Faith has \"runner vision\" where ineractive objects glow a blood red color. While the setup is a tad repetitive, its uniqueness grants it a lot of leeway. The backdrops are city skyline de jour, having the appearance of a futuristic skyscape painting. The effect is still real enough that you'll get an adrenaline rush when you fall.The voices are well acted, though rather calm considering the gunfire and the near death falls. The sequences are cel-shaded in the style of XIII, though almost too cartoony.The story shapes up well, though it is rather short, and the gameplay is exciting, and just frustrating enough you'll be compelled to complete levels just for the expereince of doing so.

Lumines is an addictive, fun, and stylish puzzle game for the Sony PSP. When most people think of \"puzzle\" games, the first thing that pops into their head (or what should) is Tetris. Tetris was an extremely addicting puzzle game and still lives on as one of the best that has been made. Just like Tetris did for the puzzle game market, Lumines takes us to a whole new level of gaming. Even for those players that think puzzle games are a waste of time, or just not fun at all, this game should surely change your mind. In theory, the game is pretty simple. At all stages in the game, there are only 2 different colored blocks on the screen, and you basically have to match same colored blocks together. Again, like Tetris, the blocks fall from the top of the screen, a \"falling-brick puzzler\" if you will.The main thing that makes this game different from other puzzle games out there is the music and the way it is integrated into the game. First off, the music is brilliant in every sense, and there are many different kinds in the game. The music really brought me into the fun of the game. Again, I said that I loved the way the music is integrated into the game. While playing, there is a musical staff bar that sweeps across the screen to the beat of the music. Only when the bar makes its way across will your combos be counted. At times, the bar can move very slow, other times it goes extremely fast, making for a new and fun experience with every stage. When the music goes fast, your combos get counted and taken away, making it pretty hard to fill the board up, but also making it hard to make larger combos. It's pretty much opposite when the music plays slow; you make large combos with ease, but it is also very easy to accidentally fill up the entire board with blocks. Eventually, you'll find yourself bobbing your head to the beat, trying to create combos that will get counted when the staff bar goes by. It truly gets addicting, but in a good way!Overall, this game is exceptionally good and well put together. It can become an addiction quickly, but even if it doesn't, it's a game that you can pop in and play at any time, years from now, and not get bored.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2006"}

Gordon","summary":"Frustrating Yet Enjoyable Tribute to Old School Gaming","reviewText":"It's not easy being Ninja Gaiden 2.  The original 3D Ninja Gaiden for the Xbox was a complete shock to the system, in terms of taking the move-heavy gameplay of 3D one on one fighting games, and successfully adapting it to the action-adventure genre in a game where you regularly fight multiple enemies.  Along with Halo, it was one of the main reasons to get an Xbox.  Sure, Devil May Cry may have laid the foundation, but Ninja Gaiden took it to the next level, even if it was brutally hardcore, and cursed with a twitchy camera.  Ninja Gaiden Black, for the Xbox, and Ninja Gaiden Sigma, for the PS3, both provided expanded, more definitive versions of the game, with the latter adding not only HD graphics, but several new chapters as well.Ninja Gaiden 2, however, gets less respect.  Putting aside the technical flaws for a moment, some were disappointed by the switch from the unified \"world\" that Ninja Gaiden's city of Tairon provided, where conquering puzzles and triggering game events would open up previously inaccessible areas, to a very linear, level-based game.  Others had issues with what often seemed rather severe balance issues, where enemies would often kill the player not necessarily through clever use of skill, but rather by sheer numbers, cheap methods, or in one case, by simply withholding vital information from the player(i.e. the exploding nuclear lava turtle situation).  For many, perhaps it was the lack of the original's \"sense of the new\" that turned them off.  However, the principal curse the game suffers, in my eyes, is technical: the extremely spastic camera.  In short, the camera, while controllable, is often zoomed in so close, that the player will often be unable to keep track of the surroundings, with off-screen enemies seemingly attacking from nowhere.  At certain times, the camera will get stuck in a corner, and shudder uncontrollably.  There are also moments where the control scheme for using arrows is simply not player-friendly enough, given the speed at which action transpires.The shame of it is that, if not for these technical issues, Ninja Gaiden 2 could easily rest within a \"5/5\" rating zone.  The change from a \"hub world\" design to linear level progression allows the game to provide much more variety, as opposed to forcing the player to retread the same areas again and again, and seems to me to be a clear homage to the era that the original Ninja Gaiden trilogy emerged from.  In particular, Strider and the Shinobi series appear to be referenced.  In the space of the game, much like Strider Hiryu, you'll visit a Russian city in the winter, the Amazonian jungle, and even fight on and within a flying battleship crawling with hi-tech enemies.  Similarly, the game's early levels in a futuristic Tokyo, a ninja-infested village, and a disaster-strick New York City all feel somewhat reminiscent of levels in the Shinobi series.  As the game progresses to even weirder levels in the last third, the feel of the original, 2D Ninja Gaiden 2's \"otherworld\" levels is evoked to great effect.  It's this straightforward emphasis on action that successfully channels the 2D action aesthetic into the third dimension here.No holds are barred as the designers throw you into all manner of bizarre situations, such as fighting off an army of werewolves in a castle arena in Venice, or being charged by demonic centaurs on a desert plain in Hell.  There's a story in there somewhere about some dangerous Demon Statue, a feud between Ninja clans, the Countess of Bathory, a mutated Rasputin, your pops, a large-breasted CIA agent, and some other crap, but let's face it- some games weren't meant to have a deep or non-ridiculous storyline.  This game's story serves one purpose: to give the player the opportunity to sever a lot of ninja limbs, kill all manner of grotesque demons, and leap about like a homicidal, sword-wielding ballerina on crack.  Speaking of weaponry, you'll get to wield a decent arsenal, including the Vigoorian flail (nunchaku, but with blades attached), tonfa sticks (think police batons for ninjas), and a freakin' huge Grim Reaper scythe from Hell.  Like its predecessor, this game requires you to be constantly ready to dodge or block when not busy attacking your enemies.  Unlike its predecessor, the game makes a concession to the player by both allowing some amount of health regeneration when away from enemies, and providing one-use full health recharges at save points.  That being said, don't expect much else in the way of mercy from Ninja Gaiden 2.  On your first playthrough, you WILL die repeatedly.  If you can bear with some frustrating design issues, Ninja Gaiden 2 will provide you with one hell of an action rush- in fact, the kind of visceral, constant motion gaming that is a rarity in this day and age.As a side note, Tecmo released a \"remastered\" version for the PS3- Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2.  Having both versions (so sue me, I like this series!), it's hard to really say either is more \"definitive\" than the other, unlike the first Sigma.  NGS2 has several new chapters with new characters, some new bosses, possibly better enemy AI, and also has a mission mode right out of the box.  More importantly, it has a better camera and better graphics.  However (and this is a big \"however\"), Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 has noticeably fewer enemies in each level, to the extent that the pacing and overall excitement in the game is dampened.  It's noticeable enough that I'm glad I didn't sell my original version of Ninja Gaiden 2, even though the camera still gives me fits when compared to Sigma 2.  Whichever version you get, if you're not afraid of a challenge, this flawed masterpiece will provide the old-school action fix you crave.  Just don't be surprised when you trip over that camera.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000P297EI","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"A stylish showcase of action and style","reviewText":"I know that title isn't exactly awesome but it fits the Devil May Cry series perfectly. This is not deep storylines or emotional cutscenes or ultimately sympathetic characters; this series is about keeping enemies afloat with a wave of bullets before you bring down your sword right on their head. I really only finished the first one and haven't bothered with the next 2 but since I have a shiny new Playstation 3, a whole new wave of games I have to try show up. So after the mandatory and hefty 5 GB install (more on that later), I was set for my adventure of sword-and-gunplay awesomeness with flaws that bugged me incessantly.Story: Instead of playing as series regular Dante, you now control Nero, a member of the Order of the Sword, attending church with his friend/love interest Kyrie. Just then Dante shows up and proceeds to assassinate the leader before taking off. The Order tells Nero to go after Dante and make him pay for his crimes but there's more to it than that and Nero and Dante try to get to the bottom of it all.Graphics: I always found Capcom to be quite stellar when it comes to presentation and while the art style isn't as beautiful as Folklore or as immensely detailed as Metal Gear Solid 4, this game is still quite the powerhouse when it comes down to the graphics. From its art design style with castles, ruins, picturesque landscapes to the fluidity of the action and cutscene direction, this is quite a great looking game on the PS3. Added bonus is that the mandatory install which takes a good 20 minutes drastically reduces load times with at best 2-3 seconds of a \"now loading\" screen. Sweet.Sound/Music: The music has always been a mixed bag in terms of what it does and what it feels like the game should be doing. At times, the game takes on an operatic approach with organs, pianos and choirs in Latin but then when action hits, it brings out a cheesy metal song. Sure it fits what you're doing but having sweeping music only to be replaced by music worthy of bad Slipknot and it's just bizarre. Voice acting in Capcom games tend to be hit-or-miss as well, as if the whole game is one big, stylish and impressive B-movie with one-liners (unfunny ones at that) and a villain who stutters and it's quite funny in a bad way.Gameplay: The Devil May Cry series is all about the combos and the moves like God of War. From all the moves you can purchase to upgrades, your character will be flying up and down the screen as you bring the proverbial smackdown to your enemies. Gunplay and swordplay effortlessly shift back and forth and using the Devil Bringer, which basically acts like Scorpion's \"get over here!\" from Mortal Kombat. Instead of going over to your enemy, you can grab them from afar and smack em around. Instead of Dante who received new weapons to shift back and forth from, Nero keeps his sword and guns but he just gets more stuff to do with them.The problem is is that the moves and upgrades are rather hefty price-wise and you will frequently go through the process of \"orb farming\" where you replay a level to get better ranks and more Proud Souls to use to upgrade which can get very repetitive and the more Souls you get is depending on how good at combos you are. From Deadly to Sick Smokin' Style, you have to be very adept at slinging together combos without getting hit so if you're a bad player, you're going to be pretty small on upgrades. Also at times, Capcom has gameplay ideas that just don't work and for those wondering if the game is as famously difficult as the third can rest easy (though it's still maddening sometimes), it does a couple things that irk me. Jumping puzzles are sometimes imprecise and with enemies respawning should you fall, it gets kind of boring and quite irritating. The other is that you'll get a board game where you move a character across a board but considering how it's played, it feels like a game stretcher to make the game seem longer than it is.At a certain point in the game, we get to play as Dante and he's basically the same though there's some changes. Dante can now shift into different modes from Gunslinger which focuses on weapons and bullets whereas Trickster basically allows you to dodge enemies more efficiently and the new weaponry gets added upon completing certain missions. However, not to spoil but basically Dante is Nero's levels backwards and you even fight the same bosses...3 times. It might be a next-gen title but it's also burdened by gameplay choices.I'd play the game since it's one of the more well-known and popular PS3 games but I wouldn't consider it my favorite and it's more a game I like than absolutely love. I don't mind playing through it and even wanted to get to the end but I didn't feel it was good enough to purchase but that's me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2008"}

(funny because it IS a Japanese game!).Cons:  Though the game was difficult the last boss is super easy, leveling all of your magic takes FOREVER, the other two characters often act annoyingly in battle, despite the setup on tactics; especially the sprite getting stuck behind obstacles ALL OF THE TIME!Seriously though, this is in the top 5 SNES RPGs!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2010"}

Also i noticed that this game has a really big ErrorError #1) this error is pretty common but probably noone notices it. maybe its just me. Sometimes. when you pressed X or any other button and then quickly Pressed  Triangle or any other button. the second button performs the same action as the first button. happens a lot in this game. also. if you target an enemy with R3 and you move sideways. sometimes. it willautomatically roll and it will cause trouble.Lets get back to the Mini Boss. AKA Havel The Rock(hes in the basement of the tower)if you started the game. you need to know how to defeat him. i used this one and i thing its the best way.First. i started the game with the Pyrotechnic character. he has special fire attack.(Use the Battle Axe)first of all. when you get to Havel. make him follow you and then get all the way where u came from. when you get to the door you came from. stand still there until he comes. when Havel comes. let him try to hit u near the door. when he is about to hit you. roll back. and then before he gets up. hit him with the R2 with the Battle Axe. and then retreat back to the stairway. but not too far away. Havel will go back down but before he does. get into the room and make him follow you again. keep doing the same thing. tho it gets harder after. he will know what your doing and he will start walking by the wall so he doesn't get hit. so you might want to make him follow you to the stairway. also. if you have firebombs, throw knives. use them at him while hes retreating. also use your Fire Bolt(special attack for pyro character). This is the best way to defeat him. don't listen to what the tutorial tells you. don't try to back stab him. you need to do that like 30 times. and i wasn't able to do it 3 times. because he kills me. also. make sure your Health is always full. use Aid even if you have 90%. You might wanna use the Golden Pine Risen(will last for about a minute). makes it faster to kill the basta*d.UPDATE 6/3/2013i've been playing this game for a while. i have about 20 hours in it and this game is packed. through it was hard at the begining. it gets fairly easy after a while. make sure you search every corner for weapons and special early items. if you don't . its gonna be hard for you. though make sure to repair your weapons. you will encounter the blacksmith and then many blacksmiths. the first blacksmith is the best. but you will have to kill him. don't kill him right away. make sure your done with all the bosses around and play with the game for a cpl of days and sweep the maps. then kill the Blacksmith to get a key which opens the Closed door in Darkroot Garden(I killed him accidentally. but am happy i did). also make sure to use spells. upgrade your weapons and reinforce them. i don't recommend to upgrade a weapon more than 5 times. because then you will get new better weapons and it would be hard to find the upgrading items. also. i got a sword in the begining of the game. its called. Dark Knight sword. its a very good weapon. it has the highest damage for a while. upgrade it. it will have crazy damage rates. you will be able to kill NPCs and Mini Bosses in a hit or two. i killed two Major Bosses without getting a hit \"The Gargoyles\". don't quit this game. stay playing it. its fun once you get the right equipment.UPDATE 6/10/2013I've noticed in the past couple of days that in this game you actually miss about 50% of the content and missions. don't kill the characters in the game that are not enemeies. i killed most of them. the game never tells you not to but they give you quests and missions. but even with that. you will not go through the whole game. so be careful playing this gameUPDATE. 3/21/14This game is awesome. first. i was pissed because the beginning was hard. but it is awesome once you get the hang of it. i've played it for about a year. 250 hours and 3 playthroughs. i never spent that much time in an RPG game. thanks for the great game.

This may push those who were on the fence about laying out the money, over to buying one. Hopefully, this new developement will be the thing to spur sales of the console and by extention create greater support by game developers for the PS3.

When you read about the PS3 slim and its features it makes you think that the original PS3 must have been some poorly designed mess, when that could not be further from the truth. Part of what makes the new PS3 so amazing is that Sony was able to take all the great features of the PS3 like Blu-ray, WiFi, Free On line gaming, mind blowing graphics (from Sony's first party titles anyway), Full 1080p HD and HDMI and shrink it down to this size in just under 3 years. The PS3 was always a great value its just now an even greater value in a smaller more energy efficent package. The new exterior design is great as well, the mostly matte finish keeps finger prints and dust from being a eyesore while still adding subtle touches like back lit power and eject buttons that have hidden LED's when in use. The over all design is very user frinedly, and makes it easier to touch and use the system.Also when compairing both HD consoles the PS3 becomes an even bigger value:PS3 - 299.99 comes with:Blu-ray - standardHDMI 1.3 - standardHard Drive - standard and fully/easily upgraded with any Laptop hard driveWiFi - StandardWireless rechargeable bluetooth controller - standardNetwork gaming access - Freenow compare Xbox 360 (black model, white arcade unit is further stripped down)Blu-ray - NOT AVAILABLEHDMI - Standard on newer modelsHard Drive - Standard on black units $80 to $180 extra for White Arcade units, not upgradeable with anything but Microsoft branded Hard drives.WiFi - $80 to $100 extraWireless controller - Yes but the controller DOES NOT come with a recharageable battery, so add an aditional $20 to $30 for rechargeable battery and device to recharge it(depending on which option you choose)Network Gaming Access - 49.99 a year for gold membership otherwise you can not access content or play most games online.Do the math, PS3 costs 299.99 and includes everything you need to get started.Xbox 360 costs $480.00 to $500.00 just to offer SOME of what the PS3 does right out of the box at no aditional cost to you. Then factor in that the 360 will NEVER be able to play Blu-ray movies and that the hardware is still unreliable. In this economy getting more for less is important and the PS3 has that in spades.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000066RKC","description":"Based on the same elements that made the movie so enjoyable--fear, suspense, and the possibility that your teammate might be infected--The Thinglets players slowly creep into the action with the help of several nonplayer characters (NPCs), whom you control and use to protect and aid you and your group. Using a core team of engineers, medics, and soldiers, players must manage and control their level of trust in, and fear of, you. They react to your actions, and might betray you if they think you might be the Thing. Conversely, you must constantly monitor which one of them might be infected and dispose of that person. Other characters must trust you, but if they fear you, actions as drastic as coercion might be necessary. For example, if a soldier doesn't have confidence in you, you may have to put your gun to his head to convince him you're not the Thing. For his sake, he'd better believe.","reviewerName":"Jaha","summary":"Metal Gear Solid meets Silent Hill.","reviewText":"Fans of the Metal Gear series will feel somewhat at home in a game like this.  THe controls are similar and the environments are also.  The only difference is your fighting creatures that look like they were ripped out of Silent Hill or Resident Evil.  The twist to the style is the added team element and the possibility of infected team members who can turn on you in seconds.  This premise really attracted me to the game and it is a neat concept but the game is flat.  The graphics are decent, probably along the lines of the first Metal Gear Solid game with some slight refinements.  The weather effects are however very nicely done.  I found interacting with the team members clunky however and you never seemed to have the same troops around you for very long.  It always seems like they follow you to a point and then you have to find new ones.  Makes no sense.  They also are very dumb.  They constantly ran into my field of fie and didn't fight all that good.  One nice thing about them was that you needed them to do things.  Medics were great for healing and mechanics were a must.  The variety in aresenal wasn't very inovative but they did the job.  The shotgun was my personal favorite.  Only knock was sometimes you couldn't find ammo anywhere and other times there was more than you could carry.  This was cool because you could return to those stores and stock up though.  Another negative side to the teamates was the trust factor and weapons.  In order to gain a mans trust you had to give him a weapon.  This was fine if you were stocked but sometimes you would supply them with a gun and then you would lose them a short while later.  This hurt your own ability to keep up good stock of ammo.  Plus troops always ran out and never picked up for themselves.  I found the best strategy was to equip a man with a flame unit and you hold on to guns.  This way you have a one-two punch in order to knock out bigger enemies without having to equip a flame unit yourself.  Anyway enough of control gripes.  The plot itself was ok.  Your typical alien encounter with a hidden web of government corruption and deception.  You start out with very little clue as to what is going on at all and the story progresses with very little explination and very and I mean very short cut scenes.  This appeals to those of you RPG or adventure gamers who like to play and not watch scenes but for a gamer like me who prefers a good story and plot development was a little disappointed with this game since there wasn't much more to it than running around finding troops, testing their blood and killing aliens.  The game itself is labeled as a horror game but I disagree.  Aside from the high level of blood everywhere and a few graphic cut-scenes this game is not really scary.  Silent Hill used lighting effects as well as eerie sounds.  This game just uses a remote environment and some funky looking creatures not much more.  Nothing more than a quick startle.  Also the games challenge factor is not too hard so to increase difficulty they seem to just throw a ton of enemies at you at once instead of tougher enemies.  Even the boss fights are like this as you are getting hit from all sides but 5 different enemies and the boss.  Overall the game was interesting but nothing special.  I recomend that if you are interested to rent it for a couple days or if you are really compelled to buy it you can find it used for around 15-20 bucks.  Other than that I'd stick to some of the bigger titles like Silent Hill or MGS.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2003"}
{"product_name":"B0017HPE7E","description":"Transformed and unleashed, Sonic races to save the world...and himself. Sonic the Hedgehog is on an adventure unlike any other. Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience. Merging blistering 2D action with meticulously rendered 3D environments, players race through intriguing locations across the globe as Sonic to save a chaotic world.The other side of SonicSonic and his alter ego Werehog.View larger.Collect rings for Ring Energy.View larger.Swing into action with Werehog.View larger.A NewSonica New StoryOn a quest for world domination Sonic nemesis Dr. Eggman has managed to steal the chaos emeralds once again and this time drained them of their power. As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new proprietary &ldquo;Hedgehog Engine,&rdquo;Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other next-gen technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"Chaz Ashley","summary":"Sonic's back!","reviewText":"I have to start off by saying Sonic unleashed is what many have been waiting for in a Sonic game, platforming mixed with speed and cool new things with less focus on side characters like Shadow and whatnot. I was both excited and dreading the release since the last few 3D games have been disappointing with gameplay and the number of glitches I encountered (specifically the Next Gen Sonic the Hedgehog game and Shadow the Hedgehog).The game is fast fun and definitely polished, there's no glitches or agonizing load times seen in the next gen Sonic the Hedgehog, they took out the serious story with realistic looking characters and replaced the story with one of more fantasy with more fitting cartoonish characters. The levels go flawlessly from the behind the back running to 2D style running and they've added a few moves like drifting, boosting and quick dashing and thankfully removed the repetitive talking in the levels. The werehog was a big thing I feared from the start but it turns out it's like a less violant God of War (Literally down to the way he attacks, opens doors and finishes off enemies) and it still manages to be fun, though not as fast but it's okay and I'll say why later. You have to level Sonic and the Werehog up separately, though not to the extent of Sonic and the Secret Rings where you're running horribly slow, you go from fast to mach ten. Sonics day levels are pure speed and fun much like Sonic Adventure just MUCH faster when they have to be and more polished so to speech, the werehogs levels are slower but also more focused on combat and some light puzzles, where leveling with Sonic would get you more speed and boost, the werehog gets more attack moves, power and health, and  there's also the Tornado levels where you fly with Tails to take down Robotniks (Eggmans) army which is more or less press a certain button to blow up a certain enemy..The 360/PS3 versions are almost completely different from the Wii/PS2 in every way, the levels are the same theme but are completely different in design, there is no leveling for Sonic and it's done automatically for the werehog. The werehog is more of a button masher than it is the 360/PS3 version where they have a long move list. There's more of an even spread between Sonics and the Werehogs levels, while the Wii/PS2 seems to focus more on the werehog. There is no towns to explore in the Wii/PS2 version, which is more of a picture/text adventure rather than running around, which is fine, but it's fun to see Segas new art style with the human characters that actually fit in this time around.The  360/PS3 version seems to be larger in scale to the Wii/PS2 versions but that's not to say the Wii version isn't good, it's just not as large as the 360/PS3.I'm so happy with this game, even if you're not a big fan of the werehog levels, there's enough fun in Sonics levels to keep you coming back for more. They don't try to over complicate a story with characters wierd events and certainly no Final Fantasy looking characters. It focuses on Sonic and his Werehog form and has a very fantasy/silly story, but it's very fitting for Sonic I must say. The game is the best Sonic game I've played in along time, and though I expected it to be not great, it turned out to be my favorite 3D Sonic game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2008"}

Just an excellent machine with ideas ahead of it's time. I still think it would've sold better if it had a DVD drive but I guess things were tight for Sega back then or something. Anyways, I got this for collection purposes but it also has some great games. If you were to investigate you would find games that were made for the PS1 but also put on the Dreamcast. The Dreamcast would benifit from smoother textures and perhaps shorter loading times. Resident Evil 2 is an example but there were others as well before the PS2 came out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2013"}

Nathan Hale.View larger.This sequel introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers.View larger.Resistance 2 takes up right where Resistance: Fall of Man left off. Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"j-rob-82","summary":"Multiplayer Greatness","reviewText":"I really didn't look forward to Resistance 2 like all the other fall games coming out until about 1 week before its release.  I played the 1st and enjoyed it but I didn't have internet at the time to try online play.  Whats so great about this game is PS3 exclusives are getting harder and harder to come by and PS3 owners should be proud of this one.I didn't buy this game but rented and if you have the money than buy it if not rent it and see what you think or maybe renting is better since our opinions differ so much and $60 is quite a bit of kablinky for a game you wont like or refuse to like.Graphics are maybe 4 stars.  1st off the graphics are somewhat of a short fall for such a big game.  A example of this is when I think its your San Francisco mission which I think is the 3rd and you walk out to see a massive fleet of ships flying in the sky and attacking in the distance which looks amazing but a close look at the city in the distance it reminded me of a old monster movie with cardboad cut outs of buildings but in 2D.  Its not that they are awfully ugly graphics its just there not special like when I 1st stuck in Halo 3 or Metal Gear Solid 4 and the game popped visually though these games still had little short falls as well graphically.  I know Halo 3 (since I own PS3, XBOX 360 and PC and am not biased to any since good games are on them all) isn't PS3 so no need to point it out and I only mean those graphics at the time when I stuck the game in it blew me away.  This game does make up for its graphics in sheer scope and gameplay which in the end is what really matters.  This game is more colorful than the 1st which I found with kind of a bland blend color pallet.  You expect next gen games to meet a certain criteria of graphics though so don't get me wrong graphics are still important its just not everything.In single player mode the 1st level is just the example of scope with giants roaming the landscape and blasting everything in sight and I thought what a fantastic way to start a game.  What I hoped for was a part of this game to have a wow factor to it and it does and quite frequently.  The amount of enemies can be overwhelming and there always seems to be a lot so you have to take your time sometimes and I found a lot of trial and error.  My 1st lesson was jumping in water and having my face ripped off by some water monstrosity or running in a room with enemies everywhere and fire from all directions.  I found another interesting thing was the attention to detail of the weapons especially the alien weapons.  I did like playing like a squad more than going solo with the A.I. characters.  I kinda missed split screen co op through the missions and I wonder why they took it out which I figured it must be b/c online.  I wish you could play campaign online like GOW but that's not really a big deal.The sound is fantastic since I wasn't too much of fan of the 1st sound design.  Everything sounds more organic and realistic or that might just be me being picky with sound.Single player is like a slice of the great cake that is Resistance 2 compared to the multiplayer  b/c multiplayer was the cake I ate the most of along with the persons hand holding the cake. That comment is just to show how much I enjoyed this experience online and craved it.  The XP is like a addiction just like in any other game where you want more and more of it.  This was my 1st experience on PSN and I loved it.  I have been on Live and online with the PC by the way and not meaning I was new to online play.  The 8 player co op is so awesome that you hope every game to come has something like it.  Its funner with a head set but you don't really need one since all you have to do is pretty much follow each other and stick together or your probably not gonna last.  Even though it would be nice to play campaign like that its really not that big of a deal next to how fun it is.  I do wish there was more maps and hopefully there will be more to come.  From my understanding is the more experience the players have the more difficult it is which stops it from getting boring.Deathmatch on the other hand is different non stop killing and chaos.  Even though I didn't like it as much as co op its still really enjoyable and very competitive.  For some reason there were 60 players and I kept getting killed by the same guy in different spots.  I thought \"there was no way my internet connection can handle this\"  since my connection isn't the greatest but to my surprise there was hardly any lag.  Its still up to your connection though to decide how well it plays but on there side so far so good.Even though I had a few problems great games deserve what they get and I stick by my 5 stars.  If you are not online you might wanna rent unless you have the money.  Multiplayer is where this game needs to be played to fully have the experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2008"}

Now, I know people will say I should have read the back cover of the game before opening it or I should have read it somewhere on the internet. Well, the fact is I didn't, nor should I have even thought about checking to see if internet is required before you can save a game or gain trophies. Why? How many times has this been done in the past? None. Zero. Zilch. At least from my experience and I've played a large number of PS3 games. I'm sorry but that's way too controlling on Rockstar's part. This should have been advertised much more. As in having internet required in big letters on the front cover, say at the bottom or top somewhere. Now, you can still play the game, but you won't be saving without an internet connection. I have internet connection but it's not connected to my PS3. Too much trouble since I never use my internet for anything PS3/X360 related.I started playing this this morning and didn't pay much attention at the time to the pop-up that says you need to be connected to the internet to save or collect trophies, so I ignored this and proceeded to play the game. Big mistake. I played the game about 6 hours total, but not straight through. In other words, I turned my tv off and took breaks without turning off my PS3. I do this all the time to save time on loading up the PS3 to get back in the game quickly. Now, after this 6 hours of play I still didn't know about the internet connection thing. So, I encountered a game freeze on I believe it was Chapter 8. I ended up having to turn the system off because of this. When I turned it back on, thinking I was going to start back on Chapter 8(thinking there was an autosave) I was in for a big surprise. A real big surprise! I had to start all the way back to Chapter 1. Needless to say, I won't be playing this game again. Ever. When you take away a freedom as simple as saving or autosaving in game by requiring you to have internet connection, then you're crossing the line. Shame on you Rockstar! Amazon, I want my money back in full! And no, Amazon does not mention anywhere in their listing that internet is required for saves. Rockstar puts in very small letters on the back cover by required memory and all that that broadband internet is required.If you don't have you're PS3/X360 connected to the internet avoid this game. Unless, of course, you don't mind taking your chances of going through 14 or so acts without a save and the possibility of the game freezing on you. Not everyone has internet connection and you shouldn't make them get it just to save a game or collect trophies, especially when you don't make it widely known that it's a requirement. That is beyond bogus and a big FAIL! A BIG EPIC FAIL.*******UPDATE*******If you would like to see proof that I'm not lying about any of this just click on the link titled \"view and share related images\". This link can be found under the stock box/cover artwork of the game provided by amazon... just under the images and video link.

{"product_name":"B003VWXV50","reviewerName":"Sigmund Freud","summary":"great controller so far","reviewText":"Been using this controller for about a week now and so far its been functioning well, Its light even with the rumble but not too light like the sixaxis. The feel of the controller is smooth like matte or suede. The grips are a nice touch and help if you get sweaty palms and in those cases where that leads to dropping your controller; with the grips this most likely will never happen. I've been mostly playing FPS games with this controller and its been excellent it feels like your playing on xbox 360, the whole controller is mapped like the 360 controller down to the shoulder buttons which look and feel like the xbox controller.The controller is good for fps games mostly as I tried playing fighting games (MKvsDC,SSF4 etc and it did'nt fair to good thanks to the d pad which is better then 360s but not by a lot.The only small problem I have with this controller is that you can't turn on your ps3 with it by pressing the home button on the controller instead you'll have to manually do it. Which is not huge negative, you can just turn on your ps3 while your plugging in your controller. But that added convenience would of been nice but its a 3rd party controller so I understand some features would be missing like motion controls; which I didn't care one bit because the ps3's motion controls is a joke and most people forget that it even has that functionThere is a wireless version but it costs a little more. All in all I'd recommend this to any ps3 owner whose looking for a great alternate ps3 controller, its the best one out in the market from my use with it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2010"}

It simply is the best game that I have ever played, largely because it has every element that I like to see in game like this: It is epic, with a sprawling story arc that covers thousands of years of galactic history, it is heroic- the character you play fits the mold of a hero in every way- depending on the choices you make determines how `light' or `dark' he or she becomes, the art, graphics and music are first rate, and unlike Halo 3 or Gears of War, Mass Effect might actually be the `killer app' the 360 has been waiting for. Above all, it's fun. There were lots of places to go and explore- something I can't get enough of in these so-called role playing games (If you are familiar with Bio-Ware's Knights of the Old Republic or Jade Empire, a lot of Mass Effect will seem instantly familiar). I will grant that the story is not entirely original, and the game borrows a lot from Babylon 5 and Star Wars, though with a pedigree like that, it's hard to go wrong, because they took all of the best elements from both. What it does achieve is an immersive story that provided me with hours of entertainment.The human race is a johnny come lately to the galactic stage after discovering an alien data cache on Mars that advanced a lot of our existing technology at least 200 years. Namely, the \"mass effect\" which is created when an electrical current is passed across a material known as \"element zero\"- a negative current and the object becomes lighter, a positive current and it becomes heavier. That alone would enable ships to overcome the nasty effects of relativistic space travel. They also discovered in the ice on Pluto a small mass relay- essentially a space catapult that transports ships vast interstellar distances almost instantly. A nice little draw back is, relays can only send to other relay. In so doing mankind discovered a host of other races already in place and in charge and promptly went to war with one of them- the turians, a short conflict the humans won. The other races have been in space, some for as long as 2000 years and established a sort of cooperative empire based on an enormous deep space station known as the Citadel. Everything- the mass relays, the Citadel were already there waiting for younger races to find them, having been built by a long-dead species known as the Protheans.You play as John Shepard (or his female counterpart, Jane), no, not Joe Flannigan from Stargate: Atlantis, a Systems Alliance commander and second in command of a brandy new starship called the Normandy sent to investigate a Prothean artifact discovered on the human colony world of Eden Prime. The Normandy arrives just as the colony is under attack by an unknown alien spacecraft. It's your job to uncover why the colony was attacked, the vision given to you by the Prothean artifact, eventually save the galaxy, and prove humanity's worth. You will be joined by numerous human and alien NPCs, some of which have their own agendas, but all of them are useful in one form or another. For example, if you take on the Soldier class for your character, you will likely take NPCs on missions who are more capable in tech based skills or biotic powers. Biotics are another mass effect product developed when a fetus is exposed to an element zero reaction in-utero, a process that has limited success. Either you get cancer and die or super powers.Mass Effect is, in my opinion, the killer app that the 360 has sorely been lacking. The Xbox 360 has been out for a year and a half now and most of the games do not interest me and those that do haven't been all that great. Mass Effect is also an RPG that thankfully doesn't fall into Final Fantasy trap of static `wait your turn' combat, but instead allows you to move about the battlefield, issue orders to team mates, duck for cover, switch weapons and more. The game gives you lots of things to do- side missions, exploration, surveying mineral deposits, following up on clues, computer hacking, and lots and lots of bad guys to blow up. There are a thousand points of achievements to boost your Live! Gamer Score. The graphics and sound are first rate, with some of the best character and face modeling I have yet to see in a game. Mass Effect and Halo 3 are two completely different games, but for my entertainment dollar, Mass Effect is better. I finished Halo 3 in maybe 6-7 hours, Mass Effect took me 22 hours to finish and I still hadn't completed all of side missions, which took another 24 hours in my second run through.I love the fact that you can upgrade virtually all of your equipment. Guns get enhancements that make them more accurate, less recoil, and different kinds of ammunition. You can also improve your armor with better kinetic shields, better first aid equipment and more. There are only four basic weapons- pistol, shotgun, assault rifle and sniper rifle, but there are dozens of variants of each that get more powerful as you gain levels. You also get to outfit all of your NPCs including where they put their skill points, and that doesn't always mean keeping the best kit for yourself, depending on your class, etc. you may find armor that you can't wait because it's made for a krogan or a turian. All in all there are hundreds of upgrades.The game is not without its problems, however, but most of them are of a technical nature. First, it uses the DVD rom drive constantly- on my 360 it never stops reading from the disc and gets so loud that my girlfriend commented on it from across room. It also fails to load all of the textures, leaving objects as black silhouettes- usually crates, but some of the NPCs on Feros were also rendered this way. Also, the short load times means it takes several seconds to load all textures when the action does start, leaving surfaces with only their primary texture layer. In the end, Mass Effect provided me with over two solid days of play time and I'm still not finished with it yet, I still want to try the other character classes and see how the game changes accordingly. They left it open for a sequel and my hope is BioWare won't pawn it off to a second-rate developer as they did with Knights of the Old Republic II.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2007"}

Along the way you'll encounter all of the pratfalls of the typical real estate tycoon.","reviewerName":"Knewace","summary":"Roller Coaster Tycoon","reviewText":"Roller coaster Tycoon by Chris Sawyer is a theme park strategy game, It is a game that makes you want to actually ride coasters even if you hate them, It makes you belive you are creating a real theme park. The Interface is almost the same as chris swayers earlier game Transport Tycoon and it is very easy to use. The gameplay was easy, I was able to figure out the tool bar icons without much trouble. The gameplay is that you have to manage a theme park and complete the given objective within the time limit, You could borrow money from the bank and there are limitations to how much you can borrow. There are almost every type of ride you see in real theme parks in this game, Kiddies train, Chartlift, Merry go round, Bumper cars, Go karts, 3D cinemas, Boat rides, Obsevation tower, Force lift, and ofcourse Roller coasters, There is every type of coaster in the world from. Besides these there are many trees and when you build a pond ducks will come there. The hardest part of the game is Building coasters that would work and the ones the guests would ride, There are lots of already built coasters but desinging your own is a lot of fun. The bad thing about Rct is that it comes without a screnario editor, You can only play only the available screnario's, Most of the screnarios are very small in size, You cannot build outside the park and not all parts of the land are available for sale and the park is are almost half built. The research tool is bad too, It takes a lot of time and some times it comes up with rides useless for the current park. You can costumize them but they are in a mess too, If you need just gentle rides it may research a chartlift in a very small park. Still Rct is the best strategy game i have ever played, I loved it, I played it for 5 hours and didnt know that i was on so long. Rct is a must for people who love computer games and have the system requierments. It doesn't take a coaster nut to fall in love with this game, Get it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2000"}
{"product_name":"B00020LZBG","description":"The third installment of the Ratchet & Clank franchise incorporates new elements of gameplay not seen previously in the series, including online and offline multiplayer capabilities that will appeal to a wide variety of players.Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenalreturns gamers to Planet Veldin, the setting of the originalRatchet & Clank, where the duo set off on a gripping new adventure through a multitude of diverse planets to fight for galactic peace. Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.After word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest inRatchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub. The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"Victoria Jann Borjesson \"Calle Borjesson\"","summary":"i love this game","reviewText":"ratchet and clank 3 is sweet. there are more levels in this game and qwark makes his own team called the Q force. qwark doesn't do any thing and takes glory for what ratchet does. that lazy bum can't do any thing. r and c 3 is cool because in some special vendors you can get guns from the other games in the r and c series free. so you might want to check the vendors for special offers. the guns are better and you can upgrade them to a v8. the robots don't die that easily like in the other games. there is a multiplayer place where you can battle your friends. you can sorta make your own people. you choose a body and name it, it's still fun. the modes in multiplayer are siege, deathmatch, and capture the flag. you can also ride in veichles: an airplane and a car. one person could get in the plane, and two people could be in a car. maybe 2 people could get in the plane because i have never tried it. get the multitap and play 4 player and choose a team.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2004"}
{"product_name":"B001GGO1GG","reviewerName":"Caleb Williams","summary":"So Bad, It's Excruciating","reviewText":"Words really can't express just how disappointed I was in this game. The trailers for it, made it seem just as good as the first, if not better with its innovative \"Don's View.\" The first game drew a lot of controversy and attention due to the fact that it contained voice acting from the legendary Marlon Brando and other actors from the movie. It also apparently had people who were involved in the movie as consultants towards the atmosphere and the mafia underworld of 1930s New York in the video game. \"The Godfather\" game had a lot going for it in terms of scenic detail, texture, atmosphere, story and structure. It was worked on for a very long time and a lot of effort went into it. It had a lot going for it and it will certainly be remembered as a classic game; but sadly, its sequel will not.\"The Godfather II\" has literally, in one glance, managed to destroy any credibility built up by the first computer game incarnation. There were a lot of great ideas for this game and if more time and money was put into the game, there's no doubting this could have had the possibility to be one of the best games of the year. The flaws seemed almost endless when playing and after an hour or two, I became so frustrated by the awful playing experience, I would have preferred to go to work.So what flaws am I talking about here? Is the game really as bad as I'm trying to make out, or am I just being a bit melodramatic? Well no, I'm not being melodramatic as this is sincerely the worst game I've played this year. The most advertised aspect of this new game was the introduction of the revolutionary \"Don's View.\" This gave you the ability to take on the role of Don and overlook your empire by sending your men to attack rival family rackets or help out your businesses that are under attack, without you becoming directly involved. In this view it also allows you to manage other aspects like family finances and soldier upgrades.This is about the only redeeming aspect of this game, and even this is annoyingly awkward and seems to have just been thrown together at the last minute. The controls in this game are clumsy, ill thought out and even at times seem unresponsive. The graphics and atmosphere are the biggest let down of the entire game. The original managed to capture the 1930s New York atmosphere perfectly and presented sincere graphical intelligence with the rendering of the movie characters faces and voices. I'll give the sequel credit, and they did manage to get Robert Duvall to do the voice for his long stuck character, Tom Hagen. That is the only credit I'm giving this game as thinking about the graphics and scenery, I remember just one of the reasons why I hate this game.Remember when I said about the first game capturing the atmosphere perfectly? Well, EA threw all that out the window with this. The premise of setting the game in 3 prime locations (Cuba, Florida & New York) was a brilliant one and upon first hearing about it, I became excited at just how they're going to present the individual atmospheres in their own unique way. No. That wasn't going to happen. What EA did do, however, was give us a tiny New York map, and a slightly bigger Florida map and I haven't managed to get to Cuba as I became so frustrated by it I just don't want to play it. About the only thing unique about the two locations I have seen is the base appearance as any aesthetic individual depth seems to have been cast out at the planning stages.The controls are also shoddy and annoying. For a game that boasts about its incredible handling in the terms of its interrogation system etc. The entire thing is just frustrating. I appreciate how they incorporated the motion sensor controls to this, but they became utterly pointless and annoying as the slightest movement by me would place the man I had hold of in a completely unwanted position, and with no option to turn it off, that annoyed me more. The fact that I have to keep re-adjusting the camera is also something I don't want to have to be thinking about when trying to shoot the guy in front of me.The story itself is based loosely on the movie sequel and just seems to go into its own direction. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's just a shame that they didn't have the creative talent to be able to create a compelling story that would make you want to play it. The supporting characters are shallow and irritating which is supported by the painfully wooden voicing. There's just so much about this game that I dislike I can't even begin to think of something good to say. Such a disappointment in comparison to its predecessor and I only hope that if they are planning on bringing out another sequel, they at least spend more time and money on making it worth our hard earned cash.I wasted my money on this, I warn you.

{"product_name":"B000035Y08","description":"Squaresoft presents this side quest to the popular Final Fantasy RPG series, for the Super Nintendo platform.","reviewerName":"Joe Sherry","summary":"not fun, and too easy","reviewText":"This is the black sheep of the Final Fantasy family.  It is barely mentioned in any discussion about Final Fantasy and there is a very good reason.  This is the worst game that I have played that actually bears the Final Fantasy name.  Simply put: this game is not good.  By the time this game was released, Squaresoft had give us a simplified version of Final Fantasy IV and called it Final Fantasy II.  FFII was more complex and had a deeper story than Mystic Quest.  The American audience had proven that we could handle more complex RPGs, but the next Final Fantasy we got was the children's game Mystic Quest.I finished Mystic Quest the first time in about 8-9 hours (at most), and after that I could beat the game in less than 6 hours.  Had there been an actual story to the game, this would have been just a warm-up, but instead the game was complete.  Mystic Quest would have worked better as a side scrolling adventure RPG rather than a straight RPG.  As it stands, the game is closer in feel to Final Fantasy Adventure for the Gameboy than any Final Fantasy in the numbered series.  The story is simple: gather crystals and save the world (okay, FF I and IV had this story, too).  The gameplay was far too easy.  Most enemies would go down in one or two hits, and you can just fly through the game learning some spells and whacking enemies.My description isn't quite doing justice to how dull the game is and how little fun it is to play.  Because of the weakness of this game, the only positive is that the game is so short.  If you must play it, go into it with no expectations.  If you want to play a good SNES RPG, try Final Fantasy II or III, or Chrono Trigger.  If you do play this game, remember to use the Cure spell on the final boss.  It makes life easier.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2003"}

The series went down hill and it was a fairly poor franchise for a while.  But this game is a great return to Tomb Raider's roots.The graphics for the 360 are very pretty.  The lighting and textures are good, better than the PS2 and x-box, but not as good as other x-box 360 titles.The game play is intuitive for anyone who's ever played tomb raider before.  The camera is a little tricky, but in a game like tomb raider where you're constantly moving up, down, left, right, forward, and back - it's pretty hard to have a standard camera angle that would work all the time.  The opening level has a tutorial so it walks you through how to jump, swing, shoot, etc.The major downside of this game is how short it is.  The game could easily be beaten in under 5 hours (especially if you set the difficulty to easy).  There are lots of hidden \"treasures\" that you can collect to boost your \"achievements\" score; but it gets a little tiresome to find all of them.  There's also a time-trial to beat levels under a set time (and it is VERY hard to do, I might add).But the time trials and hidden treasures don't really add much to the game.  There's no reason you couldn't pick this up, play it over the weekend, and beat it and return it.  Overall, I thought it was a lot of fun, and then I returned it to the video store.And, of course, if you have x-box live, you can download a demo of this game on the live marketplace.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2006"}

The story takes place several years after the original Neverwinter Nights, and reintroduces popular characters and NPCs in a new storyline with new challenges.","reviewerName":"Andrew C.","summary":"Could have been special, but....","reviewText":"I waited a year before picking up this game and the expansion, Mask of the Betrayer.  Since the initial release in 2006 had technical issues and other problems, I decided to get this game only after the expansion came out and received good reviews (and supposedly fixed bugs and optimization problems).  Unfortunately, not all is well with this game, even a year after release and the new expansion pack.  It has a better single-player campaign than the first Neverwinter Nights, but is still just a cut above mediocre.  If you are looking for the next Baldur's Gate-style epic, definitely don't look here.  However, with some luck, some good player-made modules might be produced with the toolset that comes with the game.Gameplay: Story-wise, this is a run-of-the-mill roleplaying game (RPG). Your character rises from rags to riches in search of his/her life's meaning and in search of the bad guy that needs to be vanquished.  The game is based on the 3.5 Dungeon & Dragons rules and offers a lot of customization options for race, class, skills, feats, etc.  There is an awful lot of loot to be found, bought, and custom-made.  Unlike the first game, you actually have a party to control, which is both good and bad.  The good part is that your party members have personalities and make the adventuring a bit more colorful.  The bad, well, where should I start: pathfinding issues, not-too-efficient use of spells, suddenly vanishing party members, some suicidal behavior, and so on.  You can let the AI control the party, but this works well only early on.  Toward the end of the game, you'll need to micromanage each spell and sword swing.  It's not as tedious as it sounds if you ever played classic games like Baldur's Gate.  But none of the possible 10 or so party members that you can have around come close to the hilarity of a Boo & Minsc or the seductive intrigue of a Viconia from Baldur's Gate 2.Generally, the pieces come together fairly well in this game.  The inventory system and journal are decent, as is the interface.  The camera can be annoying largely because it never seems to face in the right direction when you enter a new area.  That is, sometimes north will be toward the right side of the screen or toward the left, forcing you to swing the camera around to match the direction of the map.  You'll get used to it, but you shouldn't have to.  A few things I really liked were the number of scripted events, the save system (none of that checkpoint stuff; you can save anywhere), and the death system (no one in your party actually dies unless everyone goes down in a fight).  But the things that I really didn't like were prominent as well, mostly involving the campaign which was about twice as long as it should have been.  There are a lot of busy-work quests in the game that add absolutely nothing to the story.  Chapter 1 (there are 3 in all) is the worst in this regard, but monotonous chores and a somewhat nonsensical narrative plague the game throughout.  There is about 60-80 hours of gameplay here if you try to do everything.  A tighter, more compelling story could have been told in half that time.Graphics: The game looks good, but certainly not great.  With the patches and the expansion installed, I didn't notice any framerate problems on my mid-range computer, although the game sometimes did not load all of the textures in each area.  Character models, monsters, and terrain are all convincing, and spell effects look particularly good.  There are night & day cycles that make the game a bit immersive, though it is hard to get too immersed in a game that is best played from a high overhead perspective and that requires constant monkeying with the camera.Sound: The music was great.  I wouldn't mine actually owning a few of the tracks.  The voice acting ranged from decent to good, but it was the usual RPG fare of Scottish-accented dwarves, English-accented elves, deep-throated demons, and the occasionally whiny acolyte magician (always with an American accent).  Sound effects for spells and other things were appropriate.Technical Issue/Documentation: The game comes with a rather lengthy manual, which is quite helpful.  It also has a clever tutorial at the beginning.  Whether you get it alone or with the expansion, prepare for up to a 30-minute install which includes downloading some big patches.  The game was rock-solid stable for about the first 30 hours of gameplay.  Then the crashes started.  According to posts at the official website, people are still having a variety of problems with this game, even after all the patches.  My issues involved the game refusing to load new areas and crashing during transitions. The first time this occurred (while leaving Ammon Jerro's haven), I was able to find a workaround solution on the internet.  The second time (at Crossroad Keep in chapter 3) there was just nothing that could be found to get me around this.  I never got to finish the game. This was very frustrating and more than likely will keep me from buying another game by this developer.  In fact, I was so disgusted by this problem that I sold both the game and the expansion on eBay.  I had really had enough of the main quest after 50+ hours.Value/Recommendation: If you like D&D-style; roleplaying games, this might be worth your while at the current price ($20). However, be sure to patch it and be willing to deal with the game's remaining technical issues.  This is really not a good value unless you are going to play player-made modules and/or play online.  As with the first game, the single-player campaign, while long and with a few high points, is largely unremarkable (and buggy) and there are better RPGs available.Rating: 3.5 stars (out of 5)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2007"}

Each offers wildly different play mechanics, and this coupled with the game's time warp storyline (more on that later) offers needed variety to a survival horror franchise that was never really know for its fear factor.Each character will upgrade their weapons and skills through the course of the game (much less so for Michelle, as she's playable for far less of the game than the other two) in the usual fashion&nbsp;&#8211; collecting souls. Without a combo-laden combat system, Demon Siege relies heavily on timing and strategy to master each of the three warriors. This mechanic is very reminiscent of Enter the Matrix for two reasons: minimal button presses result in onscreen action that looks very, very cool. Two, the timing of action is far more crucial than combos. The difference is that Demon Siege is just a much better game &#8211; the enemies offer more variety, the control is more precise, and the elemental weaponry is extremely varied.While some action hardcores will likely fault the game for its simple control scheme, most will appreciate it for the satisfaction it brings to the screen. Kicking a demon away so you have better range with the Ball and Chain of Doom (my name for it, not the game's) is quite cool, after all. Just keep in mind that plot and combat play equal roles in the Onimusha universe, and each are doled out fairly.On the story side of things, Demon Siege has that dual time period hook. How well is the idea executed? Well, Paris really looks like Paris; and without being able to experience feudal Japan firsthand, all I can say is that it looks beautiful in the game. The plot unfolds at a lightning pace and requires players to use one character (in one time period) to do something, which has an effect on the other character (in the other time period). Switching frequently, the game's pace is so well crafted that there are few places that seem to be a pause &#8211; you'll always want to do that next thing.What I really like about this game is that I always felt like I was getting a new weapon, going to a new area, or fighting a new boss (most of which are ferociously tough, by the way). There was no drag for me. That, and kicking Genma butt made me look badass. Personally, I wouldn't want anything else for my favorite samurai/horror sendoff.Concept:Craft a compelling, edge-of-your seat action game to conclude the Onimusha seriesGraphics:3D backgrounds don't mean that players have camera control, but it does mean that everything looks really greaSound:The score alternates between totally inspired and super cheesy &#8211; but it does fit the gamePlayability:Timing is the key to success and I rarely felt robbed, so it did what it was supposed toEntertainment:Demon Siege is one of the most cinematic games to date, and I soaked up every second gratefullyReplay:HighRated:9 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:The final chapter of the Onimusha trilogy radiates excitement and is the very definition of epic. The opening CG cinematic is so detailed and explosive that I wouldn't be surprised if George Lucas started handing out pink slips to the ILM crew. I know this clip is only a few minutes in length, but it is worth the price of admission alone. Further justifying that you absolutely need to add this title to your library, the gameplay is equally exquisite and is brimming with non-stop intensity. The methods with which you dispose of your assailants remain simplistic and true to the series. Plus, the battles are much larger in scope, the pacing of levels is relentless, and the visuals that you breathe in are all the more majestic. This truly is game development at its finest. While I would have liked to see more interaction in the environments, and depth in the combat, I really couldn't ask for a better conclusion to one of the PlayStation 2's finest series.Rated:9.25 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Marc Ruby&#8482; \"The Noh Hare&#8482;\"","summary":"Paris With Demons On Top","reviewText":"While demon whomping action games aren't my usual type of game, I had a played through Onimusha 2 a while ago and enjoyed much more than I expected to.  With the price of Onimusha 3 so low, I decided to try it out.  Again. I was happy with the result.The two games share some characters - Samonosuke and Nabonaga, of course, and a host of monsters.  Demon Seige though, breaks new ground.  Nobumaga's scientist Guildenstern has figured out a way to fold time, spreading the battle to modern Paris and introducing the complication which makes this game unique.  An accident transports Jacques Blanc of the French military to Japan and creates two Samonosukes - one in Paris, and one back in 16th century Japan.  In addition to Jacque, we get his fianc&eacute;e Michelle and his young son Henri.That this works at all is amazing.  The player has to adjust to three different sets of fighting skills and weaponry (fortunately Henri stays a non-combatant) and deal with the occasional complications of having to fighters in play at one time.  But work it does - in no time you are winging your way between the Eiffel tower, underwater temples, and the usual Japanese temples and castles.  And having a ball solving puzzles and beating up bad things.Play is straightforward with a small set of fight moves and some interesting weapons.  The plot is linear, but the need for the characters in both eras to coordinate their actions creates the sense of a few degrees of freedom that aren't really there.  One you've been through it play time should run under 20 hours, even with some extended leveling up.Artistically the game is superb.  Amemiya's influence still shows, and the overall level of detail makes watching almost as much fun as playing.  Player action is smooth as is the interface that drives the character.  I still think Onimusha 2 had the better story, but from a playing and viewing experience Onimusha 3 is a real improvement.  This is certainly worth the price.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2004"}

Its not bad, or ok or even good.Look its the perfect Deadpool game, thats about it. If it wasnt or was anything else. I would have given it a much lower score. It is funny as hell. I mean the jokes and ref are what makes the game redeemable in any way.The voice acting is great, mostly due to Nolan Northan reprising his role of Deadpool from marvel vs Capcom 3.A nice little detail is the game pays homage to old overhead 2d dugeon crawlers and side scrollers from the games of the past. Also the game does break the forth wall a lot which is awesome to see Deadpool complain to the player and the game creator.The game is your typical hack and slash game. You kill your enimies with either guns or melee weapons. To dodge you can also teleport over small distances which is also the counter button so things can get confusing.Another big issue is the camera angle. Its basically manual so if you want it to be right you would have to control itself but if you need that finger to do something else you will get screwed with the camera. Also the aiming is ok at best.The game is roughly 6 hours long to beat. So dont expect to play it for a while. There are challenge maps for added fun but they are just wasted space. I wish they would have used that space for me story levels.The story sounds cool at first but by the end its a let down.No matter what difficulty its on, its super easy to beat. But the last level is super hard even on super easy. So there is a huge difficulty spike at the end. You get some cameos from some X-Men and Cable which is sweet. The first level is an awesome one but goes done hill from there. However the baddies are repetitive as are the levels. The bosses are meh mostly and the last boss is really cheesy.If you love Deadpool and want to play this game. Rent it. I am glad I played it but first chance I got I traded it at Gamestop for the most money I could to be able to get a good game.Pros:-Perfect Deadpool Game-Very Funny-Cameos by the X-Men, and Cable-First level-Two words... Nolan North-Video game homages-The 4th wall has been brokenCons:-Too short-Horrible camera-Ok at best aiming-Too easy for most of the game and last level is way too hard-Challenge maps are pointless-Repetitive baddies and levels-Meg bosses and final boss-Story mostly a let down","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2013"}

There really are hours upon hours of single player and co-op joy to be had. 2 things.If you're looking forward to or want to play borderlands 2 I recommend buying this game just so you can get used to the mechanics of borderlands 2 as I'm sure will have the same or similar mechanics to borderlands 1. For example understanding how the skill tree works and point distribution and critical hit versus normal damage that enemies take. All these things are important and will help you when borderlands 2 launches in September.The 2nd thing is if you're buying this game by the game of the year edition the DLC is well worth it and gearbox really knows how to bring out quality DLC and they deliver in this game. It's worth the extra 10 bucks by far.So if you have never played this game and like first-person/RPG games this game is for you it takes a little bit to get into understanding how all the different guns work and it's mind-boggling even now for me trying to decide which guns are better than others.

Take control of two  heroes, Jonathan Morris, a vampire killer and his close friend Charlotte Orlean, a girl with tremendous magical ability. Amidst the chaos of World War II,  two mysterious sisters emerge, and design a plan to resurrect Dracula. Join Jonathan and Charlotte as they attempt to thwart the terrible plan to resurrect  Dracula.Fight vicious bosses as you play the character of Jonathan and  Charlotte.Choose which character you want to control on the fly.Explore the depths of the castle.Seek out the evil  Brauner.Game StorylineInCastlevania: Portrait of Ruin, players take on the role of Jonathan Morris and  Charlotte Orlean. During World War II, many lost souls from the global conflict were left to wander the world in search of salvation. Desperate to escape  their terrible plight, they sought to resurrect Dracula's Castle from the rubble of society, assisted by two mysterious vampire sisters. Now Jonathan and  Charlotte must work together to confront the two vampire sisters, and ensure that this villainous catastrophe is not unleashed on the world.GameplayEvolving the action-adventure gameplay that has been the series' trademark for 20 years,Castlevania: Portrait of Ruinlets players switch  freely between Jonathan and Charlotte as they proceed on their heroic mission, each with their own strengths, abilities and style of play. Players can now  utilize powerful combination attacks in which both characters unleash the full extent of their combat abilities to decimate the game's more than 100  different enemies and bosses. In their quest to stop Dracula's resurrection, Jonathan and Charlotte can collect and use different weapons, equipment, and  items to increase their overall skill level and acquire new abilities.As mentioned before, players can switch freely between both characters, a  necessary option to win the game. For instance, you need to analyze certain situations and carefully choose to play either Jonathan or Charlotte in order to  successfully battle against the vampire army. The two characters can also combine their powers to pull-off powerful combo attacks. Their combined abilities  are needed in certain parts of the castle in order to progress through the game.The game has two different endings. Both endings involve the prevention  of Dracula's resurrection, however only one actually involves the defeat of Brauner. Different choices allow for a uniquely diverse gameplay experience.Castlevania: Portrait of Ruinsupports the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection with a limited cooperative play mode feature. There is an online shop mode used through  Wi-Fi as well. Players are able to put their items up for sale in a realistic marketplace. And perhaps best of all, when another player buys the item, the  selling player gains the money but doesn't lose the item.","reviewerName":"Lestor neeker Wong","summary":"Return of the Whip","reviewText":"Last year's Dawn of Sorrow was Castlevania's first entrance into the DS library. It proved to be a hit, both in critical acclaim and sales. It isn't a surprise, therefore, to see Konami releasing the next instalment of its popular Dracula-related series, just in time for the Christmas holidays. Portrait of Ruin isn't exactly related to Dawn of Sorrow, but both share similar core gameplay elements. New features are included this time round as well to keep things fresh. The result is an instantly satisfying title that will go down in the books as another great Castlevania game.The story of Portrait of Ruin is set in the year 1944, during World War II. In the midst of hellish times, Dracula's castle mysteriously reappears. Two vampire hunters, Jonathan Morris and Charlotte Aulin, join forces to investigate the occurrence. This is as simple as it gets when it comes to the game's premise - it's merely an excuse to get your characters to explore a huge castle again. This is not really a bad thing though, since it's what Castlevania is all about. The interesting thing here is, you will get the chance to control BOTH Jonathan and Charlotte. This is something that is uncommon in the series.As you may have expected, both characters have different abilities - Jonathan is the powerhouse that deals high melee damages, while Charlotte is more of a magic user. Despite their differences, controlling them isn't difficult. The basic controls are similar to Dawn of Sorrow, but you can choose to control only one character, call forth your partner to fight beside you, and even switch between characters. All these options are accessible at the push of a button, which makes this double-team attribute extremely user-friendly. There's even an option to perform combo attacks, giving this team feature a further edge as compared to previous single-character campaigns. The downside of this arrangement is that both Jonathan and Charlotte share the same HP and MP. If you choose to play with both of them, losing health for Jonathan means losing health for Charlotte as well. Thankfully, when your partner is hit, he or she wouldn't lose health. Instead, your MP decreases. This is definitely a friendlier approach, since MP does recharge itself over time. With these restrictions in mind, however, you may have to decide whether it's worthwhile to play with the partner.I won't go much into the weapons, skills and items that you will acquire in this game, except that the whip (originating from the very first Castlevania) is back. Most of these are recycled from previous games, and many of them are rewards for killing enemies or getting into obscure corners. Some of these, however, can only be acquired upon completing quests. Quests are new additions to the Castlevania fold, and are basically things you do that may not have major consequences to the story. For example, one of the quests requires you to kill a certain number of a certain enemy, another tasks you to perform a sword skill a few times. Quests are also largely optional, except for one. The rewards for doing them, however, are exclusive contents that cannot be found anywhere else. True to Castlevania fashion, skills acquired (not necessary from quests) can help you venture further into the castle. The Lizard Tail, for example, allows you to slide through lower ceilings. The Acrobat, on the other hand, lets you use your partner's shoulders as a launching pad for jumping onto a previously unreachable ledge. They are extremely useful, therefore, if you intend to cover every inch of the building.The castle is once again separated by various themes. The themes aren't as colourful as Dawn of Sorrow, and appear more generic than innovative. You have the locations like the Buried Chamber and the Great Stairway - places that sound, and look darker than the playhouses and gardens from the previous game. However, Portrait of Ruin also introduces an \"alternate castle\" feature. These additional castles can be accessed by entering various portraits (hence the title of the game) found in the main castle. They are, of course, defined by different themes too. Areas within portraits are comparatively more colourful, which provide great contrast between both universes. It would be a giveaway to explain why you can enter portraits though, so I would just leave that aspect for you to explore. You will no longer be contended just by achieving 100% map coverage anymore though - with these new areas, it's possible to cover as much as 1,000% map, which REALLY sounds like great adventuring prospects.To complement said adventures, Portrait of Ruin excels in both graphical and audio performances. The game plays like your typical 2D side-scroller, but the backgrounds are rendered in 3D, which give the on-screen action more depth than ever. The details are magnificent as usual, and even with an overall darker feel to the game, the colors remain vibrant and pleasing to the eye.  Like Dawn of Sorrow, this game also features an upper screen map support, which, despite its superb functionality, isn't adopted by many other games of similar genre. Music wise, let's just say that the opening theme is good enough to give us goosebumps (the good ones). Sound effects also maintain the high standards set from the last game.It seems that with each instalment of Castlevania, Konami are getting better at the job. Like Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin is a candidate for the game of the year on the DS, and it's hard to see how Konami can further better the series in the next instalment. For now, however, Portrait of Ruin is definitely the game that you should get for the seasons.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2007"}

I know it's unlikely that we will see commercial space travel in my lifetime (or at all if Einstein's theory of relativity is airtight), but in order to retreat from the horror of this game I just might run away to an island and live a life of coconuts and loincloths. Dead Space 2 ain't no tourist brochure for Outer Space.Having never played the first game I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to keep up with the story, but thankfully there is a 'previously on Dead Space' option on the main menu. You play as Issac Clarke, an engineer who wakes up on a colony on Titan to discover that a disgusting biological accident called the Necromorphs have taken over. On his way to safety he also fights against the Unitologists, a cult who worship 'The Marker', a faux religious artifact that is actually a man-made weapon that turns human DNA to sludge. The resulting Necromorphs (terrifying monsters made from re-animated human corpses) spread the chaos as Issac flees through the disintegrating colony while hallucinating his dead girlfriend as a demonic ghost.The dread in Dead Space 2 is overwhelming. It is honestly the most frightening game I have played since Condemned 2 (PS3). If you have a home cinema you can scare yourself to death by playing this at night, with the lights off, and sound turned all the way up. Every breath, every gasp, every distant rumble will make the hairs on arm stand on end, and some of the stingers (quite clever ones too) will cause your heart to stop beating.The gameplay is the over-shoulder, run-and-gun type you've seen in Resident Evils 4 and 5.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

It's truly an awesome game.  I don't know if the Gameboy Advance version has added anything extra, but I know it didn't need to.  The game was perfect years ago, and it's still perfect today.  The only problem I had with the 8 bit game was it couldn't be saved and continued at another time.  I assume the Gameboy Advance version has a saving feature.I don't know if the levels were painstakingly designed or just thrown together, but they're absolutely great.  Some of them are pretty tough though, especially towards the end where you have to go through all of the tank levels.Some of the enemies on this game are pretty tough too, particularly the heavyset ones that shake the ground and stun you a bit.My advice to those playing the game is this:  Don't use the warp whistles if you happen to find them.  They'll jump you ahead to levels that are so difficult you won't have enough lives and items to be prepared for them.  This is a tough game, and it's twice as tough if you try to take shortcuts.  Plus you miss so much when you skip levels.  You miss frog suits, and takooni suits, and the giant enemies, and all of the fun stuff.This game just has so much variety.  New stuff is everywhere.  Play every level and have a good time.  Find that level with the giant boot to jump around in too.  I love that one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2005"}

This is one impressive machine!To start off, this is one of the easiest pieces of video game equipment I've even put together. The drum set comes preassembled except for the cymbals and the control box - it literally took me 15 minutes to get this up and running. The instructions for putting this together are typical Logitech - very simple to follow. I've uploaded the instructions so you can see how easy it is. Once you put in the two AA batteries, plug in the USB fob and press the PlayStation button on the unit, you're ready to rock!The cymbals and pads are made of very durable material. I spent the better part of 3 hours banging away on this set - it took the lickin' and kept on tickin'! The drum sticks themselves are made of sturdy wood (not plastic), designed to take whatever we can dish out. I really like the design of the foot pedal, because the early Rock Band pedals had the spring in the middle which led to them breaking easily. This pedal has the spring in the toe, and a strip of Velcro can be attached to the bottom to prevent it from sliding around. There's an extra jack in the back of the unit, I assume this is to plug in another bass pedal for optional songs in games like Guitar Hero Metallica.Adjusting the height and location of the drum pads/cymbals is very easy to do. With this set, I can give my arms more freedom to move around, which is a big improvement over the standard Rock Band drum controller, where the foot pedal is attached to the base and the pads can't be moved at all.Okay, so that's the unit itself. But what games does it support?Well, here's a list of the games I tried out:Guitar Hero World Tour(PlayStation 3)Playstation 3 The Beatles: Rock Band(PlayStation 3)Guitar Hero Metallica(PlayStation 3)Guitar Hero Smash Hits(PlayStation 2)I tried these on my PlayStation 3 as well as my PlayStation 2 Slim, and the games worked on each of them without any problems whatsoever.Once I finally got my hands on a copy of Rock Band 1 (Thank you Fey for lending me your copy), I tried using this drum set and it thought I was hooking up a microphone. Other reviewers have found out the same cold, hard truth...Rock Band 1 does NOT work with these drums.I was also kind of surprised to see there wasn't a holder for the drum sticks. Everything else was designed so well!The main con to this drum set is the price, pure and simple. When the PlayStation 3 came along, many consumers found themselves with PlayStation 2 peripherals that couldn't be used anymore. This unit solves that problem because it works on both platforms with several different games.There are less costly drum sets out there, but some of them are reported to be made cheaply and not built to last. If you're willing to spend the extra money for a drum set that works on 2 game systems, this set will not disappoint - I'm very happy with Logitech products because they're made with gamers in mind. Even with the lack of support for Rock Band 1, I still love this drum set.Now that this review is done, I can go back and get the Beatles through Shea Stadium.

In my opinion it is offroad ACTION, and less of a racer. I know ACTION doesn't seem befitting of a game in which you drive, but there are too many problems to call it a real racer. Unless you are a big rig or a Monster truck, it feels as if the environment, the other vehicles, and YOUR OWN VEHICLE are all stacked up against you (not in the strategic good way). Let me bring you to a better understanding..........The environments are beautiful and in motion they're the best graphics I've seen besides Gran Turismo 5. Littered throughout the environments are water, ramps, and fire. Fire/lava is a universal hazard to be avoided by all, water cools your engine, but sometimes deep water can swallow up an ATV/bike. I'm sure you know this stuff. Also sprinkled throughout the environments are rocks. BIG and small. These rocks are obviously placed there as a fun little obstacle, but they have the potential to flip over your vehicle if you roll over it on one side. There are also changes in elevation and tiny hills that will flip over any vehicle. This makes it very hard to master the course for reasons I will further explain. Each con of this game branches out into another con unfortunately.These rocks are even more of a hazard when considering the OTHER RACERS. You'll be battered and beaten by larger vehicles, and sometimes even smaller ones. At times they even sacrifice their own vehicles to make sure you mess up. If you even TAP a monster truck's wheels or a big rig, the game will go into the slow mo crash sequence (that's why I never use a bike). The damage system while brilliant and extremely detailed is overly exaggerated. I had a rollover (from one of the rocks) while I was going pretty slow and my wheels popped off and all of the paneling and bumpers flew everywhere as well. If you roll over at all for any reason YOUR TIRES WILL FALL OFF. I dunno why, but almost every time I crash my tires fly off. 90% of the time the crash will be in slow mo, and oddly there is an explosion sound effect as if your engine blew up. Its EXTREMELY cool when you first buy the game, but after a month, it gets annoying. I wish there was an option to turn off the slow motion crash \"movies.\" The amount of times you'll crash in the first day will be in the hundreds, I guarantee it. Still to this day, I strongly believe that the crash physics are the best I have EVER SEEN. Nothing else comes close albeit hugely exaggerated. Your car will look like a crushed beer can after certain crashes.Which comes to my third con, YOUR VEHICLE. I've been playing Motorstorm for a good month now, and most of the time I crashed, I'd say 70 percent of the time is because of the vehicle's handling. I know this is an offroad game, but the vehicles slide around a lot more than they should. The guy even said it in the IGN review. They should call this game slidestorm. Seriously, you will slide all over the place and flip over easily while trying to avoid the Monster trucks and Big Rigs mowing you down. What's worse is that in a buggy you don't feel grounded. You feel like you're just going to fly into the air even if you go too fast. Simply racing becomes a burden, which is why many played the demo and just dismissed it as a stupid arcade racer. I can see why they did though unfortunately.You never feel completely safe if you're not in a Big Rig or Monster truck. Even the Monster truck feels like paper when driving next to a big rig. The tracks offer many paths for you to take advantage of your vehicle's strengths, but all of this flies out the window after experiencing the \"rubber-banding\" that everyone was talking about. I've heard the term \"rubber-banding\" in almost every professional review I've come across, and believe them.....ITS TRUE. On lvl 8 (which I don't believe I'll ever be able to beat BTW) driving effectively becomes impossible. You'll turbo past a monster truck just to see it right behind you 3 seconds later. Its a broken difficulty and so brutally hard that I stopped trying. If I crash in first place, I'll remain in at most 4th for the remainder of the race. In short, you have to drive perfect with all the the listed problems above. Please. Its near impossible!There is also no variety to the sounds for the vehicles. There are in total 8 engine sounds. 1 for EACH ENTIRE CLASS (atv, bike, bugg, big rig). My dirtbike sounded the same as by Harley-type motorcycle. Thst's just.......bad.......and sad.A good side to this game is being able to pick it up every now and then put it on medium difficulty, choose a track and time of day, sit back, and look at the beautiful graphics as you drive. On the harder difficulties the game becomes unplayable and is no fun at all for me. I'll admit, I got this because of my long wait for the reason I bought my PS3. Gran Turismo 5.One other HUGE asset to this game is eliminator mode. The true form of the game comes out in eliminator. You are basically fighting for your life to not be in last place as all of the cars around you are blowing up and crashing in the process of avoiding the dreaded last place. In this mode every 15 or so seconds the person in last place blows up. As you play this mode, you really get the feel for the \"Lunatics\" atmosphere the developers were trying to get across. The sense of urgency and the rush of adrenaline you get from this single mode really show the game's true colors................and wasted potential. I actually find this mode and the speed events (time trials) more strategic and fun than actually racing. Maybe its too many cars on the track, I dunno.I've juggled with the possibility that there are far too many cars on the track at once and its TOO MUCH CHAOS. There should be only 7 or 8 cars on a track not 12. The graphics on the vehicle models are OUTSTANDING. FEEL FREE TO ASK ANYTHING ABUT THE GAME THAT WASN'T ADDRESSED IN MY REVIEW. ANYTHING!

{"product_name":"B0050SXFKE","description":"","reviewerName":"olainez","summary":"Very good game that could be a masterpiece but it's not...","reviewText":"OK, let me start off by saying this is a fantastic game. Combat has been improved and it's so much fun to be Connor and his... well play it, I don't want to spoil it.Did I miss Ezio? Yes, I did, but remember we all met Ezio when he was born until he was a very old assassin (ACII, Brotherhood, Revelations.) But Connor, in my opinion, has his own identity and a good reason to become an assassin. He is not Ezio nor Altair, though. Unfortunately, even though the story starts in such a fantastic way (but a little slowly) I couldn't feel a real connection with his ... family (well, at the end yes... Wait until his haircut.)This game could be a masterpiece, because it has a lot of fantastic ideas. Nevertheless, when a game comes out every year this is what happens, it has little time to be more developed. AC III is a bunch of great ideas, but at the end loses weight.This game give us a five-six hour tutorial with a surprise when this tutorial ends. That's great, I was like WTF? But after that, when we meet Connor we are eager for see how this little child is going to become, perhaps, the last assassin of this trilogy? (5 games, actually.) But like I said, the game loses its weight.Don't get me wrong, it's not a mediocre experience, it's actually good but it could be so much better and so much developed. A longer sequence when he was little could be a terrific gift to have a stronger connection between Connor and his (a little SPOILER) mom. Is this important? It is for me, because he (minor SPOILERS) wants revenge for what templars did to her.Gameplay is awesome. Combat is very good and bloody, naval battles are a blast, fantastic! I didn't like this kind of quests, but in AC 3 they are terrific. Tutorial here is very good, because it's easy, fast, and simple.Tutorials, well they are inconsistent. The game has a slow beginning but the tutorial lacks of development. And what I didn't like at all it's when you start a quest and fail its 100% because they didn't explain from the very start what to do in order to complete in a 100%. Anyway, you can do it later or start it over again to complete and get this achievement/trophy.The ending? No spoilers here, it's not bad. I've read some reviews that states it sucks. I think it's OK, not great but it's not that bad. My favorite though, it's Brotherhood (ending) and my very favorite of the series it's Assassin's Creed II. This game, on the other hand, it's not better than those. It's good, but it's not great.Graphics are very good, as always. Unfortunately, it also has some issues and glitches that make you start a quest again more than once. But it's not big deal, but they are there.PS3 version comes with a code for four exclusive missions. That's great, 4 missions more. An extra hour? No, you'll complete them in 20 to 35 minutes. SPOILERS, the missions unlock as soon you get to NY. Try not to do it until you realize what George Washington did. Are ps3 exclusive missions good? They are not bad but very generic, and they give you a little or maybe nothing to the main story. No trophies for those missions though.OK, overall this game is a good way to say ?goodbye? to Desmont, or maybe not. It's so much better than Revelations, but not the best of the series. If you're are a fan, it's a must buy. If you're new... hmmm you should play previous games to understand the whole story.8/10 maybe 8.5/10, because AC3 has some holes that could be filled and they aren't. Glitches are a pain but don't worry, you'll finish the game if you are patient with no problem. You will enjoy the game, it's good. I'm a little sad it's not as great as I thought when I first saw Connor on E3. But I'm happy I played it.I think you should buy this game when the price drops because it worth $60 with the $29.99 season pass for having a better experience. There are lots to do here (side quests), but the 12 sequences for the main story are not more than 15 hours.I really like homestead developing, it reminded me Villa Auditore. Hunting is good too, but Red Dead Redemption is better here. Like I said, great ideas, but they needed a little more development to have a masterpiece.Enjoy the game, it's very good and you have plenty of things to do. Multiplayer is good too, so you have a game for a while. Platinum trophy is not too hard to get for those trophy hunters. After 25 hours, and completing main story you'll have more than 60% of the trophies.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2012"}

As with other games I review, I like to look at the technical aspects of a game and save the review of plot points for someone else.The control scheme in this game is good, and I think that every button the dual shock2 controller has been utilized to the fullest extent.  The attack buttons and combinations are easy to remember and it is easy to access magic and defense and combo attacks within short succession.The frame rate is great, smooth game play with the most minimal of load times between some areas.  The in-game movies were polished and added to the story...like others have said, this game was like playing an interactive movie...the story was not the greatest, but the material was fresh and fun and overall entertaining.This game spent something like 3 years in development and production.  3 years.  That is a long time.  My only beef is that if a game has been in development for that long, how come the end result only takes me 9 hours to beat?  I felt short changed, somewhat cheated out of my 49.99 or whatever it cost on release day.  In fact, I traded the game in two days later for store credit at my local EB store.The replay value is almost non-existent...even with the addition on challenges that get you new armor and the addition of an even harder \"god\" mode.  The game is still essentially the same as when you played it the first time.  Just a bit harder.  To me, that is cheap.  I dont want to replay the same game with harder enemies.  I want something new, new areas, new enemies, new weapons, new stuff!  I want something as fresh and progressive as the game itself.My only other beef is with the nudity included in the game.  I am a 25 year old male, I am an adult.  But for some reason, digital breasts just dont add anything to this game.  To me it shows that developers are pushing the envelope for the sake of pushing it.  Nudity did not one thing to add to this game.  The fact that it is in there only shows that the developer and publishing house thought it would make more testosterone ridden teens want to buy their game.  For me, it is an insult.  It is a game...nothing more.  Your graphics engine is more impressive with lighting effects and particle effects that with the inclusion of disporportionate women who wear either nothing or next to nothing.As a parent, I would not buy this game for my child.  I would not buy this game for the price they are asking for it.  As a gamer, I expect to feel as if I have gotten my money's worth in my purchase...with this game I do not feel as if I did.  Rent this game...you will beat it in no time.I liked this game, but for some reason, I just didnt feel as if it warranted a purchase on my part.  Parents...this game should be kept away from younger children and those under the \"M\" rating age limit.  It was definatley marketed at an older audience, but had nothing substantial enough to offer.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2005"}

Sherman \"The Critic\"","summary":"A Plumber's Tail","reviewText":"If there's one thing I've learned from watching all the Batmans, Ninja Turtles and yes, Marios of the past decade is that reinvention is necessary to keep new generations interested in old things.  Having only played 'linear' Mario games (and trying out Mario Galaxy for just a few minutes), the free-roaming concept of recent titles is still new to me.  Super Mario 3D Land tries bringing the best of both worlds, providing open-ended three-dimensional areas either contained by walls or surrounded by bottomless depths.Mario, the plumber who doesn't actually 'plumb' anything, still rounds up coins and mushrooms (with some flagpole dancing thrown in) to rescue a princess who's actually someplace else.  At least now you can slap around all those Toads who told you she's in another castle.  Another bonus is that you can also reserve one power-up, tapping the touch screen on the 3DS to activate it.  And you get a lot to work with, too; Super Mushrooms, Fire Flowers, Starmen, the new Boomerang Suit, and the classic Tanooki Leaf (which everyone in the game seems to be using).Once I started playing, I've breezed through the first 2 levels before I started losing lives.  In fact 3D Land makes it hard to actually lose.  When you're on a losing streak, you're offered an Invincibility Leaf that makes you impervious to everything except steep cliffs.  If that's not enough (and believe me, it's possible), a P-Wing item is added to help the player completely bypass the course and reach the goal.  Both are just options you can ignore, but would you?The only real challenge 3D Land offers is to collect each and every Star Coin to unlock the second half of the game.  You'll still need 'em to access new worlds and in some cases, you can't move on to the next level without 'em.  Fortunately, StreetPass offers special mystery boxes from other players so you can grab more stuff.  But chances are you'll still have to grind through lands you've already conquered to gather the required number of coins.For the most part, I still enjoyed taking this out for a spin.  And if not for the release of New Super Mario Bros. 2 (which is totally linear and right up my alley), I'd strongly urge any Mario fan to do the same.  Otherwise, you might want to wait for the princess to learn self-defense.This game is rated E for Everyone: Mild Violence.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2013"}

I originally purchased this 3G/Wi-Fi Bundle and within a week I had noticed at certain points while using the system in low lighting the screen would have weird black blotches. Thinking something was wrong I returned this back to Amazon. I then looked up about that issue and it's seems that's a common defect of OLED screens and that they all have it. I then repurchased the Vita and again same issue but since it's natural I dealt with it as it only is effected on the black colors. I beat Uncharted on it and that's pretty much it. Never used the 3G as it's pointless and expensive. Didn't use the Vita for a while after that but I carried it places with me and always check the PSN store to see if new games had come out. Eventually I dropped it and with the disgust following I sold the Vita. Months later the Vita had once again come with something I wanted - Assassins Creed Liberation and on a black friday sale the price was to low for me not to bite. Played the game for a little while but eventually got bored since it had no real ties to the actually main series. From the time I didn't have the console til now games have come out and I've purchased and resold most of them as they were not up to the standards a great system like this should have and at their price points. The Vita is at the same point the Wii U is at and that console just launched, such an empty library. Right now I have Persona 4 Golden and Zero Escape and those both feel like the same game with mostly just story telling not bad but not quite what I want with this console at the moment. Recently a game finally came out I'm interested in but for some reason it's only purchasable from the PSN store and I only have a 4GB memory card that was included and refuse to pay $100 for a memory card. The vita needs more time. That's my final opinion.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2013"}

It seemed like such a different style of game for a Nintendo franchise like Mario and l thought it was especially cool that Luigi got his own game. Going after *gasp!* ghosts in a haunted mansion seemed scary for a little kid at the time. Luigi's Mansion went on to become one of my favourite Gamecube titles. When the 3DS came out a few titles certainly seemed interesting enough and maybe worth shelling out the cash for, but when Luigi's Manson Dark Moon was announced l was in. This game is one the main reason l bought a 3DS.The story is very simple: Luigi comes to professor E.Gadd's aid when the ghosts start acting up again and reluctantly heads back to face the ghosts. First off, it really is a true successor to the Gamecube game. It's one that fans who enjoyed the first will pick up and feel right in their element and that will grab the new generation as well. It looks very much like the first, the graphics are comparable and it's certainly one of the better looking 3DS games and the 3D looks good as well. The controls are fairly straightforward, in the first the Gamecube's second analog stick was used a lot and here you use the buttons.The ghost are a little more challenging in this one. In the places that they hide and some of them even throw things at you! A few new features including an upgraded Poltergust 3000 (it's 5000 here) add a freshness to the game and are  actually really cool features (l'm not going to spoil anything). The environments are fun to explore, and l like to examine every bit of it. I think capturing the ghost in Dark Moon is even more fun, they are more comical as the cut scenes confirm.This time around it's a little less free-roaming (even if there is still a lot of that). Personally l am not a big fan of going back to previous areas l've already completed which you'll have to do here. You also get interrupted by the professor a little too much for my liking which does tend to get a little annoying. There are multiple mansions in Dark Moon which makes it a longer game than the first.The game lacks a checkpoint feature, if you lose all your health you will have the redo the mission.There is very little bad to be said about Luigi's Manson Dark Moon, it's an excellent continuation upon the first and the move from console to portable was executed in great fashion. Kudos to Nintendo. I'm glad that Nintendo decided to do a full sequel rather than a 3D port. I could see this game being a little hard for kids since it's basically a lot of puzzle solving that demand a lot of thought and patience. I'm an adult and had hard times figuring out some of the puzzles myself. All in all, Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon is an excellent sequel, will appeal to fans of the original and was well worth the wait and gaming experience. It's one of my favourite titles in my 3DS library. 4.5* stars","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2014"}

And yes, I have them all.  :)This time Lego returns to us with Pirates of the Caribbean!  The fun and humor that you've come to know and love in the wordless grunts and gestures used to convey the story is back.  The characters that you're familiar with are all there with all the mannerisms, down to the detail of Jack's shambling \"not-all-there\" gait.The puzzles and action that are also a part of every Lego game are here as well - with some rather new, notable features:- Jack's compass is an element in each level.  If there is a special item to be found, activating his compass reveals the path in blue footstep squares like bread crumbs to the treasure he is looking for.  If it's buried, your trusty dog can be used to dig it up.- Characters are all switchable, as before, but one of the new (and quite welcome!) features for me was the character wheel which allows you to choose WHICH character you'd like instead of tapping endlessly / by proximity to get the character you want.- Some levels feature \"sticky\" elements that won't let you fall helplessly as was previously advertised on gaming sites.I do have some complaints, however:- Level design is still frustrating at times.  If your jumps are \"not so\" or if you scoot 1 mm to the left, you may find yourself missing your destination and sighing grievously.- After how many years...and still no online co-op modes?  It's 2011, Traveller's Tales games.  Can we get on the ball here?Despite level design (and if you're used to Lego games, you'll be used to this) and lack of online support, it's still a fun roller-coaster ride through all 4 (yes, you read that right) Pirates movies including:- Curse of the Black Pearl- Dead Man's Chest- At World's End- On Stranger Tides (yep, you get to have a sneak peek at what the next movie might be about - otherwise, just play the other 3 until you see it)The other debate is...get it on PS3 or Wii?  Most of my other Lego games are on the Wii, but it does look fantastic on the PS3 in HD (and for the same retail price, mind you).  I find that the aiming in the PS3 (when Will throws his ax, for example) is a lot easier than I thought it would be and I don't miss the Wii functionality much as a result.  However, I'm sure that the game plays equally well on the Wii so it's completely up to you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-10-2011"}

And, to an extent, it is a treasure hunter's dream. What it's not, however, is anything new or multi-player friendly. The way the split screen action functions will eventually make you nauseous. Often times the game loads entirely too many characters in the same small span of space, depth perception is nearly non-existent, and crossing certain obstacles (such as the tiny, glitch-ridden bridges) can be far more frustrating than is ever called for. The game has some charm. And, once you've played through it once, it can be fun to go back through the stages with the characters necessary to collect all of the treasures. But the first playthrough is a messy one that you'll want to break from more than you would with most other Lego games. Some parts of certain levels are really clever, but the controlling in this game feels half-realized and the overall experience suffers as a result. It isn't a bad game. It just isn't the best. It may also be a bit too complicated for the younger audiences the game aims to please. You'll often be juggling more than 4 characters, all with different powers, which have to be used independently in order to progress. In short, don't expect something fluid and frustration-free. Buy it used if you simply have to buy it at all. And be prepared to play it alone. Co-op makes one feel (pun intended) seasick.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2011"}

It is a good balancer for online play. In addition to the new warthog, you now can use the banshee in multiplayer play. It even is the fuel rod projectile from campaign mode. That's all the things added to the game.The major flaw of the game is that it seems slowed down. You don't seem as into the game because it seems slower. Not by that much but, too me, noticeable.

When you return, you are put on trial for treason, but after you escape, you find a new portal and go to the future, circa AD 2300, which has become a desolate wasteland thanks to a creature called Lavos.  You vow to save the planet's future, even if you will never live to see it.  Along the way, you team up with Robo from the future, Ayla, from 65 million BC, and Frog, from AD 600.  There is also a wizard named Magus who you fight in 600, but then you meet him again in 12,000 BC and are given the option to have him join you, which I highly suggest.This game has tons of spells, especially since you can combine turns to perform double, and even triple, spells.  The side quests are great too, and you should do them all if you want to get each character's ultimate weapon.If you've never played this game before, do yourself a favor and play it, because this is one of the greatest RPGs ever!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2002"}

Weapons of mass destruction, deployed with complete impunity razed the land in the blink of an eye. The dire situation forced the two opposing factions to negotiate a cease-fire and an agreement was quickly reached, but although the war may have ended, its effects remained. With the deteriorating environment, Earth's population was drastically reduced and those who survived lived a confined existence trapped in underground cities. Eventually countries joined together to form the Greater United Nations and turned their eyes skyward, to space. With the establishment of the USTA, the Universal Science and Technology Administration, man began to seek new worlds beyond the stars.AD 2087...The first year of the spacedate (SD) calendar. Thanks to the success of Professor Trillas Bachstein's warp drive experiments, mankind's dream of a spacebourne existence has inched closer to reality and the USTA secretly began to implement its SRF project, the Space Reconnaissance Force. Now it is SD 0010, and the first official SRF mission and your adventure has begun.CharactersPlayers ofStar Ocean: The Last Hopewill meet and interact with a wealth of characters from different parts of the galaxy, each with their own history and weapons of choice. Just a few of the more prominent characters to familiarize yourself with include:Edge MaverickAlthough generally possessing good judgment, this young Earthling commander of the maiden deep space voyage of the SRF ship the Calnus, can be reckless. His signature weapon is the sword.Faize Sheifa BelethA young Eldarian committed to etiquette and logic, and capable of astounding feats of engineering, Faize is always honorable of those possessing abilities he lacks. His signature weapon is the rapier.Reimi SaionjiThe kind and levelheaded navigator of the Calnus, Reimi was born in an aristocratic Saionji family and has a shared history with Edge back on Earth. Her signature weapon is the bow.Lymle Lemuri PhiOrphaned on her home planet of Lemrick long ago, Lymle is mischievous, but friendly and inexplicably retains the appearance of a young girl. Her signature weapon is the wand.Gameplay and CombatAlthough Edge Maverick is the main character inStar Ocean: The Last Hope, players will of course experience gameplay action in the form of a number of different characters and utilize the signature attacks assigned to each. The game features a real-time combat system which allows for up to four party members to remain active in battle at a time. Improvements to the game's combat system include 'Rush Mode,' where players can switch out active members of their combat groups for reserve members in real-time; 'Sight In/Sight Out' which allows for timed evasive and counter moves against enemies; and the BEAT (Battle Enhancement Attribute Type) system, through which players can change a character's fighting style at will. Other actions players will master through gameplay include piloting of the spaceship Calnus, a first in theStar Oceanseries; item creation in the form of weapons, healing items and accessories; and Private Actions (PAs), a cause and effect relationship between character in-game actions and the acquisition of new abilities and scenarios. Through the increased flexibility mastery of all these skills provides, players should be able to more easily increase their team and individual team member's combat experience and status, and so unlock more advanced combat styles and linked combinations.Key Game Features:Series prequel-Star Ocean: The Last Hopeis a prequel in the classic series, combining sci-fi and fantasy elements, spanning multiple planets and the vastness of space itself to recount the origins of the Star Ocean universe.Exciting Battles- Exhilarating combat expands upon the franchise's famous real-time battle system, including the amazing graphics and visual effects only possible on Xbox 360.Compelling Scenes- The game features breathtaking CG movies by Visual Works, the cutting-edge studio whose previous work includes cutscenes for the acclaimed Final Fantasy RPG series.","reviewerName":"Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!)","summary":"A Very Entertaining Game If Given The Chance","reviewText":"Despite the reviews of how poorly the graphics were and how bad the voice cast were I still decided to take the chance with this game and am delighted to have made that choice.  While the graphics aren't on par with some other games like FF13 or Heavy Rain the graphics are still very good and incredible to see especially the cut scenes in the game, also while it is true that there are one or two of the voice cast who could work on the acting skills for the most part the cast were very talented in their character roles a lot more than what's to be expected from some peoples points of view.  The one and only thing that is somewhat of an annoyance is that the game does come in three disc and while it's not to problematic it's still a little annoying when you have to keep changing disc each time you go from one world to another that is probably the biggest pro that the PS3 version will have on the differences between the two(Plus the added Japanese voice cast track of course).  The fighting game style reminded me a little of another Square Enix game that I recently bought Indefinite UnDiscovery where instead of being turn based combat you can control you characters during combat which I truly enjoyed with this game.  So for RPG fans an the like is the game worth getting?,  I'd advise trying a demo if you can find it first to see if it's one you truly like that's all I think anyone can say because almost everyone's going to have their own opinion on their experience with the game but it's ultimately going to be up to the person who's playing the game itself to see if it's truly enjoyable for them....","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00020LZAM","description":"Jak 3concludes the Jak and Daxter trilogy with a truly plot-driven adventure game filled with friendship, betrayal, death, and a long-awaited understanding of the Precursor civilization that has, until now, remained a mystery.One year has passed since Jak and Daxter saved Haven City from Kor and the attacking Metal Heads, yet Haven City is still immersed in deadly chaos as three groups fight for control of the streets. The people of Haven City have grown to distrust Jak's dark powers, and as rumors boil of Jak's ties with Krew and Kor, the city blames Jak for its current woeful circumstances. When the palace is destroyed by a surprise Metal Head attack, even Ashelin cannot protect Jak as the High Council's power broker, Count Veger, forces Jak into banishment to the desolate Wasteland. Jak is flown to the harsh island and dumped. With Daxter and Pecker bravely by his side, the three begin their next adventure where the battle for the city has just begun.Five times the size of Haven City, the Wasteland is a desert environment with multiple areas including mines and a volcano. Given the enormity and variance in terrain, vehicles play a large role as off-road transportation is introduced, fueled by a true-to-life physics engine. With a rugged new look and suited with armor, Jak is also equipped with an arsenal of new weapons with upgradeable mods that enable players to increase their firepower and enjoy the freedom to strategize and activate their arsenal at any time.As Jak has been exposed to Light Eco, players can now experience Jak's magnificent transformation to Light Jak. With a glowing electric blue aura and a massive wing span, Light Jak introduces new move sets, including the ability to glide great distances, emit an energy to block enemy attack, and power up at anytime, all of which provide the player with a sense of being invincible. Dark Jak also returns with more capabilities, forcing Jak to find a balance between light and dark.Additionally, game developer Naughty Dog continues to push the genre forward with the introduction of new technology. For the first time in the franchise, enemies feature realistic ragdoll physics, which will allow gamers to witness a unique death for each enemy that is killed. Naughty Dog has also implemented independent cloth movement technology and enhanced the enemy artificial intelligence (AI) with wall climbing and smart formation capabilities.","reviewerName":"blackaciddevil","summary":"Jak 3.............","reviewText":"I'll admit, I've been a fan of this series since it first came out. To be honest, I'm a fan of all Naughty Dog's games. Yet, Jak II left me seriously considering abandoning the series. Not that it was a bad game(by any means). It was just there were moments in the game that were so insanely difficult that it left me cussing like a madman. Fortunately, I stuck it out and kept playing and it turned out to be an even better game than the first. Now, the third is upon us and I'm really impressed with it. You can play as both Dark Jak and Light Jack with new move sets, such as the ability to glide over great distances and more. There's an awesome arsenal of new weapons with upgradeable mods. Enemies fall with realistic ragdoll physics and that's not all. You get to drive a variety of vehicles, amongst other things. Sadly, this game concludes the story that began with The Precursor Legacy but it's good to see how the story ends. Naughty Dog made the series look even better with this one. Action/Platformer fans are really going to love this one.As of my writing this review, Naughty Dog has a PSP Daxter game planned, which I'm seriously looking forward to. Plus, Jak X:  Combat Racing. If you're a big Jak and Daxter fan...definitely look for these games when they debut.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMB3","description":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timemay be the greatest single-player video game ever created in any genre. It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide. WithThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Nintendo has come up with an all-consuming adventure title that will provide days of engrossing gameplay.--Eric FredricksonPros:Best single-player video gameFreedom to explore a rich, complex worldHelpful fairy guide gives hintsCharming, humorous, lighthearted, yet challengingCons:Some puzzles can be frustratingOnly one saved game per player--don't save when you're stuck!Much more fun with Rumble Pack","reviewerName":"newfound32","summary":"THE BEST GAME FOR 64","reviewText":"This is truely the best game for 64 becuase link is so cool.

With that said, this is a good game. Incredibly scary for any first time player. I'll admit that I was awake for a few nights after playing. The game even suggests cutting out your lights and putting on headphones to make your playing experience better (this is VERY creepy). Anyways, the plot tells the story of a trucker named Travis Grady. You play as Travis throughout his time in Silent Hill and manage to learn some of the more... frightening parts of his life. Needless to say, the plot is quite creepy by itself. As for the game play, it's not too hard. In most cases, it's simply knowing how to get around, avoid the monsters within the town and figure out the puzzles. If anyone has played Resident Evil before then you know what I mean about there being puzzles throughout the game. Graphics and sound are quite good especially for the PSP as well. Be warned that some of the \"Other World\" scenes are very dark and can be hard to see at times. My only complaint is that the game is a bit short (5-6hrs at the most), but there are a few endings so that adds some fun in replaying the game. Overall, it's probably one of my favorite PSP games and definitely one to keep you addicted. Give it a shot.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2010"}

They added  improved enemy searching A.I.This game is a definate improvment in enemy A.I. They will search for you with Flares & Flashlights and when Sam whistles they will say things like 'Im not falling for that trap' or 'do you think Im that stupid'.They will also revive there knocked out comrades if they are found.The enemies will also notice lights that have been turned off and they turn them back on and search area.Also if you shoot the lite out they will say things like 'what was that' and then investigate.They will also notice hacked doors or broken locks and become suspicious.They will also notice doors that werent previously open (if you leave them open).They will notice candles that have been blown out by you,and they will re-lite them.Sam  has alot of cool New moves ,make sure before you play the first level check out the training video to learn the new moves.The very reason I bought my Xbox was for the First Splinter Cell.And its my fav Xbox series.Chaos Theory is a must own game ,with excellent Online & Versus play and excellent graphics,you really cant go wrong with this game.Sam now has added Knife attacks while hanging from a ceiling pipe and can throw enemies over railings,he can also cut through plastic sheeting to advance his position.There's enemy Tanks now and also a Flying drone type thing(on one level only) that scans the area with a red search beam ,it basicly a flying turret with a helicopter blade.The shadow lighting effect are once again execellent .Sam has better hacking abilities and can hack wirelessly from a distance as long as the computer is booted up.The gun now has a Launcher attachment for gas grenades & explosive grenades and also a shotgun attachment.Im am a little dissapointed that in Stealth choice you dont get the Silent sniper attachment.But you can still zoom 1.5x ,its just not the 3.0 x zoom that the 20mm Assault choice has.The strongest element was being able to hit targets with one head shot in 3.0x zoom with the Silenced Rifle,now you have to get closer than the previous 2 games.But these are very small differences that dont take away how excellent this game is.Splinter Cell Is definatly one of the best all-time console series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2005"}

Could have been brilliant, painful to play, agonizingly slow","reviewText":"I pre ordered like everyone else.  Got the game, and its buggy from the install.  Takes half a day to just get it to run (you have to launch it from the binaries folder, not the config screen, which crashes 100% of the time)Once you get it to run, well, its another skanky console port.  I can live with the 3rd person view, thats not too bad.  But the controls are so clunky, you simply cannot get anywhere.  Also, there is a quick save that does NOT work (it says, \"quick save failed\" 90% of the time).  Turns out, you CANNOT save during a firefight, which is the only time most people WANT to save.  Dumb, just dumb.As far as game play, its a mixed bag.  The story line is so so, seems like a mishmash of Doom3/Halo2/Advent Rising/et al rehashed at some level, but its decent.  Voice acting is above par as well.  However, the weapons simply suck, as they take 30 seconds to recharge (while you get killed), and the whole \"level up\" thing makes no sense so you can't seem to get anywhere.  Also, in the grand tradition of console games, the action does things for you, like take cover, or make dumb decisions for you about where you stand (and get stuck).  Its that thing that made Gears of War frustrating on the PC, and its here yet again.  I find myself mashed against a wall, when I didn't want to be there.  Aiming is also assisted, and it makes absolutely ZERO sense most of the time, especially because you cannot hit anything anywayAlso, using the scope on the assault rifle shakes so much, you cannot hit a thing.  In many games, there is a breath/calm/stabilize function for scope use, or you can crouch to steady the scope, but not here.  Totally useless 80% of the time.  What were they thinkingIt has an inventory system, that basically makes no sense, and the pamphlet that comes with it seems to be an even dumber downed version of the console version, with less information.Some folks are talking about the grainy look to it, but that can be switched off in the options menu by de-selecting the \"film grain\" look button (why any game developer would waste their time with this whole thing is beyond me)All in all, its another half baked console port.  We are all tiring of them to be honest, as one can tell by the zillions of harsh and painful reviews for console ports.  The developers just drop the ball nearly 100% of the time for whatever reason.I don't mind many of the console action cues, or some of the basic control crossovers, but when there is ZERO effort put into making the PC versions work like a PC version can, its a huge letdown (just see the bloody aweful Lost Planet for the PC, nearly unplayable)  Mass Effect is not a total dud port, but what was delivered to us is a major letdown, as the developer touted how much PC focus was going to go into the game.  Oh well, another $50 down the drainADDED MORE 6/6/2008I have tried to like this game.  But alas, it was not meant to be.  The designers simply were not thinking.  Each firefight is painfully slow and repetitive.  You cannot hit a thing, the weapons do not work, you cannot really hide, jump, or any evasive maneuvers.  The story is very VERY verbose, which is ok I guess, but you have to hear it over and over and over again because it always comes before a firefight, and you cannot save during the talking or shooting, so you have to listen over and over and over.  Simply atrocious.Bioware knows they have an issue here, and they are deleting posts from their forums where people complain, and basically pretending nothing is wrong, which makes matters worse.I tried, but failed to let this game grow on me.  It is another example of the \"professional reviewers\" giving high scores to games of advertisers, where the game does not even come close.  Crysis was another trainwreck like this, where players hated it, and reviewers said it was the next coming of the messiah.  Uhuh","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2008"}

Period.After Gothic 3 I spat everytime I heard the name PB or JoWood. I got the demo - an hour later I was downloading the game.Like others have said, if you liked (the working versions of) Gothic, you're gonna love this. Open world, lots of quests that can be handled from different angles.Fighting sucks (*at first*) once you train str - dmg output increasesTrain up your weapon style and you get more moves, attack and dogdge fastrer.People act like they're supposed to wash up on shore, grab a seashell or whatever and start whippin ass...the whole 'lev 1 no attack power, no combat skills, no armor' goes over their head. I dont get that...just like anything you're new at, you wont be very good. At first. It gets better, alot better.Ya, combat is hard, but so is life! Get some skills and str and it gets easier, way easier.Quests in this game present you with a problem and with a solution, how you handle the in-between is up to you.Through stealth, combat, or the face to face approach there are many different ways to skin a cat in this game.This game has a lot of little animations that you dont see game makers doing anymore:Unearthing treasure chests, hitting water pipes, cooking, alchemy, lockpick mini game etc.Like I said from line one: Dont go into a (good) RPG expecting high end graphics. Go play an FPS. With that said, I dont have a problem with the grpahics, in fact, I kinda like them. There's a warm feeling about the environment the way the light filters through the foliage of the bandit camp or watching the sun set in Harbortown.  IMO, the graphics are not super hi res nor are they terrible. For this genre, they work just fine (for me).The game has a learning curve to it, but its mainly learning the basics (block, attack, hotkeys), and paying attention to what the NPCs are saying. For the most part, named NPCs are not speaking just to speak, so listen to the stuff they're saying. There is no mini map, and no hand-holding on quests (no flashies pointing you directly to point B, no 'walk 10 steps and get more exp' here). You gotta hike and learn the environment.There's a lot of hack n slash, but not in a diablo sense. The majority of your exp comes from solving the problems from the different factions and the sidequests within each town.The beauty of this game, imo, is the flexibility you have to accomplish tasks at hand.Onto the Bad:  I wanted to give this game a 5 but it's almost an EXACT replica of Gothic1/2 so that's a star off for originality. I said graphics dont count in an RPG but even Im not naive enough to not acknowledge the age of these graphics and its almost 2010 so another star off.However, I still remember PBs last product (Gothic 3) and the total abortion that turned out to be and this is a total 180 from it in terms of stability and gameplay, so another star added.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2009"}

The difference here is that this new model is quite a bit smaller than  its older brother, and quite a bit cuter, too.The system is made up of a 32-bit, 34-MHz RISC processor with 16 Mbits of main  memory, 8 Mbits of graphics memory, 24-channel stereo sound, double-speed CD-ROM  drive, and one Dual Shock analog controller.

{"product_name":"B001B1W3GG","description":"BioShock is an innovative role-playing shooter from Irrational Games who was named IGN&#8217;s 2005 Developer of the Year. BioShock immerses players into a war-torn underwater utopia, where mankind has abandoned their humanity in their quest for perfection.","reviewerName":"M. Fulkerson","summary":"Nearly perfect game","reviewText":"Bioshock is a FANTASTIC game.  I would give this game four and a half stars if I could, but I definitely don't feel like it deserves a full five stars.  The first 95% of it is about as enjoyable as video games can get, and I could not put my controller down for two straight days until I finished it.  I know this game has been out for quite some time and there are many other well written reviews about it, but I thought I'd take a moment to point out its many strong points, and it's very few weak spots.First of all, the premise to this game is such an original and fresh idea that it's impossible to not get sucked into its unique world.  I love the idea of a city existing under the sea, and the art direction to the levels in the game are beautiful to look at.  I found myself stopping in the middle of gameplay to just check out the surroundings.  The level of detail in the graphics is painstaking and beautiful to behold.  Another hugely entertaining touch is the music.  How often do you get to run around in a nightmarish world with \"Danny Boy\" playing in the background?  Bioshock avoids a lot of horror game cliches by leaving out the cornball fright music and using authentic 30's, 40's and 50's music.  It's a very odd juxtaposition that keeps you on your toes, and it really adds to the depth of the game.  Another cool aspect of Bioshock is that I never felt strapped for ammo or weapons.  One of my pet peeves about games is leaving you without ammo or supplies that are necessary to move forward.  It's more of an annoyance to go searching for stuff that should be made available in the first place.  There is tons of stuff to search through, and I always felt that I was collecting something worth while whenever I searched through a barrel, corpse, safe, or whatever.  Another thing I particularly enjoyed was the voice acting.  It isn't out of this world, but the little audio diaries you collect throughout the game really draw you into the levels you're roaming in, and hearing these broken people and their isolated voices talking about the city of Rapture makes the game that much more tense.  The idea of Big Daddy and the Little Sisters is great as well.  It's such an original idea, and it never got boring fighting the Big Daddies and then rescuing the little girls.The length of the game was decent, I'd say I put between 10 and 15 hours of gameplay into it.  Load times weren't excessive, and the game allows you to save anywhere which is always a bonus.I have one very minor and one major quibble about the game, and I hope they fix them for Bioshock 2.  The minor quibble I have concerns some of the battle scenes.  There are several points during the game where they send four or five \"slashers\" after you, and deciphering what is going on can be difficult.  I don't mind being disoriented in a video game, after all, this is a horror title, but there were times it was more annoying than challenging.  I would get stuck in tight spaces and I'd have the slashers on all sides before I had a clue what was happening.My bigger complaint, though, concerns the ending.  The ending to this game was terrible!  The final boss battle was incredibly short and easy, and then the game just ends with hardly any fanfare or closure.  It's frustrating because the developers did such a great job of writing during the entire length of the game, and then at the end they just seem to give up.  Take my word for it, once you get to the final boss scene don't even bother fighting him.  It isn't worth your time, so you should just consider getting to the final boss as enough of an ending.  There needs to be a payoff for your efforts, and I feel that far too many video games don't put any thought into the ending of games, and Bioshock is no different.  They don't even leave anything open-ended in case they wanted you to think there would be another game.  Of course, we all know that Bioshock 2 is almost here, but still, they need to take the time to come up with a satisfactory conclusion to the story.All in all, I couldn't stop playing this game.  It's definitely one of the 25 best games I've ever played, and I would whole-heartedly recommend it to any gamer out there!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2009"}

As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed. Taken together all these changes add up to more action, more fun and moreDead Spacefor players on the Wii.Key Game FeaturesAn All-New Prequel Exclusively for the WiiFollow the lives of several different Aegis VII colony members as they carve a bloody path to survival.Meet a new cast of characters, destroy fearsome new enemies, and wield brutal new weapons.Real TerrorStunning graphics, panic-inducing audio, and a frenetic first-person perspective thrust you headlong into the terror.Play through an engrossing, interactive horror movie experience that raises the bar for storytelling in video games.Intuitive ControlsStrategically dismember your enemies with pinpoint control using the Wii Remote.Wield a powerful arsenal of abilities and weapons to freeze enemies, manipulate gravity with telekinesis, solve puzzles, and fight off attacks from every direction in zero gravity.Co-Op GameplayTeam up with a friend to fight off the invasion on the USG Ishimura with jump-in cooperative play.Combine efforts on engineering puzzles or determine specific roles to create a unique experience with each play session.","reviewerName":"Halicon5","summary":"Yet another quality on-rails shooter for the Wii","reviewText":"ExtractionDead Space: Extraction is a quality on-rails light-gun shooter, which is exactly what the Wii needed.  Sarcasm aside, it isn't revolutionary or cutting edge, but it succeeds at everything it attempts to accomplish.  Basically, it's the same exact thing we've seen in Resident Evil: Chronicles and House of the Dead.  What the game does, it does well, and if you're into this sort of thing, you'll probably enjoy the heck out of it.  If you don't like on-rails shooters, you probably won't enjoy the game.  I would have rated this game higher, but it really feels like watching smartest kid in the class just scrape by with the bare minimum amount of effort.  It is definitely good, but the game and license have so much more potential than we see here.PROS:+++ Great graphics.  This game definitely pushes the Wii's graphical capabilities.+++ Great sound.  Very moody.+++ Decent story that fills you in on what happened before the original Dead Space game.+++ Precise shooting controls.CONS:--- The first-person camera is way too jumpy at times and can be frustrating.  I managed to get motion sickness a few times as well.--- Compared to the first Dead Space game, this is a much shallower offering.GAMEPLAY: As stated previously, this is a light-gun shooter.  The game presents itself in a first-person perspective and handles all movement for you.  You use the pointer, pull the trigger and stuff dies.  The game takes great pride in the dismemberment mechanic, encouraging players to shoot legs and arms of enemies off with wild abandon since head shots and body shots are of little use against most enemies in the game.  The game offers a wide assortment of weapons with different firing modes, which gives quite a bit of variety.  Every weapon can be upgraded by grabbing upgrade powerups as your progress through the levels.  What's really great about the game is the drop-in/drop-out two-player co-op mode.  Whenever you have to kill zomb... er... necromorphs, it's always more fun to do it with a friend.GRAPHICS: Amazingly good, for a Wii game.  No where near as slick as the XBox 360 game, but this game is a stand-out title on the Wii.  Unfortunately you will spend a lot of time being led about in the dark and the color palette is a bit dreary in an effort to give the impression of an oppressive horror scene, but it all looks very good.VALUE: The main game is pretty short, but like many other light-gun shooters, the levels offer branching paths that encourage you to replay the levels to see parts that you have missed.  Additionally, there are some entertaining challenge modes that add several hours of time to the game.  Not a bad package as a whole.  The two-player co-op mode definitely adds to the value of this title.STORY AND PRESENTATION: Mostly good.  The story is entertaining enough, although it is a bit campy and predictable.  Seriously, the game opens up with two characters planning their date for the evening, and I knew immediately who was going to die.  Rule #37 for surviving a zomb... err... necromorph invasion: don't make any evening plans with a member of the opposite sex.  Predictability aside, the story is decent and well-presented with some dark humor sprinkled about.  If I have any serious complaints though it is that I don't know of any way to skip the cut-scenes, which get a bit long-winded at times.  You'll probably find yourself thinking it would be nice if the characters would quit yakking and get back to letting you shoot stuff.COMPARISONS TO DEAD SPACE: I thoroughly enjoyed the first Dead Space game on the 360, despite its many flaws.  The choice of making Extraction an on-rails shooter is decent enough, especially considering the first game was very linear as well, but I would have preferred having gameplay more akin to the original.  The story is presented better and the characters have a bit more depth, especially compared to Isaac, the main character from the first game who may as well been a murderous puppet in a space suit.  I would have much rather preferred the upgrade system from the first game, because the weapon upgrade system in Extraction just feels shallow and lame in comparison.  Extraction is a decent addition to Dead Space brand, but I can't help but feel that a lot of short-cuts were taken when designing the game.Overall, I recommend this game to fans of the on-rails shooter genre since this is one of the best on-rails shooters produced yet.  If you liked Resident Evil Chronicles or House of the Dead, you will probably enjoy this game.  Even if you don't like on-rails shooters, fans of the original Dead Space should at least consider renting this game.  If you aren't a fan of either of those things, I can pretty much guarantee that you wouldn't like this game.  It's good for what it is, but it isn't really for everyone, especially if you are looking for a something with deep gameplay.[EDIT: Some readers have asked me to go back and re-evaluate my criticism of the \"jumpy camera\" because there is a camera stability option that can be set.  I neglected to mention in my original posting that I had set the camera shakiness to 0 for my play through, so my original assessment still stands.  Thank you for those of you who questioned me on this point and asked me to clarify.]","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2009"}

Why bother...I did try the multiplayer in the beta and the input lag (press a button on controller, delayed reaction on screen) was still pretty severe and not fixed from Crysis2.BTW, these issues exist across are PC, PS3 and 360.It's too bad. This is one of the most important gaming engines in the world and this is the flagship release. Very pretty game, good voice acting, great soundtrack. It's a tad short (5 hours) and it has a throw-away story, but if the bugs weren't there, it'd be a solid game. The sheer number bugs I experienced and am reading about online are unbelievable...I expect bugs from Bethesda, they've got a massive game, massively complicated, so many intersecting quests and items and this and that. But Crysis is just an FPS with some physics and a handful of weapons. How hard can it be to iron out the bugs? And what in the world was the BETA for?

In a last-ditch effort to save himself, one researcher jumps into the other prototype suit that they have and chases after him. What he finds is a world where the use of future technology has allowed said madman to become an unstoppable fascist dictator. That's the plot of Timeshift, a first person shooter for the PS3 that combines Half Life 2's dystopian future with Prince of Persia's time-changing abilities.The main abilities in the game focus on the suit's time-warping, which can slow down, stop, or reverse time for short periods. Slowing time will increase your reflexes and agility, boosting your fighting ability. It also has a fairly long effect before it runs out of juice, so it's a good one to use during regular firefights. Stopping time has two different effects: one, it allows you to move among the enemy even less impeded than in slowed time, allowing you to literally grab the guns from their hands as they stand frozen in place. The other effect it has is on physics and the world; teetering boards that in other games would lower if you stood on them can be frozen in place and used as a solid walking platform, and water can be run across like solid ground. Reversing time is useful only in certain situations; unlike Prince of Persia, the player character is not moved by the reversing of time (so you can't pull yourself out of dangerous falls or whatever). What you can do, however, is undo damage done to, say, a bridge, so that you can cross before it gets destroyed again. You can also use it to free yourself from a sticky grenade that has caught onto you. The effects from these are pretty cool, and also tie into the health system (which regenerates over time); you can use time effects to surprise your enemies, run to cover, escape an ambush, or just plain beat up your foes. The time effects are definitely the best part of the game.The FPS part of the game comes from the guns used by the player. However, they're almost all textbook weapons - pistol, rifle with grenade launcher, shotgun, sniper rifle, and so on. There's nothing particularly noteworthy in the field of firearms, and they're mostly there to give you something to shoot with when you freeze or slow time. The controls are weird and unintuitive, and they can't be changed except for a single button switch.The graphics and sound in the game are nice, but not excellent. The sound especially is fairly mediocre, though there are some interesting enemy responses to your time-shifting (\"He just appeared!\" \"What just happened?!?\"). The characters are bulky and odd and don't seem natural for whatever reason. None of the designs are particularly good; all of them have the same \"future trooper\" motif.As a whole, this game has one neat element and a lot more mediocre ones.

{"product_name":"B004XGN8W4","description":"","reviewerName":"O. R. Rodriguez","summary":"This replaced my 15 inch vizio and made traveling with my consoles a LOT easier (UPDATE, nice ps3 tip)","reviewText":"(I uploaded some pictures showing before and after the g155)I have been carrying my hardware on the astro mission bag for over a year.  I got what i used to call my \"mobile command unit\" which is based on the PS3, X360 (on a separate backpack), A40s and the vizio 15 inch led.  It was fine and all, and since the G155 was not released when i decided to go mobile it was the best solution i could think of at that time.  Throughout this past year i saw the G155 and all the great reviews kept pilling up.  I was tempted, yet i decided to be satisfied with the vizio and the mission bag.  Time kept passing and the more i used my solution the more obvious it became it was not mobile at all, just decent.  So now i have the G155, and this is my story.I use the Ultra High Performance HDMI Switcher, 3to1 Switch to connect my X360 (inside the G155) and the PS3 (outside the G155) simultaneously and the experience has been a HUGE upgrade in simplicity and easy mobility.  I still use my mission bag for the PS3, A40 and other accessories, with the G155 next to it.  When open i like how the G155 has space on both sides of the console to put the controller when not in use, the A40 mixamp and the charging cable for the controller.  It just looks clean.  I used to have the vizio and a bunch of cables flying around and it was all just a mess.  Now i got the G155 and it provides a personal environment for a neat and beautiful gaming desk.As for the G155 itself, i have put it on marathons with the X360 and PS3 and the performance of the screen is just awesome.  ZERO lag, fps are fluid and look great.  Skyrim looks awesome.  The screen performs as advertised and then some.  The speakers are better than expected, no gimmicks here is all about performance.The case itself is just right.  Hard plastic, rubber feet in the right places, stable in vertical position, console sits tight and safe with the straps.  At some point i like using my x360 on the G155 than on the big TV.  for some reason i like the up close and personal feeling the G155 provides.In my opinion, the G155 is not exclusive for mobile action.  If you are in college, or have one tv in the house the G155 can provide a perfect solution for that gamer in the house that needs to get its gaming fix.Great product, great company, once you buy it you will know why the great reviews keep pilling up.UPDATEI have been using the ps3 with my g155 and noticed that the fans were getting way too loud and the heat build up around the console worried me. Because the ps3 does not allow full games install it gets pretty hot.My tip is to take the storage pouches that come with the g155 and fold them in a way that when put under the ps3, one in each side, the ps3 is lifted just enough to allow better air flow through the side vents and the bottom is not compressed against the cushion. Also with this adjustment he usb ports are more accessible for charging the controller and using the ps3 wireless headset.  The straps will keep the ps3 in place, so dont worry about that. Hope it helps","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2012"}
{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","reviewerName":"Private Quentin Tarantino Fan","summary":"One of the Best Games I've Ever Played. Period.","reviewText":"I'm not going mince words here.  The Last of Us is simply one of the best games I have ever played.  It is that simple.  The Last of Us is, really, about as good as games get.  Don't be scared by the premise; ND has crafted something that reaches far and wide delivering an experience that's akin to a playable drama film.  Wash away those horrible memories of The House of the Dead and put your fears away.  The Last of Us is simply incredible.The Last of Us is a tale that takes inspiration from various works in the genre it works with (most notably The Road, No Country For old Men, and The Walking Dead), while forging its own path to create something equally memorable and carving out its own path that sets it apart from all of its inspirations beforehand (certainly feels like it).  What may sound like B-movie shlock on paper has been transformed by Naughty Dog into something no short of a masterpiece.  While stalwart games like Resident Evil 1 are so horribly done that they make Ed Wood look like George Bernard Shaw, The Last of Us is an instant classic that would rightly belong in the Criterion Collection or right next to an art film.  Naughty Dog really outdone themselves, and they have done something entirely else.  ND has created something that feel so real and tangible for today's society.  Through the epidemic certainly has ravaged the lives of so many people by turning them into horrible creatures, The Last of Us isn't so much a zombie based horror flick as it is a tough, deeply woven drama with the vision that reaches far and wide.The Last of Us stars Joel and Ellie, two amazing characters who are heart and soul of this journey.  What follows these two incredible characters is a journey that will test your limits as it touches upon society as a whole in ways that I myself wasn't even expecting.  At it's core, what happens when society collapses?  What is the capacity that man would do in order to survive?  How far would you go?  The Last of Us may seem simple, but it hides under this and explores the implications of society's horrifying ability to crack underneath the pressure.  Or on a more simple but wider note: \"what it would mean to live in such a world?\"  What follows is a brutal, but often beautiful, journey that touches upon the lives and delicately explores all the turbulence one would expect when society breaks down from a horrible apocalypse.  It's a thematically rich and touching tale, with oceans of subtly and the resulting details that should take far more time to grasp than lightweight fiction would ask of you to do so.  Take it all in, appreciate it, read everything that comes to you, and don't be afraid to put all of what you know and would imply during the situations that unfold throughout this extremely long journey.  For my money, this is one of the best stories I've ever encountered in the medium.Visuals and sound are two of the video game medium's greatest strengths, and you can be sure Naughty Dog knows this.  Visuals are amazing and absolutely essential to the experience, using the power of the PS3 to make the experience irreversibly absorbing.  Sure, the technical aspect of The Last of Us are first rate, but the artistic vision of the game is where it truly shines.  The environments are absolutely PACKED with detail, and build a frightfully immerse and believable world.  It feels real as you traverse it.  Whether it's crawling through a decrepit hotel, a horribly bleak, ruined convenience store, the rancid and dehumanizing quarantine zones, or the serene and calm realm of nature that has overtaken humanity, the world in The Last of Us is telling and a character in itself.Animations, especially facial animations, are also top notch.  Facial animation can indeed make or a break a character's emotional resonance (you've might of heard of the uncanny valley), and Naughty Dog makes sure The Last of Us does not break the emotional resonance.  Simply put, The Last of Us is a beautiful game, both technically and artistically.Sound is also amazing as well.  The sound track, composed by two time Oscar Winner Gustavo Santaolalla (Babel, Brokeback Mountain), plays a big part in the game's experience.  The score is sparse, but is effective in bringing a bleak and beautiful sense of isolation, also not forgetting to puncture the game's most harrowing moments with appropriate menace.  At its softer moments, its tinged with a particularly Americana  melancholy, which perfectly evokes the kind of western feel one would get reading Blood Meridian's most beautiful moments.  Sound Design is also terrific.  It makes sure that the entire world comes to life in a dizzying amount of different ways:  it makes the violence almost too harrowing, the sound of the zombies horrifying, and makes the space you traverse feel real; an active experience indeed.  No matter if you feel sorrow, or dread, happiness or solitude, sound is there to make sure your experience comes to life.Also, the acting performances are on a whole 'nother level.  Troy Baker in particular absolutely needs recognition for his performance, (The intro.  My god that intro), but everybody else does a fantastic job.  Led by Druckmann's exceptional script, the performances feel so understated, quiet, human.  It's often simple and direct delivery unexpectedly leads to  depth, getting into the lives of these people and how they  relate to the apocalypse, the turbulence of such an event, the fear, the loss, the suffering and brutality of the world around, and beauty and heart in the most unexpected of places.  It's pristine delivery, with such delicate crystal clarity and nuance, makes sure every spoken word lingers in the air with such believable weight.  No matter how uncomfortable or violently dark, savage, these people get, you still understand them.  When these characters speak, you simply feel these human beings within yourself.As terrific as all of this is, graphics and sound aren't the most important aspect of storytelling.  Game play is what completes a video game narrative.  Ever since the medium's inception, games have been struggling to properly mesh game play and narrative, especially games with a heavy emphasis on combat.  I'm not going to be point fingers at any particular game here(it's really all comes to one's subjective player experience), but there is no doubt games have been hobbled by this design flaw.  Luckily, TLOU averts this with absolute skill.  The Last of Us made sure that game play didn't become second nature, and as a result it has to be one of the best examples of seamless meld  of game play and story in the medium.  True to its survival horror roots, The Last of Us has nailed its goal of violence and game play as an art form, and as a result the game is tense, horrifying, brutal, and gritty as a player authored experience.TLOU is a survival piece.  Be of note, this game needs to play on the highest difficulty in order to truly make it a harrowing experience to interact with.  Emotionally tax yourself on hard, and once you unlock Survivor mode, bite the bullet and never in turn lax the emotion.  With little resources available to you and enemies that can kill you in one or two hits (assuming you're playing on higher difficulties), TLOU is as frightening real as games get.  Your best bet, whenever possible, is to avoid combat as much as you can, and cling to your wits in order to make it out alive of any situation.  If not, be prepared for some chilling engagement.  The Last of Us is horrifically violent, so brutal that the game can really be harrowing in a way that few video games ever hope to achieve.  Oh, and you swerve with an almost overwhelming sense of nausea.  While some complained about the aiming, I thought it only made the game more nerve racking (it's not impossible to get used to the aiming, either).  I think this is a valid complaint for those who aren't willing to deal with it (this aspect, I imagine, will be rather subjective), but it makes sure that the cover based moments still feel dangerous despite being in cover.  It's like a playable No Country for Old Men, which is the highest praise I can give this game.Mechanically, TLOU doesn't feature the complexity of EVE Online, but it opens up well enough as you go through the game.  True to its genre, the game rewards exploration and scrounging, and with a variety of supplies, you can craft numerous weapons that help you creatively both offensively and defensively, such as sticky grenades, smoke bombs. Molotov cocktails, shivs, blades on melee weapons, and more.  In addition, numerous amounts of upgrades to both your character (through medicine) and your weapons (through upgrades) means that you will adapt and evolve throughout the game.  Better health, faster crafting times, less swaying, and many others will enhance the player character; for the weapons, expect better reload times, a few enhancements, the ability hold more ammunition, additional weapon slots (saving your character the agony of having to go through a back pack) and others.  Even better, the new game plus mode makes sure that you can play through the game more than once and build upon the arsenal you had in your last game.While the game's story and presentation, and its merge of game play and narrative, is damn near perfect (or at least close, considering perfection is impossible), I do have to point out some flaws in the game play, mostly due to minor game play lapses (which is typical in most ND games).  I found the highest difficulty mode to be challenging without breaking my engagement, but there are some spots in the campaign that felt unbalanced and cheap.  Battling against enemies has the weird bullet sponge feel, and it's often annoying when facing soldiers.  The annoying fiddliness of the survival horror genre doesn't fully avert The Last of Us (much like System Shock 2), with combat sections that turn the game's balance from \"challenging\" to \"unbalanced\".  Luckily, this happens very infrequently, and the game is still mechanically satisfying.  However, just keep this in mind when you play through The Last of Us, because moments like these will come up.I'll leave the MP to other people if they want to talk about it.  It's great, but you can ignore it altogether like a bonus track because the SP is a masterpiece.  All I'm saying is this:  believe the hype when it comes to TLOU.  The Last of Us is incredible as an experience that Naughty Dog deserves your money for the SP alone.  The Last of Us is not only just a superb video game, but it's a brilliant shake up that this industry sorely needs.  I remember reading an interview that they wanted to raise the story bar with The Last of Us, and in turn making other developers scramble for cover.  This was the end goal Naughty Dog wanted to achieve with this release.  Well, I tip my hat to you, Naughty Dog.  You've succeeded.  The Last of Us is another success for Naughty Dog on a story telling level, and for the medium as a whole.  It's a masterpiece, one of the best games of 2013, a game of the generation, and one of the best games I have ever played.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2013"}

I've seen this so many times between the three games ~ people expect them to be similar, so when they play a new one they are extremely disappointed because they were expecting it to be like the previous game they played.Baldur's Gate is character and dialogue driven. It is extremely non-linear and allows you to wander around and do things at your own pace in whatever order you choose (reasonably).Neverwinter Nights is focused on creating and managing only one main character and is a mix between linear and non-linear. It has limitless custom content and roleplaying potential.Icewind Dale is very linear and is combat and strategy based. The battles here are far superior to the ones in BG or NWN. They are well-balanced and always challenging. They require planning, thinking, strategizing and ample use of the pause button. It's not an easy game but that is what makes it so much fun. Of course, it's not friendly to newcomers, which is one reason many people dislike it so quickly (i.e. they suck at it).The music in IWD is phenomenal and one of the best video game soundtracks. The sound effects and superb and the game is full of brilliant art, level design and atmosphere. This is a game I keep coming back to, over and over again, because it has such high replay value and exciting combat.

You wander around a zombie infested island doing quests to level up and get access to versions of the same weapons that do a bit more damage and defeat mobs with a bit more health by doing the same basic attacks endlessly.  Despite the really repetitive play the carnage is satisfying because you can build a few custom weapons that have great animation.  The ammo for the guns is really rare so rather than being a first person shooter this is more of a first person clobber or first person slicer.  They did a fine job of making each individual zombie look distinct but with only a half dozen types of mobs you don't need any real skill to beat the game.So, overall this is a pretty but rather dull game.

{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"Scottypiper \"Scottypiper\"","summary":"One of the best video games of all times!","reviewText":"I'll start by saying this is one of the best games I have ever played. From the opening scene in the game, I was hooked.Story: Set in an alternate reality, Andrew Ryan builds an underwater city called Rapture. He wanted a city to be free from the laws of the land and to push the scientific boundaries without ethical interference, so he builds the city on the ocean floor in the Atlantic using geothermal power from underwater volcanoes. One scientist discovers stem cells from a slug could be used to create \"Adam,\" a plasmid that alters DNA and grants the user special power. All of the citizens of Rapture become crazy and hooked on Adam and the plasmids and want more. In order to create enough Adam, these slugs were injected into the stomachs of little girls (called little sisters) to produce large quantities of Adam. A plasmid industry was then created to sell plasmids to citizens. Soon a war broke out between Andrew Ryan and a gangster named Frank Fontaine who wanted control of Rapture. Andrew Ryan appears to defeat Fontaine and seizes control of the plasmid industry. Fontaine's soldiers (called Splicers) continue to attack the little sisters so Ryan creates plasmid-enhanced super soldiers called Big Daddies in order to protect the little sisters.Gameplay: First-person shooter. You are Jack, a plane crash survivor in the ocean, and you seek shelter in a lighthouse. You find out the lighthouse is actually a bathysphere that transports you down to the underwater city of Rapture. You are guided through the city by Radio from a guy named Atlas. He teaches you how to survive and instructs you to inject a plasmid into yourself. You then battle through Rapture killing the Splicers along the way to your goals. You have multiple weapons to use including a wrench, pistol, machine gun, shotgun, grenade launcher, etc. and multiple plasmids that let you use fire, ice, electricity, telekinesis, insects, etc. to damage opponents. As you make your way through Rapture, there are multiple vending machines used to purchase ammunition, health and equipment, create items, adjust plasmids, etc. There are cameras in some areas that scan and try and spot you. If you are spotted, bots are released that can shoot bullets at you. In order to get past cameras, you can hack them or destroy them. Hacking is a big part of the game. Every electronic in the game can be hacked such as the vending machines, health stations, safes, cameras, bots, and automated turrets. Hacking cameras, bots and automated turrets changes them to your side where they will attack enemies for you. Hacking health stations and vending machines lowers the price of items and add new ones. When you hack something, you play a short mini game similar to Pipe Mania, where you try and get the flow of the liquid from the start point to the end point without setting off alarms. Several items make hacking easier, such as slowing the liquid, less alarm tiles, etc. As you make your way through Rapture, you will need to acquire more Adam in order to buy more plasmids or upgrade them. You get Adam via the little sisters but you have to kill their big daddy first. Big daddies are tougher to kill than Splicers. Once they are gone, you can harvest Adam from the little sisters. You have the option to be good and save the little sisters (keep them alive and free them from the slug) or kill them and harvest every bit of Adam from them down to the slug. Your ending depends on your choices with the little sisters. You get more Adam by killing them but you get bonus presents from the little sisters for every 3 that you save. It adds up to be about the same either way. Another item in the game is the research camera and film. You can take photos of each enemy, exposing weak points. Once you take enough photos of each enemy type, you will get the maximum benefit and they will be easier to kill. It takes several of each enemy to get enough photos. This works on big daddies, cameras, bots, turrets, etc.Graphics: Amazing views of the ocean and ocean life. The details are incredible and the animations look very vivid and life-like.Sound: The game is set in the 60's so you often hear 60's music and sound. The voice acting is good and the sound effects are realistic for every weapon and plasmid.Conclusion: All of the game play aspects add up to an amazing experience. I have played through the game multiple times and it is still a blast to play. Definitely one of the most defining games of the seventh generation of video game consoles and one of my favorite games of all times.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2011"}

You wave it around, and your on-screen character waves their wand!This isn't an add-on controller - this is the actual, standard controller that most if not all games on the Nintendo Wii use as their primary control unit. There is also a \"nunchuck\" that can be used in your off hand, but many games don't use the nunchuck.The aim of the Wii was to make gaming as simple and intuitive as possible for the casual non gamer. Pretty much every person with a TV is comfortable using a TV remote. You point, you click. The Wii Remote Controller works in the same fashion. The motion sensors know what you are doing with the remote. If you're playing a baseball game, you swing at the ball. If you're playing a bowling game, you bring your arm back and swing it forward. Everything \"makes sense\". A sword swing? A light saber battle? Just move your arm and the character does the same thing.There are only two buttons that really matter. There's an A button on the front that you push for most operations. There's also a trigger underneath that is the B button. Depending on the game, they will have you use one or the other button. There are also a few other buttons for more complex gaming. There's a D-pad. A \"home\" button lets you go instantly back to the main Wii menu if you're tired of playing. There's a plus and minus button, a 1 and 2 button. There's even a power button. You don't have to walk over to your Wii any more to turn it on or off. Just hit the power button on the remote and you're all set.The remote runs on two AA batteries, so there's no USB plugging in or charging up, as with the other systems' remotes. You do get a wrist strap, though, so the Wii remote doesn't fly out of your hands while you're doing a super powerful golf swing.There's even a speaker in the remote! This is great if you're playing a game against another player. Say I'm boxing my boyfriend and I am the winner. *My* remote says that I triumphed, to me. Neat!I definitely love the Wii remote controller. It's light, it's super easy to use, it's intuitive and I can just pop batteries into it when it runs out, instead of having to wait for a recharge. Highly recommended. Just note that if you want to play a game that needs a nunchuck as well, that you have to buy that separately.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2006"}

Sweet story, but seems to be too short to me. The game'd be better if it had some garages where it'd be possible to store some unique vehicles. And to be able to repair them Not enough of sport cars or one of a kind cars. It'd be more fun to have something unique in the game. More better vehicles is what I want to see in the next game. When attacking the army, after a while it all seems repetitive, with almost the same design. Pretty boring. I play mercenary mode for I finished the main missions. I really find it now too boring to play. No more missions and those small races, and those collecting skulls, drug cases things, and so on seems like a waste of time. I really liked how the world look and Scorpios outfit but after that last mission I have nothing else to do. Scorpio has lots of nice vehicles and ammunition however now it seems like:'' It is not enough'' We need more. I love the game and I played it with a big pleasure. I hope in next game JC3 it'd be possible to have more kick ass world, weapons and of course cars and jet flights. Overall this game is amazing. Really a kick ass game.

Using the extraordinary superpowers and amazing skills of Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Wonder Woman, and other favorite DC Comics super heroes, players must join the Justice League to ultimately save humanity from Brainiac and the dark forces that lurk in the universe.","reviewerName":"MurphysLaw","summary":"Disappointing","reviewText":"\"Justice League Heroes\" is disappointing for several reasons.  First, the arcade style seems a bit outdated and due to the camera angle, which primarily has you looking down on the characters, makes you feel almost detached from the game.  It doesn't help that your character often blends in with the bad guys, especially in the darker levels.  This isn't as noticeable when you are playing as Superman or Flash with the bright red costume but it is a bit of an issue when playing as some of the other characters.  At times, when you are fighting next to large objects, the characters are completely obscurred.Another complaint is the inability to select which characters you will use to complete a mission, especially early on in the game as they are pre-selected.  The graphics are decent although the backgrounds tend to be a bit generic and you'll see the same thing over and over.  There are essentially no areas to explore outside of the general gameplay area and in fact, you can't access many of the areas due to police roadblocks, etc.  This seems almost ridiculous since your character can pick up cars and throw them but you can't move a wooden road block.  The voice work is good but you'll hear the same comments repeatedly.  The interaction between the characters is also odd.  Batman seems to almost detest Superman: \"I didn't ask for your help\" kind of thing.  Superman is a bit smug as well.  Ah, super egos.The game is a button masher for sure and there is very little challenge to figuring out what you need to do to progress.  The controls are very easy to learn and combos are typically limited to 4 buttons.  There is a great deal of repetition in the enemies you'll fight as well.  The first few levels consist of robots, robots and more robots, followed by robots and giant bees...yes, bees.  Checkpoints are frequent and you can use them to revive a fallen team mate.  The levels are short and the game itself is short.  If compared to other superhero games, \"Justice League Heroes\" is better than most but if you compare to other fighting games, it falls short.  The game gets tedious quickly and a single-player game is significantly worse.  Glad I did not purchase and only rented.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2007"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E986","description":"","reviewerName":"Gearhead Mania","summary":"A lot like Forza 3, but some fun new features","reviewText":"Forza Motorsport 4Having maxed out my profile to level 50 in Forza 3, I was pleasantly surprised to see Forza 4 recognized this and gave me some goodies like free gift cars and 60,000 credits. It is far easier to earn free cars in Forza 4 than in 3, because each level gives you a choice of several cars but many of them are shoddy older vehicles (ahem, I meant classics or retro). It is also easier to earn credits through race bonuses or affinity bonuses. The manufacturer affinity is now no longer capped at level 5, but at level 5 you get 100% discounts on upgrades which means you can customize your cars without being charged. I always felt that it was unfair to spend that much money in Forza 3 to find out that your performance index went over the limit for that class.The controls are amazingly intuitive. I did not tweak any of the settings for my controller, but the layout is a major concern. In Forza 3, I ran Layout 5 which uses \"X\" as the handbrake, and \"A\" as the rear view. For some unknown reason, Forza 4's Layout 5 is the same except \"X\" is now the rear view, and \"A\" is the hand brake. Needless to say I always accidentally use the handbrake when I want to look behind, or I look behind when I want to tap the handbrake. I find it idiotic for the developers to lock us into fixed controller configurations versus totally custom setups.The very first race you start in the game forces you to use an unfamiliar controller setup with all of the driver assists enabled. I was not a happy camper as I tend to brake late and slide the rear. The AI difficulty is kind of weird. In the World Tour, the difficulty is progressive. So as you start off, the AI is fairly easy. As you progress, the AI starts to overpower you with shoddy cars or overpowers you in spec racing which makes no sense. It is not possible to adjust the difficulty in the World Tour, but it is possible in the regular events. This makes no sense whatsoever, but if Microsoft had anything to do with it, then it totally makes sense. Just like printing Outlook calendars where you can never have the previous month and next month in the corner of the calendar, or how all default \"All-Day\" events have 18 hour reminder times which can't be changed because it was made by Microsoft.Speaking more about the AI difficulty, I found that Forza 4 and Forza 3 have the same levels of difficulty. I normally use Medium because I want to relax and have some fun. The Hard setting is hard because the AI just gets on your six and can overpower you if you open up a hole for them. In the Professional setting, I've given up because even in Spec series racing where everyone has the same car, the AI will actually overpower your car in the straights as if they had extra power from the engines. The AI makes mistakes in the Medium mode but sometimes they act strange and start to become ultra competitive. I'm just playing Forza 4 to learn the tracks and enjoy myself, not to become King of Forza 4.Some of my other complaints include the lack of the Le Mans Bugatti circuit which was in Forza 3, which was a lot of fun and happens to be used in the MotoGP series. The Indianapolis Grand Prix circuit, also used in MotoGP, is found in Forza 4 but it is somehow run in reverse. I am not sure why that was done, because after playing MotoGP 09/10 for a year plus and watching the MotoGP races, I was used to it running in the anti-clockwise route.Forza 4 has a similar feel to NFS Shift 2, especially with the race starting sequence. Forza 3 felt a bit different, more bland or sterile compared to Forza 4, which is seemingly more vibrant with its menus and Auto Vista feature. I really wish the player's engine doesn't rev in the starting sequence because it messes up the launch sequence.  You want a continuous RPM, not a bouncing RPM. The speedometer and tachometer in Forza 4 is difficult to read because of the white/bright text and colors and actually fades out on the bright tracks. The framerate of the game actually slows down with the rear view mirror enabled! It clearly shows the limitations of the Xbox 360 GPU hardware.Some new features in Forza 4 include the multi-class race, where you can have two different performance classes running on the same track (like S and D) which creates some interesting situations. The Top Gear bowling pins and soccer ball games are fun, but not that mandatory. The Top Gear test track was brutalized by the developers with the addition of fake barriers that don't exist in real life. I sat there and pondered why they would do that, and assumed it was because the game needs some type of definition for the course and to determine where you \"get off the track\". At least it is better than not having the Top Gear test track in the game!One of the gripes I have is with realistic engine sounds. The GT500's supercharger is not very audible in Forza 4, and I recall it being somewhat audible in Forza 3. In real life, the familiar whine of the Eaton is very audible inside the cabin, let alone outside the car. The rich sound of the blower should be replicated for a better experience.Another gripe I have is that most of the powerful cars are very difficult to drive using the controller. In Forza 3, I have no problems pushing the \"A\" cars to the limit with Traction Control and ABS shut off. This includes the Audi R8 V10 and Ferrari F430. In Forza 4, the \"A\" cars and beyond (S, R3, etc...) become extremely touchy with the throttle and brakes. I find myself easily locking up or not using enough brakes, or losing traction very quickly. Once I enabled Trac Ctrl and ABS, the cars became totally drivable and I was leaving the AI in the dust in the world tour. I find that it is hard to tell when the tires are at their point of adhesion with the game and Xbox controller. In real life, there are clues like the sudden relaxation of the steering feedback or sounds from the tires, or your butt meter tells you the car is yawing.The Downloadable Content (DLC) for Forza 4 consists of extra cars so far. The November and December car packs are now available, and there is a modicum of decent cars with plenty of junky, ahem I mention retro classics, cars as well. The Ford Raptor, Pontiac Fiero, Chevrolet Chevelle, and Suzuki SX4 Pike's Peak race car are some of the more interesting cars, but note that after spending Microsoft Points on the DLC packs or cars, you must use in-game credits to buy the cars!A Xbox Live Gold Membership is required to post videos, download gift cars, and buy/sell auction cars. Compounded with numerous bugs in the game that corrupt your save game files preventing you from saving replay movies, it gets on my nerves. I had a Gold membership last year when playing Forza 3, but I quickly realized that the Gold membership wasn't worth the price last year. Microsoft raised the price of the membership for this year and I didn't bother to renew it. So far the gift cars from Turn 10 aren't very good, and the DLC cars aren't enticing enough to convince me to shell out the coin for a Gold membership. I do have some free trial Gold membership codes, so I plan to do all the \"shopping\" at once on a free trial to avoid paying the exorbitant membership fee. It's just frustrating that a Gold membership is required to do all of these static things, I could understand Gold being required for online race sessions, but to download a gift car or to buy/sell auction cars? Outrageous.Overall: 4/5 stars. Forza 4 is a lot like Forza 3, and shows the limitations of the Xbox 360 hardware. There are some nice new features, but again many frustrating aspects are back or are new and mainly related to AI difficulty and controller layout. It's a fun game for sure, and if you have not tried Forza 3, and you are a gearhead/petrolhead, you'll miss out if you don't try Forza 4. If you have played Forza 3, Forza 4 is worth the price of admission.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYY5E","description":"","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"A classic is reborn in HD","reviewText":"Halo is a classic in the gaming industry.  Like Gone With the Wind is to movies.  Classics, whatever they may be, are basically essential goods that have influenced their respective realms and have achieved iconic status.  But the problem with classics is that despite the acclaim and general reverence they eventually show their age, pretty badily too.Take Gone With the Wind again: The acting is relatively bad in most parts and compared to modern day it's almost pathetic.  Halo, which is one of my all-time favorite series, has a similar problem.  Graphically, it's gotten a MAJOR overall (it's not the extra pixels that most HD collections get, ie. Ico & Shadows of the Colossus - it's completely redesigned) thanks to 343 Industries, and it's definitely cool to switch to what the game originally looked like (if not to see how far we've come graphically in a decade but also for nostalgic reasons), but the game play is archaic (at least to me...) in comparison to the fluidity of the modern day.  That said, the graphics are great, but nothing close to, say, the recently released Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception - 343 definitely impresses with their prowess in this department, but it doesn't jump off the screen and amazes you (overall, I found the graphics pleasant, but perhaps expected more from all I saw and heard about in trailers); still, it's by far the best HD reworking of any dated game to date and 343 deserves a pat on the back.Halo Anniversary is a great title to pick up for many reasons.  The new graphics are amazing, as is the ability to go from the original to the flashy new skin.  I encountered a few glitchy spots, and the character faces are almost unrecognizable in their new form, but the pros far, far, FAR outweigh the cons.  Halo: Combat Evolved was never my favorite Halo game (Halo 2 warrants that due to its great story line, excluding the cliffhanger ending), but Microsoft gives us a true Christmas treat here.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2011"}

For a time there, it was incompatible, but for those of you looking to blow the dust off those old discs, I have good news:  it works in Windows 7.  No Compatibility Mode tweaking or other fiddling necessary:  I just stuck in the disc, ran the installer, and was good to go.  You won't find a stunning max resolution, but you can force newer tweaks through the nVidia Control Panel using the \"Application-specific\" settings.To that end, I've gone back down the rabbit-hole, and now I'm going to take you along with me.  American McGee's \"Alice\" was designed to tell a newer story from Lewis Carroll's classic:  Alice's family perished in a terrible fire.  Alice has gone mad with grief and survivor's guilt.  You are Alice, returned to a weeping Wonderland that begs for her to set it right.This third-person shooter uses a variety of clever weapons, from croquet mallets that bludgeon one way, alt-fire an electrified croquet ball another...to the very magical Blunderbuss if you can find it in its secret location.  The many creatures that menace Alice are a combination of folklore (fiery imps, a witch who would eagerly eat you) to book-lore (the Jabberwock, the Mad Hatter), and unique creations in between (creepy dollface spiders, a centipede with a German soldier's helmet and flaming eyes).The environments are interesting, and the voicework is for the most part ahead of its time (which puts it close to the professional-polish we get in newer games today).  There are some problems you would expect from an older game, such as a difficult jumping mechanic and occasional button-lag, but otherwise the slow climb through the many interesting levels make it all worth the effort.If you have (or are considering purchasing) this title, you will find an enjoyable dark gothic tale with color and imagination.

{"product_name":"B000FQBPCQ","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Absorbed in Twilight","reviewText":"The Legend of Zelda is one of the most popular games of all time. When a new Zelda game marches forth, the fans are always there. Now, after spending years in development, with delay after delay and ultimately being pushed onto the Nintendo Wii, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is finally here.Twilight Princess is by far one of the most instantly absorbing in the series.  The game begins with you as Link in the village of Ordan.  Things are going well for Link and his friends until a band of monsters riding a boar come and kidnap two of his friends.  When Link awakens, he's suddenly thrust into a twilight realm where he meets a creature named Midna, who decides to aid Link on his quest.  From the get go, The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess is instantly absorbing.  The storyline is by far one of the best in the series and is very engrossing and absorbing.The control scheme is not so bad at all. You'll control Link using the remote and nunchuck attachment. Swinging the remote makes Link swing his sword. It doesn't take a lot of work to do it either. A simple flick of the wrist is all it takes to make Link swing his sword.  In addition, shaking the nunchuck causes him to do his famous spin-slash attack. The controls are surprisingly fluent and very well responsive. Its an interesting way to play Zelda, and there's no steep learning curve to it.The heart of the challenge from the game mainly comes from the puzzles rather than the actual dungeon crawl itself. Simply because once you do get used to the Wii remote and controls you'll have a pretty easy time getting through the dungeons.  The game provides a targeting system for you, and so you'll find it really easy. Using projectiles like the slingshot is also made easier with the Wii remote.  You simply aim at objects and fire.  If you miss its entirely your own fault.A unique twist to the gameplay of Zelda is that Link not only goes around in his normal form, but can become a wolf as well.  As a wolf the controls are virtually the same with the exception of Link being able to use senses and dig.  You'll also be forced to solve puzzles in wolf form as well, and it does indeed add some variety to the game.  As you progress in wolf form, Midna sits on your back and is there to offer advice for you.  Gameplay wise, Twilight Princess knows how to keep you immersed in the game.Visually its hard to judge Twilight Princess. Its a pretty game, but as you probably expected it pretty much looks like a late Gamecube release. This may be because Twilight Princess wasn't intended for the Wii in the first place, but the Gamecube.  To the games credit though, it has a lot of detail going for it. Link has never looked better. The land of Hyrule has never looked better.  Your enemies and some of the cinematics also sport some awesome detail.  So while it does look like a late generation Gamecube game, keep in mind that it still looks good and that it probably even looks smoother and runs better on the Wii.  Load times are virtually non-existant here.The music still sounds pretty good. A lot of tunes you'll recognize from previous Zelda adventures, but the new stuff sounds pretty good too. There's no voice acting, though, and that still bothers me about Zelda to this day. The Windwaker could've used voice acting and so could Twilight Princess. The story is so absorbing, and it probably would've been better had they added voices to it. Link grunts and such and from time to time one of the NPC characters might yell something, but there's really no spoken dialogue throughout the game.  It would've been really exciting to see some of the cinematics brought to life through fantastic voice acting.  In the long run this probably won't bother anyone, and its a small price to pay for a game that's as fantastic as this.For what its worth, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is very good. Its by far the most absorbing story in the entire series, and its gameplay is unmatched. Fans who have followed Zelda since its days on the NES will be pleased at just how far the series has come with Twilight Princess. Its one of the best in the series.The Good+Absorbing story+Fantastic Gameplay+There's a lot of great detail given to the game+The puzzles are quite challenging+The game still sounds goodThe Bad-Graphicwise, its really pretty, but you can't help but admit its just a late Gamecube game-All this time and the series still lacks voice acting","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2006"}
{"product_name":"B0009EHQVI","description":"This is the game SOCOM 3: U.S. Navy SEALs for the PlayStation 2.","reviewerName":"Jeffrey S. Stanley \"Viper_29\"","summary":"Just as good as SOCOM 2...","reviewText":"Okay, I will write my review for the single player portion of the game as I have not played the online portion yet. I have focused on the single player portion only. I enjoy online for the most part but there are too many idiots out there who ruin it by talking smack and cussing like they think it is cool, most of them are kids. Anyways, onto the review.In the single player portion, you will play in three different locales. Each locale will offer multiple levels up to around 6 or 7, based on how soon you achieve your bonus objectives. If someone escapes who you could have caught as a bonus, then you continue to another level to try to apprehend that suspect again. The missions are nicely laid out and varied this time around. There are vehicles that have been introduced as well that you can drive such as the standard combat boats, buggys, 5 tons and a few others. Weapon lay out is nicely added with multiple weapon combinations that you can use. SOCOM has always been the leader in the realistic approach of special warfare. The bullet impacts in the game are extremely realistic, whether that is hitting the body of the enemy or shooting thru different materials such as glass or crates. The bodies will react to each and every single shot as in real life with the force of impact driving the body in the game. Nice touch to me for realism.I have to say though that after SOCOM 1 and SOCOM 2, there was a short time frame between those games, only a year, and there was a 2 year hiatus between SOCOM 2 and SOCOM 3 that I would have expected a better gain in graphic performance. While it still looks good, I wished it would have looked slightly better in overall terms. Zipper has gone through a lot of work to get the little details included in the game such as the different sounds of the weapons and the sounds of the different materials they are shot through. This game would have rocked in my opinion even more if they had included the methods of insertion such as scuba diving or sky diving. Would have brought the immersion factor up even more.The Sony PSP will be gaining the SOCOM Fireteam Bravo for it and from what I have read the two games are supposed to be interoperable by connecting the two console units to one another, but I am not positive on this so it will be interesting to see what comes of that.All in all SOCOM 3 is a great game and definitely keeps the lead for the best shooter on PS2, and in my opinion one of the best shooters over Xbox as well. The realism is there, the immersion factor is there and the attention to detail is there. At the very least give this game a chance with a game rental. You will most likely be headed for the store when the time comes to return the game and pick up your very own copy. Enjoy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2005"}
{"product_name":"B003EH0BQ4","description":"","reviewerName":"Shaide","summary":"Fun for the youngsters","reviewText":"Something to keep in mind, is that the Wii is a family oriented gaming console. It doesn't have the raw sheer power of a PS3 or 360, in fact many of the games found on the WII, could(And in some cases are) found on last generations PS2.The games though are mostly kid and family friendly, and of course it's home to all things Mario and Link! It's also the only place you can find Animal Crossing: City Folk, which is perhaps the funnest game exclusive on the console, hands down!One thing I want to point out, is that not only does this console play gamecube games, but you can also make purchases from Nintendos online store, and download classic games from classic systems, and play them right there on your Wii console. Classic games like Super Mario RPG, Final Fantasy  classics, Paper Mario and any number of other game classics.While most of the Wii exclusive titles don't impress me, access to classic games thrills me, and it's because of those playable classics, that I recommend this console to gamers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2013"}

{"product_name":"B007V9QKH0","description":"","reviewerName":"Scratchy","summary":"Solid Lootfest.","reviewText":"The game itself is full of fun button mashy levels that never get old because as you progress through the game you unlock different paths and ways to fully complete every stage.The artstyle is gorgeous!!  Every level's background looks like a moving mural.  The enemies are very distinct and not just reskins which gives the game a nice fresh feeling seeing how you play a lot of each level.Gameplay is fun.  Its a combination of button mashing Square or Circle to attack and to get more detailed you combine the directional pad to each button for different attacks.  You can also hotkey 4 abilities, spells, items or potions for added variety.The online isn't available until you progress somewhat into the game.  You can choose to play offline and choose your own characters to play with from resurrecting fallen soldiers you find in each level or go online and play with friends or have someone else drop into your match.  Unfortunately I don't think there is any option for voice chat so it makes it hard to tell people what to do but game is fairly straightforward enough that too much strategy isn't really required.The Artbook is fantastic.  Lots of great drawings that show off the colorful characters in the game.  Too bad its very highly sexual in manner you might be confused for a perv if the wrong people thumb through it.The sexploitation aside its a solid RPG lootfest that is pretty good to play offline or online.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2013"}
