I beat it once and I know thier are combos I haven't even done yet!  The story is kinda of strange because of the japanese overtone to the dialog but once you take control, she will not disapoint.  It is a difficult game on normal, but if you want to see how good you really are than play it on normal.  It will test yor skills in ways not tested before.  Witch time gives you the ability to slow down time when an enemy is just about to hit you and your timing has to be perfect in order to activate it.  Once its done, unleash blows and tear them to shreds.  Her powers and overkills are just insane, and the scale of the boss battles can compete with god of war any day.

I'll update it once I beat the whole game.STORY/AMBIENCEIt's nice that Nintendo really tried to infuse Skyward Sword with a story. It actually works for the most part. The scenes between Zelda and Link are really touching. And for once Gannondorf isn't the main villain!That said, while the story itself is fine, it just doesn't have the same epic feel Twilight Princess did. First, Skyloft feels a bit silly. I have nothing against riding birds, but it just can't compare with riding a horse as the standard for a fantasy/adventure game. I feel like Nintendo wanted to make this game different but this was a case of throwing out the good with the bad.Also, more fundamentally, the game just has a more lighthearted feel to it. Even after Zelda disappears, Zelda's father doesn't seem particularly scared and tells Link they'll have to start to look for her in the morning. Enemies aren't scary. For the first 2-3 hours, you'll spend most of your time talking to folks in Skyloft and finding cute little animals in a forest. It's just tough comparing this to Twilight Princess, which had beautifully haunting cutscenes, a chilling villain in Zant, and a melancholy ambience.GRAPHICSFirst, I'll address what was probably the most controversial aspect of the game: the graphics. When it was first revealed that the game had a pastel color palette, some fans complained that it looked too lighthearted and the characters too cartoonish. I was actually worried about this since I loved Twilight Princess' realistic style.Fortunately, after getting a good sample of the game's artwork, I have to say I'm quite satisfied with the outcome. I still prefer Twilight Princess' realistic style, but Skyward Sword looks great. The characters look alive and they have a wide range of facial and emotional expressions.The landscapes and stages are at least as detailed as in Twilight Princess. From a distance, the impressionistic style works really well. Sadly, unlike Twilight Princess, there's no Hyrule FIeld, which was always my favorite part. Also, the other landscapes don't quite have that epic feel and almost look like they could have come out of a kid's game. Make no mistake - they look good, but not quite epic.SOUNDBecause Skyward Sword has such a deep story, it's all the more disappointing that Skyward Sword doesn't have voice acting. The on-screen dialogue text worked for past Zelda games because the dialogue was short and often transactional in nature. However, there are cinematic cutscenes in Skyward Sword and the text dialogue just becomes a chore to read and really detracts from the story. Worst of all is when there's dialogue on the screen but the character's lips aren't movie.The soundtrack is good, but not quite at the level of Twilight Princess or Ocarina of Time. Again, as with the rest of the game, it's more lighthearted. It's tough to really judge while playing the game, so I'll have to wait until the full soundtrack is available for download.GAMEPLAYThis is where Skyward Sword really shines. While I don't think the swordplay is necessarily a revolution, it does add a new dimension to the game. You actually have to think about HOW you slash and hack. The Wii MotionPlus or its equivalent will definitely be standard for any future Zelda games.OVERALLSkyward Sword is really hard to rate because it both exceeds expectations and disappoints. The impressionistic art style didn't bother me nearly as much as I'd feared. On the other hand, the game just feels a whole lot less epic than Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, and especially Twilight Princess. I'll write an updated review once I finish the game (it is a long game) but in the meantime I give it 3.5 stars.UPDATE (1/2/2012)Took me longer to finish the game than I'd thought. It is a long game, with at least 50 hours of play, and I didn't even finish all of the side-quests. However, my initial review remains largely unchanged.I think the root of the problem with the game is that it's a bit too much like a Mario game. Don't get me wrong, I love Mario. However, Zelda is supposed to be a different experience. In Zelda, the levels aren't just platforms, but rather supposed to be immersive worlds. Levels and challenges should feel like natural extensions of the story, not just \"fetch-quests.\" By contrast, in Skyward Sword there were way too many \"fetch-quests\" and pointless activities just to vary up the game design. My least favorite was when the Water Dragon simply threw several dozen musical notes around an ocean and forced Link to swim around looking for them. I almost shouted in frustration.Also, I think Nintendo made a huge mistake by not giving each of the dungeons a unique feel. It makes the game less memorable. I feel like I played and beat the game just a few days ago, but remember it less than I do Twilight Princess. Because the dungeons aren't entirely separate from the over world and are much smaller overall, they just don't stick out. I can't think back to the \"Water Dungeon\" or \"Sky Dungeon.\" Separate dungeons also would have widened the variety of locales and the play experiences. As it stands, I felt like I was going back and forth over the same territory, which got tiring.The non-playable characters all felt like add-ons and were fairly superficial. Unlike Twilight Princess, I didn't really find myself caring for any of them. One of the first side-quests is to help a mother find her child. My first though was that any mother dumb enough to let her child wander around on a floating city with no side rails and monsters running around at night deserves to lose her kid. Zelda's dad seems entirely unconcerned that his daughter is missing and possibly kidnapped by an evil demon. None of these characters actually helps you in your quest. Except for Groose. I ended up loving him. He had real character and actually does try to become more than simply a helpless victim.The bosses just didn't meet my expectations. There actually are a lot fewer than in Twilight Princess, especially if you don't count the multiple times you fight Ghirahim or the Imprisoned. Ghirahim actually worked well as a boss and was the only time I felt like the motion controls added anything to the game. I also liked smacking Koloktos with the giant sword. Other than that, the bosses were too easy and not particularly memorable. The final boss, Demise, was pathetically easy once you figure out that you have to use the Skyward Strike. The designs are certainly nothing like the intimidating beasts from Twilight Princess.Finally, I really have to reemphasize that the lack of voice acting is noticeable. Other Zelda games told the story more through images and narration. Here, so much of the cutscenes and story involve dialogue. It just looks and sounds ridiculous watching these scenes but only hearing odd grunts and sighs.Overall, I stick by my rating of 3.5 stars. It's a good game, but really could have and should have been so much better.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2011"}

Yes. Realistic? Not by very, very long shot.","reviewText":"I think there is a reason why accurate flight simulators are few and far between on the consoles. With only a few buttons, a d-pad, and thumb-sticks on a controller, there isn't a great deal of input choices that would make up for a keyboard and full-blown flight stick. Flight sim developers are plane nuts and they strive for accuracy, many gaining access to the real aircraft, even taking test flights in them. Ace Combat 4 is not such a game. It's a fun romp through a campaign across a fictional nation that much is certain, but it has all the depth of a wading pool.  Combat is a simple matter of simply getting close enough to lock up an enemy plane and firing a missile while evading an incoming missile is as easy as turning and breaking. Also I know for a fact that real world aircraft do not carry upwards of 82 missiles.Flight dynamics are a joke; there is little difference between piloting an A-10 Thunderbolt or a F-15, characteristically, both air craft handle pretty much the same, save that the F-15 is faster. Realism goes out the window as one can usually out-maneuver an F-16 in an F-4; whereas in reality an F-16 would fly circles around the venerable Phantom. Aside from carrying five or six times the missile load out, missiles themselves are equally good at shooting down aircraft as they are blowing up tanks and hardened targets like bunkers. Fire a Sidewinder or a Sparrow at a modern battle tank and even providing you could hit it, the missile might scratch the paint. There's a great difference between aircraft aluminum and layered and ablative chobham tank armor. Bombs are equally weird, Mk-82 500 lb GBs seem to shoot out of your aircraft as if launched from a cannon. When doing a bombing run you can actually see them fly on ahead of you towards their target.What also got me was how useless the M-61 20mm gattling gun is on most aircraft. I did a little research  a few years ago and found that the cannon is incredibly accurate. Its spread pattern of 1-3 meters, even at two or three thousand meters range, indicates a 60 to 90% hit ratio. In Ace Combat 4 however, it's a bullet hose with all the accuracy of Fox News. The real weapon is so accurate because its muzzle velocity is so high, and thus overcomes gravity and wind resistance to a greater degree. In other words, shooting down another aircraft is very difficult, because you have to hit it so many times and providing you can maintain a close target lock long enough to pump enough rounds into it. This includes the A-10s 30mm Avenger cannon, the depleted uranium slugs of which will chew up battleship hull armor.These are pretty glaring faults for a game, but despite these, I found myself enjoying the game a great deal on my first play through. I liked the story as told by a young boy whose village is under enemy occupation. I generally like games that let you pick and choose what aircraft and weapons you wish to fly for each mission that is if you have earned enough money to buy such aircraft to give yourself that kind of choice. Each mission gives a series of objectives that must be met to earn cash, a little like anime `Area 88' where mercenaries on both sides battle in the skies over Africa, and use earned money to buy new planes or repair their existing aircraft. You also get a boatload of weapons; various bombs- guided and otherwise, laser guided Mavericks, and Phoenix missiles- which are actually really cool, because when armed, they lock up everything in front of you. And when you fire, you launch as many missiles as you have targeted aircraft.So, from a realism aspect, Ace Combat 4 misses the carrier deck by such a wide margin that it's in a completely different ocean. I can accept that; because it's fun. And fun is the name of the game. Going after the massive guns of the Stonehenge base and racing down the Death Start II tunnel system to wipe out Monolith, is darn cool. The lack of mission outline, the fact that missions are timed, and the fact that mission's objectives are handled pell-mell; is not. The plane graphics are great, and the landscape images are good from a distance. The combat chatter is fun, but you don't get to hear enemy in your cockpit in real life. Ace Combat 4 is a fun game, but a long, long way from being a real flight simulator or even accurate.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2004"}

Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"Reuben Roa","summary":"I loved it","reviewText":"Im gonna have to disagree with the previous reviews.

There are a few differences that I consider to be mostly cosmetic.  The finish has a rougher texture on this new one, they moved the extra buttons around a bit (I rarely use those anyway), and they G500 has a cord that looks more like a shoelace.  It seems more flexible and sturdy, so I'm guessing it is less prone to damage and wear.  The one change I really do like is the fact that they provide little weights that you can add to the G500, to customize it to your liking.  I loaded mine up with the maximum weight, and I like how it feels.  It clings to the pad and doesn't \"bound\" around as much.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics. The anime-style cutscenes woven around the slice-and-dice sequences provide an interesting story, but one that doesn't relate very directly with your job on the streets of postapocalyptic Tokyo. Your moves are cool though--spinning in midair to collect coins that will unlock secret levels, killing three ninjas with a flash of Akujiki, zipping around so fast that a shadow of your ghost remains. It's easy to get caught up in the exhilarating energy of the game. Serious gamers will enjoy confronting bosses, who may take several frustrating tries to kill. But when you finally defeat them, you will feel the power of centuries of samurai.--Maile BohlmannPros:Fantastic graphicsExcellent scripting and voicingFairly easy controls and maneuvers at outsetExciting fighting sequences with intense gameplayCons:Killing early bosses can be unusually difficultLong sequences with no save pointsStoryline frames fighting sequences, rather than interacting with them","reviewerName":"FRANCISCO CARDENAS","summary":"HARD BUT FUN","reviewText":"It's been a while since I played a game that makes me want to smash the controller, and this game almost made me do it.

The boss fights are a bit difficult specially the last boss, that one took me about a week to beat it, I looked for tutorials on youtube and saw some videos wich they killed him in about five minutes, I guess they practiced alot.If you are looking for a hard game to play with it, this is for you, plus we all love Shinobi games.Play On!!!!!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00005MO5G","description":"Although the game will seem very familiar to Sonic fans,Sonic  Advanceis an entirely new creation that's been built from the ground up.  The gameplay, graphics, and sound borrow from the classic Sonic games on the  Genesis and are successfully translated to the Game Boy Advance. The game's  single-player modes are relatively short 2-D platform rounds--each run takes two  to three hours--but replay value is added through the game's various characters.  Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy each have different abilities that make getting  through the game a unique experience.The real star here is the game's link capabilities. The Chao Garden allows you  to raise your little critters and upload them to the GameCube via thelink cableandSonic Adventure 2:  Battle. Having one cartridge lets up to four GBA players compete in one  minigame. Gamers can play two additional minigames if each player owns a  cartridge. Although the single-player game is quite good, the link options give  the title tremendous value.The only notable problem stems from the series itself: There are still entirely  too many cheap deaths resulting from the title's high-speed gameplay. You'll  find yourself zipping along a level only to be hit by an obstacle you had little  chance of seeing, let alone avoiding. Ultimately, the only way to get past these  hazards is to memorize where they are.

I'm also a fan of Starbreeze Studios so I knew I would not be disappointed with it.About the visuals.  It's very well done but I think all the elements on screen is just overkill if you are not playing this on a big 1080p screen.  I'm playing it on a 19 inch 720p display and it just seems a bit distracting to me.The story line seems good.  It takes place around 2017 I think and they did that well.  NYC still looks like the real NYC, grimy as ever but with even more neon lights which is kinda weird actually.At $20 bucks you can't go wrong with it.  Get it!UPDATE:  10 more minutes into the game.  The games actually starts in the year 2069.  I think they still did a good job of presenting what the future would like.  I'm starting the campaign over with the difficulty setting on hard.

For the hardcore gamers who are more attuned to games like Halo or God Of War this game probably won't really appeal to you as it is more for the gamers who are on the side of Mario and Sonic,  but don't let that detract you the game becomes very addictive after you start playing.  The one thing I found truly enjoyable was that unlike the previous Kirby games you didn't suck up your opponent as much as do unusual tricks to defeat them especially the boss battles which were a true joy to play as with Super Mario Galaxy 1&2 the bosses required different approaches on how to defeat them.  The graphics and soundtrack to the game are amazing and fit perfectly with the game and like SMG 1&2 you will get extra for exploring the level looking for extras or you can just cruise on through the levels to try and finish the game but I'd advise to take the time and explore.  So is the game worth the price of $50.00 dollars?,  if you're a fan of the classic Nintendo hero's like Mario,  Luigi, an the like I say a definite yes or if you're just looking for a fun family game to enjoy but if you're more of the first-shooters or hardcore graphics game than this one probably won't be for you...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2010"}

Garcia","summary":"This is a game to skip.","reviewText":"I'm not typically one to bash video games. Brink had some interesting commercials so I decided to take the plung. This is one of those games where I found myself feeling suckered.Let's start with the single player/offline mode. I was excited for the character customization. The graphics were alright; nothing stellar but I'm not that interesting in graphics anyway. Once the game started, the problems began rolling in like a tsunami. The enemies are strangely persistent, the weapons are rather lame, the upgrades aren't all that exciting, and the game just feels like it's missing something. The maps are small, the missions are essentially go here, go there, kill x. When you're playing alone, you have to rely on some incredibly stupid AI bots. Whatever though. Nobody really expects shooters to have a good storyline or offline mode.The online multiplayer aspect of this game is what absolutely kills this game. The combat is just clunky, the controls are terrible (though you can change the settings), and the classes are messed up. I have a decent wired internet connection (12mbps) and I found this game to be laggy as all hell. Even with the patch, this game is borderline unplayable online sometimes.When I popped this game out of the 360, I was especially shocked to see that BETHESDA made this game. The people who brought us Oblivion and Fallout 3. I don't know what's going on at that company, but they've been turning out bad games left and right these days (New Vegas is the only other game I've rated poorly).Bottom-line:  Just skip this game.

{"product_name":"B003Q55YCU","description":"","reviewerName":"Jon","summary":"Had promise but was disappointing, not worth the money","reviewText":"My impressions (does not include online stuff):I figured this would be more like Freedom Fighters was for the PS2, with more options as what to do when and a fun & solid storyline balancing with the action, but I ended up getting really frustrated.  After awhile playing it, my goal was simply to beat it quickly just so I'd be done with it.  As I will end with: a fun premise of a game does not necessarily translate to a game being fun.This game is difficult for the wrong reasons.  It's realistic that when you get shot you get hurt quickly, but I find that half the game you're basically just getting shot once by guys you can't see and have to hide so your health refills.  Many times the people you're following (on your team) don't help at all.  They seem to do random things: they'll just disappear and hide like cowards at the start (they're not supposed to do this), they'll run WAY beyond you so you're left wondering both where the hell they went and where the hell you're supposed to go.  I also frankly don't like games where basically the other characters treat you like a little girl and shout/bark at you the whole time then they don't do anything of use themselves, but that's more of a personal preference.Also I can't begin to guess how many times I had to head-shoot guys multiple times.  My tv is plenty big, but I still found it difficult to get the crosshairs/sights of various weapons dead-onto an enemy's head, and like I just said even when it seemed like the crosshairs were dead-on, I'd fire and the enemy would just fall back then obviously knew where I was and shoot me, rather than them dying from the evident head-shot.  And the way guys fall down when you wound them it looks like they're dead, so you turn to another enemy & inevitably get shot then hide then fight again, and then randomly the first guy you shot is still alive and kills you.I concur with other reviewers that this felt like basically PS2 graphics.The game overall felt STRANGE for lack of a better word.  When you buy this game you know exactly what the storyline is basically supposed to be (written by guy who did Red Dawn and all), but somehow it never really gets very DEEP.When one character dies somewhat early on you don't care because they were only in a few scenes - I didn't even realize they were a leader until it was referenced in a passing dialogue later on.  You learn very little about the main characters.  The game felt just sort of like, \"okey-dokey, here's briefly what happened, now that's done & Koreans have taken over (some? all? a tad bit? most? and: of the world? or just some of the world? and how much of the US?  who knows so far!  there's a small map you can look at at one point, but who knows what the hell it means.).\"Finally, it's silly to loop people critical of this over-priced disappointment together as just being fans of COD.  I don't care at all about what series it is as long as it is a fun game worth my money.  That's why I gave the PS3 game from my personal favorite series ever - Medal of Honor - a lower score, since it's so so short, and thus not worth the money.  I'm reading a lot of favorable reviews where as with favorable ones indeed for COD: Black Ops (which I also did not like), favorable reviews for this game seem to be biased and by loyalists - in Homefront's case, people loyal to the patriotic premise of the game.  This is not, nor should any reviews for any video game, ever be about patriotism or anything of the sort.  Reviews about video games should ideally simply be a person's unbiased opinion on how the game actually was and whether it's worth buying to any readers of the reviews, while mentally comparing games to other games but not actually writing down comparisons IF you're so loyal to a series that you HAVE to like it even if in reality it is not, a good game.  Homefront is not a well-made game, it was WAY overpriced for the PS2 graphics and glitchy gameplay you get, and that's plain and simply it.Bottom-line: This'll probably be one of the more harsh critiques I hope to ever do for a game.  As I said, the PREMISE of a story does not necessarily make the ACTUAL story or gameplay fun.  Rather, it makes the game that much more disappointing in this case.  I was expecting a much better quality game all the way around, but I still think Freedom Fighters for the PS2 had a much more WHOLESOME feel to it - your money would be better spent picking a PS2 up on the cheap, then getting Freedom Fighters.I'd honestly say don't pay over $10 used for this game - it's not worth your money to buy for anything over $10 BECAUSE there are other much better games out there you can buy instead.  Had great promise, looked fantastic and awesome in previews, I was really excited to get it and figured it would be epic, but ultimately I really was completely disappointed and not happy at all I spent $60 on it.  This game has WAY too many flaws to it.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000R3BNHE","reviewerName":"jmpg","summary":"Welcome back to Nightopia","reviewText":"It has been well over 11 years since the acclaimed cult classic NiGHTS into Dreams by Sega's Sonic Team debuted on the Saturn. And now after countless rumors, endless petitions, and a series of long waits, its official follow-up has finally arrived but this time on Nintendo's console Wii. Even with its glaring faults it can still manage to rekindle memories of the original and perhaps spark interest in those who have never played NiGHTS before. Two dreaming children, Will and Helen, have been having nightmares that have gotten in the way of their aspirations. They soon come across NiGHTS, a flying jester determined to rid the dream worlds of Wizeman and his henchmen, who wish to turn everyone's dreams into nightmares.CONTROLPlayers are given the option to choose from a few modes of play, either with just the Wii remote, Nunchuk style, Classic style, or with the GameCube controller (which I suggest using first, preferably the Wavebird). Your mission as NiGHTS is to fly through a series of rings and collect blue chips in order to break the capture chamber, which advances you to the bosses. You will also learn special attacks and moves that will aid you in your quests. Regardless of which control scheme you choose, the responsiveness of the controls feel glitchy at times. Controlling NiGHTS can occasionally be awkward and is missing the fluidity found in other Wii titles. Controlling Will or Helen in the platform levels can also be a bit quirky. However, no one should have any trouble adapting to any of the control schemes after a continuous amount of playtime.GRAPHICSWhen you first boot up the game you are treated to very well made full-motion-video opening cutscenes. The CG quality is definitely ranks among the best yet seen on the Wii. The graphics are also impressive in terms of level design. The designers over at Sega are definitely gifted when it comes to realizing dream worlds. Each level is quite creative. However, the framerate hitches on a frequent basis, especially during the real-time cinemas. There is also some considerable choppiness and blandness which becomes all too noticeable. Even though the whole presentation is incredibly colorful and dreamlike, it is all marred by annoying little blemishes. It makes you wonder why Sega's talented engineers could create such imaginative worlds yet not get over the technological obstacles. Still, the overall visual production is something to appreciate.SOUNDProbably the best aspect of the entire game. The music tracks are fun to listen to. They are catchy and stick in your head most of the time, and they almost perfectly emphasize the gameplay. Fans of the original game will be happy to know that a few familiar tunes and jingles have made a return in Journey of Dreams. A lot of the same trademark sound effects have also come back. A new element added in the game is the use of voice acting. Yes, NiGHTS finally has a voice. It may be blasphemy to those who think the NiGHTS character should have stayed as ambiguous as possible and others may not agree with the voice that was chosen. But overall, the sound is still far away the most impressive part of the game and proves that Sega means business when it comes to quality sound.CONCLUSIONThe A-Life feature returns, allowing gamers to look after Nightopians/Nightmarens in their own personal garden, and a 2-player match where you can battle or race against a friend. Despite these additions, many inconsistencies prevent Journey of Dreams from being a solid title. A lot of components in the game interrupt the action, such as dialogue, cutscenes, bizarre objectives, and even platforming missions, which could turn off gamers who just wanted to enjoy the sheer sensation of flight. It's also fairly short in length. In the end, this is really a three-and-a-half star game (I thought rounding it to four stars looked overgenerous). Though not perfect, it doesn't mean it's not fun. There's more good than bad. It's not the masterpiece I was hoping for but it is still mostly a fun game nonetheless. My best recommendation is to simply play the game in any you can (whether buying, renting, etc.) if you are interested in it. Please do not let my criticisms discourage you from trying it. You may end up liking it more than I did, so just go give it a chance!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00006GSO1","description":"James Bond... Solid Snake... Ethan Hunt... Based on their recent games, all these so-called superspies could stand to take a few lessons from newcomer Sam Fisher. His name isn't important; the important thing is that his game,Splinter Cell, comes from Tom Clancy's game studio and offers up the kind of sophistication and control you'd expect from the studio that brought gamersRainbow Six. It's all about the details. When Sam enters a dark area, he's got two options, thermal and night vision. Thermal lets him see the body heat of an enemy soldier, even through walls and doors. Shoot through cover with a high-powered weapon, and you can watch as the heat fades from the body. Not dark yet? Shoot out the lights. Need a distraction? Pick up and toss a tin can. Come up to a door too thick to pass thermal readings? Sneak up to it, slip a fiber-optic lead under the door frame, and peek at what's beyond. When you're ready, open the door--just a little bit at a time. WhileSplinter Celllacks a famous hero in the lead role, it does sport the famous technical military thriller author Tom Clancy in the title. And you can see the evidence of his expertise in every facet of the game. Who needs the baggage ofMetal Gear Solid 2when Tom Clancy'sSplinter Cellbrings you better weapons, better controls, better graphics, better spy toys, and a coherent story?","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"Tom Clancy Enters the Third-Person Action/Stealth Genre","reviewText":"If you played Tom Clancy's previous games, you'll know that most of them were first-person tactical shooters.  The Tom Clancy name takes a different approach with Splinter Cell and allows you to play a game heavier on story and arcade action.  If you ever played titles such as Hitman or Metal Gear Solid, you already know exactly how the game works. If that's the type of game you enjoy, I definitely recommend you pick up Splinter Cell because it's one of the best games in that particular genre.  I've never really been a big fan of those types of games so I found the game average but I'm in the minority as a lot of gamers enjoy these titles.  If you're the type of gamer that usually only enjoys fast-paced action games, you probably won't enjoy Splinter Cell as much as others.  This game requires stealth and slow methodical operations instead of fast hand-eye coordination.  I also didn't enjoy the story that much but I can see why many people would.  If you love Tom Clancy novels, in particular the ones with John Kelly, the ex-special operations soldier turned into a CIA operative, this game is for you.  For me, Splinter Cell was an average game, but that's just my two cents, many people love this game and it was so popular, the designers are already working on a sequel.  This game was released on all gaming platforms and that might be one reason why I don't enjoy it as much.  The controls and inteface seems more suited for a console gamepad and anytime you create a game with weapons and soldiers on the PC, you have to compete with all the great first-person shooters on the market.  It also lacks any type of online options.  For games like these that have quality stand-alone (not online) stories and missions but no online multiplayer or significant mod community, I usually wait until the price drops because they don't last as long as other titles, but only you know what type of gamer you are and what price is acceptable for you.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M4","description":"It's often argued that Nintendo makes the best video games in the world,  but one thing the company isn't known for is scary games. If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"C. Conard \"ExtremeAvalanche\"","summary":"Original, Spooky, and the Most Fun You'll Ever Have!!","reviewText":"I was hesitant to get Eternal Darkness simply because I thought that it would be another wasted Resident Evil look-alike that was terrible. However, after reading many great reviews of Eternal Darkness, I simply knew that I had to get it! Let me say right away that I wasn't disappointed by the game! In fact, it's the most original game to ever come to a platform, and it started a new genre, psychological horror. This genre tampers into your brain, using something known as a Sanity System. When the sanity of your character becomes low, you begin to experience things such as blood running down walls, T.V. visuals such as MUTE on and the screen going black while it says VIDEO on it, and then you go back to the game as your character wimpers. This adds a lot to the game, and it gives the whole gaming world a little something extra!In the game, the plot is consisting around three ancient artifacts and the Ancients, a powerful race of aged beings, consisting of monsters such as zombies, giant bear-looking things, and spider-like creatures known as Guardians. All of the creatures live in an ancient city, and as twelve characters spanning 2000 years, you must defeat the darkness and save the light. This is another awesome feature, where you play as anything from an ancient Roman soldier to a modern-day Canadian firefighter. You will have a variety of spells and weapons to use, such as anything from Flintlock Pistols to military OICWs. Most game do not have numerous characters, and this feature make Eternal Darkness all the more interesting. The graphics are good, especially since Nintendo had to remake them(this game was supposed to come out of N64). The sound is good, with haunting music and pretty good voiceovers. Combat can be weak, but the slashing of zombies a thousand times over with a magically enhanced sword should give you pleasure in fighting! Gameplay is smooth, and the controls are easy to get used to, much easier than Resident Evil's odd control scheme. Puzzles are complex but not impossible, unlike RE's which could take days to figure out how to solve. The game is fairly linear without much coming-and-going such as in RE, and it is definitely not as linear as first-person shooters, which is a sigh of relief! You'll find the game to be a joyful experience for any gamer out there, and if you like Nintendo games or anything with Resident Evil schemes this game may just have a place in your gaming heart!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2003"}

Antiquity (12,000 B.C.) is an age where the world is divided between people whose continent is buried in snow, and the magical kingdom of Zeal, a highly advanced civilization. The Middle Ages (600 A.D.) is an era of swords and sorcery, a dark time when the armies of Fiendlord rule over the land.The Present (1000 A.D.) is the time period in which Crono, Lucca and Marle live. It is a bright and peaceful age. However, in the Future (2300 A.D.), an era of despair has taken hold with rogue machines ruling the world.

Roman","summary":"A 16-bit classic good for new RPGers.","reviewText":"I know this review will be stormed by fanboys patrolling the page to make sure no one gives the game anything less than a 5, and vote 'no' on if this review is HELPFUL or not, which is always weird to check reviews for things you've already played. But this review comes from someone who loved Chrono Trigger when it first came out for the SNES. I had just finished Secret of Mana and Final Fantasy III/VI, and by that time, I was getting into RPGs big time. Chrono Trigger blew me away with its music, characters, time traveling story, and multiple endings. I played the bejesus out of that thing until it got to the point where I could beat the game and get the regular ending in 7 hours. But that was when I was 12. I've grown up since then. Don't take that the wrong way- I'm not saying I'm above it or anything, but these days, it takes more to hold my attention or keep me from rolling my eyes at melodramatic moments. Having played the DS port, I can only say that people who can still play through Chrono Trigger and enjoy it will get a good bargain of this version, and younger gamers (11-15) will probably enjoy it if they like the Final Fantasy series. For those who like deep stories and developed characters, look elsewhere.Chrono Trigger's plot is easy to summarize at first, but since it has a lot to do with time travel, things get crazy after the first couple of hours. You play as a teenager, Crono, who goes off to the Millennial Fair and literally bumps into a young girl named Marle. She ends up getting teleported to the past after a demonstration of a teleporting machine goes wrong. Crono risks his life and follows her. It's hard to say much more because of all the things that happen and what they lead to, but the story was very interesting for its time, and it went at a good, steady pace without moments of nothing really happening. You'll go back to the past and fight dinosaur-people that are trying to kill all humans, fight a powerful warlock trying to conquer the world by summoning Lavos (a giant creature that can destroy the world pretty quickly), travel to a time when magic was common and those that didn't have the power were reduced to hobo status, and you'll travel to the future where things are very bleak.One of the things I loved about Chrono Trigger back in the day was its cast of characters, which sadly don't do much for me anymore. Crono is the stereotypical silent hero, Marle is the stereotypical tomboy that doesn't want to live the lifestyle she inherited, Lucca is the default smart one, Frog is a cursed knight/master swordsman, Robo is your standard robot (and borderline emo), and Ayla is the generic 'me strong, me smash stuff' person. There's also another character you can choose to either kill or let join the party near the end of the game, and depending on what you do changes the ending(s) a little or a lot. Again, for younger gamers, these characters will probably be really cool. But after playing something like the Knights of the Old Republic titles and Valkyria Chronicles, the characters here just don't compare. The music is still great though, and I still have my 3 disc soundtrack for the game, and can listen to those tracks anytime.Gameplay was unique for its time, and still has some cool parts. In combat, you can have two or three characters attack an enemy (or a group if they're positioned right) with double and triple techs. These attacks are usually just plain awesome, and do huge amounts of damage. Like Final Fantasy III/VI before it, you can equip accessories that enhance your abilities in combat like reducing the amount of MP an attack costs, or raising your speed or Critical Hit %. Another thing the game had going for it was the New Game + feature. Once you clear the game, you can start a new slot using the cleared game data. A lot of games use this feature today, but as far as I know, CT started it. Using New Game + is the only way to see all of the different endings, which you can see by going to the final battle at specific points in the game via a special teleporation gate. A lot of the alternate endings are cool, and it's worth going through the game a few times to check them out.Ok ok, so what does the game have for the DS exclusives? Not a whole lot really. The animated cutscenes from the horrible load time-infested PSone version are back, but a little grainy looking. Character dialogue was changed a bit, and Frog no longer speaks in olde English. A lot of people made a big deal about this, and I can understand why since it made him stand out, but at the same time, he was the ONLY character in his time period to speak it, and in the Japanese version, he talked just like everyone else. There's also a totally new ending that, on one hand is pretty cool, but on the other is so forced to link with Chrono Cross that it's not even funny. Finally, there's a kind of Pokemon-esque monster raising mini-game that's pointless and I'd be surprised if anyone spent more than 10 minutes on it.When it comes down to it, if you still have your SNES copy, you might as well keep playing it, provided the internal battery's still working. Chrono Trigger DS doesn't bring enough new goodies to the table to make old fans part with their SNES carts. But newcomers to RPGs or those who just want to see what the 16-bit era had to offer will probably get their money's worth, and more, out of this. Again, I'm not going to let nostalgia blind me here. Chrono Trigger's good, but 'one of the best games ever made'?? Depending on how many games are allowed on such a list, I wouldn't put it on a top 50.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2010"}

After the explosive opening to the game, the beginning credits roll with a song entitled Snake Eater.  I was surprised, thinking I had already started the game proper.  But that was just the tip of the iceberg.I think Kojima did an excellent job of creating a 60s style Metal Gear game.  He mirrored the game off of James Bond, taking the beginning area, then a cool segue into the main action, including a song that has meaning to the game.  The opening theme also carries into the mission and is played at several key points.  Very effective.Also in keeping with a James Bond type influence, there's the female love interest, who has a habit of exposing her bra.  I found myself chuckling and thinking fondly of James Bond movies at many points in the game.  I think what Kojima has done so well is construct a game that truly has a cinematic flair.  Yes there are cut scenes that are long but, in comparison to MGS2, they are short and have a TON of gameplay in between.  I never once found myself sitting through a boring codec call or boring cutscene wanting the action.  There was enough spliced through.In fact, toward the end, the game raises the bar on cinematic excellence, incorporating you directly into the action while at the same time making you feel like you're watching a truly awesome scene.  I don't want to spoil it for those who play, but the last 1/3 of the game races to a truly exciting climax.I am completely amazed at how well all of the new gameplay works into the game, from the camo to the food to the healing system.  All of it naturally fits and the game does a good job in teaching you the basics with it.  I never once felt like it was a gimick.As far as negatives, sometimes the color scheme was so drab it was hard to see some people who weren't trying to hide.  In particular toward the end, almost at the climax.  Also, unlike previous MGSs who have bosses nicely spread out, I felt that they all came at once.  I didn't feel like I got a chance to really know them like in the first MGS.  But, these bosses (the Fear, Fury, Sorrow, Pain, End) are some of the weirdest and cool bosses in MGS games to date.Some people have commented on the lack of radar.  I never found this lack to be a hinderance to the game.  In fact it makes perfect sense in the context of the game world.  And, the truth is, there is a radar that you can use.  You have a motion detector, and a sonic detector that shoots sonic waves and shows you where things are.  I say things because you are in a jungle and it's possible that what shows up is an animal not a human.  Also, getting caught does result in either killing everybody and hiding, or just hiding forever.  In fact, at one point in the game, I hid in a place I couldn't be found and went to the restroom and got something to drink just to wait it out.However, this minor things aside, this game does what Metal Gear Solid 2 semi-failed in doing.  It brings together the cinematic experience with wonderful espionage.  The characters are excellent, the story far surpasses the previous two (which is a difficult thing to do since I consider the story in MGS1 to be one of the best I've experienced).  And it is just plain exciting.  Kojima and his wonderful team know pacing and the pacing of this third masterpiece is wonderful.I can't recommend this game enough.  For those jaded on MGS2 (I happened to like it), this will help bring you back into the weird world of Snake.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2005"}
{"product_name":"B002GN8HU4","description":"Gears of War 2 is the highly anticipated sequel to the 5 million-selling blockbuster action game, and one of the most popular Xbox 360 games in history.","reviewerName":"Adron Gardner","summary":"Reaver madness","reviewText":"Gears 2 was a welcome refinement over the original game.  The visuals were tightened up a little and so was the sticky button for cover, minimizing unintended  and ponderous cover moves.  Other than that, it's kinda short, barely longer than the original.  One more star could have been given for my review but for a couple glaring flaws.  First - there are too may times where I was missing the contextual button cue to do something and died constantly wondering, \"What the heck do they want me to do?\"  Really lazy game design.  Second,  there is a point toward the end where I just wanted to stop playing because of how repetitive it was.  It's pretty disappointing with enemy variety because they end up sticking you up against the Reavers (Bullet sponge mofos on Nightmare) over and over and over and over and...You get the idea.  You can extended the game by playing on Nightmare, as Hardcore really isn't all that hard, but Nightmare is pretty merciless - your mileage may vary.  On the weapon front, there's a hand full of new ones like the flamethrower and the weird mortars,  but you'll still be using the lancer most of the time to grind out Locust with the evergreen head shot master Longshot now and then.SPOILERSThe saving grace really is the end.  They junk the all too tired cliche of the end boss (Raam really was a weak way to end the first game) and instead, you go on a totally hilarious steam rolling driving a Brumack.  The problem is, the ending deserved a better game.  Sure there's chainsaws, Carmines and Dom kills his wife - which I found to be unintentionally funny - but despite the polish, this one is barely longer than the first, has a better ending, but none of the freshness.  The boss encounters - like the one lifted from Resident Evil 4 on the lake - aren't well though out and in the online component, I never liked multiplayer in any of the Gears so this one is no exception.  Learn to love the shotty because that is all you will see.  Horde mode wasn't a great idea because that is essentially what the rest of the game is.  You roll around shooting until the enemies stop coming.End SpoilersFor $20 this is a great buy - bar none worth the purchase.  But overall, this game is way overrated, I bought it when it was new and sold it after a week on eBay.  If you're a fan, then why are you reading this review?  Just enjoy the game.  It is fun, just not more than $20 fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2011"}

{"product_name":"B003ZHMMEM","description":"","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Konged Out","reviewText":"There is no question that when it has came down to the Nintendo Wii, it has been the most influential game system of this generation. Since 2006, it has had some really strong smashes that have changed the way we play video games like Wii Fit and the definitive Super Mario Galaxy. But now, with Sony & Microsoft trying to equal what Nintendo had already doen with Wii, feels a bit lackluster into what already had shown to be great games. But with a lack of great games right now, it is a good time to take a look back at some good games that have been overlooked. Donkey Kong Country Returns, has been one of the most overlooked titles on the Wii. It has been a very long time since we've seen a Donkey Kong Country game, with the Super NES era in the 90's. But now with a new title on the Wii, is it really worth the wait on the Wii, well it actually has a few rotten bananas.Donkey Kong Country Returns for the Nintendo Wii, brings in the classic fun as Donkey Kong and his sidekick Diddy Kong take on a whole a whole new adventure. This time, their banana bunch had been stolen by a bunch of vile tiki foes, who've gained control and possession of the friendly animals on the island through their hypnotic music. Now, it is up to Donkey & Diddy to save the island and rescue their friends. As they go through each level, they have to stomp on foes, uncover trasures like jigsaw puzzle pieces, and try and get special bonuses by accomplishing special feats. Graphically the game looks good, and the music brings in the classic Kong drive to hard core fans. Sadly though the control is extremely clunky, and can be very frustrating for new gamers and die hard fans to master the game. It also can be hard to get certain villians from trying to stop you. That is a far cry for gamers, who've loved the control from other Wii adventure games like Super Smash Brothers Brawl.Overall, there are some games that have had all the hype, and the fun to go with it. However, I didn't find that with Donkey Kong Country Returns. It really has honestly been a hit and miss game that should've had a bit more to master with the game to go with it. If it had better control, it would be more like a must own. With all the geared elements Donkey Kong Country Returns brought with it, there truthfully could've been more fun to be showed in the gameplay. Unfortunately for the Kongs, they've been a bit loose to make it as fun as other great Wii titles.Graphics: BSound: BControl: CFun & Enjoyment: C+Overall: C+","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000095ZH6","reviewerName":"Troy Kearney \"avid reader\"","summary":"Time to raise hell and make someone else suffer...","reviewText":"The Suffering is a game that would fall into the rather successful niche created by games like the Resident Evil and Fatal Frame series, but with one sick little twist.  This game takes psychological horror gaming to a sick and rather twisted new level.In the game you play as Torque, who has just been sent to Carnate Prison, one of the worst penitentaries in the world.  Torque was sent there for the brutal murder of his wife and two children but has absolutely no memory of the crime.  On the day Torque arrives at Carnate, an earthquake occurs that seemingly has opened the door to a hellish gateway that unleashes demonic creatures based on the various methods that were used to kill the prisoners of Carnate.  Your task: kill whatever gets in your way (human, creature or otherwise) and learn the awful truth of Carnate while escaping the hellhole, figuring out why you have a mysterious ability to transform into a monster (more on that later), and learning if you really WERE responsible for your family's deaths.Throughout the game you will encounter creatures that represent the various ways of dying in and/or escaping from prison, including creatures with blades for hands and feet (knife/shiv attack), beasts with needles in their backs and eyes (lethal injection) or guns on their backs (firing squad), creatures with half a body that drop from the ceiling with nooses around their neck (hanging), creatures that burrow underground (digging out) and one boss that has a particular affinity for-and is made nearly entirely of-poison gas (gas chamber).SO how are you going to fight them?  Luckily for you you will run into a nice little assortment of weapons to use like a shiv, shotguns, Tommy gun (machine gun used by gangsters in the 1930s), revolvers, a dual revolver set, grenades, TNT, Molotov cocktails, and more.  But what if you're in a bit of a jam and your weapon's not helping?Well you have a little something that is called an Insanity Meter that can help.  For each monster that you kill your meter will grow. If you just happen to kill a lot of mosnters in any area, Torque and his weapon will be virtually splattered with blood from the attack. When the meter is flashing, press one button and Torque transforms into a monster that can tear through enemies and shake things up if you need to.  Keep in mind that you will have to play in certain ways and do certain things to get one of the game's 3 possible endings.This game is definitely not for kids since there is a lot of bloody violence, seriously disturbing imagery and a lot of swearing.  The graphics are pretty good, even if it is a dark and slightly moody atmosphere for the game.  But another fun aspect of the game is that the shooting allows you to switch at random from third-person (which you are in most of the game) to first-person at the touch of a button.  Additionally as I was playing the game I couldn't help of think of a rather obvious pun while playing...(Hell in Carnate/Hell Incarnate)All in all, this is a game that a lot of gamers slept on initially, but now that its available for $20 this is a good time if you're not too happy with how Resident Evil: Outbreak was (I know I wasn't) and have your reservations on Resident Evil: Outbreak File #2.  So get set to (literally) raise a little hell and unleash The Suffering...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8LR","description":"WhenLuigi's Mansionwas first announced, many assumed it would  follow in the legendary footsteps ofSuper Mario WorldandSuper Mario  64. The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy. If  only it were a bit longer.--David Jenkins. --Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"tdl","summary":"Beautifully made!","reviewText":"Luigi finally gets his own game! Instead of copying Mario and jumping on Goombas, Luigi wins a mansion! YAY! But the bad news is that is haunted by ghost who kidnapped Mario. BOO! To save Mario, Luigi must vaccuum up every ghost in the huge mansion. It sounds tedious, but Nintendo packed a lot of variety into the game. The 28 mini-boss ghosts in the game have interesting personalitites. The first mini-boss ghost was reading a book in front of a fire place. The second mini-boss was the reading ghost's wife. The real boss of that area was the baby: Chauency. Chauency was VERY DISTURBING! Not only was he a baby ghost, he constanly cried and threw teddy bears at Luigi. Then he shrank Luigi and tried to squash him. After Luigi vaccuums the baby ghost, you still have 25 more to go. Each ghost has their own room, and the visuals are quite charming. At one point two ghost decide to a waltz together, and a spotlight shone on them. Another ghost was an artist, so his studio was filled with sculptures and paintings. The rustic mansion had so much charm and beauty, it can hardly be described with words. Then the musical scores. When Luigi is in the hallways of the mansion a spooky and distictive tune plays, but when he enters a room with a ghost the blaring music stops and the entire room is silent. It was a very ominous effect. The controls are a bit difficult at first, but it's fine once you get used to it. I recommened the game to anybody who likes unique ideas or anyone who just bought a Gamecube. It is slightly small, but it lasted long enough for me to save up enough for another Gamecube game. If you plan on buying the 3DS sequel it would also be a good idea to warm up with the first one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2012"}

It's the best xbox live game to-date.  However, it's not perfect.  It's not the greatest game of all time.  Most importantly, the only mark it has made on history is single day sales.That said, let's get to the bottom line about Halo 2.The Good:-Graphics-A good online multiplayer setup-Fun-Sound/Soundtrack-Dual Wielding is pretty cool.The Bad:-The Ending.-Weapons are still unbalanced, just in a different way.-Levels are still repetitive.-Some Xbox live players are, for lack of a better term, annoying as sin.-No tanks in Multiplayer (in optimatch, at least).Some Elaboration on the Bad Points:I will not discuss the ending, as to not spoil it.  It's just bad.  Really, really, really bad.The weapons are kinda irksome.  If they had left the pistol as what it was in Halo 1, it might have balanced out what they've created.  The problem is the energy sword.  Most of the maps have 1.  Short of the rocket launcher, or a well placed grenade (and that is assuming they don't hit you from behind), good luck getting off enough shots to kill someone with the sword.  Granted, if you can keep your distance, sniping is an option.  Or if you're lucky the shotgun will do it, but for the most part, it's pretty unstopable.  Which is annoying.Equally annoying is the lack of tanks in the multiplayer.  The tank balances out the warthog, ghost, and banshee.  Without it, the only balancing item is the rocket launcher.  Just seems lacking.One big complaint in Halo 1 was the levels you had to repeat backwards.  While this never happens in Halo 2, the levels themselves are internally repetitive.  For example, big room, corridor, identical big room, identical corridor, slightly different big room, slightly different corridor, etc.  There could definately be more variety.Finally, while I like xbox live and the rank/optimatch system, there are a lot of annoying people on xbox live who you'll run into.  It's unavoidable, and there's no real way to fix it, but it's there, so be ready for it.Bonus DVD: While cool, it's not essential.  Pretty interesting to watch, though, and makes a lot of sense of the news and delays we saw waiting for this game.  But, don't watch it until you finish the game, it has plot spoilers.Bottom Line: Good game you should probably have if you have xbox live.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2005"}

{"product_name":"B004L4G8UC","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A strange turn for the series actually works with fun strategy","reviewText":"The Good: Fun and full of action, each Ghost is unique, varied missions and maps, lengthy campaign, semi-decent story and characters, decent 3D effectsThe Bad: Extremely difficult even on easy, some missions drag on forever, not very deep customization wise, doesn't deliver anything new to the genre, average graphicsWhen you think Tom Clancy or Ghost Recon you probably aren't thinking turn based strategy. Ghost Recon takes the weirdest and most unlikely departure that is sure to become a disaster, but works well and culminates into a great little TBS game. This would be a great game whether it had the Ghost Recon name or not. Traditional fans of the series may cry foul or turn their nose up, but portable fans and turned based strategy fans will likely get hooked. Ghost Recon has never been known for deep or complex stories, and Shadow Wars is no exception. You play a squad of elite soldiers trying to stop a war between the Russians and Kazakhstan. Due to the lengthy campaign (a good 15 hours or so) you get an entertaining story that you actually want to see an ending to. While the characters aren't very deep you do grow somewhat attached.Of course you want great tactical gameplay in a game like this and Shadow Wars delivers. While it may not be very deep its suspenseful and has various missions that will put you on edge some times. The enemies are just regular soldiers, but as the game moves along and you level up they get tougher, and eventually you get drones thrown at you which are pretty tough against anything but explosives. Each of the six Ghosts are completely different such as one who uses a mini-gun which is good for up close fire power, Haze is the sniper, Banshee uses a cloaking device so she is invisible to everything unless right next to an enemy. You will use each ghost and rely on their powers and abilities because each mission will require you to really choose wisely on how to move about the map.Each Ghost can gain command points by killing enemies which then can be used for their special power. Duke and Banshee can use Rapid Strike which gives them one extra turn, or Haze can use Super Shot which pretty much is a one hit kill sniper shot. Of course their secondary weapons can be used this way too like grenades, or Duke's portable missile launcher. Most maps have various command flags which you can capture to earn command points for the entire squad that can be used to give a Ghost another turn, give everyone a huge command point boost, or call in an airstrike on outdoor maps for devastating attacks. You can use cover like in the regular games that will reduce damage such as going in buildings, or being next to obstacles. You also have attack range that will be reduced the farther the enemy is, but this isn't anything new to TBS players and should fit right in.While all this sounds deep it really isn't. Sure on the field you have to use your brain and decide how to move about the map wisely, because 99% of the time you're greatly outnumbered and a dumb move can cost you the game. Each map is completely different, but most objectives tend to be the same. After a mission is complete you can distribute points to level up your Ghosts which gives them more health, further movement, and more damage. You can also equip weapons, but I was greatly disappointed in this because each Ghost only gets one other option for each category and I stuck with the first one through the whole game.There are other problems like the game being way to hard on anything but easy and even then you'll fail missions a lot. Thankfully there's a save feature, but towards the end you're greatly outnumbered by enemies that take forever to kill even if you're at the highest level. I found this unfair and despite being intense by getting out with a hair of health left, it was exhausting because some levels dragged on forever. Despite these shortcomings the campaign is varied and mixes things up a lot so this kind of helped.Don't expect anything deep that you expect from most turn based strategy games, just come in expecting a lot of fun action. The game is extremely tough and doesn't offer a deep and really interesting story like most turn based strategy games do. The graphics are also nothing special even with decent 3D effects you're not going to see anything that you haven't seen in a portable TBS game. Shadow Wars is a great entry into the 3DS and will keep you busy for quite some time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Here's how to fix the freezing glitch!","reviewText":"This game is absolutely excellent. There's not much that I can add that hasn't already been said - but there is the major problem of the freezing glitch that can cause SERIOUS aggravation. I was up to level 4 and the freezing got to such a bad point, the game wouldn't load anymore and I had to restart from scratch.From checking online, and trying it myself with a new save file, it is possible to get through the entire game without a single freezing glitch. There is a \"Hero\" chest where you can store items that are not in use (armor, gloves, belts, etc....)Do _not_ fill up this chest and have your active characters carrying 20 items at the same time. Apparently this is what causes the freezing. I kept my items in the hero chest below 30 and the next time through the game, there was no freezing whatsoever.The symptoms appear to be when you attack a glowing character, or try to pick up an item from a weapons cache, these are the most common points that the freezing occurs.If this is the case, reboot the game and try cleaning out your hero chest items to below 30, and drop about 10 items out of your active party. That should clear up the problem.I'd rate the game higher, but this is a glitch that definitely should have been caught during quality control.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2005"}

(in time trials, i killed all the villains in the first level within 30 seconds; all the villains in second level in 60 seconds, all the villains in the last level within 2 minutes.) in crackdown 2, your mission isn't complete until you kill every cell member and freak, so you just grind out the mayhem until the task is done. in addition, you rapidly gain enough strength to kill freaks with a single kick or two, before they can do you any damage, so this part of the game becomes monotonous quickly. the \"cell insurgency\" plot line is never developed; it's possible to piece together a narrative by collecting sound files lying here and there, but really there is no plot complexity; the cell are just guys you kill.there is significant borrowing from other videogames or films. the massed freaks much resemble the massed zombies in \"left 4 dead\"; their deformities are reminiscent of \"dead space\". the art is now more realistic in several ways, especially in the boss battles, which disrupts the uniformity of the visual style; the heads up navigation and control interface is now more like \"grand theft auto\" (which in many ways has established itself as the videogame design standard), and killed freaks dissolve into a cloud of glowing embers, &agrave; la the vampires in the original \"blade\". (it's true, pacific city gradually brightens and cleans up as the freak campaign progresses, but here it reverts to the appearance of the original game, copying itself.) the \"audio files\" concept is taken from many other games, such as \"dead space\" or \"biosphere\" -- but they work in that context, because you run a prescripted maze of locations. in a sandbox format, you may never find the files you need to learn the narrative details.the agency director, your voiceover command line, was for me an amusing and officious character in crackdown 1. in crackdown 2 he seems less humorous and more controlling. as other reviewers have mentioned, there is an annoying tendency to tout every achievement (\"you found an ability orb! now that's an achievement!\"). there is also more repetition; fewer distinctive script lines, and these are repeated more often. worse, the game incorporates advertisements for xbox live: ability orbs are scattered around with the word \"LIVE\" on them, and if you touch one the director says \"you'll have to buddy up to get that orb!\". getting around by car is a huge chore, because streets are torn up, barriers abound and citizens are always walking in the way; if you want an agency helicopter, you can get it by ... joining xbox live!i bought many of the recent popular games in order to explore this exciting new genre. but crackdown 2 makes me think of the \"hollywoodization\" of the videogame. the industry is now so huge, the talent so quickly moving from one project to another and one company to another, the programming, art and physics engines so generic, that games resemble each other more and more. i liked the first crackdown for its originality. now i feel like i've played out the medium and it's just one hollywood horror or crime film after another. i'll check back in five years or so, and see if anything has changed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2010"}

There is only 4 'mission' types, so far at 9 hours in game, basicly you can only take over enemy strongholds and turn on energy beams, but there are several side 'missions' to power up your agent's skills.

{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"XDanteX","summary":"The Start of an Amazing Video Game Series!","reviewText":"The entire Ratchet & Clank series of video games is at the top of its class; I definitely recommend it to anyone who appreciates great gameplay and enjoyable storylines.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2013"}

I hope Square-Enix continues with this lucrative trend.  To fully appreciate FFX-2 you must be familiar with FFX.Any good RPG has compelling characters.  FFX-2's cast is...to put it mildly, odd.  Their antics range from absurdly stupid to very cool.  Overall the dialogue and voice-overs are done well.  Voices for the recurring characters sound the same as they did in FFX, which pleased me greatly.Depending on how quick you want to get through the game, completion time can take anywhere from 10-150 hours!  Most areas in FFX-2 are completely optional.  Replaying a second time is necessary to see everything, just be sure to choose new options within the story.  Luckily the function of continuing a new game with almost everything acquired in the first game makes such re-exploration painless.  More RPGs need this feature!A revamped battle system makes gameplay more fun than in most other Final Fantasy releases.  It takes the best aspects of FFVII and FF Tactics' combat and adds a faster pace.  I love it.  Utilizing the wide variety of Garment Grids, Dresspheres and accessories available never became tiresome for me.The visuals aren't anything special; pretty much unchanged from FFX.  The same can be said for the sound effects.  FFX-2's music is a mixed bag, though.  The title theme features one of the most enchanting pieces of music I've ever heard in a game.  A few other samples are also impressive, matching the onscreen events admirably.  But I found the rest of the soundtrack to be unimpressive.The lack of new environments and enemies is a tad disappointing.  75% of everything you encounter has been seen already in FFX in some form or another.As you're probably heard, the females in FFX-2 appear to be immodest where clothing is concerned.  Rikku's standard 'uniform' consists of little more than a thong bikini!  Obviously the developers thought that forcing some sexuality into the all-female main cast would keep male players interested.  Sad.Fortunately there is some real substance under the pop-singing and temporary silliness.  Those who take their time uncovering all the game has to offer will be treated to a rewarding Final Fantasy experience.  The COMPLETE ending, should the proper prerequisites be fulfilled, is especially satisfying.For FFX fans, this is a MUST BUY.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2004"}

Note: You cannot use pokemon from the gold, silver, crystal, ruby, and sappire games, not to mention FR/LG versions of the game. I used to love playing this game back in 1999, but during the time that I used to play this game, I started to realize strange coincidences that always seemed to work in the enemy's favor! For some strange reason, moves with low accuracy, such as FISSURE, that also terminates one pokemon in a single hit! Would strike my pokemon WAY to often! Just to clarify, this is how it works, FISSURE only has a 30% chance of hitting an opponent, yet it seemed to strike my pokemon every time without fail! I have been know to refer to these coincidences as \"Cheat-detectors\" Because they only seem to happen if you are literally dominating your opponent! FISSURE is only an example, these \"Cheat-detectors\" can pop up at any time and effect any attack, you may find your attacks continueously missing you opponents pokemon for no appearent reason!!! These Cheat-detectors also exist in PokeMon Stadium 2, but I am not sure if they exist in Pokemon Colosseum for the GameCube, but I'll bet that they are! This is not so much of a set-back as it is an annoyance, Cheat-detectors dont make the game impossible to win, but they do get in the way of winning as well as annoy you to no end.

Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both?

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

It used to be that we'd cruise around the block in GTA, cappin' fools and jackin Bently's. But some people think of that as to low key. InFamous \"kicks it up a notch\" by having an open world that you can scale buildings, throw gernades at cars, and suck the souls out of pedestrians. A sandbox game as a superhero.A electric bomb has gone off in the fictional city of Emprie City, killing thousands of citizens, but leaving protagonist Cole McGrath alive with electric super powers. InFamous' story cant be taken seriously at all. Just like the art of the cut-scenes, it all feels like a comic book. A really bad comic. The story of InFamous deffinitly is not the selling point of the game, but with a plot that gets progressingly worse as you go, terribly corny enimies and totally unlovable characters makes this feel like a campy remake (although it is an origional IP).Sucker Punch has been around the block a few times with the platforming series Sly Cooper, and platforming is a main aspect of InFamous as well The game also mixes a little bit of  Assasin's Creed climbing as well. Any part of a building is considered a ledge, all you half to do is just jump to it. Cole can hop, skip and parkour around the city beautifully. Although a little floaty with it's physics (feeling a little Sly Cooper-ish), InFamous has lain down a great way to platform. Being the electronic freak he is, Cole can also move around the city by electric sliding on rails and power lines. Platforming is InFamous' main feature, and Sucker Punch has masterfully exicuted this.Although bad guys are funky as could be (fiends, transients and a cult take over a town), they still cause havoc that you must stop. But hey, you got electric super powers! Combat, as fun as it is, has some major jinks to it. There's nothing quiet like tossing a car up in the air, it's gas tank, and ahniliating baddies. That's just fun. But when you're firing off your electric attacks, Cole becomes a slow moving sponge that is so eager to soak up the bullets. A really slow sponge. Good thing your health is based on draining any electric substance you can find. Transformers, telephone poles, car batteries, anything. Sucker Punch really went out on a limb with making electrical powers (lightning bolts, shock waves, even a lightning storm), each one fully upgradable depending on how you play the game.InFamous' karma system also has it's pluses and minus'. Each power you get can be upgraded differently depending on whether you play as a super hero cop or a electrical terrorist. Each base power can be upgraded so far out depending on what side you play, you have to play it twice just to see all the different goodies. The negative is that is when you show your true colours, the choices are so black and white, it's almost no fun. Should I kill the pedestrians kill an innocent man, or should I set him free? There's just no shades of grey. And none of the decisions have any impact in the story, just if you plan to play it good or evil.InFamous' core mechanics are fantastic and fun. Climbing and fighting have minor setbacks, but the good deffinitly outweights the bad.

{"product_name":"B000ZKDOV2","reviewerName":"J. Gordon","summary":"Surprisingly Fun, Ridiculous Take on the GTA Open World Crime Genre","reviewText":"When the first Saints Row came out early on in the Xbox 360/PS3 generation, Xbox fanboys crowed about its \"superiority\" to GTA: San Andreas, which wasn't surprising, given its exclusivity to Microsoft's then-new console.  The problem was that Saints Row, despite being one of the first GTA-style games of its generation, was actually behind the curve in a number of ways compared to San Andreas.  Boats had been in the GTA franchise since GTA III, with motorcycles and helicopters entering the scene in Vice City, and planes and....well, just about everything else being added in San Andreas.  All this was absent in the original Saints Row.  In addition, San Andreas gave the player essentially a whole state, with 3 cities, countryside and small towns to play around in, while Saints Row kept things in a not-so-big, single city.  In fact, San Andreas was so ambitious that it was foolhardy for people to claim that Saints Row would make anyone \"forget\" about San Andreas.  That being said, Saints Row did bring some things of its own to the table, such as HD graphics, superior controls, more solid framerates, a multiplayer option, customization and over-the-top side missions.  But the question remained how the franchise would fare in the face of GTA IV.I will admit that I gave GTA IV 5 stars in my review here, in large part due to its technical achievements and sheer immersiveness.  But in all fairness, it was also a step back.  In pursuing that \"sense of realism\", Rockstar Games may have gone too far, removing the vast variety of activities, vehicles, and other factors that made San Andreas so mind-blowing.  Several months after GTA IV's release, Volition released Saints Row 2, and you know what?  It was a major improvement in the franchise, and dare I say it, surprisingly more fun than GTA IV.  In fact, while it still couldn't quite top what San Andreas did in terms of scope, variety and ambition, Saints Row 2 actually managed to top San Andreas in terms of control and user-friendly design in some ways.  It was clear that Volition realized Saints Row 2 needed to at least try to incorporate a number of things that were missing from the first entry, and as a result, created one of the best \"B-games\" out there.By B-game, I mean a game that doesn't hit you as a \"system-seller\", or a game that doesn't even bother to try to catch your eye with cutting-edge technology.  Saints Row 2 isn't a horrible-looking game, but in comparison to GTA IV's atmospheric graphics, SR 2 was certainly behind the times, with a washed-out color scheme, and a decided lack of detail which, while providing a generous assist in terms of steady frame rates, could be best described as \"generic\".  The city of Stilwater isn't really based on any specific city, and while that does mean it comes off feeling a bit cookie-cutter, it also gives the designers more freedom to make it \"video-game friendly\".  This time around, Stilwater is a noticeably bigger place, and has more variety.  The aforementioned freedom means the developers could stick a minature mountain right in the midst of the city, throw in an Animal House-inspired university campus next to it, create an elaborate museum peninsula, complete with transplanted Greek Ruins, throw in a prison island, and power the whole lot with an island with a sprawling nuclear power plant.  Oh, and there's a trailer park area, for fans of Red County from San Andreas.  It's still only one city, and sadly there's no real countryside areas (although there's a farm and suburbs mixed in), but Volition deserves credit for trying to mix things up even while using the same city from the first game.  It also should be noted that there are a fair number of interior environments, tunnels, and canals that encourage exploration.The story itself is no great shakes (it's actually not linear enough to give that sense of progression I prefer), but does provide ample framework to put your character in some whacked-out situations.  Speaking of your character, one of the game's massive advantages over the GTA series is just how much you can customize your character.  Male or female, various different races, muscular, young, old, pretty, ugly- the character creation feature is akin to Oblivion's robust editor, and you can even change your character's physical features mid-game at the plastic surgeon's office.  There's plenty of clothing options to go along with that, and frankly makes GTA IV's character \"options\" look like a joke.  In fact, it's this concept of freedom with your avatar that translates into pure fun in various aspects of this game.  The controls in this game are extremely player-friendly, with free-aiming, zoomed aiming, a handy sprint-button, and one of the most entertaining aspects: grabbing people.  You can grab most other characters, spin them around as a human shield, and most importantly, toss them when you're done with them.  I cannot emphasize enough how entertaining it is to go around throwing people in this game, matched only by kicking them in the crotch (which you can do if you're dual-wielding firearms).In a similar vein, the game encourages you to create as much chaos as possible, by not stripping you of your weapons if you die.  You don't have to worry about being arrested either; in the world of Saints Row, the powers that be must've issued \"dead and not alive\" orders to the police.  In a sense, it almost seems that Stilwater is a sort of videogame hell, where dead bad guys from other videogames are reincarnated as hapless citizens, to be tormented by the player.  The design ethos here rewards the player for just about any decision he/she makes, whether it's car-surfing, hijacking people in their cars, pulling off stunts, mugging, or simply dressing in a cool outfit.  And speaking of \"optional\" activities, the side-missions in this game are something else.  The insurance fraud activity returns, encouraging you to injure yourself as much as possible, while the \"Fuzz\" and \"Crowd Control\" activities allow you to express your inner sociopath with the full appearance of societal acceptance.  And as for \"Septic Avenger\"....well, who knew spraying fecal matter on everything in sight paid so well?In regards to the first game's failure to look beyond cars as transportation, Volition has more than made up for that failure in SR2.  Boats, jet skis, motorcycles, helicopters (including an attack chopper), armored personnel carriers, passenger jets, and even WWI bi-planes with machine guns- you'll find them here, along with the ability to activate a parachute if you're falling from high enough. Vehicle handling, while somewhat arcade-ish, is done well enough in most cases.  The weapon variety puts GTA IV's selection to shame, while unarmed combat is quite satisfying.Most importantly, this game has been designed to be gamer-friendly.  You can replay missions you've already completed, and the \"chaos creation\" aspect of this game is tuned so well that it's comparable to Just Cause 2.  The customization aspects of the game (which also include car customization, choosing a theme for your gang, and design options for some of your safehouses) allow for a level of personal attachment that one might not expect, while the constant stream of rewards for completing missions, side-missions and activities provides motivation for staying engaged with the game (in completing 92% of the game, I've logged over 60 hours).  If GTA is a parody of the real world, SR2 is best described as a parody of a parody, and should be enjoyed as such.  There's room enough for both franchises here, and I laud Volition for rising to the challenge (which they also did with Red Faction: Guerilla, coming from the disappointment of Red Faction 2 which almost killed the franchise).  Let's hope Rockstar Games uses this as motivation of their own to bring back some of what we missed from the GTA franchise.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2011"}

You do need two Move controllers, but I recommend it for anyone who has the PS Move. Or if you don't have Move or PS3, this is a great reason to get Move or the Playstation 3.The game is deep and has not only many stages of fighting but also many levels of training. So it's not just waving your arms to get through the game. The PS Eye also tracks your head movement, so you can duck to avoid punches and punch in the lower area of your opponent. Make sure you have adequate lighting and following the set up instructions, then the motion controllers and camera will work great each time unlike some of the other people who have mentioned that head tracking doesn't work.I think this is one of the best PS Move game or even one of the best motion games out there among all consoles.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2011"}

I've made much progress over the months & I haven't gotten bored.  I talked so much about this game & balance board that my Mom (age 71) & my Step-Dad (age 84) wanted it too.  So, I bought it for them & they still enjoy it.  My grandson (age 3 & 1/2) loves it.  He's been begging to play the games on it for awhile & I recently let him (after lecturing him about how to treat the board, remote, etc. even though he's used this at his parent's house who also have it).  Well, in order to play the games, he had to be acknowledged on it.  So I created a Mii (Wii avatar) for him & it weighed him, & gave him the body test (simple quick tests to access your balance).  He did wonderfully on this & to my delight the cartoon wii board was excited that he was the equivalent of a 5 year old.  Very exciting to my grandson to be \"older\".  I didn't know it would have that programmed into the game.  See for us adults, we want to be younger so depending on how well I did on that day's body test, it'll say I'm like 24 or 30 years old (instead of my actual age of 41).  My grandson played a bunch of the games (he doesn't care about my yoga & strength exercises which I love) & yes he did get the high score over my high scores on a few of the balance games.Anyway, I love this game & how flexible I've become.  I get on it everyday & there's a graph to show your results over time of your weight & Body Mass Index (BMI).  The Wii board cartoon has encouraging words to say when you do well & if you stop in the middle of a game, it knows you did this.  Also, the board is very sensitive: it knows when you're doing a yoga pose incorrectly & will tell you.  I like the instant feedback.  It's kind of like having a trainer with you without being annoyed with a real person around telling you what you're doing wrong.  My step-kids (ages 26 - 32) have this in their homes now & their kids enjoy it.  It seems to cross over ages because there's something everyone can do.  I've been very pleased with this exercise game.  I consider this low-impact exercising & I'm very pleased with it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2011"}

I am so tired of devs not including coop because it doesn't \"fit with the story.\" That is just an excuse for being lazy and sloppy in their work. Either write a new story or just put it in anyway.

Williams \"zerokoolkw\"","summary":"A Turning Point In Smackdown History!!","reviewText":"Most annual release franchises try to dazzle gamers by adding a few new features, to a roster updated but otherwise unchanged, game. THQ and Yukes are one of the few companies that seem to take their game back to the drawing board each year and rebuild from the ground up. Smackdown vs. Raw '07 is a truly an ambitious example of this trend and the end product is nothing short of amazing!!By far the largest change this year is the completely redone control scheme. Though this can initially be very jaring to long time fans who have been using the same controls for almost a decade to play Smackdown games, it truly IS for the best. Each year THQ has been trying to give the gamer increased control over what moves their wrestler performs in the ring while still maintaining an authentic on screen wrestling matches. This year the right analog stick gives you more control over what AND HOW certain moves are performed. For example, in the past a typical turnbuckle move was to mount and punch a guy 10 times. This was performed by pressing the right combo of buttons and was followed by a canned animation. In SVR '07 you actually control how many times you punch your opponent by mimicking the punching motion and pressing up and down with the right analog stick. This may initially seem needlessly complicated but the on screen instructions make the appropriate button presses apparent in all environmental situations.The season and GM modes have also been improved upon but to me the most exciting changes were done to the create-a-entrance mode. You can now watch entrances AS you make changes and you can actually control the timing on fireworks and camera moves!! WOW!!The graphics and sound are as good as they are gonna get on the PS2. It's hard to explain but the moves seem to \"chain together\" better than in past games. For example, reversals aren't so obvious and thus harder to counter. You'll think you're executing a move perfectly until Oops, you're laying on the mat wondering what happened. The wrestler models are slightly closer to their real life versions this year. The commentary though, mostly the same seems to have been expanded upon for more action specific comments. Instead of JR commenting on the fact that you are beating your opponent, he'll talk about the powerbomb you just executed. The wrestlers themselves also make noise as well when wrestling (hooray for grunting) . The only negative criticism I have relates to loading screens. While this has always been an issue on the PS2, loading seems to take extra long this year (probably because of all of the improvements). In some cases you'll wait 20 seconds on one load screen only to go to the next load screen.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2006"}

{"product_name":"B001BP4JY6","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"Learn the ways of the ninja... or suffer many frustrating deaths","reviewText":"I know I'm a bit late to the roller coaster ride known as Ninja Gaiden, but I finally made it. Ever since I played Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening I've used that game's difficulty as a benchmark to which I compare the difficulty of other games. I have several games that range from challenging to difficult, such as Jak II, Jak 3, The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction, Prototype, and of course the original Devil May Cry and Devil May Cry 4. However, none of those games came close to the extreme difficulty of DMC 3... but then along came Ninja Gaiden Sigma. I've never played the X-box version, so if you want comparisons between that one and the PS3 version, then look somewhere else. Anyway, this game is as hard as the legends say, a close cousin to DMC 3. Ninja Gaiden Sigma is all about relentless, brutal, fast paced, in your face action that will constantly demand players to be at the top of their game; the second you slow yourself down or relax... you're dead. You are Ryu Hayabusa, wielder of the legendary Dragon Sword and leader of the Hayabusa Ninja Clan, and after his village is decimated by evil forces, Ryu goes on his quest to retrieve the stolen Dark Dragon Blade and take his revenge on those who have royally pissed him off. The story is your basic cookie-cutter affair which was quite literally just tacked on to this game for necessity's sake.There's basically no character development and the plot is thinner than a reality t.v. modeling contestant. You'll find more story elements in the game manual than in the actual game itself, and Ryu literally has only about 10 to 15 lines of dialogue in the game... the ENTIRE game. But I knew going in that the focus of NGS was the gameplay, so I won't hold the lack of story against it. Ryu is a deadly, modern day ninja who is a master of weaponry and ninpo (ninja magic), but his enemies are just as deadly. He'll fight other ninjas, samurais, soldiers, cyborgs, and ugly monsters known as Fiends; and they're all a bunch of supreme jerks. Knowing when to stop attacking and then go to blocking and dodging are the keys to survival in this game, and it must be done with PRECISE timing. From the lowliest enemy soldier to the most powerful of Fiends, all the enemies in this game will beat the crap out of you repeatedly, until you pick up their patterns and learn when to slash and bash them to pieces. Ryu is certainly not short on weaponry with which to do terrible things to his enemies: he'll have a sword, twin swords, a staff, flails, shurikens, a bow and arrows (normal and explosive), and more. He'll also use his ninja magic to attack enemies with fire, ice, and lightning spells.You also play a few missions as Rachel, a Fiend Hunter with a large hammer and a pair of honkers that are nearly just as large. Her attacks typically do more damage than Ryu's, but she's also comparatively slower, plus she can't wall run like Ryu can. Out of the 19 chapters in this game, you only play as Rachel for about 4 of them, which was enough. Even though Rachel's strong, her more limited mobility and the fact that she only has one main weapon makes it easier for enemies to adapt to her attacks and get around them. Ryu's many different weapons offer him numerous styles of attacks and certain weapons work better against certain enemies, making him a superior warrior all around. Aside from slaying enemies, NGS has many puzzles for players to tackle, most of them involving finding special items to activate machinery and open doors. Since several of the levels you go through are interconnected and the game isn't always very specific about what your next goal is or where your next destination lies, you may find yourself getting lost from time to time. As difficult as this game is, it probably wouldn't have been quite so infuriating if the camera wasn't out to get you just as much as your enemies. It can be adjusted most of the time, but other times it is fixed... unfavorably. Several times, especially during the boss battles, Ryu was knocked towards the camera, then he disappeared from sight and was ruthlessly pummeled offscreen. Even during a couple of the platforming sections of this game the camera annoyingly looks away from the next spot you need to jump or wall run to, usually leading to Ryu falling into a conveniently placed pool of liquid hot MAG-MA!Even learning how to properly make Ryu dodge and jump correctly takes time to get used to, but once you do it makes things easier (somewhat). Save points are frequent enough that even when you die, you normally won't have to replay too much before you get back to where you were killed. I was greatly annoyed however at how the game no longer gives you access to an upgrade statue in which to buy things like health items and arrows during the last two missions, even though you fight many enemies and bosses in a row. Also, the fact that Ryu is unable to absorb soul essences from fallen enemies while he is blocking and attacking is just plain stupid since you really need that stuff to gain health, magic, and currency. Those are just downright sadistic gameplay mechanics. Again, much like Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening, Ninja Gaiden Sigma is brutally difficult and cheap, but it can be very rewarding when you're finally able to defeat the very tough enemies that are thrown at you. So all in all, this game is fun and has lots of cool looking characters and enemies, with plenty of fantastical ninja swordplay. NGS is not for casual gamers and is more fit for hardcore masochists; I fall somewhere between casual and hardcore, so if you're like me, it's probably better that you play this game only if you're a big fan of ninjas and action games in general. Either way, be wary.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2011"}

The main mechanic of the game was a novel idea when it was first release; you can play couch Co-op with a friend, you duck, cover and shoot. Very reminiscent of Gears of War.Army of Two has an \"Agro Meter\". The player that is being the most agressive; by firing too much, killing lots of enemies and even the type of weapon their using will determine the amount of \"Agro\" they build up. Thus the enemy A.I. responds more aggressively to this player, while pratically ignoring the other player (that has Agro.)This Agro feature allows for flanking maneuvers, and allows for good strategic gameplay. At the same time it is limited by the level designs which are very linear. You can only go to certain paths on the game map.The cover system in inconsistent. Sometimes you'll stick to cover. Other times you'll have a hard time hiding as your character doesnt seem to cling and instead you'll slide out to get shot at.To make matters worse. The shooting mechanic (the main point of all shooters) feels slow and clumsy. Its frustrating to aim a spot and have the enemy move away because THAT'S how slow it really is, even on the highest control sensitivity.Although the music is very good, the sound effects of all the gunfire sound very similar! That's just plain laziness on whomever did the sound effects.The enemy A.I. Is rather competent other times it can be absolutely brain dead, by not reacting to you even though you are in front of them or running in their general direction.You're partner A.I. has the ability to heal you if your wounded, but sometimes it will drag you into the line of fire, resulting in both of your deaths. Sometimes it gets preoccupied in shooting the enemy even though you order it to heal you. Instead you will bleed out and die due to its stupidity.Playing with your friend Co-op is almost a must so you dont have to experience that type of AI stupidity. And there are a couple of fun levels, where you pilot a hover craft, or that require that do a back-to-back shooting frenzy.Using the Agro feature is even better when playing with a friend, but it still has a finicky cover system, slow aiming and shooting, which really hinder the gameplay.Because of these major flaws I cannot recommend the purchase of Army of Two; especially now that better cover-based shooters are available on PS3, including the two sequels: Army of Two 40th Day, and Devils Cartel.Pros:+Agro meter+Cover based shooter+Couch Co-op+Weapon customizationCons:-Clumsy controls-Slow aiming-All gunfire sound similar-Brain dead A.I. partner-Cover system is inconstant-Ugly old school graphics","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2014"}
{"product_name":"B006WQR3OM","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"An incredibly fun game that balances complexity with accessibility","reviewText":"Although I purchased XCOM: Enemy Unknown to play on my PC, I'm extremely happy that this game was released on consoles as well.  This is the exact type of game that is needed in the console landscape...a turn-based strategy game that puts a huge amount of responsibility in the hands of the player, yet does so in a way that is accessible and easy to get into.XCOM: EU re-imagines the classic and beloved PC strategy game for modern audiences.  You assume the role of the Commander of XCOM, a secret, international group that rises to the challenge of repelling an extraterrestrial invasion of Earth in the near-future.  In this role, you serve two major functions: overseeing the development of XCOM's base, and directing small teams of soldiers in direct combat with the alien hostiles.  The base building and development is the part of the game that will take the most getting used to for newcomers to the strategy genre.  You are in charge of every detail of XCOM's operations, including what scientific research is conducted, how soldiers are trained, what new gadgets and tools are engineered, and what countries you will protect, as you seek their funding and assets in exchange for protection.  Once the initial shock of the overwhelming nature of your role settles, you'll appreciate how well put together this part of the game is.  The interface and menus are very easy and quick to navigate, and your team of advisers will always be there to help guide your decisions.  It's incredibly satisfying to watch your base develop from a small, desperate group of teams into an incredibly powerful fortress of technology, weaponry, strength, and innovation.The combat segments of the game will likely be easier for newcomers to pick up, but will also eventually prove to be incredibly challenging as the game progresses.  The game shares many characteristics with RPGs, as you assemble squads of soldiers of various classes, each with their own skill trees that are filled as the soldiers gain experience in combat operations.  The combat, despite being turn-based, is extremely intense and exciting, as the prospect of your beloved soldiers dying in combat, never to return, constantly hangs over the battlefield.  However, similar to the base-building portion of the game, winning a major battle against overwhelming odds never ceases to deliver huge doses of satisfaction.  This is especially true of the way the combat directly ties into your research projects back at the base.  That alien you managed to capture alive rather than kill?  Your interrogations of that creature helped develop a new ability that you were able to teach your soldiers, which ended up saving their necks in the next huge battle.  XCOM: EU is filled with moments like this, and it makes this game one of the most satisfying, addictive, and purely enjoyable games of 2012.XCOM: EU was perhaps a risky game to make in today's climate.  Fans of the older PC game may call this a simplified or watered down version of their beloved title.  And the game may appear to be too complicated for console gamers who have been playing games that have, by and large, gradually been becoming more and more simple as the number of gamers worldwide continues to multiply.  But I believe that both groups would be wrong in those assumptions.  XCOM: EU is one of those rare games that does very little wrong.  It is unique that given its incredible depth, it manages a level of accessibility that actually makes it a very welcoming game for any open-minded gamer out there, whether they be a newbie or old school.  It's refreshing to see a game like this hit both the PC and the console platforms, and I sincerely hope we see more big budget projects like this in the future.  This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite releases for 2012.  It is deep, challenging, and rewarding in ways that few AAA, multiplatform-released games are nowadays.  Give this game a chance if you're on the fence, and let these publishers know that we want to see more stuff like this in the gaming landscape.  You won't regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2012"}

They put an amazing amount of work into the art and design of the game, and it shows. The world you work through feels *real*.In many ways this is obviously a version of Halo. The large selection of weapons, the four types of grenades, the great comments the characters make, the fighting-space-enemies in a futuristic environment. This isn't a bad thing - Halo was an incredible game and Brute Force shares many of the same great qualities.And Brute Force takes it a step beyond. In Halo, you had great AI teammates to help you out, but no real multiplayer. If you had local co-op, you had two Master Chiefs. In Brute Force, there are four distinct players. When you're playing single player, you can swap amongst them, using whichever one has the best skills for the task. The other become your backup, following your orders and supporting you.But multiplayer is where this game is truly amazing. The game is very obviously created for multiplay, with the multiplayer options being integral to the game. Set up your system link and join multiplay games of all varieties, choosing your favorite character and weapon combination to truly customize how you play. Speed is blisteringly fast, and many players out there are already top-notch.Where the built in campaign is amazingly fun and can be played (if Halo is any judge) for months on end, the fact that multiplay gives you endless players and new downloadable maps means the game could in essence be played ... forever!Highly, highly recommended for anyone who loved Halo.

I was extremely excited to play, as it seemed to have all of TOS's gameplay mechanics with a new story and characters.Well, call me disappointed to say the least. Sure, all the ingredients are here for a great RPG, but the chef has left the building. TOS's unique, charming characters and dialogue have been replaced by bland sterotypes and endless conversations that I could have predicted after the first sentence. Here's a hint, Namco: Gamers like to play as people that they actually LIKE. There's nothing fun about having as a party a perpetually angry teen (who looks like a mutant), his nauseatingly sweet sister, a bland older man who could be everyone else's babysitter, a whiny female knight, a \"cowboy\" with a stupid accent...the list goes on and on.Gameplay is similar to TOS, but it's dumbed-down and feels like an endless pattern of \"go here, talk to some people, run around these corridors, get into a battle, mash the buttons to win, repeat...\" And the random encounters were irritating--I would have liked to see my enemies before battling.Overall, it seemed that Namco wanted to duplicate its previous RPG success, but failed to add that extra kick and charm.

Sly and friends move quickly but not too quickly (where in some games characters can feel jerky and over-eager), and the points you can jump to are perfectly recognized.  Also nice is the slight move in perspective while sprinting, etc.  As far as controls go, it couldn't be better.The various environments you travel to are entertaining and fun to look at.  The exception, while gorgeous to look at, is the 10,000 BC section.  Your hideout is positioned where it's almost impossible to get any treasure back in time.  After a few attempts (saving just before, then reloading after failing) with some of the easier treasures, I gave up on getting them for that level at all.  The exception to those perfectly recognized \"touch points\" are the mushrooms, which you fall off of more than bounce from.  And there's one you need to use right under the hideout.Speaking of visuals hinted at above, wow, it's a great looking game!  Of course the environments have a cartoonish feel, but that doesn't detract from the attention to detail and vivid colors.  Everywhere, even the sandstone-dominated old west, looks alive, colorful and fully detailed.Sly's ancestors are fun, too.  Each has a specific ability and it's fun to mix things up a bit.  A lot of dialogue is pretty entertaining, too, especially (although I wouldn't have expected it), the over-anxious, storm-the-castle medieval knight.  Also, the the Arabian ancestor's sneak attack is downright laugh out loud funny.The bad points for me, besides the 10,000 BC hideout problem mentioned above, is every second I'm made to play someone other than Sly or his ancestors.  Bentley and Murray are in a near tie for the worst video game character ever devised award, with the edge going to Bentley for his incredibly obnoxious voice.  I have to admit I'm a little biased this way, because I feel the same way about being forced to play Clank in the Ratchet and Clank games, but at least Clank isn't annoying beyond belief by nature.  Some say they add variety, I think they just get in the way.  I'd rather have a short cut scene where they take care of business instead of having to play them.A lot of people have complained about the mini-games (mostly hacking as Bentley, but also a few with our 10,000 BC cave racoon and other chacters).  Yes, they were a bit annoying, but I don't think they were as bad as some make them out to be.  One mentions the egg-balancing challenge in particular, but I got through that on the 1st try.  You need a steady hand on the controller (it's a six-axis, tilt-your-controller challenge).In summary, I'm won over.  I'm definitely going to play this again.  Sly's ancestors are very fun, each in their own way, and I'll tolerate having to play the others again just for the rest of the game, which is just plain excellent.  As usual, you'll probably need a walkthrough or book to find all the bottles and masks, but the treasures aren't all that important to me (although some do increase your skill in one area or another).  What's way fun about this game is simply sitting back and playing it, and that's what really counts in the end.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2013"}

Rather than go all out and spend the money and energy to make the game better than the competition, they basically eliminated the competition by being the only choice for the gaming public. Thanks a lot, EA.My opinion is that NFL2K5 was better than Madden 2005, at least for the PS2. Superior in graphics, game play and price (at only $19.99). Sega finally did good and seemed to correct a lot of what people disliked about previous versions of NFL2K. I'm sure they would have only improved with the 2006 version, but EA knew that they had to do something drastic before the 2006 rolled around. And they did.Anyway, on to the game. I have to say I was relieved that EA didn't just sit on their butt and allow the series to swirl down the drain. The graphics are at least better than last years version.The passing game is probably the most drastic change. Now, to add to the realism, your QB's passing accuracy is affected by his vision. Your QB has more or less a \"headlight\" which shows which direction you're looking. This may improve the accuracy of the pass, and add to the realism, but if you're playing head to head, it would seem that you're basically telling your opponent \"here's where the ball is going\". You can switch your vision to another player fairly easily, and the better your QB (compare Brett Favre to Charlie Batch) the better your vision. This is a nice touch and does add to the realism.Another new feature is the create-a-player which goes so far as to actually have you choose the PARENTS of your player! It's a nice touch, and my brother said it's fun (I haven't tried it yet), what are they saying here? Good genes equal a good player? That might be true in some instances, but what is this teaching here, that if your dad isn't a neurologist and your mom isn't a chemical engineer (if in reality your dad works at the local movie theater and your mom is a waitress), you're not going to turn out to be a good athlete? Give me a break. Half of the NFL have sob stories about their upbringing, and spent most of their time in jail. So if Madden is going to add extra realism to their games, why not add a parole officer or the occasional drug test?The background music continues to suck. I am so tired of rap and alt-rock music in the Madden games! You want big name artists to participate, fine, get AC/DC for \"Back In Black\" or some good old rock tunes that you might hear at an actual game. You're telling me you're going to hear crap like \"Chamillionaire\" or \"Memphis Bleak\" at a real game?? Maybe in the player's cars when they drive off, but not during the game! It couldn't possibly cost that much different to get decent music. One nice thing about the NFL2K series is they had their own original background music, no famous artists.Tecmo Bowl for the NES and even SNES was a classic. Cheesy music, poor graphics, but FUN!! If Madden kept the god-awful music and extra junk hogging up memory like the previews to other games, tutorials...etc..., nobody would ever complain about there not being any competition.If you want the most up-to-date version with current rosters, this is the game to get. It's either that or continue to play last years versions and make a bunch of trades or pretend it's last year! Thanks EA for the big menu out there!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2005"}

Go away!","reviewText":"I am a big fan of the original Batman AA as it truly put you in the role of 'dark' knight more so than any movie or comic book I've read. With the release of Arkham City things just got exponentially more awesome and darker!Imagine Arkham Asylum as it was in the first game then place it in a fairly large city then allow for free roaming and you have B:AC. It's just so cool to explore the areas on the rooftops and on the ground and everywhere in-between in this amazingly massive area. An area huge not necessarily in terms of pure acreage but more in terms of depth and places to explore. You can go down to the sewer and lower or just flit around the rooftops and anywhere else that takes your fancy. All of your favorite belt utilities are back along with some new ones and exploration and collection are perfectly combined with the main storyline and sub-storylines. If you don't fancy following the main route then go off and have a blast at your leisure but everything is so engrossing that you'll find yourself following the plot a lot more closely than in most free-roam games I'd say.Riddler's puzzles and the lime green ? are back and are more devious than ever and the interaction with batman's enemies is always a joy and quite layered. The story isn't a case of Riddler, Joker, Mr Freeze etc versus the Batman; it's much more convoluted and clever and the design and backstory of each antagonist is exquisite.Now I do have two caveats - one, graphically the city is muddy. It's hard to describe but maybe there's too much bloom or blue/grey combos but it's sometimes difficult to discern exactly where you're going when you're gliding at mach 1. Texture pop-up is also prevalent especially if you land in an area that's yet to be cached. If I had room on my 20GB HD I'd install it - perhaps that would help.My biggest complaint is not directly about the game itself, but about the decision that the publishers made to cripple it with an online single-player code. Catwoman is an important part of the story and the action, she's not just a skin with the same abilities as batman. Some areas and trophies are only accessible to her but in order to activate this important part of the game you have to put in the supplied one-time-use online code. This is simply unacceptable and I genuinely would not have bought B:AC had I have known about this. When I pay for a game, especially a single player game, I expect first-sale doctrine to apply. Should I use the code to open Catwoman then the value of my purchase is immediately diminished. So I can choose not to be able to play for a good chunk of game that I've paid for or choose to have the resale value of MY game halved. A star off for that and frankly if I was in a worse mood I'd knock two or three. Beware if you buy a use copy of B:AC that you will almost certainly be paying extra to open up parts of the game that you thought you'd already just paid for.Aside from all that, B:AC is an amazing game crammed full of extras and many, many hours of fun. I also have to mention that of the three 3D games I own now (Crysis 2, Gears 3 and now Batman:AC) that this game looks utterly drool-inducing in 3D. Best use of stereoscopic imagery in a game so far - not dark or blocky like GoW3 and not too narrow on the eyes like the headache inducing Crysis 2. If you have a 3D TV set up then this is the game to show it off.Great sequel to an already great game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2011"}

Each character kills Seth in the end, including Seth.The gameplay is well suited for the 3DS. The brand new C-Pad, which is new to not only Nintendo but all video games, is very easy to move for all the moves that characters can use.

Each animal has a unique mode of operating, which means that the two interconnected narratives behind this game each offer their own distinctive challenges to conquer.As the armored, action-oriented scorpion, you'll string together stinging blows into deadly combo moves that culminate in cinematic finishes and decimate your opponents. Playing as the sneaky tarantula requires a little more finesse--you'll find yourself leaping from above onto your nemesis, throw out neatly aimed shots of webbing to paralyze your prey, and finishing creatures off with your devastating fangs.Wild Enemies and a Sinister Back StoryIt takes skill and composure to master the moves the scorpion and tarantula have at their disposal. And, even after you think you've got every move down, you'll find you need to learn methods, since these life-and-death struggles take place between you and a huge array of vicious, hazardous creatures, including wolf spiders, rattlesnakes, Gila Monsters, Tarantula Wasps, black widows, mantises, enemies of your own species, rats, and even humans.Beyond the immediacy of fighting for survival, this game features a story of greed and betrayal in the human world. Slowly unveiled from the disparate perspectives of the two headline creatures, this evolving storyline helps keep even advanced players engaged and guessing at the implications of their own actions.Explore Brutal, Unforgiving EnvironmentsWhichever creature you're playing as, you'll have 360-degree access to a wide range of 3D environments based in the harsh Sonoran Desert. You'll explore a gloomy maze of thorny brambles, forgotten underground tunnels filled with rusting pipes, an above ground wasteland packed with people's garbage, and even a desolate gas station. Each arena promises to challenge your skills as a hunter and a survivor in its own way, while unique angles and a sense of scale that turns small, familiar objects into major obstacles help make these environs especially prickly.","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A great idea that is poorly executed","reviewText":"The Good: Highly detailed creatures, lots of moves to unlock, great combat system, some epic momentsThe Bad: Retarded story, bland ugly environments, repetitive, just gets way too hardI remember talking to my family years ago about a game where you can play as a bug, animal etc instead of a human or some other form of biped. THQ finally delivered with an interesting concept of playing as a tarantula or scorpion in Deadly Creatures. The game is about some guy who killed another guy and said deadly creatures did it...yeah not very interesting, but Dennis \"King Koopa\" Hopper and Billy Bob \"Major Pervert\" Thornton voice as the two hicks in this game, but it makes me wonder where this low-budget game got the money for that.Anywho, you start out as a tarantula crawling around in a desert trying to find nests of real life enemies such as tarantula wasps and different types of lizards and scorpions. All represent real life creatures and are as gross as their real life counterparts. While you're skittering around as either the tarantula or the scorpion you can walk up on walls to collect grub to slightly add health while also unlocking concept art. There are crickets and grasshoppers to give you health while bright green ones permanently increase your health. When it comes to combat this is where things get interesting. You can use the A button for your basic attack than combo from here with a wiggle of the Wiimote. You can shoot your web to stun enemies, pounce on enemies, and if you're the scorpion you can even flip that Wiimote upside to bury underground then turn it up to pop out and attack your enemy. The control scheme is fairly neat, but there were a few moments when the controls wouldn't respond unless you hold the Wiimote a certain way. Among these moves you can slowly unlock more by leveling up such as being able to climb on ceilings (passive moves), or the ability to burrow under designated areas. Along with these you can unlock an \"execution move\" which will display buttons to press for cinematic camera cuts, and this can be pretty epic.Some moments in combat can actually be pretty epic such as the rattlesnake and tarantula fight (as seen on the cover). Some moves are button timed sensitive which is used for great cinematic camera cuts. While that sounds like that's all there is that is really true. The whole game is combat based and there's not much in terms of variety. The level design is a bit funky since it can be hard to find out where to go thanks to the bland brown environments which makes it hard to figure out where to go. There are a lot of invisible walls, and just certain places you can't climb. You have cacti blocking your path, cracks in walls, and even some collision detection issues where if you move to far to the side of a log underground you creature will just stick to air for a second then fall off and die. There are certain obstacles each creature must overcome such as jumping for the tarantula, and digging for the scorpion, but these don't pose as too much of a problem.My main gripe about the game is that it's too damn difficult when it comes to larger creatures to fight. There are no hints on how to beat these guys and it just makes things so impossible and frustrating especially when the guys take forever to kill. The environments tend to be a little cramped and it may take a long time to use every move on the enemy until the right one kills them. Some enemies must be turned upside down, some have to be stunned etc.When it comes to looks and sounds the graphics are just OK with flat textures, and everything is really brown. The creature models are highly detailed with excellent lifelike animations, but that's about it in the looks department. The sounds the creatures make don't seem to sound accurate, but hey this was kind of an experimental game anyways. I really hope THQ makes another game in the series or someone else picks up on the idea. There is a lot of potential here and I hope the idea doesn't die.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

The larger maps don't fit Call of Duty style. The spawns are still bad. I can appreciate no more deathstreaks but the new killstreaks are just stupid. A guard dog that launches at anyone nearby for such little kills? And once again, it takes less and less bullets to kill an enemy.

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level.

The graphics are great, and horrible at the same time. Even with their brightness turned all the way up, through half the game (dungeon crawling) you can't see them. It brings back that old 'pea soup fog six feet in front of you' feel that the original game suffered from. While you do get a flash light, it doesn't help very much - it turns 'bad' to 'almost as bad'.The combat system and controls are phenomenal! The previous games were almost unplayable due to dodgy camera and character controls. You can walk and shoot at the same time, you have two forms of melee attacks. Multiple weapons.The voice acting is hit or miss, usually during the same dialog. One character's dialog sounds like he's welcoming kids to Mr. Rodger's neighborhood, while the other guy's dialog sounds like he's passing a stone while giving his kid driving instructions: imagine Jack Bower interrogating Barny. The worst part is that you can't skip it. For example, right before you fight a boss, you usually speak to some mentally unstable sort. Annoying and incongruent dialog follows. After the dialog, you battle the boss, die (get used to dieing at least the first time you fight a new boss), and it's check pointed you right before the unskipable dialog.Most bosses are pretty easy to kill ONCE you figure out their pattern; on one hand cool (because it takes thought), on the other hand, it's like battling one of the Chuck E.

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A Criminally Underratted Mario Masterpiece","reviewText":"Super Mario Sunshine is a black sheep, an odd duck, a quirky gemstome. SMS is one of those games that takes an incredibly successful formula from Super Mario 64 and makes just enough weird tweaks that it feels like a game that is amazing, but in an odd place placed next to its predecessor and successor in 3-D Mario lore.The story is the first strange difference. No longer is Peach the helpless damsel in distress that spurns Mario's quest. Sure, she gets kidnapped a few times throughout. However, this game is about Mario's vacation ruined by an evil doppelganger who has become a vandalizing, littering fiend on Isle Delfino. When Mario arrives, he embarks on a subsequent adventure to clear his name while restoring sunshine to his tropical island vacation destination. Sounds bizarre, doesn't it? Yeah, it is, but for some reason it works! I enjoyed it quite a bit and some familiar elements do come into play, but even those are employed in unexpected ways. It made the story aspect of the game a little more interesting than the run-of-the mill Bowser-kidnapping-Peach Mario story we're all used to (not-really-a-spoiler-but-kind-of: it does go in that general direction eventually). Granted, story is not the most prominent theme in any Mario game, obviously. However, this one is compelling enough, and pretty clever.Because of the tropical vacation premise, Mario's adventure is entirely confined to Isle Delfino itself. OUT are the magical portal paintings of various settings, like in Mario 64. IN are very diversified levels, but all of which sport some sort of Tropical Island motif. Again, this is NOT a bad thing, and I have tremendous nostalgia for all of the levels of Super Mario Sunshine! From a family vacation theme-park,  to a bustling and charming seaside port, to a magical cove filled with native citizens with seashells for clothes and massive shells for homes, plus MANY more, EVERY level is incredibly unique, memorable, and FUN! Even after all these years, I still goosh over the ridiculously killer level design and unique challenges to get the sunshine.The gameplay is another thing Sunshine does different. Sure, the super intuitive, responsive acrobatic controls are all still in Mario's repertoire; but there is a huge wrinkle in the gameplay in the form of the FLUDD canon, a backpack water pump that Mario uses to clean the goop and grafiti that \"Shadow Mario\" left in his mischievous wake. The FLUDD's mechanics are easy to grasp and it is a BLAST to use! It is always surprising and awesome, how the FLUDD comes into play when solving the game's numerous puzzles, boss fights, and anything else you can think of! The Starshine bits to collect all have unique challenges that are always fun, and quite varied. This game really does build on the brilliant ideas first created in Mario 64, and later continued in Super Mario Galaxy 1 & 2. Even Yoshi makes an appearance or two, but he is the only thing not implemented very well.The graphics are all amazing, in that immediately distinguishable, stylized Mario sort of way. The different levels are all unique and colorful, and the animations are great! The sound effects are top notch and, as in any Mario game, the music is catchy, memorable, and excellent. I have no complaints in these regards.Super Mario Sunshine is a special game I hold near and dear to my heart. Many people dissed it when it first came out, but I gave it a fair shot, and was NOT disappointed. Even all these years after, Sunshine is a game that captures the heart of the 12-year-old that played it way back when, and the heart of the 20-year-old gamer who loves great games, period. Even now, I would recommend buying this fantastic 3-D Mario black sheep, and enjoy it even amongst the current generation bests. It does so many things differently than you'd expect from Mario, but it does them as masterfully as any mainstay element of the classic Mario games, and feels just as special as a result. Buy it, play it, LOVE IT!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"CKE","summary":"Not too shabby","reviewText":"This is a fun, cute game that offers many hours of enjoyable play. The basic premise of the game is the standard stuff... the world is coming to an end, bad people have taken the girl, and YOU are the chosen one who has the &quot;Gift&quot; to make it all better. See pretty standard stuff.However, there is some non-standard stuff here too! First of all, the game is fun. Sure it is cheesy and it was (mostly) made for 12 year olds but it is still playable. Second. the blend of Disney characters adds a nice touch and helps to keep you from getting bored. This is one of the few games that succeeds in making you believe that you are watching a movie. Finally, the game has that &quot;addictive&quot; factor and you will find yourself up way past your bedtime!.Cons-1-  The camera angles can be horrible. This is the only reason for &quot;4&quot; stars instead of &quot;5&quot;. There are times when accomplishing certain tasks is more about figuring out how to get the camera angle right than the actual task.2- It seems like if you didn't have the $15 manual you may be lost. Some of the items you need are a little hard to find, and without the manual you may be out of luck!All-in-all I would recommend this game. Think of it as Dark Cloud with Donald Duck and Goofy! There is some frustration involved, especially when you are trying to figure out how to get the cameras to work in your favor, but it is still worth the $20!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2004"}

As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels.

{"product_name":"B00BGAA0SU","description":"","reviewerName":"Jeffrey Owens","summary":"The Series Continues to Better Itself","reviewText":"I have beaten this game twice, and I can say with full conviction that this game is a solid title. It has a smooth frame rate, with very rarely any hiccups that I have noticed. This game looks phenomenal, using the power of the PS4 to make a great looking game that is extremely enticing and immersive. Being from Seattle, Sucker Punch nailed their home town into a video game format, and then some. Personally, I feel the love in their city by how much detail they placed into the city, how much detail they put into the citizens, the environment, and so on. Each power looks amazing as well; each has a distinct look, color scheme, and effect on the environment in the form of color, particles, and residue of power left over, ie. Karma moves aftermath. Each power also has a separate color scheme based on the morals you chosen throughout the game. The sound is easily my favorite part of the game, funny enough. I think the sound of a game can either break all immersion a game has tried so hard to make, or it can sink the player deeper into the world the creator has made. This game nails the sound and feel of the game's world; the soundtrack is extremely memorable and exciting, the powers in the game each have a specific sound that adds to the immersion of the game, with each creating a different impact upon the player (for me, each power left a different and specific impression thanks to the color, the sound, and the textures of them). But seriously, the OST for the game is so great, I probably will end up purchasing that just to hear the soundtrack while I walk around or jog. The story in the game is maybe the weakest part, but that isn't because I didn't connect to the characters or anything, but instead I (like many complaints) did not like the moral system in this game. Let me be clear: I loved Deslin, Fetch, Eugene, and Tommy. I love the overall story (I won't go into detail, play it or watch videos on it for they are worth it). The Moral system in this game felt too black and white, however. Too many times I wondered if there might have been opportunities to make a mission or two have multiple branches, with maybe how you choose to, overall, complete your mission be the determination of being evil or good (which in that is arbitrary sometimes as well). And to go a step further, I loved the ending to the game on both playthroughs, but I felt as if I was an Antihero on my evil playthrough, and not so much the evil villain like Cole could have been in previous games, especially Infamous 2. Infamous Second Son made me feel like Deslin was meant to be the good guy, but that might also be because of the canon they chose to follow (the good ending of Infamous 2). In any case, that is my only complaint, for the story and characters were actually fun and interesting, and the free DLC that has come out so far have been very helpful making the story to ISS really become fleshed out, especially Paper Trail. I hope there are more meta-online games like this in the future, not so much that we deserve the free DLC for I would pay for Festival of Blood like DLC any day of the week, but I think it would be awesome to set up a month and a half free DLC game for players centered on a power and to build the background on certain characters, especially Eugene and Fetch who I grew to like quite a lot yet felt there was room to learn even more of them. Lastly, the gameplay itself, which is quick and easy: it is fun. The game feels smooth, fun, exciting, and yet novel with each power. Each power feels different, acts different, and can and should be used differently in many different ways (ie. Neon is the one I use most because it packs a good punch, but it also is accurate and a long-range attack, with a powerful heavy attack and awesome karma attack, whereas Smoke is more of a in and out, powerful and fast attack plan that, when used right, can decimate the enemy easily and quickly.) Overall, this game is amazing, and I still play it a ton despite a Platinum that is easy to earn to be honest. One last criticism, however: once the game is beaten, there isn't a ton of stuff to do. Don't get me wrong, there are still lots of DUP people to beat and lots of side stuff to do, but the issue is that once all major side missions are done, such as the spray painting and whatnot, then there is even less to do. But from what I have seen of the Paper Trail DLC, I love what Sucker Punch is doing to support the game further, and I expect continued DLC along that path. Anyone with a PS4 should in the least play it, but I recommend purchasing this game easily, and anyone on the fence for a PS4 this should defiantly be on your radar as a reason to lean for PS4 (but to be fair, Titanfall is pretty awesome too).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2014"}

Young \"Hello\"","summary":"Not The CIV You Expect","reviewText":"Well, it is hard not to compare this with the much loved computer based versions.  Yes, they have in the description that this console version was written from the ground up, so that does provide an excuse.  So to be fair, all I will say is that this version is nothing like the computer version.  It has very few similarities at best and the game play is very different.  They obviously made this for the casual gamer.  Serious gamers will think this version is a joke.To call this a next generation game would be an insult.  The graphics are sub-par at best and is really nothing better than you might see on the Wii console.  I am not knocking the Wii, I am just providing a comparison.  This console version also lacks the many wonderful musical scores from the PC version.They have animated characters guiding your way through the game.  They all speak in gibberish that gets very annoying the longer you play.  Again, the graphics for these characters are bad for a next gen console.The victory options are non-existent.  In fact, there are hardly any game options.I don't know.  When comparing to the PC version, I could beat this version up all day and write a novel.  This is going to be good for the CIV novice that has never played the PC version or maybe thought the PC version was too hard to play.  However, they at least could have done much better on the graphics and sound if the $60 price tag is to be justified.  This costs more than the PC version and you get so much less.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2008"}

I commiserate with another reviewer about the \"This was on the X-Box, so it's worse here by definition!\" reviews, but I can't co-sign on grade inflation.And honestly, while this game has a lot going for it, its flaws can be severe. The average player probably wouldn't notice (i.e. the one that plays the game one time through), but I would guess that most people buying this game are hardcore (and the developers believe the same - look at all of the postgame extras, and the ridiculous PSN trophies associated to the game).So anyway:The Good:- I really like the battle system in this game. There is one major flaw (targetting), but all in all, I've enjoyed fighting (which is good for a game of this length). The \"blindside\" and \"rush combo\" systems are magnificent, IMHO. The characters clearly have different personalities on the battle field (including the fighters - Faize's rapier combos act much different than Edge's, e.g.).- The story. While the cutscenes are a major pain (they are too long, and poorly written), I'm a sucker for a space exploration story. No, this isn't \"Mass Effect 2,\" but I think the plot synthesizes much of what is good about various Japanese sci-fi animes (ridiculous science, absurd character interactions, a universe-threatening enemy, etc.)- The extras. Tri-Ace has ALWAYS given the player more for completing a game, and this is no different. A huge battle arena, two long and rewarding post-game dungeons, billions of battle trophies to test your skills and patience (OK - there are only 900, but it will feel like billions by the end). SO:TLH delivers. However, there is one major flaw here, as I will state below.The Bad:-Battle targeting is atrocious. The computer NEVER fixes on the proper target; your character will often run the length of the battlefield to attack another enemy, instead of the one in front of him. In order to change targeting, you have to use the start button (who in the world thought of that?)...but this is a pain in the heat of battle against an enemy such as, say, Kokubei (who has about 10 other small enemies constantly circling her). Ugh.- Where are the save points? It takes FOREVER to get to one! I've heard that autosaving doesn't work in JRPGs (with citations of other 360 RPGs as evidence). I don't buy it. There HAS to be something better, and if we ARE fixing ourselves to this archaic system, at LEAST make it reasonable. At time, you will find yourself going an hour or more between save points in dungeons. At the end of the game, adding together the cutscene time, the credit time, and the battles, it took over 2 hours before I could save my game! That's ridiculous.Also, when you finally do save, the game asks you, \"Do you want to keep saving?\" The default answer is \"YES\" the first time this question is asked. What the heck? I guess even the game realizes that saving is a luxury that you never want to end. :-P- While battle trophies carry over to different playthroughs, battle trophy progress does not. What are you thinking, Tri-Ace? So, if I kill 29,999 enemies with Edge in one playthrough, and don't get the trophy, I STILL have to kill 30000 in the next playthrough. All I can say is, if you care about these things, keep your old save files intact.- The cutscenes. They are WAAAAAY too long. Now, I'm not a fan of cutscenes in general, but when the writing is as bad as it is for these, it's particularly atrocious. In fact, I would suggest just skipping them entirely (the game is nice enough to provide you a synopsis of any scene you skip, and the synopsis is both short AND well-written).The unforgivable:- Missable trophies. OK - I can accept that some games should have PSN trophies that require work. But this is ridiculous. For example, there is one trophy for completing all the quests in the game (and there are hundreds, plural, by the way). The catch? Near the beginning of the game, some quests simply...disappear. Forever. There is nothing telling you that this might happen, but it can. Later on, other quests disappear. Forever. So, what do you do? YOU HAVE TO PLAY THE ENTIRE GAME AGAIN. Clearly, this is implemented solely to sell strategy guides. There are other egregious examples (what, I can't make every item in the game because one of my party members left permanently?), but you get the point. Everything about the trophies is meant to anger you. I kid thee not.Anyway, there you have it. If you are going to play through once, I would rate this from 4 to 5 stars. It's pretty fun. But if you are like so many others that requires that platinum trophy, expect lots and lots of frustration. Happy gaming!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2010"}

In this seemingly utopian paradise, a crime has been committed and now you are being hunted. You are a Runner called Faith - and this innovative first-person action-adventure is your story.    Mirror&#x2019;s Edge delivers you straight into the shoes of this unique heroine as she traverses the vertigo-inducing cityscape, engaging in intense combat and fast paced chases. With a never before seen sense of movement and perspective, you will be drawn into Faith&#x2019;s world. A world that is visceral, immediate, and very dangerous. Live or die? Soar or plummet? One thing is certain, in this city, you will learn how to run.","reviewerName":"Ryan J \"Ryan\"","summary":"Mixed reactions","reviewText":"Mirror's Edge, a first person action-adventure from Digital Illusions, is a game unlike anything you have seen before. Set in a society where communication is heavily monitored by a totalitarian regime, you play as Faith - one of many runners who transport messages while evading government surveillance. Inspired by Parkour, the gameplay is based primarily on running across rooftops and interior spaces in an attempt to get from point A to point B while avoiding the police. As such, there is a heavy emphasis on movement, such as maintaining momentum and fluidly chaining together moves. There is a bit of gunplay, however Faith is not very effective in combat and the game teaches you early on that it is always best to avoid conflict.At first glance, the setting of Mirror's Edge sounds pretty interesting, but the storyline is actually pretty boring. Your sister has been framed of murder, there are mumblings about a secret project called \"Icarus\", and it's up to you to clear your sister's name and uncover what exactly that secret project is. Most of the story is told in stylized vector art cutscenes that actually look really cool, but the actual content is boring. Throughout the game you will meet a handful of forgettable characters that seem to exist only to provide a few lines of exposition before you move on. It's hard to have any attachment to any of the characters (Faith included), making it difficult to care about the plot.Moving around these environments is generally fun thanks to some well thought-out controls. Instead of requiring complex button combinations to pull off Faith's crazy acrobatics, most are mapped to one of two buttons: move up and move down. These actions are context sensitive, so what they do will depend on what state Faith is currently in. If you are on a pipe, pressing up will climb and pressing down will slide. While she is running, pressing up will cause her to jump while pressing down will cause her to kick. It is all very intuitive and easy to wrap your head around after only a few minutes in the tutorial level.Everything about the game's presentation screams high production values, especially the visual style which is just as unique as the gameplay. The city is filled with giant skyscrapers made of cement, glass, and steal, all brightly light and saturated with solid colors. Its not just all for looks either, important buildings and areas often use color to contrast with the rest of the city while \"runner's vision\" highlights important objects and doors with bright red. The game is at its best when the controls and runner vision all come together. You will find yourself flying around rooftops, keeping momentum, making crazy jumps, sliding under obstacles, and running along walls all while dodging bullets. However, when things don't come together it really drags the whole game down.There are far too many instances when there is no obvious place for you to go. You might see your final destination in the distance, but how to get there is completely baffling. This grinds the fast gameplay to a halt and causes a lot of frustration. Sure, you can take your time and simply stumble around until you come upon where you are supposed to go, but who wants to do that? What's even more annoying are the sequences when you are being chased by police and don't know where to go. They will kill you in a few shots, making exploring very difficult. It can get really maddening. This game has way too many trial and error sequences, where you will repeat the same stretch of game over and over again while you try to figure out what the level designer intended you to do. The main cause of this problem is that the levels are extremely linear. Adding more routes around the environment would have gone a long way towards alleviating these headaches.The level design starts off great, gradually teaching the player how to string together moves in really awesome ways. The subway level in particular sticks out in my mind as being exceptional. The problem is that after the first few levels, the designers have shown all of their cards and the game becomes extremely repetitive. The real problem is that while the Parkour elements of Mirror's Edge are fun, it's simply not enough to base an entire game on. After the novelty of the first person platforming has worn off, there is really nothing left to keep your attention. A good story would have helped a bit, but it still would not have addressed the core problem.It also doesn't help that the game occasionally forces you into confrontations with the police where the only real way to make progress is to kill all of them. Faith is extremely weak, and can be permanently downed by only a few shots or two punches. You never start levels with weapons, meaning the only way to get armed is to close the gap on a cop, while attempting to dodge bullets and disarm him. If he has any buddies in the area, as they often do, this can become extremely difficult to pull off. Even if you do manage to get your hands on a gun, you only have the ammo that is left in the clip. Once it's gone, Faith throws it away and you are back to trying to take down cops with ranged weapons using only your fists, feet, and frail body.It really hurts me to give Mirror's Edge a mediocre review. As someone who plays a lot of games, it's refreshing to see new ideas and intellectual properties. Mirror's Edge is one of those games that when its fun, it is really fun. It's just unfortunate that the overall game is more frustrating then it was enjoyable. If you are someone who rates games simply based on how fun it is, Mirror's Edge is a game that you should pass on. However if gaming is more of a hobby then a simple diversion, Mirror's Edge is worth checking out simply to experience its unique ideas, both in gameplay and in visual design. Just don't expect to have a lot of fun while doing it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2009"}

A lot of people remember the first Jedi Knight with a lot of affection. It was the very first game in which players could actually become a Jedi and use a lightsaber. The single-player storyline was quite good, although I personally thought the filmed cutscenes were a bit weak.It's been quite a few years since we've seen a Star Wars single-player game, so I was surprised and delighted when I heard that Raven Software would be developing a sequel to Jedi Knight, entitled Jedi Outcast. So is it worth buying? It depends - Jedi Outcast has exactly the same pros and cons as the original game did. So if you loved certain aspects of the original and hated others, you'll find yourself reacting the same way here.To start with - the bad points. If the jumping puzzles and mazelike levels really annoyed you the first time around, things aren't going to get any better the second time around. The worst part is during the levels in Nar Shadaa, which are often set above vast bottomless chasms. Some puzzles require exquisite timing and luck, in particular a level in Nar Shadaa which requires you to leap onto a moving hovercar and then dodge a trash compactor.In addition, in the first five levels of the game you don't have either a lightsaber or any force powers. You're only equipped with run-of-the-mill weapons. The level design in these first five levels isn't all that great either. I suspect that Raven Software created these first five levels as a homage to the original Dark Forces PC Game - if so, it was a poor choice.The other important point to mention is that you WILL need a fast PC in order to play and enjoy this game. I have an AMD Athlon 2000+ XP, with 512MB PC2100 DDR RAM and a 64MB GEForce4 TI4200 Videocard. It's quite a powerful system, and I can run the game at 1024x768 at the highest detail levels, without a single frame-rate slowdown. I would NOT recommend running this game on anything less than a Pentium III/AMD Thunderbird 1.2 GHz PC. The big payoff is that the graphics are jaw-droppingly awesome. Again, the Cloud City levels are a beautiful example of this - you really will believe that you're in a Star Wars movie.Now, the good points, which more than outweigh the bad. It takes about two hours or less to play through these first five levels. The level design also improves considerably, with the Cloud City levels being my personal favourite. You also finally get access to your force powers, and then your lightsaber. The \"tutorial\" mission on level 6 demonstrates just how much the force powers have improved over the original Jedi Knight. The old abilities are all here but given a brand new twist.For instance, in the original, the only really useful power was Force Pull, which you could use to pull weapons from enemies hands. This time, you have both Force Push and Force Pull, and both are quite dangerous. Force Push can be used to actually knockdown enemies from a distance, while Force Pull can be used to physically drag enemies towards you. As you progress through the game, your Force Powers will increase. At full power, Force Push can be used to fling an entire platoon of Stormtroopers into a chasm, which is a truly awesome sight to behold.The other great aspect about this game is undoubtedly the Lightsaber combat. Obviously, the original Jedi Knight's lightsaber combat was based on the first three films, and it mostly consisted of frenetically waving your lightsaber around. Jedi Outcast's lightsaber combat was based on the newer films, which means that using your lightsaber involves more than just repeatedly pressing the fire button on your keyboard.Put it this way - anyone who's watched the Phantom Menace will remember the truly awesome fight between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Maul. They will also remember the combat moves they were able to execute, which included somersaulting off walls. Well, know you will also be able to execute the same moves, and it looks and feels absolutely awesome. One of my own favourite moments came during a Cloud City level, when I was locked in combat with a Dark Jedi and a hapless stormtrooper. I actually managed to kill both the other Jedi and the Stormtrooper at the same time - and the game actually went into slow motion replay to show me the death scene. Coolness.With both Jedi Outcast and Elite Force, Raven Software have proven that they are a high-quality Development Company, who are quite successful at bringing legendary big-screen adventures to the PC. I believe that Raven Software were probably the best (and most likely only) company that could've pulled this off. This game is a classic, and I would certainly not hestitate to recommend this game, providing the person in question has a reasonably fast PC.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2002"}

{"product_name":"B002BS47YE","description":"","reviewerName":"HitRaj 47","summary":"Forget Your Prejudice About Console Games for a Few Hours","reviewText":"Crysis 2 sort of continues from the story of the last game, except this time it's set in New York instead of a jungle. Well, actually a concrete jungle then. The story is pretty good, for a video game and it all plays out at a good pace. It took me three days to finish the game, which I would probably equate to about twelve hours of gameplay, which isn't too bad. I'd just like to say though,  I didn't extend this time by playing the multiplayer or replaying the single player to find the hidden items or \"souvenirs\" as the game calls it. This, in my book, doesn't make a game replayable by default.Speaking of replayability, you could try and play through the game in a different manner. Whilst the levels require you to basically get from one point to another, there is a bit of freedom in how you choose to do so. I chose a hybrid, flank and sneak past enemies and if I screw up, go in guns blazing. Even though you could probably figure out what routes to take yourself, the tactical advisor in the helmet visor is pretty helpful, if only suggesting limited paths.About the guns, all of them can be customized, just like in the last game, with a variety of scopes and attachments you'll find the right combination for any situation. The weapons are also a joy to use, including the pistols, which pack sufficient punch and recoil, as well as sounding great. Just the way guns in a shooter should be.But the star of the show is the suit. The controls are much more streamlined this time and to be honest I like it. The sprint button is speed, Q for armor and E to cloak. You could still use the middle mouse to interface with it, but with this new streamlined approach everything feels a lot more natural and I find it a joy to use. Another really cool thing,  which I would actually like to see in more shooters, it the ability to slide across the floor from sprinting. It's so easy to implement and it's really nice to use when moving from cover to cover. There's also a huge \"bad ass\" factor as well!One new thing introduced was suit abilities. When you kill an alien they drop/give off some sort of pixie dust, which is the best way to describe it. Walk into it to collect it and it will give you point to spend in one of four branches. Each branch has three abilities,  all of which are passive (you don't have to do anything for them to be active) and help you out in a different way. For example, one focuses on stealth and makes your cloak last longer,  footsteps are quieter etc. Then there are others that make your health regenerate faster or a visor upgrade that lets you see cloaked enemies.You can only have ability on each branch active at a time though, and as cool as I thought it was, I didn't really spend a lot of time collecting the pixie dust, thus I never bought all the abilities on each branch. Having said that, I think you could get through the game without them!As well as being on PC the game is also on consoles, which brings me to the graphics. They are just as good, if not a little better than the original. I don't understand how gaming graphics work, I played it on PC with everything turned up and it looked just as good, though slightly better than the original. But somehow they managed to get this level of graphics on the consoles? I've not really seen it for myself, but on PC the game looks great. If it looks this good on the consoles, without much of a performance hit, then I'm amazed!Since I didn't play the multiplayer, which to be honest looks like a bit of a Crysis themed Call of Duty clone, my only complaint would be the lack of MOD support it level editor. This seems to be a trend these days, which is a shame as it really extends the life of a PC game. Great games (e.g. Counter-Strike, Battlefield 2) have come from MODs, as well as creative communities. Crytek will probably blame piracy as usual for the neglect of PC gamers, despite the fact this game was pirated for the 360 before the PC. Having said that, I'd like to give Crytek credit for not making this game a straight port, because it could have turned out much worse. Overall this is a good shooter and worth playing through at least once. Ignore anyone telling you this is a console port, this is a good shooter, that's not trying to be anything else.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00BGA9YZK","description":"","reviewerName":"Jeffrey Owens","summary":"A Good \"Reboot\", But A Missed Story","reviewText":"I have noticed from playing the new generation games (Dead Rising 3, Killzone SF, Infamous SS, ect) that most of the new &#34;sequels&#34; are, in fact, not necessarily sequels. Each title, for the most part, are rebrands of the original IPs; they accept the events of the previous generation's titles, but they go their own way, with whole new areas, new characters, new stories, and barely bring up the previous title's events (also, each of these have very different mechanics, tones, stories, and so on compared to the original series). Personally, I like that sort of direction for each series; it is a good excuse to change much of the structure of each series for the future due to the new system, and yet still holds on to the original framing.That being said, I liked Killzone SF. Was it amazing? No; if Amazon gave half stars, I would give this a 3.5* of 5 personally. (The * is because the 0.5 I deducted could easily be fixed due to the multiplayer issues, see that section).Gameplay wise, this game actually felt nice and slick; the OWL was fun, used the touchpad in a cool way (and actually, to me, proved the use of the touchpad at a separate action mapping system and not just gimmick scenarios). Gone was the feeling of cumbersome soldiers, for you are not necessarily a soldier, but more of a stealth operative from the ISA (kind of felt like a Shadow Marshall, even from KZ 1, was a badass who was almost like a Bond but in a war setting, who did whatever they wanted for success). They were like CIA agents, and in this game I felt like one. The guns, the OWL, bullet time, ect. = all made me, as a player, feel powerful, and I never felt frustrated on the hardest difficulty for every death (which I had plenty), were my fault and not the game (versus Killzone 2, those AI problems though). Also, the controller being revamped actually benefited this games controls, with triggers actually being triggers.Visuals wise and sound wise, this game is basically was Forza did for the Xbox One - really showed off the graphic abilities, frame rate successes, and sound quality of the new generation of consoles and games. And to be honest, I expected this game to look great, for the previous Killzones looked great too (despite bland color schemes), and they also sounded great too.Story wise is the main reason why I will not give a higher score. I liked the story quite a bit, don't get me wrong; I liked the aspects of going from a CIA agent who followed blindly to being shown the facts of the enemy, and even showed how the &#34;good guys&#34; were the bad guys too. So really, everybody was bad, and all those in power wanted destruction of the other side, with the soldiers and agents only wanting peace and being forced to kill the other side. I liked this alot, but I also felt that there was a missed opportunity,  and this is where my whole 1 star deduction comes from: this was the perfect opportunity to introduce a much more human element to the Helgast, and allow the player to play AS THE HELGAST for once (which was teased at the start of KZ 3). Instead, you played as the ISA the whole period, and it made me wonder why the main character took so long to break away from his boss after all he had seen, and never tried to do some solo work himself. But still, this game could have done so much more in story mode wise, and for a game that is basically a reboot in so many ways but still accepts previous events (despite little recognition beyond the intro scene), it played it safe by doing the same old kind of story in terms of characters, expected &#34;twists&#34;, and so on. I personally wanted to be a Helgast for once, and to see that maybe, JUST MAYBE, there is a reason for their being ***hats and killing civilians and always wanting power. Not only that, but this game could have revealed a true political and world reflection of our current state of life now (could have been a nice 1984 by Orwell story lined game), and it touches on such a possible game, and yet never fulfills this. However, the end of the game gives me hope for the series and for a very interesting set-up for future titles. Still, the story could have been better; it wasn't bad, and I enjoyed it for what it was, but it could have been something so much more.Finally, after that little rant, is the multiplayer, and personally I loved it. It was fun, it was addicting, and for me it felt fresh and unique. It felt like the best of the shooters that had released at the time, with mechanics, maps, play-types, servers, and all else that not only rivaled, but beat the competition (at least for a while). I loved it for the time I played it, but the sad fact is that the servers have gone down hill a bit. I recently played the servers again, and while before I rarely ever experienced lag, every match I had was littered with bugs and problems at some point. This is where my final half star comes in, but I put a * around it due to such problems can be fixed easily (usually).Like every review I write, I encourage questions, conversations about the game, and for each gamer reading this to play the game and make up their own mind, for each gamer is different. Enjoy!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2014"}

Of course the Humans and Orcs are still available to you but the 2 new races move the story along. There are many drastic changes that take place in WarCraft III that were not in the previous three. Blizzard Entertainment is bent on keeping the faith in the WarCraft series by making changes in WarCraft III. For example:1. You have a limited food cap of 90.(some units use more food than others)2. Your heroes can receive and use items in their inventory.3. Human, Orc, Night Elf, and Undead races have special advantages over one another. (Orcs are best melee fighters, Humans are average, etc.)4. There are many different units available in WarCraft III than the other WarCraft games. They've only kept mabye 2 or 3 units from the previous games.The changes are a bit burdensome at first but you get used to it fast.The overall performance of the game is awesome.

The third game in the legendary cult series, \"GTA3\" surpasses the first two games by a long shot because of a combination of beautiful graphical presentation, excellent audio usage, and award-winning gameplay elements. To say that \"Grand Theft Auto III\" is the game of the year is an understatement; it's the best game for the Playstation2 and probably the best game on any system.First of all, something must be made clear: \"Grand Theft Auto III\" is a mature game that earns its rating. While other games merely wear the M-Rating mark because they met the minimum requirements, \"GTA3\" earns the rating many times over. However, it's not matue in the sense that it uses intentional and unnecessary shock factor like the horrible \"State of Emergency\"; it's mature in that it represents a part of life, the criminal underworld, that is realistic, haunting and frightening. So parents who allow their kids to play mature games seriously need to look at this game before giving the go-ahead.The story of \"GTA3\" is pretty simple: you are a nameless guy who was robbing a bank with your girlfriend when she doublecrossed you and popped you, leading to your arrest and conviction. But fate is kind to you when you manage to escape capture through a strange turn of events that brings you under the wing of the local mafia, where you become their lackey. But the story doesn't end there, as you'll have to change alliances and move between three different islands so you can get your paychecks and stay alive. But if this sounds generic, it isn't, because \"Grand Theft Auto III\" goes far beyond the storyline in terms of gameplay.A gamer can play \"GTA3\" in one of two ways: he can stick to the missions and complete them one after another, or he can fool around in the place that is Libery City. Regarding the missions, they require the player to accomplish tasks given by different characters in the game, tasks such as sabotage, assassination, mindless destruction, and even grand theft auto (go figure!). Completing a task gives the player a reward; failure requires the player to restart the mission from scratch. But while the missions are fun, they are nothing compared to what a player can do in between missions!\"Grand Theft Auto\" gives players what many have thought impossible: a massive world to run around and do whatever the hell you want. Want to become a rampant killer on the streets? Do it. Want to hijack cars and drive them around until they explode? Go for it. Want to give back to society by driving a firetruck or ambulance or police car? You can do it! How about get the national guard to chase you because you've been such a bad boy? Why not? Of course, there are limits to what you can do (you can't enter buildings, for example), but considering how much freedom is offered in the game, a player won't even notice these slight \"limitations.\" The ability to do whatever you want can be just as fun as doing the game's missions, maybe even more so. This gives the game enormous replay value; gamers will play this game simply to roam around and just have fun.Graphically, the game is one of the better-looking PS2 games. It doesn't beat games like \"Final Fantasy X\" or \"Metal Gear Solid 2\", but the graphics are beautiful, nevertheless. The characters are detailed enough to see characters' faces from afar, and minute details like dented cars and tire marks on the road are a marvel to look at. Of course, with the PS2's limited RAM, there can be some cases when the player moves too fast for the graphics to load in several areas, but this doesn't really hamper gameplay in the least. And the load times between the three islands are kept to a minimum.Soundwise, the game is at the top of its game. There is no overhead music heard while on foot, but get into a car and you can hear about half a dozen radio stations, each featuring unique songs and laugh-out-loud statements and commercials. It'll be a while before a gamer hears anything repeated on the radio. And sounds like gunshots, engine sounds, crashes, and bodies being driven over are top notch.All in all, \"Grand Theft Auto III\" is an absolute gem to play and is one of the biggest investments a gamer can possibly make. To make things even better, everything I've mentioned doesn't even scratch the surface of what the game offers. There is so much to do that it'll keep a gamer occupied long after he's completed the missions of the game.Again, this game definately lives up to its mature rating, so parents have to pay attention to this game. But with that said, \"Grand Theft Auto III\" will rarely disappoint. And while the game is going to the PC, there will be no Xbox port, as the rumors suggest. Sony has signed a deal wih Take-Two Interactive to keep the Grand Theft Auto series exclusive to the PS2 for three years, so don't count on any future GTA games going to any other console either.To all mature PS2 owners, not being interested in this game is a sin; go get it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2002"}

The series' third outing builds on to the formula which made its predecessors so popular and throws it all into a 3D world.  The top down view is replaced by a more traditional 3rd person view and the graphics have been greatly improved and made to look more `real' than the past two titles.  Furthermore the game is much more storyline-based and the missions have become center-stage rather than just something extra to do if you have time.  The GTA series has truly evolved. The game begins with an opening cinema showing you and your girlfriend in the middle of a bank robbery.  But it's a set-up.  Your girlfriend pops a shot into you and runs off with the money as you're lying on the ground with a gun in your hand.  The cops come soon after and throw you in the back of their van ready to haul you off to jail.  As the van is en route something happens but I'll let you find out what that something is for yourself. After the `something' happens you find yourself at Luigi's, the first person that will give you some things to do in your new life.  The opening mission involves picking up a girl and taking her back to Luigi's.  The real beauty of this game is that this can be done in so many ways.  You could steal a taxi and go straight to picking her up or you could carjack a Banshee and cruise around a bit before meeting up with her.  After you complete your objectives whatever they may be you are given another mission. Although Rockstar has made the missions more of a priority, you are allowed to do whatever you please in between missions so the game never gets stale.  It's amazing how huge the game world is. Liberty City actually feels like a living breathing place.  Hundreds of people crowd the sidewalks and dozens of cars stop at red lights and turn at intersections.  The best part is that you can interact with all of it.  Want to blow up a car at the corner of 5th street and 2nd? Go ahead.  Want to attack some old ladies walking in front of a payphone in Chinatown? Fine. Keep in mind that this means this game is not for children.  You can run over innocent pedestrians walking down the street, ram a semi-truck into the back of a station wagon until it blows up, or walk down the street pumping out shotgun shells and never really get penalized.  Yes, you will be attacked by the police if something like this happens, but this, more often than not, just results in more bloodshed.  If the words \"Grand Theft Auto\" create a picture in your mind of someone doing something that benefits society than you need your head checked. The visuals in this game are absolutely superb.  Everything has somewhat of a cartoon feel to it and it works.  The game is streaming off the disc so most load times are usually less than five seconds.  And even if Liberty City is so huge, the frame rate only very rarely suffers.  Likewise, the sound is great as well.  Rather than having a set soundtrack, GTA3 features digital radio stations.  Each station covers a different variety of music and is complete with a DJ and commercials.  I love this because it enables you to listen to what you want when you want. Have I mentioned the great voice acting yet? The voiceovers are done by some of Hollywood's best including Joe Pantoliano, Robert Loggia, and Michael Madsen.  This makes the game all that much better and definitely gives it a more polished feel. Beyond all the cool missions and the gigantic landscape, GTA3 gives us tons to do.  There are hidden packages to be found all over the city.  Secret missions can be opened up by jacking certain vehicles.  The game also keeps track of all your kills and other statistics, such as your best \"stunt\" in an automobile.  The driving system is in itself fantastic, as all the different cars have a different feel to them, and they break apart in ways no other driving game has done. Although extremely violent and bloody, GTA3 is one of those games that you actually feel like you're a part of.  Every component of the game fits together like a puzzle and combines to engulf you in an amazing experience.  No other game can match Grand Theft Auto 3's ambition.  Rockstar set out to make a worthy successor to the series, and they not only succeeded but created one of the best games I have ever had the pleasure of playing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2003"}

Mills","summary":"More than the sum of its parts = just plain fun.","reviewText":"Lets make one thing clear right off:  if you liked LittleBigPlanet and you like Mario Kart and other cart racers... stop reading and buy this game now!Especially at the current price listed on Amazon (plus 10$ credit) which leads me to beleive its not selling well becasue people are hesitant, I can understadn that, so was I but a little preorder premotion and I thought \"what the heck?\" and  I'm glad I made the plunge even at full fair (I got my Ratchet and Clank Mods for it so I'm happy)That said, this game really surprised me, as I said before this was somethign of an impulse for me, I enjoyed the demo well enough for waht it was, but what really pushed me over the top was the preorder R+C mods, they get me every time :)The first thing that I was surprised by was the imediate plunge into a rather enjoyable story including cutscenes which for some reason I did not expect at all.  The story is somethign of a remix between Pixar's Cars, Days of Thudner, and Talldega Nights, and althoug the influence is storng, it has its own twist and flavor coupled with fantastic voice acting, the results are gold.  The two announcers really steal the show, which is good becasue you'll be listening to alot of them, they have yet to get repetitive for me but its only been a day.The racing, which i enjoyed in the demo, was not done justice by said demo.  its great, drifting is much easier to pull off than Mario Kart, even the wii iteration which is incredibly drift friendly.  But thats part-in-parcell with the MNR attitude, drifting is easiy and FUN, boosts are plentiful, jumps are abundant and weapons are thouroughly satisfying (you might remember soem of them from Mario Kart, adn the rest from wipeout ;) )Right away I was amazed with the user creations in Character Mods, Kart Mods, and Courses. I'll save discusion of coruses for one paragraph.  The Mods peopel have made are AMAZING considering its day one.  It's definately a diparture from the LBP attitude where Sackboy retained his likness no mattter what making certain customues something of a technical feat.  In MRC the tools are much more robust, and the result is (among other's) and Iron MAn that you'd swear was designed in Maya as opposed to in-game.  KArts are the same thing, I'm currently racing around on a perfect replica of the A-team van, how awesome?Course creation is ABSURDLY easy, another departure from LBP.  I made two courses in barely 20 minutes total which I'm sure would impress my friends, but when you sample soem of the things created by a truely dedicated player, well the results speak for themselves.Unfortunately this leads me into the only bad... they did a great job which this hub world where other onlien palyers race around with you, very reminiscant of Home, but its pretty hard to get into an online game as it stands.  I wasn't feling very patient so I din't bother wating around for peopel to join me, especailly as they would enevitably be strangers.  Unfortuantely none of my freinds have purchased this game which might make a difference but if you liek me, most likly alone in your friend group on you interest in this game, you might find getting into an actual online race a bit of a pain.  this combined with soem rather cumbersome loading times is a bit of a stumblign block on what is otherwise non-stop fun.  But on the other hand the ability to access other peoples content on you own time is incredibly easiy, with fantastic AI on nonplayer opponents, adn a time trail mode which allows you to feel like your part of a larger comunnity without hte hassle of finding any of them to race with you.And the single palyer circuit is fantastic!  That alone will keep me happy for hours I'm sure.All in all, this game is a great Kart racer, with very robust user creation tools and a well thoughout and setup infastructure for sahring them, clearly United Front Games learned from LBP in this regard.  But for a game which is so clearly ment for online play its a bit difficult to get into a gme and more importantly share a game with others.  To be fair, some of this is equation has to do with the ammount of user's, but it felt like I only had access to one game option when I tried to join, whcih was empty, an no one joined my hosted games, its hard to say why, it jsut was.  I will edit if this experience drmatically changes.  But also the laod times are a bit logner then we have coem to expect, I've heard a patch is comming but this game was day one patched as well...But I don't want to end on hat note because this game really blew my mind in all the right ways and if you have an interest in the genre then its a steal at full price let alone what its listed on Amazon.  You will not be sorry you picked up this little gem.  Obviously thsoe who dislike Kart Racing games need not aply.P.S. for the record I own and LOVE Mario Kart Wii, this game is not a MK killer, but its worthy to be right up there with it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000G7PMX2","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"A Few Issues but Very Nicely Done","reviewText":"Red Steel combines gun fighting with swordplay in a modern world. As a launch title for the Wii, you have to put up with some iffy results with the implementation of the remote and nunchuck.Knowing that this would be a challenge with its high intensity, first person shooter use of both controllers, I put off this review until after I'd played thoroughly about 15 other Wii titles. By this point we knew we had the fundamentals down of swinging, slashing, and a good handle on the graphics the Wii could offer.So, on to Red Steel. I love Japanese culture, and I love sword-based games. I also enjoy gun battle games, so I figured this would combine the best of many worlds. You set out as the bodyguard of a wealthy, slightly flaky woman - and you're about to ask for her hand in marriage. Her dad shows up, and in come the assassins.Soon you're involved in a variety of gunfights and swordfights. For gunfights, you simply point and shoot. You can zoom in and out by moving your remote closer to and further from the screen. Your nunchuck lets you jump and crouch.It seems silly sometimes that you have a gun but you're spending time swinging your sword. It's something you just have to accept and go with the game flow. Also, the swordfights are more of a 'dance' - i.e. it's not about who hammers a slice button the quickest, but more of a dodge-then-slice, slice-then-turn and whoever gets the right combination is going to win.I found the graphics difficult in some areas, trying to spot where to go or who was shooting at me. I did think it intriguing that tilting your wrist made your gun hand tilt - i.e. you could shoot straight-on or \"sideways\" gangsta style.It was also cool to have items around your enemies blowing up - pipes with holes letting out steam, the typical exploding barrels, chunks flying out of walls, etc. The environment is nicely destructable, which is especially great if you have a high powered firearm in your hands.I can definitely see if someone got Red Steel as their *first* Wii game that they'd be having problems. Trying to get used to the Wii remote and nunchuck on a game that is this immersive would be like trying to learn how to ski on a black diamond hill. It's too much at once. However, really do give Red Steel a chance once you've mastered the standard Wii skills. While the graphics aren't great, there's definitely scenes that are well designed, artistically. And while the plot line may be a bit cliche, the combination of full-out gun battles and graceful dance-like sword fights is very nice.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000JLIXIG","reviewerName":"B. McBeth \"PSN/XLive/Steam: DirkPittSpawn\"","summary":"Overall a Great Game and Anxious for Next","reviewText":"Insomniacs, notorious for the Ratchet and Clank series, came out with a great game. This was one of the first games made available for the PS3 and that's pretty impressive for Insomniacs to manage to develop and release so quickly. They don't even take advantage of all the features, which means that when Resistance 2 comes out it'll look/feel even better.For those who aren't familar with this title: Basically its an alternate timeline. Instead of WWII, something happened in Europe/Asia that could only be described as a possible alien invasion. Since the US was isolationist at the time, they stayed out but continued to develop. Which is why when you start the game you start with an M1 looking rifle, but has been upgraded with a Grenade Launcher (similar to the M203).It doesn't take long before you come across some crazy weapons (Good ol' Insomniacs won't let you down!): A sniper rifle that slows down time, a rocket launcher that will allow you to fire the rocket and then change its trajectory/speed, and of course, the aliens have some: a gun called the Bullseye that allows for you to \"tag\" someone and all subsequent shots will go to that location, or even a weapon that can fire through walls.The gameplay is a lot of fun, whether you play co-op, or the single player campaign or you try your luck online. There's a couple of map packs that were released not too long ago and the developers still issue patches/support for the game too.For those that are familar with Ratchet and Clank, the \"Skill Point\" system is used here too. For instance: Kill a 4-legged animal-looking alien with a grenade and get the \"Fetch\" skill-point. Get enough of these to unlock added features. They also like to hide documents on each level for you to find (similar to R&C;: Gold Bolts).The online has it's own rank system. Start off as Private and with points/kills gain XP and rank. Has a lot of interesting maps and of course: Deathmatch, Objective, etc. modes.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"Andy Tatnall","summary":"Not the same old game.","reviewText":"You might be tempted to think Resident Evil for GameCube is the same game you played years ago on PlayStation, but with improved graphics. You'd only be half right.If you never played the original Resident Evil, here's the premise: you are investigating strange goings-on and reports of strange creatures in a huge mansion. You choose one of two characters--one male and one female--to explore, while zombies and terrifying creatures spring out at you from nowhere and attempt to devour you. You must use your weapons and wits to survive. The atmosphere is dark and moody, and the blood and gore is intense.This new version does feature the same two characters and the same mansion, but Capcom has changed many aspects. They've expanded some of the original areas and added new ones. Places that once yielded zombified dogs or killer bees are now safe, while the creatures now attack you from different areas--so even if you played the original, the scare factor is brand new. And to say the graphics are improved is a huge understatement: they are incredible. Easily the best-looking GameCube title to date. You also don't have to worry that this version for a Nintendo system is cleaned up...all the gore and guts are intact, but far more realistic than before.Resident Evil for GameCube looks like a great game, and should be worth a look whether you're a RE veteran or a Nightmare Newbie.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2002"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"007 \"cmyth007\"","summary":"Franchise is losing steam, but a solid game","reviewText":"The franchise is really showing its age, but that isn't any fault of 343 Studios. Frankly, Bungie had let it get pretty stale and that is what 343 inherited. Although there have been some significant improvements in some areas, they usually lose ground in another, which keeps the game from really shining. Some folks have complained about continuity issues such as Master Chief being asleep for over four years, and yet he wakes up with upgraded armor etc. Who cares? I can overlook that, and frankly so should you. If they didn't upgrade them, folks would be pissed about that too. :) So let it go and enjoy the changes for what they are, many of them are good.The good news is that Master Chief is back, and he's ready to kick some tail. The bad news is that the covenant is back too. If you are one of the eight people in the world that still looks forward to seeing them, good for you. But I was thrilled at the end of Halo 3 when Master Chief said--it's over. I'm tired of the covenant and had really hoped they would take the series in a different direction. Yes, they introduced the Forerunners, but they brought back the covenant. Once again--the good with the bad.The weapons have been redone nicely. I've hated the covenant weapons in every game; they have been terrible. But this time around they are actually a pleasure to use, in most instances. And the new Forerunner weapons are pretty cool as well. Now for the bad part: if you really like the UNSC weapons like I do--too bad, because more often than not you won't have enough ammo to hold onto them for long. They seem to have cut the ammo you can carry in most UNSC weapons in half, which makes little sense to me. Spartans can carry untold amounts of weight and armor, but only 32 rounds for their pistol and only a couple of hundred rounds for their assault rifle? Ummmmm, okay. His shields also seem particularly fragile, so don't expect to take too much of a pounding, because you can't.Some folks are a bit upset about the lack of theater mode in Campaign, which is supposed to be added later. So if this feature is important to you, then you've been warned. Personally, I don't care too much. I enjoyed it well enough. It was cool to watch some epic moments in one of your games, but I wouldn't have wanted them to delay release for this.Visual presentation is astounding, and this is one area where the game is NOT showing its age. It is heads and shoulders above any previous versions. Graphics, colors, textures--all gorgeous. Cutscenes are top notch and well done. Sounds have been redone--thank goodness. The assault rifle actually sounds like a rifle now, and the warthog engine rumbles instead of sounding like a battery powered toy. Unfortunately the music score is flat, dull, uninspired and really takes away from the game. Marty O'Donnell did such a fantastic job with the past scores. The music really added to the game. I noticed right away how poorly done this score was, and it hasn't improved in the first five hours.Campaign supports four-player cooperative play--bravo!!! It's well done so far and seems to be noticeably more difficult than previous installments, but that is too be expected with four players. They say it is a 10 hour campaign, but I'm not sure I believe that. We'll see when I'm done.Multiplayer: I've never liked Halo multiplayer. They have one of the most active communities, unfortunately they also have the WORST community I've ever seen. I've encountered more rude, offensive and obnoxious players in Halo games than anywhere else in my multiplayer gaming. So if you enjoy it, I'm sure you'll get plenty of action from this title, but I won't touch it.Spartan Ops: Thank goodness they put something in to support cooperative play beyond the campaign. Well done! And even better is that they got rid of that terrible fire fight mode from ODST and Reach. That was the worst excuse for a game mode I've ever seen. For me, Spartan Ops is what will give this game some longevity, but it remains to be seen how strongly 343 will support it. I really hope they do, and I have faith that they will, but you never know. They may just pander to the multiplayer community and let Spartan Ops fade into obscurity. In the coming weeks I may bump my review up to four stars if this mode continues to impress me, but so far this is a very, very solid three and a half star game but really doesn't do enough to make me want to give it four stars quite yet. Am I being overly critical? Yes, I probably am. I've been playing Halo since the beginning and I have come to expect the best.Good luck spartans.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2012"}

During those 3 years, I had gotten 5 characters to level 80, and did almost everything possible in game to keep myself entertained, which included: raiding, daily quests, PvP, dungeon grinding, reputation runs, profession maxing, and even clearing up old quests.When Cataclysm was released, I thought I would enjoy it. But, after leveling my 5 characters from 80 to 85, the quest zones specific for this level range became rather bland. Not only that, but the questing zones for 80-85 are very linear in comparison to the other questing tiers seen. I raided the first tier of raids with my main character, but that lasted for about 2 months. After 2 months, I became really bored with the game.After the quest grinding, there really was nothing else to do except look forward to the daily dungeon and weekly raid runs. For someone who played this game hardcore, I was extremely disappointed in this expansion. It seems to me that they placed more emphasis on redoing the original starting zones (Levels 1-60) than they did with the 80-85 zones. For people who love quest grinding alts from level 1-60 would have a blast, but for those of us who don't care to roll anymore alts are left feeling short changed. The weekly raids and redundant daily quests became old rather quickly, and I canceled my account and said my parting words to my friends whom I raided with for so long. The whole concept behind WoW now is that they place more and more emphasis on the raiding aspect more than anything else in the game. I also think I got tired of raiding; having to commit to playing 3 hours a night a few nights out of the week got old.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002B1TDV8","reviewerName":"trashcanman","summary":"If there's a problem, yo I'll solve it!","reviewText":"\"Scribblenauts\" is a new puzzle game for the Nintendo DS that is limited only by your own imagination.  Seriously.  This is a revolution in the genre tht id playable by absolutely anybody and will challenge absolutely everybody.  The premise is this: you are given a task to complete which will result in you obtaining a \"starite\".  How you complete this task is completely up to you.  Anything you can think of within, you can write into the game and use as you see fit.  No joke.  If you think the mighty Cthuluhu will help you achieve your goal, then you can summon him.  If you wish to utilize zombies, dinosaurs, a blowtorch, a UFO, and a \"jerk\" (who goes around hitting people) you can do that as well.  If you can think it, you can write it and make it appear so long as it's not a copyrighted character or potentially offensive.  The sandbox potential by itself is massive.  I bought this game yesterday out of lingering curiosity after seeing it played on the popular video game show X-Play (they wrote in a dingo and had it eat a baby) and it really lives up to the hype.  I planned on giving it a test run for a puzzle or two and was planning on playing some Xbox 360 or maybe writing a review.  5 hours later, my DS battery died and I was forced to stop after 4 hours and 45 minutes of thinking \"Just one more.  Just one more....\"  This is like crack in puzzle form.Now I'm usually pretty good at staying focused on the task at hand.  I'll play around a little, but for the most part, I'm all about gaining points.  The idea is the solve the puzzle and get the starite in the least possible time.  Each level has a \"par\" for the number of objects used.  If you use less you get bonus points, if you use more you get less.  You also get other bonuses such as not using weapons or writing in objects that you haven't used before.  This encourages creative and efficient thinking rather then writing in everything under the sun.  As I said, I'm pretty good at staying on track but on one occasion I needed to pas a tripwire that was dropping the starite into lava so I wrote in \"teleporter\".  It teleported me to Mars.  From there I just went nuts.  Among the discoveries I made was that you can type in \"otaku\" and get a geek wearing a shirt with an old-school Nintendo controller on it.  I wrote in \"anime\" and a DVD appeared.  I gave it to the otaku and he seemed happy with it.  The TV and DVD players didn't have anywhere to plug in , though. Then God and Satan had a little tiff.  God won.  I then proceeded to type \"atheist\" in and that guy got scared and ran screaming from our holy father. I then gave the non-believer a gun and he proceeded to run after God and shoot him with it.  He got smited.  Tell me that isn't awesome!  Way cooler then getting a stupid star thingy.Another puzzle included getting a girl's cat off of her roof. I wrote a dog on the roof to chase it off.  the kittie didn't survive the fall, so next time I placed a ladder for it to jump too.  Worked like a charm.  Another featured a trapped starite buried under a large piece of steel with two baddies on top of it.  I wrote in a superhero and hit the switch to unleash the villains, who were quicky smashed by the cape.  I then gave the superhero a magnet and as he flew over the steel, it lifted up and away from the starite, and I got my prize. I wonder how somebody else would have solved that one.  Seeing different things interact with each other is great fun.  Write in a vampire and then huck some garlic at it to see it crumble to dust.  Throw a chunk of silver at a werewolf and he's cured!  When a zombie bites somebody, they become another member of the undead  And yes, as I said, a dingo will eat your baby.  The people who made this game really thought of everything.  The submarine even has torpedoes.  Shoot, you can even dress guys up in drag if that's your thing!  And if you paint yourself into a corner, just drop an atom bomb and watch the world disappear in a flash of white.  Good times.The more points you earn in \"Scribblenauts\" the more you can unlock.  New worlds with new puzzles, new avatars (mine's a ninja), new music, new sandbox levels (which begin every gameplay session), and there is even a level editor.  That is correct.  You can go into any level you've played and make your own puzzle out of it using anything you'd like.  I have to say that the amount of stuff you are allowed to put in each level is pretty limited, but I suppose they had to have some kind of a cap on it to keep players from getting out of hand with their creations.  You can also wirelessly share your levels with any friends you have who own the game, which is cool.I don't believe there's ever been a game like this out there. \"Scribblenauts\" is a game that anybody can get into.  It twists your mind and has a wicked sense of humor to boot.  Some of the puzzles are insane and coming up with ways to solve them is bound to make you try some very outlandish things.  Seriously: a superhero with magnet.  Is there any other game out there where that would be a viable option for anything?  And why bother putting in an atheist who can get the fear of of God put in him? It doesn't even have anything to do with solving puzzles! Just because the makers of this game want you to know that they are way ahead of you and at least as twisted as you are, that's why.  I look forward to delving into the innumerable (okay, they are numerable, but that numero is really big) challenges of this game and hopefully finding even more hidden little goodies to make me laugh out loud while I try like hell to find a way to beat the current maddening challenge.  If you've got a DS and an imagination; buy this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2009"}

However, Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles is the superior rail gun shooter game in my opinion.This is a RAIL shooter. Meaning that you don't have to move but just shoot/reload and the camera will move for you, similar to Virtua Cop that was in the arcades.Lots of swearing, however it is humorous. There are a couple of modes. Normal \"Story Mode\", which is easy difficulty because I don't beleive you can actually die and start over. When you die you just lose half your score. Compared to House of the Dead 2 & 3, this is much easier and I would say just plain easy for any type of gamer. Minigame mode, which has survivor mode where you can take on waves and waves of increasing zombies. Then victim minigame, where you save civilians, then a target shooting minigame. No highscores in the minigames, but would be good for multiplayer party. When you beat the game you get \"Uncut\" which is harder because you'll only have so many credits. So \"Story Mode\" is easy, and \"Uncut\" is hard, it is just not labeled that way.Short game, only about 7 stages or so. You can upgrade your weapons if you get cash, however when I replayed some levels I didn't get any cash. I'm not sure what the requirements are. That is a drawback. I like Umbrella Chronicles better since everytime you played through a stage you'd get at least \"1 star\" to upgrade your weapons. There are shotguns, a magnum, machine guns, etc. You can get higher scores by making combos, that is, by shooting multiple enemies without missing and not getting hit.I had one minor bug in the game, where it wouldn't spawn any zombies and I had to restart the game. It was early on in the stage, no big deal.The graphics are good, the blood and \"damage\" is okay looks like a gibfest.It is short, and doesn't leave much desire to be replayed, since you can't really upgrade \"for sure\" and takes forever to make money. And all the high scores on the \"Story Mode\" already have prefilled computer scores with ridiculously high scores (\"Agent G\"), so no fun there.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

Do We Care?","reviewText":"First off, after reading a lot of the review below, I caught myself wondering if we were talking about the same game. Graphics? \"Unbelievable??\" - Either someone is pulling the consumer's chain or these reviewers have not played very many video games in their life. The graphics are sub-par. Mediocore at best. The level design is very average and bland with little to be real excited about. The character models are OK, but again, rather bland.But the issue here is gameplay. While at times, the gameplay is fun (e.g. fighting agents or a couple bad guys at once) sometimes, the gameplay is just plain annoying. Mostly due to the very poor control setup. Using your weapons in the game (e.g. pistols, shotguns) is pretty much useless. Targeting barely works at all and it all feels very clunky and awkward. Most of the game I found myself fighting with my hands, just to avoid using the weapons.The Story: \"Who Cares?\" That is the question. We are thrown into a story that is barely coherent to begin with and on top of that, we get to play as 2 characters that we don't know, and most importantly, don't like. I have no interest in playing with either of these characters. Not letting us play with Morpheus, Trinity or Neo is simply, a smack in the face.Anyway, It's not all bad. Some levels are quite fun to play...beating up every guy you see and trying to pull off cool \"bullet-time\" moves on them. This, in my opinion, is the redeeming quality of the game and earns 2 of it's 3 stars. The other star is earned by the effort that went into putting the dvd quality cut scenes into the game and having the game work around those.In summary, This can be a fun game at times, it can also be annoying. I suggest renting it to see if you're going to like it or not before shelling out the 50 bones for it. If you ask me, this game is nowhere near the ground breaking game it was hyped up to be.

The FF series is mostly okay, but Mystic Quest is terrible.Mystic Quest was, as far as I know, a pitiful attempt by the Japanese dominated market of the time to create a 'trainer' RPG for stupid Americans.  Those stupid Americans were woefully underestimated.Mystic Quest has a plot more suitable for a side-scroller than an RPG: Find the four crystals and kill the main bad guy, and thereby save the world.  That's about it.  The standard talking and house invasion system is used, but nobody really has anything to say.There is a small assortment of friendly characters who join your party at the game's discretion.  They don't really have much to say, either.  The one guy is a ninja, I guess, which is nice.  He was my favorite.The combat system is nothing, just straight turn-based attack button pressing.  You can also cast one of a small number of spells, using a system in which you can cast a certain number of each spell type (white, black), rather than using magic points.  Also, for some reason, unless you change it, your HP are represented by bars rather than numbers.  Between towns, you fight in arenas (by the way, there is no wandering in the wilderness) which are boring, but you get prizes, so I did them anyway.  There are also only random encounters in some of the dungeons, and set monsters is the others (one is even a mixture of the two).  Don't ask why.  Having mostly non-random monsters earns Mystic Quest its first star.The graphics are downright bad, but I've come to expect that from old games.  They aren't too much worse than, say, FFIV.  The music, on the other hand, is great for old school stuff.  Good enough to earn Mystic Quest its second star.Anyways, Mystic Quest is awful, though almost comparable to FFIV, but much worse.  Maybe it is good for training people into RPG's.  Someone who is young and hasn't played any RPG's.  Maybe.  It took me ten hours to beat, but could be done in five if you didn't mess around.  Take some advice from someone who paid 10$ for Mystic Quest: If you can't find it for [money]$ or less, don't bother.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2002"}
{"product_name":"B007FMSDUK","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Engel","summary":"Highly intelligent thriller interactive story, almost perfect","reviewText":"The real appeal here is that I haven't played a game this intellectual since the original Chrono Cross in '99. Like that title, which was almost too intellectual for its own good, this game takes real concepts from the real world, such as Schrodinger's Cat, the nature of choice, the Prisoner's Dilemma, multi-Universes, and why people act the way they do depending on the situation, both consciously and unconsciously.If you want cheap thrills Resident Evil-style, forget it. This isn't about that. This is about wrapping your head around a plot that can easily confuse you if you're not paying attention, and the way it unfolds only gradually begins to make sense--even given the way the concept of time and the future is treated. Don't be fooled by the somewhat generic intro, which, while entertaining, has nothing to do with the real meat of the game.Once the game starts getting into what is real and not real and why we believe what we believe about others, and then what that means in the long run, and also why anyone's there to begin with, it's practically impossible to get away from it because you just have to see what happens next. I actually stayed up until 6 AM in the hopes that I'd reach the ending...But I never did, and I have yet to fully complete it, even though I know what I have to do.That's why every character playing the Nonary Game has their own individual ending. Generally, if you reach their \"correct\" ending (everyone also seems to have an instant Game Over ending), you gain a piece of information you *will* need to solve the later mysteries. If you fail to make note of these particular things, (e.g., a particular string of numbers or something that happened in a past \"history\" you were a part of), you'll be at a disadvantage as the game goes on.Naturally, the story has some seriously major *WHAMS* near the end. What starts as a pretty simple \"Whodunit\" gradually progresses into something way, way bigger, encompassing the fate of the entire Earth population. Some of the things that are revealed about certain characters will blow you away, and you'll be wondering how you didn't notice in the first place.Worth noting, in addition to the story, is the excellent voice acting. Phi in particular has a spectacularly versatile emotional range. All the while, you're facing impossible questions about everyone else, but the more you play, the more that's revealed, and all of it is voiced surprisingly convincingly. Whether it's Dio, K, Alice, Clover, Tenmyouji, Quark, or anyone else talking to you, their personalities come out in full as the game goes on as they can't help but start feeling desperate. All of the VAs are fantastic and are convincing, but the real VA hero here is Phi, someone who clearly knows far more than she lets on. She's exceptionally convincing in both the way she words things and why she seems to know you right from the start, as well as her extraordinarily knowledge and ability to reason, and it's almost intimidating. Let's just say you'll be guessing until the end whether or not she's an ally or an opponent--or both, depending on how you look at it.There are no \"filler\" characters to speak of, and no one is simply ignored for the \"important\" characters--they're all necessary to fit into the story so it makes any sense. Clover, in particular, has an ending of her own that I still have difficulty reaching any conclusions on, but I will say that it will *shock the freaking hell out of you* if you follow her all the way to her ending.Anyway, I won't skirt by trying not to spoil anything anymore, but let's just affirm that this is one complicated-as-hell story, but mercifully not in a way that makes no sense. In fact, everything makes perfect sense, which is why it's so engrossing. You never know who's lying or telling the truth--not even the most trustworthy-seeming people turn out to be trustworthy, but they always have a reason for it that makes sense. Further, questions continue to arise as to why they're there to begin with, and what their individual purposes are. It's all complicated, and it's all addictive beyond belief to know what happens next.If I have one thing in particular to complain about, it's the sometimes-insensible puzzles that you may read one way correctly, but the game expects you to read it a different way, leaving you stuck. Of particular note are the Infirmary and Archive rooms, each with a notoriously difficult puzzle if you want both the password to the safe and the password to the secret documents also contained. The hints you're given, assuming you're playing on the default difficulty level, don't seem to make any sense no matter how much you look at what you have and the instruments around the room. Most of the rooms are fairly straightforward and their solutions can be figured out easily enough, but it's easy to get caught in a trap of logic in which you know you're right, but the game simply doesn't tell you it wants your solution to the problem done *another* way. Obviously, this is frustrating, and you could spend hours on a single puzzle before giving up and just looking it up. For the past rooms mentioned, you get a pass for this, because the evidence they give you is just inadequate to make that kind of solution they expect. They're such far stretches from an answer you'd think would be relatively simple, but the game fails to give many hints.In short, good luck with the near-impossible fabric number puzzle in the Infirmary and the equally difficult Blue Ink puzzle in the Archives. You'll swear to God that the solution that you end up with *must* be correct, but the machine will always tell you you're wrong. Yeah, it can get frustrating, but that's why walkthroughs exist for puzzles that are stupidly illogical.Anyway, once the ball really starts rolling in the story and a massive variety of seemingly random deaths and reveals happen, get ready for one of the most mind-blowing stories told in video games in a long, long time. The atmosphere always makes you feel unsafe, so to even walk around the building you're stuck in is nerve-wracking. It kind of reminds me of Resident Evil, except instead of zombies killing you, it's just other people waiting for you to turn your back. Depending on the paths you choose in the 24 different endings (!), you can end up with all kinds of outcomes. However, if you want the \"True Ending\", you're going to have to work to get it. It's not so much that what you have to do is particularly difficult--you just have to gather every scrap paper of evidence you can find and fill up your archive to the brim to help you later--but it is time-consuming.Luckily, if you screw up so badly that you cause your own game over, your \"consciousness\" will immediately shift to any point in time you choose via a flow chart. The chart labels every event on every path you can take, and you can immediately jump back to one if you realize you don't have enough information to continue down a certain path without more information. You'll know you've reached this point if the end says \"TO BE CONTINUED...\" which is very different from \"GAME OVER...\" The latter means you can't go any further no matter what. The former means you're lacking enough knowledge and information to prevent the disaster that's happened, but can be prevented if you make different choices.Because you can jump to and from any point in your respective timelines, you don't have to worry about starting new games every single time you mess up fatally. If you do get a game over, you're sent back to the save screen, upon which you *should* save, and then immediately backtrack on the timeline to a place where you think you screwed up.A game of extreme intellectualism, complicated but coherent story, unpredictable characters with their own individual motivations, and you making the choices you think are right all along the way, this game wastes no time at all in allowing you to play detective. Granted, you can't act *outside* events, but you would have no reason to, anyway. Any event that is \"Locked\" requires information you do not have yet. And so, you try to think of where you could get the information you need, and travel down that path (most likely hitting \"Skip\" for all dialogue until something new happens) before trying a second time. The whole point of the game is to get the truth, and to do that, you need to earn the trust of individuals to get as much information as possible about their pasts, and then piece everything together until it makes a semblance of sense.I think you get the idea by now. This is basically an interactive mystery novel in which there are obvious clues, not-so-obvious clues, and also misleading clues that you need to consider the importance of.I'll tell you one thing: If you were a fan of the DS' Ace Attorney series, you should feel right at home here. There is a great deal of similarity between the two series--however, ZE has the strong advantage of making *sense*. Ace Attorney games, while entertaining, always seemed to suffer from significant plot holes or things that didn't really add up at the end. ZE, on the other hand, is actually sensible, and in a way, that makes things even creepier.Extremely highly recommended for anyone with the slightest interest in this game, unless you're easily offended by mature content, because this game has that with no restraints. It well deserves its \"M\" rating for the incredible violence that happens and the frequent sexual innuendo, not to mention being so close to themes like suicide and the idea of someone smiling at you with trust just before suddenly being killed by someone for getting too close to you. The language is also pretty bad, with the F-bomb dropped on a frequent basis and a unique level of sexual innuendo used as an insult for some characters who aren't exactly dressed for the occasion. Even you, the main character, sometimes lets his sexual feelings toward some of the participants come through. Nothing is really held back here.Really, even if you've never played the original, it doesn't matter too much. The connections are there, but they aren't critical to the story, and if they are, they're explained in plenty of detail. This, obviously, becomes important later on. It would be a crime to deny a game this well-written to not be played, especially on that beautiful 5\" OLED screen on the face of the Vita.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2012"}

This game has practically got it all: action, adventure, betrayal, romance, magic, monsters, and a couple of plot twists here and there. The only thing this game could have used more of was... more content. It's not a very long game; even first time players should be able to beat it in about 7 hours or less. The game's story is derived from classic Arabian knights fairy tales, much like Aladdin, and you play as the titular Prince (who's name is NEVER revealed in the entire series) who ends up having to save Persia and ultimately the world from the mysterious Sands of Time, which he himself was tricked into releasing by the treacherous and Jaffar-like Vizier. When the Sands are released from the Hourglass in which they were contained, they spread rapidly through the Sultan's palace of Azad in which the Prince was staying in along with his father, King Sharaman, and his army. All the soldiers and citizens are turned into deadly sand creatures; the only ones not affected were the wielders of other Sands of Time artifacts: the Prince, the Vizier, and Farah, the Indian princess whose kingdom was conquered by the Prince and his father just before she was taken to Azad as a slave. The Prince and Farah then form an initially uneasy alliance to stop the Vizier and his army of sand creatures by locking up the Sands back into the Hourglass. In order for the Prince to make it through all the sand creatures and deadly palace traps alive, he'll have to make full use of his agility, wits, sword, and the Sands themselves through use of the Dagger of Time. The focus of the gameplay revolves around avoiding the aforementioned traps, which usually consist of spiked pits and moving sawblades, as well as navigating through the numerous rooms and areas of the enormous palace. While the adventure is actually very linear, the different environments are normally rather large and it could take time to figure out exactly where the Prince has to go to next in order to advance.For the most part however, the game is good at pointing out which ledge you have to jump to or which pole you have to swing to; further aid is offered whenever the Prince walks into one of many sand vision clouds/save points located between each major area, which give the Prince brief black and white flashes of the future that show him some of the obstacles he will face in the next area and how best to circumvent them. Even with these special hints, some of these environmental obstacles require more than one try to get past, usually because some of the leaps of faith the Prince makes require quick reflexes (like if he's hanging onto a pole that's about to break off from its wall) or making sure the Prince is precisely lined up for a tricky jump to a ledge. Should you be off the mark and are plummeting to your death, the Prince can rewind time to about 5 seconds or so and correct whatever mistake he made so he won't die prematurely. Of course, there's a limit to how often you can reverse time, and that depends on how much of the Sands the Prince has in the Dagger. Along with its unique gameplay, this game even handles dying in a rather unique manner: if the Prince dies, the Prince himself, who is narrating the story, will tell the player \"No, no, no...that's not what happened. Let me go back a bit.\" Somehow, it kind of helps take away the frustration of dying ,and thankfully the game will only take you back a little bit if you die, since the save points aren't too far off from one another. Skilled players won't die in this game much anyway, thanks to the tight and responsive controls.As for putting Sands in the Dagger, that usually requires the Prince absorbing the many sand creatures that attack him into the Dagger of Time, and using their essence to power the Dagger's time warping abilities. While the game's combat is fun, it's not terribly deep, and aside from a few acrobatic sword slashes in which the Prince jumps off a wall or vaults over an enemy to slash them from behind, he only has one standard, and very long, sword combo. Still, knowing when to block or dodge your enemies and when to take the offensive is important, as you'll usually have several sand creatures (normally up to 5 or 6 at a time) attacking you from all sides and they can overwhelm the Prince if you're not careful. Even though most sand creatures are slow, they can teleport right at you if you're too far away and some are really good at blocking and countering certain sword attacks. Fortunately, for about 60% of the adventure, the Prince has Farah to help him out, and unlike most AI controlled assist characters, Farah can be rather helpful in a jam. Aside from actually being a necessary helper in getting past some of the game's puzzles, which there are plenty of and usually involve pulling the right lever or switch at the right time, Farah can assist in combat. She'll shoot and stun sand creatures with her bow and arrow; they can only be killed by the Dagger of Time or by being completely pulverized into dust, which isn't really an option until the end of the game (I won't spoil anything with further details). After Farah stuns an enemy, this gives the Prince an opening to attack if he's ever surrounded. However, the Prince must also make sure Farah isn't killed by the sand creatures either, or else it's game over.Farah might accidentally shoot and damage the Prince during battle, but it's not very common; the Prince is also capable of harming Farah, but it's ill advised to attack her if she hits you, since she dies rather easily (besides, she's a lady). Aside from being a good combat team, the Prince and Farah bring some humor into the mix with their playful banter, like the Prince commmenting on Farah's usefulness in being able to slip through cracks in the walls that he can't go through since she's a \"skinny little thing\" or Farah annoying the Prince with her occasional bossing around. Even when alone, the Prince amusingly complains to himself about things bothering him like Farah letting him do all the work or the fact that the palace is easy to get lost in. Finally, what brings it all together is how beautiful the game looks. The in-game character models are cartoony, colorful, and detailed. The facial expressions match well with what the characters are feeling and experiencing, and are very believable, and the accompanying voice acting is spot on and very well done. However, it's the environments that steal the show in terms of how beautiful the game looks. Whether climbing the towers of the palace with the desert in the background and watery fields hundreds of feet below under a sunny or night sky, or crawling through the dark ruins and catacombs deep beneath the palace, the game looks fantastic. So all in all, this game is a must buy, in case you haven't figured that out already after reading this review. Despite its shortness, this game is definitely worth a purchase, especially if you're looking for a game with an adventurous fairy tale feel to it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2011"}

It just spins around everywhere since it is so close to Snake, not much overhead like the old MGS. The graphic was average, nothing too spectacular, but I guess that's because MGS4 is an old game.

{"product_name":"B00309XHD0","description":"","reviewerName":"andrew806","summary":"Sick!","reviewText":"The first few moments of Dead Space 2 smartly accomplish a good deal in a very short amount of time. We get a glimpse into Isaac's psychological state, his psyche still tormented by the painful loss he experienced on the Ishimura during the events of the first game. We also learn that the three years since then have been little more than a blur to Isaac--he's in some kind of hospital facility, but has only the vaguest memories of his time there. And almost before you can say \"necromorph outbreak,\" you take control of Isaac as he runs for his life from the hideous creatures who, for reasons that aren't immediately clear, have suddenly appeared and started slaughtering the human population here in the Sprawl, a vast urban area on Titan, Saturn's largest moon. Isaac, who said not a word in the original game, has a voice here, and although he's a bit bland as a character, the intensity of the action that surrounds him makes you feel invested in his desperate struggle for survival. Revealing glimpses into the world of Dead Space--such as a trek through a Unitology center that sheds light on the inner workings of the church whose activity is inextricably linked to the necromorph outbreaks--keep the momentum rolling during the early chapters. The game later falls into predictable rhythms for a while, but it picks up steam again toward the end, as the story goes to some unexpected and exciting places and puts almost as much emphasis on Isaac's struggle against his own demons of guilt and regret as on his battles against the necromorphs.But those battles against the hideous undead mutations remain front and center, where they belong. The key to dropping necromorphs is still blasting off their often frighteningly pointy limbs, which you do with a number of repurposed mining tools and a few actual guns, all of which feel powerful and are immensely fun to use. All of the weapons from Dead Space return in this sequel, including the plasma cutter and the line gun, which fire beams of energy capable of slicing necromorph limbs clean off. Another returning weapon is the ripper, a terrific tool whose spinning blade can result in a noisy, grisly end to necromorphs who make the mistake of getting too close to you. And there are a few new weapons as well: the detonator lets you place laser-triggered trip mines to set explosive traps for approaching necromorphs, and the javelin gun fires spikes at such a tremendous velocity that any necromorph unfortunate enough to be in their path is likely to find itself impaled to a wall.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house.

I dislike the multiple planes on which to walk, as I often find myself on the wrong side or switching when I don't want to. The physics are just off a bit. Jumping isn't as smooth or reliable as I'd like.

There are many creative concepts to be sure - some I enjoyed quite a bit. But playing a game within a game is only fun for so long. If I want Pac-Man, I'll play real Pac-Man instead of LBP's fake Pac-Man.The stickers do nothing for me, by the way. They just seem like another shiny thing to distract you from the poor gameplay.

Cloaked in stealth, you will move unseen through crowds, travel stories above the peasant herds on which you feed--leaping from rooftop to rooftop--and use mind control to overcome vampire-proof inventions. The combat choreography unfolds with dancelike precision as Kain engages armies of demons and humans alike. The comprehensive menu of unstoppable attacks, nimble combos, and special moves are designed to appeal to even the most jaded of fighting-game fans. The world that Kain moves through is a lushly detailed gothic environment that is not only gorgeous to the eye, but also alive with the soon-to-be-dead. The AI behavioral response makes peasants and enemies variously flee, take up arms, or remain unaware as Kain moves through crowds or charges, sword raised, into open areas.","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"A sore dissapointment for those following the story closely","reviewText":"Continuity is a beautiful thing. At times it may be acceptable to ignore continuity that is ancient history. Grant Morrison refuses to deal with past issues in X-Men, the Marvel Ultimate line has thrown continuity out the window entirely, but these are stories that are some forty or fifty years old, Legacy of Kain isn't even ten yet. Soul Reaver has had extreme attention to detail, and only one issue of continuity remains in Soul Reaver, leaving out the fact that Vorador attacked the Sarafan with the Soul Reaver in the original Blood Omen, a plot element that seems to have been forgotten, but is a nit pick and not that important.Kain has always been about the story, and no other series has had such critical continuity, but in playing Blood Omen 2, which lets the player reprise the role of Kain himself, it would seem that the development team (which is different from the minds behind Soul Reaver) has not played any of the previous games. There are some serious plot issues in hand that contradict the original Blood Omen, as well as work against Soul Reaver, most notably, Vorador, love him as we all do, and his dealings in this game. It seems to me that someone on the writing staff wasn't informed that Vorador was decapitated by Mobious in a public execution toward the end of the original, a fact that was reiterated in Soul Reaver 2. This issue creates a massive hole in the timeline that is frustrating me because I want to know how Vorador managed to survive having his head taken off.The game is a lot of fun, and sadistically satisfying. A lot of games have been very tame of late, and it's been hard to find a game that's been ridiculously gory. This game has plenty of blood, and doesn't hold back at all, and for that I have to give it praise. However, despite being fun there are a few issues that plague the game. How hard would it have been to build this game on the Soul Reaver engine? The control is more similar to Tomb Raider than it's predecessors and that is a serious draw back for the intense combat situations, it makes it harder to get away. While Raziel could literally run circles around groups of enemies at a time swiping every which way at his whim, Kain is stick with the pivot, press up to move forward garbage that has plagued many of Eidos' games for ages, an archaic style that I had hoped died. There is also an unreasonable amount of slowdown where the frame rate drops significantly. This is especially annoying when taking on multiple enemies at the same time.Over all Blood Omen 2 is a good game, but if you are a Kain Devotee, then you will likely demand an explanation for Vorador, among other holes this game puts into the over all Nosgoth timeline. This game raises more questions than it answers; in fact it fails to answer any questions at all. I still like the story, but for continuity's sake, one may need to dismiss this game the way we have to dismiss &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; for the Bond franchise.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2002"}

Killzone 2 isn't Call of Duty, it is a much slower game.  Different doesn't mean bad, though some have trouble understanding the difference.  The movement in Killzone 2 is heavy, it takes a more realistic approach to warfare.  Your character does not have ability to carry two assault rifles, but rather 1 pistol and 1 rifle, which once again is how Killzone plays, it is a more realistic first person shooter.  Graphically the game is technically stellar, nothing matches Killzone.  The animations are truly the best yet in gaming and the amount of stuff going on at once is crazy.  The big complaint against Killzone 2 is the environments don't really change.  There isn't snow levels, jungle levels, etc.  The entire game is dark, drab and features destroyed environments.  Once again Killzone 2 goes for the more realistic approach to portraying war.  The game features 7.1 PCM sound which is results in the best sounding game to date, the guns sound especially great.  The controls while heavy work for the game.  I can appreciate that Killzone 2 isn't for everybody.  It isn't Halo or CoD, it takes an unique path and stands alone.  I for one loved the more slow/heavy feel and realistic scenario.  For those who love how fast Halo or CoD play, I suggest skipping this title.  For those who don't mind slower first person titles, this game is a must own.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2010"}

The city of Columbia itself is fully realized and an absolute beauty to behold, gameplay is solid, your protagonist is likable and so is your companion Elizabeth (Who SERIOUSLY reminds me of Belle from Disney's Beauty and the Beast)  The only thing I didn't really love about Bioshock Infinite was the sky traveling system.  In theory, it's a great idea-but the implementation not so much. (Look to Metroid 3 for a better implementation of a similar system)  Once you grab hold of the rails, you move so fast and so erratic it's impossible to really tell what's going on.  I also thought the first part of the game was very slow with a lot of pointless meandering until you finally get to the action (where as previous games drop you into the action straight away).  And as for the story-I don't usually care too much about a game's story when I'm playing but this one was interesting-in the end though, it just seemed a little convoluted and difficult to truly wrap your head around.  (Kinda like Donnie Darko but with a video game.)  Small complaints overall though.  There really isn't a great deal wrong with Bioshock Infinite.  You can tell that the developers put a ton of TLC into this game and it shows throughout.  One thing I truly missed though was some kind of Big Daddy/Little Sister element.  There was nothing more satisfying in the first two games then taking out Big Daddies and saving/harvesting the Little Sisters.  Sure, this game had \"Handy Men\"-but it's just wasn't the same-they were basically just a generic additonal enemy.  I hope they bring back Big Daddies and Little Sisters for the next game.

{"product_name":"B0050SXFKE","description":"","reviewerName":"Subject7","summary":"Misses the haystack","reviewText":"Echoing what pretty much every 3 star reviewer here has stated, the quality is a mixed bag and the game as a whole feels unfinished. Some cutscenes and dialog lacked flow and felt disjointed which ruined the mood. The colonial America setting was a mistake and it shows. Yes it is beautiful but it is also mind numbingly boring. The tombs from previous AC games are replaced with long, maze like tunnels with very little climbing and the buildings are no where near as grand or interesting as those from AC2. The people of the city were also rather dull and lacked that fun energy that Italy had. Being able to traverse through open forests was a welcomed addition and the navel battles were incredibly fun, but insufficient.Beyond these problems there were numerous glitches and design flaws sprinkled throughout that a game of this caliber should not have. Sometimes the controls were too responsive during free running and unresponsive during combat. Certain assignments (like mail delivery) were confusing and vantage points do not reveal all of the map, requiring you to walk in a sweeping motion revealing a radius of 10 feet or so at a time.And then there's the ending. I won't go into details but I literally checked the box to see if EA's logo was on it. I understand wanting to prolong the series beyond AC3 but doing so at the expense of a decent conclusion to this trilogy left me feeling drained and fed up of this series as a whole. The characters at least were interesting and I felt most of the emotional highs and lows.AC3 is a good game that should have been great. I recommend picking it up but suggest aiming below $40.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2013"}

Driven by pure revenge, nothing can stop Kratos from achieving absolution.","reviewerName":"drqshadow","summary":"The Must-Have PS2 Title for 2005","reviewText":"God of War is, at heart, a beat-em-up action game, pulled straight out of the genre's heyday in the early '90s and amped up tenfold. It's set in ancient Greece, a time period that's been surprisingly underexplored by previous titles, and benefits greatly from both the physical setting and the notion that this world, where Gods would toy with men and monsters still roamed the land, operated under a different set of rules. There's a lot of stuff that this game does right, but at the very top of the list is its ability to overwhelm the gamer with jaw-droppingly effective \"holy crap\" moments, paired with the dramatic camera angles to completely drive the message home. It's something I can only really liken to a great summer Hollywood action movie; the ability to completely and utterly captivate an audience with an astonishing visual, to marry them to the entire package with just a few well-placed, well-executed surprises.As Kratos, a former Spartan warrior with a violently checkered past, you're unleashed upon the armies of the undead as they make a move to overthrow the legendary city of Athens. Along the way, you'll run into just about every noteworthy inhabitant of Greek legend and, nine times out of ten, wind up brutally dismembering them in some sort of memorable way. Truly, the story itself is merely passable. It serves to carry you from one famous setting to the next, from mythical beast to mythical beast, but it's not something I'm going to go out of my way to commend. Kratos' past especially leaves a lot to be desired, and follows the carefully-established path of cliche from start to finish. Occasionally you'll catch a moment of inspiration, like the time a civilian catches an arrow in the back of the head, right in the middle of a conversation with Kratos, but I was hoping for a bit more depth than what I got. It feels like they finished a rough outline covering all of the game's big moments, and then forgot to fill in the areas in between with substance. On that same hand, the story doesn't get in the way by forcing too much dialog or over-detailed plot development, so I can't say it's totally wretched. I was motivated throughout the game, constantly prodded by the promise of new wonders just around the corner, but found it to be overall a bit shorter than I'd have liked. Start to finish, you'll run through maybe half a dozen different levels. Some are emphasized to the point of redundancy, (I could've done with a little less Athens) some are cut painfully short, (the imaginative level in Hades is just starting to get good when you're pulled away) and others are just long enough (The dungeons and puzzles in Pandora's Temple are very solid). I kept getting the feeling that they were holding some things back for a sequel, and that really started to irritate me by the time I reached the end.The gameplay is a refreshing change of pace from the usual button-mashing fare you'd expect from a third person action title. Sure, there are plenty of moments where you'll find yourself completely surrounded, madly pounding on the square button in the hopes that it will somehow allow you to live through the ordeal. There are also dozens of instances where you'll have no chance in hell if that's the only offensive tactic you've learned. As you progress through the game and slowly build the strength of your weapons, (a pair of short swords, attached to Kratos' arms by chains and swung recklessly in battle) you'll unlock more and more potential attacks, which give you the capability to execute longer and longer combos. What's cool is that none of these attacks are particularly difficult to pull off, and there's a great deal of tact and timing involved in successfully using them. The most difficult combination doesn't require the use of more than three different buttons, and is open-ended to allow you to seamlessly float from one attack to the next. However, try to jump in with a super-powerful assault right off the bat, and your enemies are likely to catch you with a quick jab before you've landed a single blow.Where God of War really makes its name is in the almost disturbingly violent throws and special maneuvers that are a part of any good combination. Every action / fighter since Double Dragon has had a grappling or throwing system of some sort, however simple and underdeveloped it might be... but in this department, God of War takes all that have come before and literally tears them to shreds in a crimson mist. After sufficiently weakening most enemies, you're given the opportunity to either finish them off traditionally with a few additional shots, or to seal the deal in style by grabbing them and performing some sort of horrific finisher that often leaves them missing limbs, vital organs or entire mid-sections. Naturally, the stronger the enemy, the more impressive the killing blow... but weaker enemies offer a lot more variety than the bosses or their immediate superiors. Some of the things you can do to the bosses almost defy description, and although performing them requires a series of timed button presses, (not unlike the action system of Shenmue) you'll almost always feel like Rambo upon their successful completion thanks to the end result.Physically controlling Kratos, as I alluded to earlier, is just a breeze. The buttons you'll find yourself pounding the most (aside from the analog sticks, of course) are the X and square buttons, which are your jump and basic attack buttons, respectively. Occasionally you'll run into problems with the grabs, controlled with the O button, especially when you get further into the game and most enemies aren't susceptible to them until they're extremely worn down. A grab isn't very precise, and routinely targets the wrong enemy when you're facing a crowd. Factor in the speed of these enemies' counter-attacks and the moment's pause a missed grab causes, and I'm sure you can imagine the accumulated hours of cursing I spent on blown attempts at grabbing an enemy.The cameras control themselves, which is a welcome solution to the camera angles that have plagued so many other third-person games. Although this does cause problems once in a while, giving off-camera enemies the chance to catch you completely by surprise and hiding special items in places that would have otherwise been in plain sight, I think the benefits far outweigh the downfalls. Without a computer-controlled camera, none of the astonishing visuals I mentioned earlier would have been possible, and the carefully-directed angles throughout the game do an excellent job of highlighting the most visually exciting sections of the screen. It feels like you're controlling a movie from time to time, these angles are so overbearingly cinematic.The game's visuals are outstanding, especially the high-definition cutscenes that show up once or twice per level, and shows off what are surely the absolute limits of the PS2's graphical potential. I'd put this game in the same class as Final Fantasy X and Gran Turismo 4 visually, at the very top of Sony's heap. The hardware's lack of any anti-aliasing capabilities are occasionally noticeable, which leads me to believe the game would look even better on the Xbox or Gamecube, but on the PS2 it just isn't going to get much better than this. Add a unique visual style that fills every facet of the game, an outstanding set of enemy designs and some top-notch environment detailing and you've got a surefire winner.The audio does a fine job of accompanying the visual superiority it's asked to accent, with some very good voice acting stealing the show. A lot of times voice-over work in video games just doesn't feel professional, like the actors are afraid to really let it all hang out and ACT. That's no problem here, as the voices of Kratos, the gods, and even the civilians are strong, well-read and believable. The way some of the dialog was written, many of these lines could have come off as excessively cheesy, (Kratos shouting ARRREEEEES spontaneously on the field of battle immediately springs to mind) but are performed almost spectacularly and add to the game's ability to draw a player in like a great motion picture. The music swells and crescendos as you sail into battle, and calms down as you wander an empty hallway. It rises to meet the arrival of an important cutscene, but never to the point that you notice it building.With an unprecedented amount of gratuitous violence, blood, guts, gore, full-frontal nudity and various sex scenes, I can't over-emphasize God of War's rating as an M title. It's not for kids, and it's probably not for some weak-hearted adults. If you've been to a summer blockbuster over the last few years, however, you've seen it all before. For a tough-to-offend guy in his mid-20s such as myself, this game is just a lot of fun. The battles are deep, but not over-detailed and confusing. The story is exciting, if not totally compelling. The graphics are top-of-the-line, and the audio is very, very good. Despite a few missteps in the battle system and a few weak moments in the story, I don't think I've played a more enjoyable game on the PS2 all year. The difficulty is set firmly onto a slow curve, the fights grow to be very difficult, but never infuriatingly so, and the boss fights are something special.

{"product_name":"B00DE2W4PK","description":"","reviewerName":"SirPasta117","summary":"Great launch bundle and excellent hardware. Bad packaging.","reviewText":"First off both Amazon and Sony did not do a very good job at packing this expensive device up. The actual PS4 is only support by cardboard, and Amazon was quite stingy with the protective bubbles and half of the bubbles were deflated by the time it got to my door step. Luckily I received mine with no issues.The PS4 itself is quite simply gorgeous. It has a sleek angular profile with hard lines and concealed buttons and ports. It can easily blend into an existing entertainment cabinet, but at the same time its still eye catching thanks to the angled edges. My only complaint is minor. The power button sits right between the glossy plastic and matte plastic and the glossy plastic loves thumbprints. Fairly minor issue, but still a slight annoyance for people like myself that hate to see oil thumbprints.The controller is without a doubt the best Playstation controller yet. It has a good weight to it, all of the buttons and triggers have excellent tactile response, and the thumbsticks are a vast improvement thanks to the right on the edge. Sadly there are a few things Sony need to work on. First off, the battery life is abysmal. A puny 6-8 hours of battery life is unacceptable in this day and age and I blame it squarely on the constantly glowing lightbar. The lightbar is mainly an addition that only works with the sold separately camera. There are a few other uses for the light bar, such as telling multiple players which character they are, or showing a characters health, but due to the inward angle the lightbar lies you have to tilt the controller toward you in order to see it and taking your eyes off the game. My other complaint was the trackpad, its a good idea on paper but was poorly designed. Its simply too small for anything useful other than quick swipes. Its curves over the top of the controller so its difficult to tell where the touch sensitive part ends by touch.As for Killzone I really enjoyed it. Its without a doubt the best looking game available for the PS4, and arguable available period. The particle effects look fantastic, and levels are diverse and looks amazing. It carries over the same sound effects from previous Killzone titles. The pings, clicks, and thuds are very unique to the Killzone universe and are quite pleasant to listen to. Story wise the game struggles. It feels like each level is trying to show off some new graphical tech and the story takes back seat. Then again the Killzone story was nothing really ever anything to write home about, I doubt there are many fans invested into the story lines and characters. The abrupt ending strongly hints at a sequel. Now that the developers have shown off all of the new graphical improvements perhaps they can take some time and work on the story.All in all I am quite pleased with this bundle. New hardware, a killer title, and $10 cheaper than buying everything separate. This was a no brainer for me. My only complaint was the 12 months of Playstation Plus was sent out via email and not a physical card.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00009TW6R","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play. However you choose to hero your way throughHalo: Combat Evolved, the action should break in your new Xbox in explosive style.","reviewerName":"Ethan D Van Vorst","summary":"X-Box? What's that?","reviewText":"There are two major factions when it comes to video games, and if you weren't aware of their existence I'll be happy to illucidate for you. Group 1, and by far the most numerous, are the console gamers. Group number 2, the one to which I subscribe, is based on PC games. I'll be the first to admit that as a PC gamer I tend to view consoles with suspicion as my experiences are that they place looks, flash, and hefty price tags above gameplay and plot. The console audience tends to be younger than the PC group, and these are the very aspects which appeal to them. So it was equal parts hesitation and excitement that I felt as I put this game onto my hard drive. For those not in the know, once upon a time, back in the early days of Microsoft's X-Box, there was this nifty game called \"Halo\", and my how the console gamers snapped it up. I saw the commercials on TV of course, and thought it looked pretty good, but felt it too bad that it was an X-Box title and not one available on my trusty ol' PC.\"Halo\" puts the player squarely in the armored shoes of Master Chief, a one of a kind super-marine engineered to bring the big guns on the Covenant, a consortium of deranged religious aliens bent on the destruction of all of humanity. No ship is allowed to go to Earth as it's location is a closely held secret which the Covenant wishes to possess at all costs. But Earth is losing the war, precipitating the creation of a new super soldier, the Spartan-II. Just before the Spartan's were to be used on the Covenant's home planet the latter launches a surprise attack on the facility and destroys all but one; You. In a gambit to elude pursuit the last ship left, the Pillar of Autumn, jumps into hyperspace and ends up in orbit around a strange ringworld named Halo, but are immediately attacked by their pursuers, who seem to have tracked down the Autumn in no time. Now, complaint number one I have of this game stems from the fact that *everything* I just described is not taken from the game itself. It comes from the game's manual. A plot this interesting should at least have been included in the opening scenes. C'mon Microsoft, you have the money, pony it up to spruce up the introduction. It's a good plotline, so don't waste it on the manual, which will only be kept in a desk drawer of some juvenile for the next 10 years and forgotten until next decade's spring cleaning.Plot (and first gripe) now aside, let's focus on the game itself. I refuse to judge a game by it's age, as too many do nowadays...for instance, I still play the original Half-Life and think the plot and gameplay more than make up for the aged graphics. The game looked fine on my PC and I never experienced anything close to screen lag. The colors and contours of the alien world and ship hallways are nicely rendered and the sound and ambient noise are above average. The music itself has nice choral sequences (such as featured on the menu screen) to downright cheap MIDI sounding music, which felt out of sorts with the rest of the game. The weapons selection is small but surprisingly good, and for any given situation you'll likely have access to the weapon/s needed to surmount it. I particularly like the Plasma Pistol with it's supercharged shots, as well as that everlasting mainstay of FPS games, the shotgun.The ability to drive vehicles is included in the game, something that separates Halo from most other FPS's, and it is a lot of fun. In particular I loved driving the Scorpion tank, which demolishes everything in it's path. You can also fly around in an enemy Banshee light fighter, which made getting past a couple of levels that much easier. The game's plot flows smoothly and the voice acting is pretty good.And now for the gripes. Right off the bat I will say that level design has to be the single biggest detraction from this game. Beautiful outdoor environments are used in this game, but not *nearly* enough. You'll spend most of it traversing hallway after hallway, which connect to rooms that look *identical* to the one you just left. Doing this 2-3 times is enough, but when you spread out a level that runs outwards of up to 3 hours of the *same thing*, it gets reaaaally stale. Case in point, in the chapter/s in which you spend time with the Monitor traveling through the Library. This section of the game was draining and seemed without end. It wasn't fun, just stressful. The level in which the player is introduced to the Flood felt much the same, although it was still a lot of fun.Vehicles are fun, but require the mouse to steer. This obviously is a remnant of the X-Box, where players had to steer the Warthog with the control toggle-thing, but I found that mostly it had me skidding against walls and occasionally flipping. The Ghost was the only vehicle I was able to use the strafe keys on to assist with steering. The enemies themselves do tend to get a little stale after a while, and during my first couple of hours of playing I wondered what I had gotten myself into. The Grunts, little pointy-backed gnomish aliens, spend most of their time running away and speaking an Ewok-accented English. It's very distracting and considering the nature of the other baddies they seemed a little out of place. The lumbering Hunter, who is super armored, was also incredibly stupid. At first I had trouble negotiating them, but soon learned that by employing certain attack patterns I could easily waste one in under a minute. The other aliens tend to use good combat tactics and I found dealing with them more difficult.The plot itself, which I classify as very good, bordering on great, kept me interested. It ain't Half-Life, but it works well enough to have my curiousity piqued about Halo 2, which I might have to go ahead and buy in the near future. I'm sure that had Halo been released on the PC first, which is what was originally intended, it'd have left a recognizable mark on the FPS shooter on that platform. So that's that. A very good game and one in which I look forward to the continuing storyline of Master Chief, killer extraordinaire!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00009ZVHU","reviewerName":"Abhilash.R \"The Sagittarian\"","summary":"A beautifully executed game...well worth the wait","reviewText":"Those who played Prince of Persia 3D have been left with nothing but nightmares. Jordan Mechner, the famed creator of the title, himself might have had sleepless nights regretting making this disaster. Yet the legacy has survived because the ubiquitous company called Ubisoft took over the reigns and brought out Prince of Persia : Sands of Time, a game so unique in both style and execution that the result is a fantastic adventure of epic proportion.You are the Prince, a warrior of immense skill and heart. When your father the king, invades a neighbouring kingdom and claims ascension, you seek the dagger of time , a legendary artifact that is said to manipulate time itself, as a gift to him. But when you pay heed to the deceitful Vizier and unlock its secret power, the sands of time is unleashed and the entire kingdom's inhabitants are transformed into zombies, save for you and a princess called Farrah. Together , you and Farrah must journey across the entire palace to unlock the true agenda of the Vizier and restore the sands of time.Interesting story, really. But it becomes second nature to the gameplay. Your prince is one agile character. He can scramble, flip, rebound, beam-walk, shimmy and do tons of other stuff with a grace and fluidity not seen in any game to date (barring Ninja Gaiden). I've heard that the prince has more than 750 animation moves !. Talk about thoroughness. The combat is all melee and the prince has a number of moves in his repertoire; flanking, defending, wall rebounding, vaulting etc. He has basically two swords at any time. A Scimitar, that will change to better versions as you progress and the Dagger of Time, his main magical secondary. With the Dagger, the Prince can unleash time reversal. You can reverse time anytime you wish so as to re-perform an action. Say you accidentally fell off a cliff, you can reverse time a bit and perform and avoid falling off again. But this can only be done a said number of times, depending on the number of 'sand tanks' the prince has. However the combat can become predictable as you will be facing only a few types of zombies all through the game, but it is still fun. The game is also pretty linear even though it appears open-ended. Fortunately, the save points are many and easy to find and at no point would you find this game daunting or habitually frustrating.  You'll also have Farrah by your side at times and the result can be some very amusing verbal exchanges. A great add-on.Also the sounds are top-notch with the ambient sounds and voice acting especially noteworthy. Ubisoft has taken great care to make this fantasy world even more believable.But the real beauty is the graphics and level design, more so the latter. Graphics is one of the best around and the game has a soft look to it, probably showcasing the transient beauty of the Arabian environment. Little additions like puffs of dust when the prince moves to the shimmering light from the palace windows, makes this game all the more beautiful to look at. The XBOX version supports enhanced lighting effects and greater polygon count, providing a richer, more immersive environment. And it is faster too. All in all, it is a feast for the eyes.But as I said, it is ultimately the level design which is astonishing. The Palace is immensely huge and varied, immersing you into a plethora of myriad architectures and puzzles that are both intuitive and interesting. Every level has been meticulously detailed and laid out ingeniously. The outdoor environments are downright jaw-dropping. At certain parts of the game, you have waterfalls , shimmering down into an endless abyss while you gaze far away into the mountains. Not even Halo gave me that sense of awe as Prince of Persia did. Hats off to the designers. Really, hats off.All in all, DON'T rent this game. Buy it!. It is worth every penny. It delivers a sense of grandness that very few titles can match. As its sequel, Prince of Persia :Warrior Within is due to be released shortly, you'd appreciate it even more if you played this classic.  I assure you you will not make a bad investment, even if you aren't a fan of this genre.Have fun.........","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2004"}

Although graphics have been updated significantly, they still retain their old look, so unless you don't mind bad graphics, you might want to leave this page now.  If the bad graphics don't bother you, then this compilation is a great addition to your collection, since, if you have bought every Final Fantasy game released for PS2 and PS1, you will have all but three, which tells us what will be next in all likelyhood.  Anyway, in addition to improved graphics, there are also new features, such as an ingame monster guide, updated with every battle, an item guide, updated with every found item, and an art gallery, updated when you get a certain amount of monsters and/or items.  I have completed Final Fantasy I and am working on Final Fantasy II off and on, and find them both fun.  Although Final Fantasy I doesn't have much of a system, just EXP and purchaseable spells, it is somehow addictive, and Final Fantasy II is interesting due to its plot and system similar to that in Chrono Cross.  While the games aren't the best in the series, not even close in fact, Square has dusted them off and improved them so that they are the best they can be, while still fitting on one disc, of course.  Also the release price was wonderfully reasonable.  I think if you want to buy a greatest hits Final Fantasy title, go for Final Fantasy VIII, VII, or just about any of the others (they're all in the greatest hits collection), but if you have those, and want to see where everything started, get Final Fantasy Origins, it's worth the money.An additional note: Final Fantasy was to be Squaresoft's last game.  It was supposed to be a goodbye present to the company's few fans.  Squaresoft was going bankrupt, or something like that at the time, so they decided to put everything into Final Fantasy.  On the days following its release, it sold so well that the dying company came back to life, continuing to make Final Fantasy sequals, along with other RPGs, always keeping that which revived them alive, with the title that was supposed to tell which of their games it was, the last (it has been a while since I heard that story, so some facts may be off, but if you are interested, you can always look online for the story)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2003"}

They were all three supposed to come out at the same time, and my mind was spinning as to which I would purchase.  I was positive that the Deus Ex sequel would be my favorite.  Luckily, it was the first one to be released.  Unfortunately, it was released with a fizzle, and now the company that made it, Ion Storm, has closed down.  A couple of months later, we get our hands on Doom 3.  While still hugely popular, it has a lot of problems, and can barely run on most machines.  It looks pretty though.  Enter Half-Life 2 - it's what the other two games wished they could be.The graphics in Half-Life 2 are the best I've ever seen.  The character models are unbelievably realistic.  The action is non-stop-balls-to-the-wall.  I remember playing the first Half-Life, and loved the way they linked all the levels together to seem like one big level.  Well, in this game, they have perfected this concept.  All the level transitions make perfect sense, and were it not for the loading times, you wouldn't even know it was another level.  I don't want to get into the story.. you should play it yourself, but I will say that this game is a treat to play.  It's exciting as hell, and it's got my vote for the best game ever made.  If you liked Half-Life, you'll love this sequel.I want to mention Steam now.  I hate hate hate the idea of having to run a seperate application that connects to the internet just to play these games.  It's obviously a very controversial subject, but I should say that it was no problem at all to get it all up and running.  It took only half as long for Steam to decrypt the game files as it did to install the game.  I'm pretty sure that updating Counter Strike Source took way longer.  Anyway, now that it's up and running, I find Steam to be a convenient way to connect to the multiplayer Half-Life / Half-Life 2 games.  They're all listed right there in one little box, and can be played quickly and easily at the click of a button.  So, if you're holding off buying this because of what other users have said about Steam, then I say go ahead and buy it.  I think most of the negative hype around Steam is pretty overblown.One more thing - there is a 3rd party mod for HL2 called HL2 Capture the Flag.  Get it!

Shockingly, this is everything the mario collection is NOT. It's WORTH something. The games seem to be ported properly, unlike the mario collection, and they added so much extra content, I love it. My favourite part of this game is the place you enter and get to look at all the history of kirby. Not just kirby either, I learnt a lot of other cool things about history in there as well. You get to play around with the cover arts and cases of previous releases of Kirby games and watch reviews on them.There are 7 games. 6 old school games, and the challenge stages. I've never played the first kirby games and I thought I wouldn't be interested but they are actually still kinda good even in today's world. I never owned the SNES kirby games either so getting them now was fun. The challenge stages were very impressive though. Some of the best graphics on Wii are in the challenge stages. New stages, new powers, it's the icing on the cake. A fresh new kirby game to take on, along with all the other master pieces of the past.What's REALLY cool though, and I mean REALLY, is that there full episodes of Kirby on this thing!

From GTA, to Call of Duty, to Mass Effect and Infamous(Yea, you have super powers in this one, because of course you do!)The game does manage to elicit some chuckles on occasion, but more often than not all it manages to cause is plenty of eye rolling. the graphics though are nice, although the controls are annoying. Switching between superpowers and remembering which ones are used on which clusters is just annoying.I did not enjoy this game at all, although others MIGHT. If you are a fan of SR3, then you may like this. It has the same level of insanity, but just ramped up to the next level.Also, the music is great! The best feature in this game, is the licensed music that can be listened to on the radio which can be listened to in or out of the car, which is good, cause once you get super speed you might not be in a car as much.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2014"}

I would not call it a bad game. I think expectations were so high though that some people could not help but be disappointed by it. I don't think I would have been happy paying Full price on this game. But at 27.99 it was worth it. Some of the level design is unique and fun. The weapons feel good. I would say it is a bit short, but the multi-player has some fun aspects. The dialog leaves something to be desired and the character development was weak. Not much story really, but still there is fun to be had here at a decent price, just don't pay the full price and you won't be unhappy if you enjoy shooters.

I absolutely LOVED Fallout 3!  I spent about 150 hours or more playing that game. When I heard about New Vegas I wasn't all that excited about the story. Then when I got the game it felt more like a western than a Fallout game. I love the other Fallout games for their leaving the vault story lines along with a dark post nuclear war atmosphere. Not with New Vegas. The sky is blue and you see tumbleweed going by. Not really a Fallout world in my opinion.  I thought I could get over all that so I bought New Vegas. I played it for about 4-5 hours before selling it on Amazon. I was really disappointed. I hated the story and the graphics engine hasn't been improved at all. I don't need incredible graphics to make a game good, but for $59.99 give us a game that looks and feels different than an expansion to Fallout 3.Long story short:Hated the storyHated that it wasn't a dark post nuclear war environmentDated graphicsCharacter animations are very dated!

Set 150 years from now, the world has been ruined by war and ecological disaster with only a handful of survivors remaining.End Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Charles \"Altered Confusion\"","summary":"Enslaved Review","reviewText":"Enslaved puts you in the shoes of a prisoner by the name of Monkey, and shortly after the opening cinematics its painfully obvious why he's named that. You'll be spending a very large portion of the game jumping from pole to hand hold, to ledge, and more. You'll also be doing all of this for a girl named Trip. She's sort of this technology hacker who just wants to get home. You will be battling tons of different robots, which they call Mechs in the game. Will you be able to survive all that stands in your path to get Trip safely home?Graphically this game is stunning. It is very well done, I really enjoy the post-apocalyptic look of New York, and now much nature has reclaimed what is left of the world. The character models are also very well done, well for the main characters, there's a couple of interactions with people outside of Monkey, Trip, and a very rotund individual named Pigsy, and they could have used the same level of polish the rest of the game got.The music and sounds were just perfect in the game. There wasn't too much repetition where you just want to shut up an individual, but there was a lot of character behind the voices and you could tell what type of role they were going for.The controls were for the most part well mapped out. There was a couple of issues with trying to control the camera in certain parts of the game, but as an ex-programmer I know why some of the control was taken out (so some of the flaws couldn't be so easily seen in certain sections). Trying to pull off the counter attack was a chore, but I think that was more about my timing and not that of the game trying to interpret when I was hitting the B button.Now some might be curious as to why the game is called Enslaved. Well the story goes that there was this huge war between the humans and the Mechs and there rose this organization called Pyramid that would pluck people up and control/enslave them to do what they wanted. They were all controlled by a crown, and to make sure that Trip gets home safely she decides to control a crown that she places on Monkey. If she were to ever die Monkey would suffer the same fate. As I previously mentioned you're going to be spending a lot of time doing what monkeys do best and that's climbing and swinging from spot to spot. The mechanics, for the most part, were beyond solid in this department. In my opinion if this portion of the game wasn't close to perfection the game would be a complete waste of space. There are a couple of times where you'll find yourself jumping to one position and then accidentally jumping back to the previous because of the sometimes not as precise as you'd like directions mess things up. You will be picking up red orbs, called tech orbs, which can be turned into upgrades for your character to enhance his ability to survive as well as kill more efficiently. You'll also find that you're stick can be used, when you have the ammo, to act almost like a bazooka of sorts.Overall this game is a solid piece of work, and one that I have to say was really hard to put down. I really hated the fact that the game had to end, but I can only hope for a sequel now. Of course with the quick drop in price for this game, the outlook isn't all that good, but at least this game is worth the adventure. This game gets a 8.9 out of 10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

The story is phenomenal, the gameplay is fun, and the art style in the game is really unique. There hasn't been a game Fallout 3 and the .hack saga that has gotten me this emotionally attached to the story, and how I was rooting for the people to succeed.  This game switches around game play styles; which gives it a nice fresh Varity to the pacing of the game.One of the best experiences in a videogame I've had. It kept me captivated along the way and wondering what was going to happen next. It's basically about a father's journey to cure his daughter's illness so she could have a normal life, and spirals from there. The world this game is based in is pretty bleak and most of humanity has been wiped out by shades and the Black Scrawl.The gameplay is one of the most varied I have played in a single title before. You have your typical 3rd person camera that takes place in most of the game; like when you visit towns or most of the battles in the game. Along with those you have an over the top, fixed camera, text adventure, or many others that makes this game great.You can also choose to fish or cultivate plants, which are tied to trophies/achievements as well. Fishing is fun, and it's hard at first but once you get practice and do the fishing minigames, it becomes quite addicting. I love the fact they added in gardening too as well, the plants have stages and they grow based on the real life time that has passed.I personally think the graphics in this game are quite unique and have an artist look to them. They are not the next generation graphics, but they work well with this game I found them pleasing to look at. The areas you visit are visual appeasing, and the cool look of the enemies and bosses make up why these graphics work.The music in this game is amazing. I absolutely love the songs they have playing at moments, and really add to the emotional ties of the story. The battle music is nice too, and I haven't quite heard music like this in a game since .hack. Sound effects in this game are nice, you hear fish moving around when you fish them out, and you hear the sword hitting the shades.Just as a side note this is a game created by Cavia, and just ported here by Square Enix (Like what Atlus did with Demons souls, and many other games). While I'm glad that Square ported this game so we are able to play it in English, it's still Cavia's baby. Also on top of this, Cavia was basically being shut down in the making of this game, so this is their final game and a great send off. I just wanted to write a bit about this since it saddens me when people say its Squares game, and not Cavia's epic sendoff.Overall I have to say this is my favorite game of all time, it has been so rewarding to me as a gamer that I was sad that it was over and was yearning for more. The way the final ending is set up introduces me to something I have never experienced in a game before, which says a lot about Cavia's story telling. Right now this is my pick of GOTY 2010. Absolutely buy this title, no matter the price for it.Length: This game took me around 50 hours to beat this game and all endings, but I also did a lot of side missions, fished, and cultivated. You can average around 20 hours if you do nothing else but play the game and watch the cut scenes.Trophies/Achievements: To get all of these you have to spend a lot of time farming for items, cultivating, fishing, along with beating the game a few times. I have yet to get the platinum and I'm at 60 hours right now, and only have less than half the weapons upgraded. It will take some time to get this one, but it could be a nice bragging completion to get.Positives:*Awesome story that's emotional*Fun game play*The graphics are unique*Great multiple endings that add to the characters*Awesome soundtrack*Gardening and fishing FTW*Cool WeaponsNegatives:*Getting all the acheivements/trophies gets tedius","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2012"}

Use a wide range of medieval weapons, and face your enemies in sword fight duels","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Still a blast after all these years","reviewText":"The Good: Amazing story, beautifully created visually and technically, lots of different missions to complete, parkour and crowd system are unique and revolutionary, DirectX 10 looks greatThe Bad: Some control and clipping issues, extremely repetitive missions, not very diverse visually, crowd simulation gets predictable and repetitiveNothing is true. Everything is permitted. This is a saying heard throughout Assassin's Creed and it really sticks with you. So does the thick plot that has come to take the game industry by storm as well as one of the greatest game characters of all time: Altair. The plot is actually weird at first because it's a sci-fi story. You are actually Desmond Miles capture by modern world Templars. They stick you in an Animus and use your DNA to access your ancestors memories to find the Piece of Eden which can be used to control people's minds. That one ancestor is Altair set during the crusades. The second story is of Altair who ends up losing his rank and status among the Assassin Brotherhood by failing a mission due to eagerness and stupidity. Your master, Al Mualim, sends on special missions to assassinate key leaders throughout the holy land (Acre, Jerusalem, and Damascus) to keep them from taking the Piece of Eden and using it to win the war.As you can see the plot is very interesting with a lot of twists. How is the game though? You have a huge open world that are full of side missions and hundreds of buildings to climb. Assassin's Creed has a parkour climbing system as well as a puppeteering system. You control each of Altair's limbs in two different states. The \"socially acceptable\" state allows you to use eagle vision which can show enemies and key targets. You can gently push people away from you and this is key because is you're running around the city knocking people over the guards will come after you, and towards the end of the game everyone is highly suspicious of you and just a few people knocked over will have the entire guard on your tail. The third thing is obviously combat, but if you hold down the run button you start climbing buildings, grabbing people to toss them, and jumping around.Assassin's Creed really tried to introduce crowd psychology into the game and it works here, but does feel limited. If you climb buildings people will react by stopping and staring and saying things accordingly. If you use ladders people don't mind so much. While using rooftops is faster and keeps you away from most guards you must watch out for guards on rooftops who will shoot you with arrows if you don't get down, kill them, or move away quickly. The climbing works well enough, but there are some controls issues, clipping issues, and other issues with the camera. When Altair is facing a different way then the camera he will jump towards his way instead of the way you're telling him too. Also, if you run around a pole or near a crate he'll start climbing it instead of just jumping over or going around. This can get down right frustrating when you are running away from a dozen guards and trying to find a hiding spot.The game also introduces anonymity via a symbol near your health bar which stays white when no ones suspects you, but will turn yellow when you are watched and flash red when guards are on to you. When it does this get away quickly or kill whomever is watching you. Don't just kill out in the open or people will run around screaming and call guards. Get away from dead bodies quickly because guards will come by and try to find who killed them or citizens will give you away. If you are caught you need to kill all guards after you or hide. To do this you must break their line of sight and the symbol will flash yellow. When it does find a hiding spot quickly before it turns red again. You can hide on benches between people, stacks of hay, in groups of monks praying, or draped boxes on rooftops. Stay there for a few seconds and you will by anonymous again. You can avoid all this chaos by just jogging, staying calm, don't flail around and jump around like a monkey in crowded areas etc.This whole crowd system is really something else and works well, but feels repetitive and predictable because of the recycled sayings, animations, and it always happens the same way. The combat is the same way because while you can gain new abilities it feels like a counter fest. You can attack with a sword or short sword, throw daggers, but most guards always block and you just stand there with the block button held down and wait for someone to attack and then counter which is usually an instant kill. This gets repetitive and the combat isn't as deep as it could be since combos are limited, and animations are repeated often. It does control well and feels smooth so I guess that's better than broken.The most repetitive thing, and the game's biggest flaw, are the constantly repeated missions that repeat dozens and dozens of times. You can save citizens, do some time trial flag gathering missions, escort missions, assassination missions (probably the most fun), interrogation, eavesdropping, pickpocketing, and climbing tall buildings to find view points to put more missions on your map in that area. Sure they are fun at first, but after you have saved the 30th citizen, or climbed the 50th building it gets old and you just want it to end. Some more mission diversity would have been nice.While its cool to be an assassin, sneaking up behind a guard and shoving a punch dagger in his gut, and then running away while he falls to the ground without anyone suspecting otherwise is satisfying you must look good doing it too. Assassin's Creed looks amazing, even today, and the PC version sports DirectX 10 graphics with some slightly higher resolution textures. The game looks a lot better than console versions and is well worth another play through just for that alone. While the graphics are amazing technically, artistically the game feels very Middle Eastern with a great soundtrack to support that, voice acting, and the whole game feels true to its time. The architecture is great, the clothing, lifestyles, and jobs people do in the game, but it all does kind of look the same with a lot of greys, browns, and whites.Overall Assassin's Creed is an amazing experience with a story you will talk about long after you finish the game, great crowd simulation, and the true feeling of being an assassin. If there was some more mission diversity, visual diversity, and smoother controls the game would be perfect. This is a game you can not miss and every gaming fan should play this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2012"}

However, as the Need for Speed franchise progressed and games like Pro Street and Shift came out I became disinterested in the franchise and racing games in general. Fast forward to 2010 when Need for Speed was back on my radar with Hot Pursuit. I took a flyer on Hot Pursuit because I had been itching for a new racing game for a while and loved it.  I had high hopes for Most Wanted, did it live up to my expectations? You be the judge.The first thing I noticed when I put Most Wanted into my Xbox was just how sharp the game looked. Not just how the cars look either. Everything in this game is gorgeous. Certainly, the cars look wonderful, but things such as street lighting, lights on top of squad cars, lighting inside tunnels. I could go on and on about the lighting and the visuals. So, let me just say the visuals are fantastic and we'll leave it at that.The one thing that can make or break a racing game is how the cars handle. Is there enough differentiation between the cars, do the \"feel\" solid, light, heavy, traction, etc. That is one area where I thought Hot Pursuit really elevated the crowded racing field. I am happy to say that they absolutely nailed it with Most Wanted. There is a definite difference between running around in a Mitsubishi Evolution, a SRT Dodge Viper, to a McLaren.  Each and every card feels unique and requires a different way of driving and planning out a course. For instance selecting the race called Getaway if you pick the McLaren you can take the turns fairly aggressively and still come out with acceleration, however, the weight of the Bugatti means you have to plan the turns more in advance to get the most out of the car.Each car in the game (excluding the 10 Most Wanted cars) can be had right at the start of the game. No more progressing until you unlock the car you want. Throughout the city of Fairhaven there are scattered Jackspots. Find a Jackspot, you can take the car and add it to your collection. Each car has a series of 5 races available for it. Take 3rd place in a race for extra Speedpoints (more on those later), take 2nd place to unlock a mod for the car, take 1st place to unlock another mod. The races for each car vary in difficulty from easy to hard. Most cars have 1 easy race which usually grants you Nitrous, and tire upgrades. There are usually two medium difficulty races, followed by 2 hard races. Hard races are better saved for last for each car as the mods you earn in the others will certainly prove beneficial. Each of the mods have a \"Pro\" version as well. Use the mod enough, and complete certain tasks to upgrade it just a little more.I am absolutely in love with the handling of the cars. As I said above each car legitimately feels different than the others. Sure, you can race each car the same way, but doing that will result in a lot of crashes, slower times, and less success on the track. Taking a little time to understand the cars and how different mods interact with each other can prove essential in making a good time a great time. Take the car above, the Porsche 911. Do you want long gears (higher top speed) or short gears (faster acceleration? Do you want track tires (better on pavement) or off-road tires (better in dirt areas)? Answer, it depends on the race. Some races are all about top speed, while others require some precision handling and take you off road. The race Needle Point is one on both pavement and dirt, but requires you to get a rather high top speed making it essential to understand the car and the mods. Some races can cause some frustration, but that can be battled with understanding the track layout and the car and mods. No race is impossible, but some will definitely make you work harder than others.The true beauty of Most Wanted though is everything that you do is really a challenge to everyone on your friendslist. Sure, there is the normal racing game feature of the best event time, but Most Wanted takes it a step (or two) further. Everything that you do you earn Speed Points. Your objective is to literally be the Most Wanted on your friends list. Even a step above that there are various other challenges thrown in for good measure. Scattered throughout Fairhaven are speed cameras, when you fly past one your speed is recorded. Anytime your friends boot up their game and drive past that camera they will see your time. It creates an inevitable battle of who can go the fastest past each camera.This leads me to my favorite challenge, Billboards.  The Billboards in the game are not based on speed, but instead based on distance. The object is to jump through the billboards and stick the landing (crashes result in the distance not being counted). An added bonus for the person with the farthest jump on each individual billboard is their avatar picture will be on everyone's billboard until it is bested. I cannot lie. There is a certain amount of glee when I hit a huge jump and know the next time my friends turn on their game and drive past that billboard they will see my smiling mug looking down at them.So, I've only talked about the single player aspect thus far. That's mostly intentional. There is a multiplayer mode in Most Wanted, but to be frank I don't much care for it. When I play a MP racing game I want to play tracks, and races. Hot Pursuit set the bar very high in that aspect being cops or racers made it so enjoyable. In Most Wanted the MP is a mixed bag, sure there are some actual races and they are a blast, but there are also farthest jumps, drifting contests in one certain area, etc. In theory it's a good attempt to try \"something different\" but in reality it comes across (to me anyway) as a hodgepodge of stuff to take up time. At the time of writing this review I have spent approximately 40 hours (yes 40, not a typo) in Most Wanted and maybe 2 hours of that was in MP. It just doesn't do for me what I look for in a MP racing game.With all that said, I really really love this game. Sure, I wish the multiplayer was more to my liking, but I also understand some people really enjoy what it is. If this was just a single player game with the Autolog monitoring my friends list I would be completely happy. Maybe through DLC, or something they can add a strict race mode to the MP and make me even happier, but I by no means am demanding it or hanging my head that it's not there. I am grateful for Hot Pursuit rekindling my love for racing games. Most Wanted just adds to my love of this genre in every way. I simply cannot say enough how much I enjoy this game. If you decide to cruise around Fairhaven be warned, I have no qualms about putting you into a guard rail and I will do everything in my power to ensure that my picture is plastered all over your game's billboards.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0000696CZ","reviewerName":"drqshadow","summary":"A Worthy Heir","reviewText":"Rockstar had a monster of a sequel on their hands here, as well as a monster of a legacy to live up to. In the wake of Grand Theft Auto III, thought of by many to be one of the most revolutionary games in console history, expectations for said sequel were undoubtedly be off the charts. Players had enjoyed a taste of the virtual crime syndicate of Liberty City, and now they wanted the whole meal. To say developers had their work cut out for them would probably pass as one of the great understatements of the young century. But, god help them, they actually stepped up to the plate and swung for the fences.Vice City is, in many ways, an \"expansion pack\" for GTA3. It's the basically same game, they've merely wrapped different skins around everyone and given players a whole new stack of missions to complete. Not to downplay the team's effort, this remains a very... VERY good game. Just don't jump in expecting an entirely new, completely immersive experience. This is everything it promised to be, episode three with new faces set entirely in the mid 80s. It's not Grand Theft Auto IV, more of a GTA3.5.Thankfully, the game controls exactly the same as its daddy. You've got basic controls; walking, running, aiming, shooting, jumping, punching and stealing. Tommy moves a little differently than our anti-hero from the third installment, he's a touch slower, heavier. He throws punches at a slower pace than the previous character, but when he connects they've got more muscle behind them. A minor annoyance is the inadvertent damage he takes when running off a ledge or set of steps, rather than leaping. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little frustrated to watch my hero fall to his doom off a ledge no higher than six feet, but if nothing else that teaches you to be a little more careful.Each vehicle you drive handles differently, whether you're behind the wheel of a race car, a compact, an SUV, a boat, a helicopter or a Vespa. Certainly there's more of an arcade feel to controlling the makes and models of Vice City than there is a simulation aspect, but I wouldn't have it any other way. If I want complete and utter realism, I'll play Gran Turismo III. If I'm looking to run some folks over, fly into a bridge or scoot my way through traffic... complete and utter realism is not an extremely important factor in my book. In all honesty, were this game any more realistic it would take away from the fun factor by tenfold.Graphically, this game is beautiful. Once you hop into the options menu and turn off the incredibly distracting and worthless \"tracers\" feature (and can suddenly SEE), you begin to recognize and enjoy the attention to detail that went into this game. Absolutely EVERYTHING is accounted for, from the names on every single building on the main strip right down to the wrinkles in the crotch of Tommy Vercetti's jeans. Not that I was looking at his crotch or anything...The voice acting and musical choices have somehow improved from last year's nearly-flawless model, to the point where you find yourself completely immersed in the game's culture. I completed my run through all the missions at roughly twenty five hours, and was only just then beginning to see a few overlaps in the conversational dialogue of non-central characters. My absolute favorite character in the game was an underling named Mario, who keeps hanging around outside establishments under your control. Alongside his fellow also-rans, Mario loudly and proudly barks orders with some sort of false sense of authority. \"WHAT HARDWARE WE GOT!?\" he'll shout, without provocation. \"WHAT SHOULD I DO ABOUT HER!?\" I laughed until I cried, and then I immediately absorbed a few of Mario's characteristic phrases into my everyday language. When I start quoting lines from a movie, you know I enjoyed the movie. To even imagine quoting something from a game, let alone a minor character in that game, is a totally foreign concept.The missions range from easy to extremely difficult to \"how the holy hell do they expect me to do this??\", but are all manageable, with practice. Right up to the game's final battle, everybody's got the same weakness. No matter how important they are in the hierarchy of crime, they'll still bleed when shot. And they'll die when you steal their car and park it on top of their heads. Or when you catch them in the rotor blades of a helicopter, as the situation may call for. Unfortunately, the final sub-boss and the boss himself each took half a dozen direct shots from the rocket launcher before succumbing to their wounds, which sort of blows that whole idea to hell, but the vast majority of the game obeys the same damage system. Again, a minor flaw but a flaw nonetheless.After the missions of GTA III, I didn't think there was any way things could get more inventive, more creative, more unexpected... but somehow they managed. Rockstar controls your emotions from the first moments of the game, right up to the end. The missions flow almost seamlessly into the storyline. You can take an extended break, running around the city, slaughtering families and retrieving hidden packages, and then jump right back into the storyline without disrupting the flow of the story. It's truly something you can take at your own pace.Overall, everything I expected from a sequel of this magnitude. If it's as they say, a great movie leaves you thirsty for more; then the same rule must apply to a great video game. Despite some flaws, Vice City continues the trend begun by GTA3. It's a worthy heir to the legacy, nothing nearly as groundbreaking as the jump from GTA2 to 3, but then again this isn't part 4. Can't wait to see where they can take it from here.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2002"}
{"product_name":"B0000696CZ","reviewerName":"Jaba the Hutt","summary":"Vice City is fun in the Sun","reviewText":"I was luck enough to reserve Vice City and pick it up the day it came out.  This game is one of the coolest games ever.  Just like  GTA3 you have complete freedom of movement.  There are over 120 cars to hijack and steal and there are also motorcycles.  I think the motorcycle is one of the best new features because it allows you to go at extremely high speed and you can easily weave in and out of traffic. Another cool feature is you can hijack helicopters.  Helicopters may not be the fastest thing to take but who cares.  Its pretty damn cool to fly 300ft off the ground dogging buildings and police helicopters.  There are many new weapons added to your arsenal like a machete, chain saw, MP5, Magnum and a chain gun.  Another great thing is you can walk into many buildings. Although some may not have much to offer, other buildings will have weapons money and many other things.  Although there are many things to do and see, the law is still on your back.  Police have gotten much tougher.  They can move in formation call for backup, or use a number of unarmed moves to throw you're butt to the pavement.  The only flaw is that the graphics still aren't top notch.  There better then GTA3 but they still could youse some help.  The main problem is there is still some clipping and you can loose your sense of reality( if there is any) if you see a body going through a wall.  Over all the graphics don't make a big difference, and you shouldn't let it stop you from buying this game.  This game is a must have, it will keep you entertained for months.  Make your life cool and thrilling buy this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2003"}

Not Quite as Good","reviewText":"In an earlier review I declared the Advanced Wars the best games ever for the GBA and Dual Strike met or exceeded everything the previous two achieved. So Days of Ruin had a lot to live up to and.... didn't.Let me start with what I didn't like. After three iterations of Advanced Wars I grew rather fond of the cast of Commanding Officers but DoR ashcans them all replacing them with a whole new cast of characters. It reminds me of when Capcom decided to swap out almost all the Street Fighter characters in SFIII. It just doesn't feel right. There is also a much smaller selection of CO's compared to Dual Strike and you don't even get to choose your CO during the main campaign. There are no more dual commanders, commander advancements and even the shop is gone. Another thing I have to take an issue with is the music. It's a blaring beat on a short loop that grows maddening after a while like Chinese water torture. At some point I had to completely turn the sound off on my DS or go crazy. Finally, this is the most verbose Advanced Wars ever and it can get tedious. I just want to fight not read a novel.On the plus side there are some great new units including motorcycles to get troops to cities faster and flares to temporarily get rid of fog of war for a section of the map. My worry is that the more units they add the more complicated the game gets and the whole allure of Advanced Wars is in its simplicity. The Duster, for example, is a new aircraft that can attack both air and ground units. Isn't that what the helicopter is for? There are also additional training missions during the main campaign that can be a lot of fun. Actually the training missions are sort of a replacement for the purchasable missions. In this case you have to earn them rather than buy them. The CO powers have been toned down and made more difficult to use. Whether this is an improvement or not is debatable but I think the CO powers had become more annoying than useful. The single best improvement is the addition of unit advancements. As a unit destroys enemy units it can advance up to veteran level with slight increases in power.Days of Ruin takes a departure from the previous three games with few improvements. The world differs, the commanders are new, and even the style of art has changed dramatically. What remains the same is the gameplay which continues to be excellent. My feeling is that games in a series should always improve and unfortunately, in almost every way, Dual Strike was superior to Days of Ruin. Because of this I cannot in good conscience give DoR anything higher than four stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2008"}

Mason","summary":"Many mixed feelings, but overall more than an average game.","reviewText":"It has a large city map, which you can get to by foot, car, or train. Looks very similar to GTA. NOT the same.There are towers you can hack a backdoor into which reveals more options in each area. (You have to find out how to get there, using cameras and such to unlock doors, etc) Fun at first, but you get progression items in-game for doing things like this.Weapon wheel-ok so far. You can get some good weapons early on; if using skill points you can upgrade your weapon skills.Hacking-By far the best and most FUN part of the game. Spending skill points here can make one quite devious. Catching the right ones early on, can make escaping the police easy.Hacking by others-This is the craziest I've experienced so far. It's been attempted on me three times as of this, but unsuccessful. One aborted, one ran away, the other I ran into the car until it exploded. You get a warning when you are being hacked along with a diameter area of where the hacker is. There is a data meter as well. You have until this reaches 100% to find and eliminate him/her. You can hack others. (I have not attempted this yet.) Those being hacked will be hunting you and YOU must be hiding and be on the run.The Phone: The most powerful item. The apps can do almost anything. Order cars delivered, many which are free, can be gained from civilians, or bought. Other games played in-game (Inception......) Can be used to hack people's bank accounts; a steady cash flow, car races, Hack contracts, etc.CON: The only one I can think of would be the only central story line. I'm not sure if you can continue to play after the game is finished. Since there are things you can do in-game, what if you don't do them all before that? There are 5 Chapters and I just started Chapter 2.6-4-2014Finished the game. I think the story-line is great: it's a bit long, but considering the price of brand new games, I'm not the only one who wants their money's worth. Since there is only a central story line, after finishing it, then (to me at least) there isn't much to playing it again. Unless you don't play for a year or more. Now IF.....others were to play it then yes, it would be worth having around. Here's a big stink going around: TOO many people are comparing it to GTA, Saint's Row, etc. This game is NOT a clone. Sure, the driving part does. The running, climbing, and vaulting is like almost every other game. How is the character supposed to get around? Wheelchair? Some people......There is a progression wheel and I still have some things to do. After completing the game and almost half an hour of credits, you are back in Chicago to do whatever you like.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2014"}

Everyone needs to experience this game online for the PS3, ITS TOTALLY WORTH IT.side note: some say theres alot of issues with their disc and graphical glitches, etc.....i have had ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEMS AT ALL with my digital download of this game so if your into digital and have a Slim, you should be alright with a download.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2014"}

{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"The_Scrutiny","summary":"Bravo Naughty Dog. Bravo","reviewText":"This. Game. Is. Phenomenal. Uncharted 2 is what turned the series from your average cover shooter to the epic adventure series that everyone has come to know. This is one of the greatest achievements in gaming this generation. Here's my review:Story: 5/5If you thought that the story of Uncharted 1 was good, you'll get an even bigger kick out of this one's. You reprise the role of Nathan Drake as he starts out looking for Marco Polo's lost fleet. At first, he undertakes the journey to find a stone thought to be worth millions. Later, this tale spins into one man's efforts to stop a villain from becoming the world's next Genghis Khan or Hitler. Every element that makes a great story is here: a little romance, tons of humor, memorable characters, astounding voice acting, and action. Lots of action. Your mind will be blown because the story is just that good.Setting: 5/5Uncharted 2 takes you everywhere. You'll visit the tropical region of Borneo, infiltrate a museum, tread across war-torn Nepal, explore icy caverns near Tibet, and even marvel at the wonders of Shambhala. The environments are diverse and beautifully designed. It also helps that the graphics are top-notch.Gameplay: 4.5/5====Combat====Cover shooting is smooth with cover transitioning for when those pesky grenades are lobbed your way. You're given the ability to arc-throw grenades without popping out of cover and aiming. Enemies have good variety with average soldiers, thick-armored brutes who stalk towards you wielding a shotgun, mega-brutes who shoot gatling guns, yetis, and Guardians. To aid you in your battles, the game gives you a variety of weapons. It's very satisfying when you find an RPG lying around and wreak havoc with it. A small complaint is there were just a very few spots where I thought there were too many waves of enemies. These occasions are very few though.====Stealth====Yes, stealth is an option. When enemies haven't spotted you yet, Drake will enter stealth mode. You can take out enemies from behind cover and snap their necks from behind. The game even rewards you with extra grenades for doing so. I loved taking out half of enemy forces before being discovered.====Platforming/Puzzle-solving====Climbing is mostly smooth. Drake hops from ledge to ledge with ease and you can leap over a few ledges to save time. There were, however, a few instances where platforming had to be super precise, and Drake didn't move exactly how I wanted him to. These led to cheap deaths, but these moments too, are few and far between. Puzzle solving is done on a big scale, and you'll get a sense of awe every time your actions move the ancient pieces around you. These puzzles are fun and memorable.Uniqueness: 5/5Uncharted 2 carves its own identity in infinitely many ways. But 2 very unique things are epic setpieces and treasure-hunting. There's never a dull moment in this game. One moment you're being chased by a helicopter through collapsing hotel buildings, the next you might be battling from train car to train car. This constant mix in the action is largely what lets people know they're playing an Uncharted game. This game really does it all with setpieces. Treasure hunting has been made more fun this time. There are more treasures (101), and some are cleverly hidden. It takes a keen eye and creative exploration sometimes to find these, and it's worth it because you'll earn in-game cash to buy weapons and game tweaks on your next playthrough. I recommend buying a tranquilizer gun and watching unconscious guards fly away in zero gravity.Overall: 4.9/5There you have it. I loved nearly everything about this game. My only gripes were very few instances where the game went overboard with enemy waves and where platforming resulted in cheap deaths. Luckily these moments are so few, and the game is quite generous with checkpoints. Otherwise, you're dealing with a true quality product. Everything from the storyline, to the varied settings, to large-scale puzzles, and to awesome setpieces screams EPIC!!! Pick this title up. You won't regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2013"}

They appear in the Sinnoh reigon's myths and old folklore. One is called Dialga, and is said to have the power to control time. The other is called Palkia, who is said to have the ability to distort space. The sinister organization called Team Galaxy is trying to rule the region by utilizing these two Pokemon's power.

Pokemon fans have caught glimpses of Mime Jr., Lucario, Munchlax and Weavile in Pokemon movies, and these Pokemon will be debuting in this adventure.","reviewerName":"Carl Carter","summary":"If it's not broken, why fix it?","reviewText":"Way back when the original Pokemon came out, I played it.  I got Blue, Red, Yellow, and eventually Gold and Silver.  Then I stopped.  While each and every game was fun, they were essentially the same thing with a new shiny coat of paint (read: more Pokemon).  Only at the recommendation of a friend did I get Pokemon Diamond.  And you know what?  I'm glad I did.  I realized that I had missed the little Pocket Monsters.  And this game is very good.  With something like five hundred Pokemon to collect, there are tons of options for customizing your Pokemon team.  The graphics are the best yet from a handheld Pokemon game, and it brings the franchise back to it's \"gotta catch 'em all\" roots.  Unfortunately, some things drag this game down.  There are FIVE HUNDRED Pokemon.  I used to be able to tell you the type, strengths and weaknesses of all the Pokemon.  When there were 150.  So basically it's almost impossible to know what you're fighting in every situation.  While this makes the game more unexpected, it also can cause frustration for anyone who actually does want to catch them all.  Additionally, there really isn't anything in this game that sets it apart from the other Pokemon games.  The only new things worth mentioning are the wireless options.  You can connect to the Nintendo WiFi Connection (NWC) and make wireless trades.  That particular feature is pretty cool, and I've used it with great success.  The online battling is another story though.  I've battled with a friend sitting a few feet from me, but to battle over the NWC you need to have registered people as your friend and hope that they're on when you are.  Where's the random battle against a similarly rated opponent feature?  So, in the end, get this game if you want to have some good 'ol Pokemon fun.  But don't expect much new from it.  Even so, it's an excellent game, and let's face it, Pokemon has always been a very good RPG and Diamond is no exception.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2007"}

There have been a lot of great games for it like The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and Excite Truck. Sadly, many gamers have been anxiously waiting the new Super Mario Galaxy, and hoping Mario would deliver again. Unfortunately, gamers will have to wait. However, a different Mario game has arrived from the die hard Paper Mario franchise from the gamecube and Nintendo 64 eras. There also is something that makes this paper seem better than flat, but will it satisfy Mario fans for now?Super Paper Mario for the Nintendo Wii, brings nack what made the Paper Mario games deliver in true role play. This time around, the game really does think out of the box, as Mario, Luigi, Peach and Bowser try to tackle the vicious Count Bleck and his minions Mr. L, Dimentio and others, as they tackle a fierce and wild world that seperates from the flipside and flopside. Each character has to unlock pixels, which help you through achievements from finding hidden doors, to lifting bosses. There are over 30 different levels in the game that bring back the classic 2-D side-scrolling action from the original Super Mario Brothers, with a different twist. Each character you play has a special ability. Peach and Luigi have a high jump, Bowser has the traditional fire-blazes, but Mario has the best ability. He can flip his world from a 2-D, to 3-D, to find hidden items and unlock hidden areas. The graphics in the game are absolutely beautiful, and really bring the classic gameplay into a whole new perspective, while the control is really on target most of the time. You do get a bit frustrated finding the unlocked doors, but everything else works like a charm. The story line also is fun and entertaining in each world of the game, while the story is cute but enjoyable for all the worlds.All in all, Super Paper Mario is a well-rendered game for the Wii, and should entice new Mario fans, as well as those waiting Super Mario Galaxy. I really like this game because it is fun and exciting, for all ages and Nintendo junkies.

I may nit-pick a little below, but know that I love this game. I am about 20+ hours into it and am still loving it.Think Fallout 3 but slightly less story-oriented and a whole lot more shooter oriented - this game is a FPS + action-RPG, where the shooting in Fallout 3 was noticeably less FPS. Or think Diablo 2 set in post apocalypse wastelands and as a FPS. The driving controls (heck most of the controls) are like Halo - and since I am not an avid Halo fan they took a while to get used to (I like Halo games but I play the single player game of each of them once and that's it).Very solid controls. Easy to use inventory system. I'm not a huge fan of games where enemies re-spawn, but I don't think you could do the leveling up of your character as well without the re-span.I have a 5.1 surround sound system and >to me&lt; the sounds don't also sound like they are pinpointed quite correctly in the speakers -- other games get the sounds placement perfectly so I know exactly where an enemy is, but it seems Borderlands doesn't get it quite as right. Again, maybe I'm crazy.I KNOW this game would be more fun with 2 or more players but none of my 360 friends have it.

I feel motivated, easily breaking lots of sweat, and most importantly: having lots of fun. Many of the exercises are very unique, with some isolation exercises, as well as combination and things you'd never think would end up in an exercise routine.  There are a wide variety of exercise tempos and levels - beginner, advanced, and even for fitness-junkies. There are routines that also cater towards kids, adults, and elders.I really loved...* How fun it was. Punching bricks, balancing a board and stacking blocks, a DDR (dance dance revolution)-like game, are among some of the games that is fun, but also gets the heart pumping and sweat glands working. A combination of any games for 20 minutes will certainly make you break some sweat.* The dialogue from the fitness trainers and encouraging audio. Sometimes it's hard not to give up after 25+ minutes of workout, but the encouraging words and sounds are very helpful in continuing the routine. It may not be a real person, but it certainly feels like it.* The organization of routines. Here are examples: warmup, arms, legs, back, glutes, chest, cardio, hip hop dance, belly dancing, and african dancing to name a few. Within each routine there are creative and fun exercises, but could get a little repetitive.* The use of the Kinect. It's incorporated into the game very well and only occasionally does it registers my body movement incorrectly.Some drawbacks:* Better multiplayer. Although you can compete, it's one person at a time trying to beat a certain score. I would've liked to be able to compete with a friend at the same time.* While it's nice to have a measure of how much we're burning, the calorie counter may not be so accurate.

But once you get beyond that, the graphics definitely put me in mind of what little I can remember seeing of Galaga from back in the day. Lots of flat, geometric shapes with more organic, flowery/sea slug like organic shapes, but overall, I just haven't seen the mindblowing graphics that I was led to expect by the trailers and screenshots from Child of Eden.A friend of mine that has also played it told me that he found the gameplay experience strange, and different from what he's experienced before. That's perfectly understandable, being that you play it simply with hand gestures, but aside from said gestures tying in somewhat obviously with the musical score of the game, there doesn't seem to be much else to really determine why you're supposed to do certain gestures when or where, aside from just shooting a bunch of \"viruses\" attacking the Internet (\"Eden\").For novelty's sake, Child of Eden is worth checking out, but using a scale that friends of mine employ for films, this one, to me, is more of a \"rent it, don't buy it\" kinda game. Glad I got it for less than full price, but even the thirty-five bucks I paid for it here on Amazon feels like too much for it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001PKHRVE","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Finally a mature rated super hero game!!","reviewText":"The Good: Amazing visuals, Hugh Jackman is best Wolverine yet, amazing combat, diverse in movesThe Bad: A tad redundant, unbalanced difficulty, makes you want moreI'm not an X-Men fan nor a comic book fan so you can expect a fair unbiased review first off. One great thing to think about when thinking about this game is that you don't need to be an X-Men or comic fan to like this game, all you have to do is like action/adventure games (God of War, Prince of Persia, Bionic Commando etc.) The game starts out pretty heavy and shows some great graphics, cinematic game play, and great voice acting (by none other than Hugh Jackman himself) all while skydiving into the forests of Africa. When you land you'll be shown a quick tutorial on how to use heavy and light attacks along with combos. You'll learn how to do quick kills which is a timed heavy attack complete with a zoom in slow mo gruesome and gory kill. Yes I said gory, and yes this is the first Mature rated comic book game ever made and I'm am so glad Marvel got off their high horse *cough DC* and start showing their characters true feral side.Most of Wolverine is based around combat since the story is simply only for hardcore fans, people who saw the movie (I hear it's excellent and Mr. Jackman is the best Wolverine yet), or the fact that the story is just too cut up and flashed back to really get a grip on. A lot of the combat may feel repetitive some times, but it's all cut up thanks to great platforming sections, some action button timing, and some really big guys you must take on, and sprinkle on some epic boss fights. Each enemy must be killed differently since some are not weak to quick kills and must be weakened, some can't be thrown off ledges, some enemies can only be killed in feral sense mode since their camouflaged. Each enemy has different quick kill animations and thus making the game feel less repetitive. You can unlock different moves by leveling up along with permanently increasing your health and rage meter. Rage always you to perform four of the rage moves which range from a blender style claw spin, to a saw blade style spin. Each one can be upgraded for longer time, more power, more speed etc. You also have three slots for mutagens which somehow passively enhance the game play by added some more health, making rage moves more powerful, or you gain more experience per kill. All these are easily in sync with each other along with a great tree that allows you to learn things about your enemies for every kill so they die faster later on in the game. This immense skill tree really works brilliantly and keeps the game from feeling to cookie cutter.The game does have puzzles when it comes to environments and some puzzles are even part of the environment. These puzzles are never hard to figure out thanks to your feral senses, but timing of certain puzzles can be frustrating. Speaking of frustrating the only real gripe I have with the game is that the difficulty isn't balanced very well so several levels will be easy then suddenly an ultra hard one then an easy then maybe a few hard ones. Same goes for certain sections in levels and this can lead some people to throw their controller at the wall...or a person. A lot of puzzles consist of pushing blocks to get up on certain ledges, pulling panels out of walls to unlock certain doors, and some level length puzzles such as using the hand of a giant robot to destroy the head firing lasers to get through the only door out of the base.Let's talk boss fights. Some range from other X-Men universe characters (Saber Tooth for one) that are easily killed, along with some that are hundreds of stories high (like the epic robot boss fight that you fight from space while falling down to earth...yes uber epic). Boss fights aren't annoying you just have to learn their moves.The visuals in the game are astounding using the Unreal 3 engine you can expect some of the finest looking graphics yet. Everything looks sharp, clean, and highly detailed for your ultimate Wolverine experience. There are some nice unlockables for fans of the game and I guarantee this game will turn haters into lovers.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Nintendo decided to re-retro this game to give a younger target market a history lesson on how it was started (back to the old school), because they know little to nothing about the NES, meaning that they don't know how they were getting ripped off.  Gamers aged 21 to about 40 who actually owned the NES in the past refused to get suckered in.  Many of us still have our NES (if we don't anymore, then we can get the complete system off eBay or amazon for as low as $25).  Nintendo was'nt thinking when they released this for GBA with the same graphics and gameplay as NES version.  If you still have your NES, do not waste $23 on this game when you can get the original NES version for 1/3 of that on eBay and here.

You get a customized lit charging-transmitter platform that plugs into a USB port and the \"palm\" type customizable colorful (and adorable) mouse in the package.Under Windows 7, drivers were immediately available and the mouse was available.  The downloaded Steel Series software provide customization options including movement speed, precision, and even movement curves in addition to control over the more artsy aspects of color and lighting for the charging platform and mouse.  There are multiple options that will make this mouse your own!The Sensei can be hard wired if you prefer but it really is unnecessary even for gaming since the wireless functionality feels hard wired.  The reason for this is that Steel Series chose to make the USB battery charging stand the transmitter rather than rely on blue tooth.  Repeat:  No blue tooth!  There is no lag time at all with this set up.Playing Borderlands 2 and Bioshock Infinite showed that this mouse is ready for action.  While this user prefers a slower mouse, at about 1500 BCPI, the Sensei can range up to a blazing 16,500 BCPI.  Movement is quick, consistent, and with no hesitation.  Being wireless you never fight with the cord.While this is a great mouse, it would be nice if it would stay on continuously with no time out.  The maximum time out is 20 minutes, and when you come back to your computer, you have to turn the mouse over to reset the connection (turning the mouse off and then back on).  This is a minor inconvenience but still if someone chooses to leave it (charging) on the stand, why would there be a need for a time out?In short, while expensive, this mouse is a functional work of art that will make your normal day to day computer tasks and gaming easy while complementing your desktop with eye candy.Edit 06-06-14:  Discovered that when the mouse goes into stand-by you do not have to turn it off and on to wake it up.

{"product_name":"B00005TNI6","description":"Final Fantasy Xis the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"Terry Surugy","summary":"This is Final Fantasy?","reviewText":"Well I am a huge fan of Final Fantasies but this one was just an embarassment. The point is just like any other FF but i'll let ya know whats wrong with it. First of the main character...Tidus....I think the name speaks for itself. The kid is a moron. Apparently he is a professional \"blitz ball\" player whatever the hell that is. One of the poorest excuses of a sport I have ever seen. More or less underwater soccer with cheap rules and unrealistic physics. But in short the entire time I was playing the game I was embarassed just playing as Tidus. Probably the worst FF character their is in the saga of Final Fantasies.The magic and sphere grid was stupid as hell. You couldn't get your magic without waiting for a couple of years and it took forever to get around it. Remember in the other FFs when you got your magic and spells by gaining expierence or by collecting items. Well in this game Tidus and the gang thought up something new. Now you have to go through this annoying ass sphere grid which takes an hour to learn and another 100 hours to complete(Probably more).Now the concept is just like I said similar to the other FFs with a story of love involved with the saving of all human kind. Well in this story Tidus is supposed to save the world with his \"girlfriend\" Yuna. The other characters are complete tag-ons and them making an impact on the story did not come into play at all.Another thing wrong with this game was the boss. Now over the years in a bunch of different games I have seen werid bosses and cool bosses. Nevertheless it was nothing like I saw here. The boss \"Sin\" is a big blob. Not only that but hes brown (kinda makes you think). So with a queerish fellow like Tidus fighitng a Brown Blob Sin the game reached an all time low. So think about it do you want to reduce yourself to a level of absolute disgrace..If not don't play this game otherwise go for it and be embarassed out of your mind and be bored as hell. You will be disapointed. Their is an absolute gurantee that you will be disapointed after your done playing this game!!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2004"}

Some fans of the series might be put off by the lackluster AI or the fact that you can only play Co-op in the Zombie Mini-game, but this is still a good buy if you like the series and you want to take advantage of the Online VS. Modes.Concept:  10/10Black Ops is the latest installment of the Call of Duty Series.  There is a 6 hour Campaign with 4 Difficulty Levels, a Single Player / Co-op Zombie Game similar to Left 4 Dead, and Multiplayer with Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and Blow Stuff Up Objectives.  There is an awful lot of gaming crammed onto this disk!Story:  8/10You are Mason, voiced by Avatar's Sam Worthington, and you begin the game being \"roughly interrogated\" by the CIA.  The fate of the free world is at stake and the only way to save it is to crack a code that has been imbedded into your subconscious.  Mason recounts his adventures with the Black Ops during the cold war and you play through them.  The story is vastly improved over Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 (Which isn't saying much because that game made as much sense as Transformers 2.)Graphics: 9/10The Call of Duty series is known for its stunning graphics and intense gameplay.  Black Ops delivers, yet again.  Although, I remember the Modern Warfare games looking just a bit better, Black Ops still looks great.  The backgrounds and visual effects are very well rendered.  Normally, I'd say, \"The graphics pull you into the action,\" at this point...  Keep reading.Gameplay: 7/10Most of the game has you running through missions as part of a squad, going from checkpoint to checkpoint as exciting things happen all around you.  You have an arsenal of guns and grenades at your disposal.  The weapons are well balanced and feel great.  However, the AI definitely needs more work.  In the Call of Duty series, you don't need super complex AI because characters die so quickly, they aren't onscreen very long.  However, the AI characters need to do a much better job at convincing the Player that he or she is in a war.  There were too many times in the Campaign where Viet Cong and US Marines simply stood next to each other like co-workers at the water cooler talking about last night's game.  Issues like this break the immersion of a battle and the game quickly devolves into an ultra loud shooting gallery.Level Design:  7/10There are combat missions, stealth missions, and vehicle missions where you destroy things and progress to clearly marked checkpoints.  Most of the missions in the game are intense and exciting, but there are a few that are far from great.  Infinitely spawning enemies and counter-intuitive checkpoints ruin the fun.  Once this starts happening, you feel like saying, \"Ok, Designer Guy, what do you want me to do?\"  Instead of feeling like you are fighting in actual battles.  There are 4 different Difficulty Modes for the Campaign and it should take you about 6 hours to complete it.Sound:  10/10Great Voice Acting + Loud Explosions and Gunfire = 10!The sound is so good, my neighbor complained about the noise!If that's not a ringing endorsement, I don't know what is.Zombies:  6/10Black Ops also features a fun little Zombie game where you are in a building that is under attack by waves of zombies.  You set up barricades and kill them to earn points.  You use those points to buy better weapons or open doors to expand the level.  This is a fun little mini-game that feels a bit like Left 4 Dead.  People either play it a few times and quit, or get hooked.  To progress past level 5 in the game, you have to be a great gamer or you need some good old fashioned Co-op teamwork.Multiplayer:  8/10The Multiplayer Modes are back and there are plenty of them.  Black Ops feels well balanced and the upgrade system allows you to purchase weapons and customize your gear.  The maps and gameplay feel really solid and it's always satisfying to shoot someone online.  The Call of Duty Kill Streaks are back, allowing Players to wreak havoc on the map as a reward for killing sprees.  Call in spy planes, assault choppers, mortar strikes, napalm...  The Multiplayer Modes are typically fun for the competitive gamers.Maturity:  MThere are some intense scenes of violence in this game, so it's definitely not for kids.Although, when I play online, I swear half of the people with microphones are 12.Overall: 8/10Call of Duty Black Ops is not the best in the series, but it's definitely fun.  If you want a great looking, intense, shooting gallery, with some multi-player modes, you will enjoy this game!Buy it if you want a decent Campaign with a Good Story and you want to take advantage of the Multiplayer Modes.Rent it if you only want to play through the Campaign.  You can do this in 1 or 2 days.Avoid it if you hate violence, explosions, testosterone, swearing, and killing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0053B5RGI","description":"The Next Evolution in Pokemon comes to Nintendo 3DS.","reviewerName":"Jack Fox, Badgerlord","summary":"Pokemon X/Y - It Begins again","reviewText":"So I'm gunna post my review of the game here... it's big and stuff so I apologize but I didn't wanna start a new thread again.Pokemon X/YWhere to begin... Well I guess at the start. I have been playing Pokemon games since they started. My first game was Pokemon Blue and I have never missed one in the series since. The joy of finding new Pokemon never seems to get old for me. SO when I learned about Pokemon X/Y I was of course Joyful as I usually was when hearing about a new Pokemon game.Nothing could prepare me for this game. Nothing.Gameplay 10/10For those new to Pokemon, You enter a world where we capture, raise, and battle with Animals known as Pokemon. They gain levels, have stats, learn different attacks and each has their own elemental Strengths and Weaknesses attached to them. Fire is weak to water, Water is weak to Grass, Grass is weak to fire etc... there are 18 I believe elements in total and all have their own Rock-Paper-Scissors Pros and Cons. This is back and of course just as fun as ever. Do you want to make a team of all bug Pokemon? Go for it! but know that you will be weak against Flying, Rock and Fire types, and yet strong against Psychic, Poison and Grass etc... Or you could have a team of various Pokemon, ready to fight against all types whenever the need arises. Building your own team has always been a highlight of the series, and with over 700... let me stop right there. SEVEN HUNDRED... different Pokemon to chose from you have a ridiculous number of monsters to chose from to form your 6 slot party. Now not all 700+ are in the game, I believe only around 4-5 hundred are to start, but you can trade Pokemon from previous games up and use them if your friends have it or you can even go back and try the old games etc... But this game has plenty of Pokemon to try out and have fun withFor those that are familiar with Pokemon , this game has everything you would ever want and much MUCH more. First off they have streamlined how leveling your Pokemon works. No longer do you have to Slowly one by one level each of your Pokemon against weak wild Pokemon and then grind more and more and more etc... Instead the game has made a few key changes to how EXP works which I shall list below.1. Any Pokemon that participates in the battle now gets 100% EXP, it no longer gives 50% to one and 50% to another. or 33% to all three etc...2. You get an EXP.Share about 1 hour into the game (After the first gym battle) And this time it is not even a held item! It sits in your inventory and as you fight, any Pokemon that participated in battle gets 100% Exp, any in your party that didn't get 50% exp. This is beyond amazing and is a fantastic way to level your low level Pokemon quickly without having to suffer from putting it in front, and switching out your Pokemon every single fight. If you don't like this feature, you can of course turn it off in the item menu. I suggest not doing so3. Catching a Pokemon still grants you EXP as if you had killed it.As a result of these new EXP changes you spend almost no time simply leveling up Pokemon and instead you will be spending your time trying to catch the Pokemon then you will simply grinding. In fact There are a few Pokemon in each area that aren't quite as common as others. For example in Route 1 there is a Zigzagoon that is harder to find than the more common Pidgey's Fletchings, and Caterpie that wander around. There always seems to be one in each area, and in an attempt to find it you naturally level up your Pokemon (Unless you are running from every battle).Now battles themselves have remained, from a mechanics standpoint, nearly untouched and that's a good thing. There has never been anything wrong with combat in Pokemon and this never needed to be changed. They did of course change the graphics and animations which I will touch on later. There are a lot of smaller, what I like to call Quality of Life Improvements, to the UI and everything that I don't see the need to go into here as if you see them you will know exactly what I mean.EV Training (Effort Values) has become much simpler this time around, you don't have to guess and check what your Pokemon's EV points are. To make along story short, EV points are how the game determines what stat bonuses a Pokemon gains. In all previous games EV points were given only by defeating Pokemon , each Pokemon gives different values. In this game, you can still do that, but you can also use training mini-games on the touch screen to raise it manually. These can get repetitive but it is a fantastic way to make sure your Pokemon get's the points in the stats you want them to be in. I spent an hour filling out my ZigZagoons speed and Attack stats so I knew it would gain the most in those 2 areas as he leveled. If you mess up or don't like how it turned out, you can actually reset EVs now using a specific item. It's been simplified for the best In my opinion as now everyone can take advantage of the EV system and in a much nicer visual way.I wanted to throw this little addition in there, for the first time in pokemon history you more or less get free movement. No longer are you permanently tied to a Grid format. Once you get the Roller Blades (About 1 hour into the game) you are able to move in full 3D movement with the joystick, you can still move in a grid format on the D-pad for precise movement. You are still limited to the grid inside of Pokemon Centers and houses, but so far that's all it's been limited too. I love this, it's a simple change but lord do I love it. Just another Quality of Life mechanic they put in.The Pokemon Aime system looked odd to me at first. It was more or less Nintendogs with Pokemon (sort of). And I kind of ignored it to begin with, But I did give it a try a little bit later and while yes it is still just a way to view and... well pet and feed your Pokemon it's also got hidden bonuses. The first is obvious, the more you pet and play with them the quicker their happiness grows. There are some Pokemon Like Riolu that will only evolve if they are happy enough. The secondary effect is it also grants another form of EXP boost. As you play and feed them their heart meter grows, granting a bonus to EXP gained as you battle, similar to if you had traded them from another trainer. I didn't learn about this until later but now that I know about it, I take time out of my farming to play with my Pokemon a bit, at least the ones I like!The last and certainly not least, new addition is the Mega Evolutions. It's a simple concept really, take an old favorite Pokemon like Mewtwo, Charizard, Blastoise etc... give them a special stone, and press a button on your magical we promise this has nothing what so ever to do with Digimon bracelets, and poof. You get a new Mega Evolution Pokemon! More or less a 4th form for some. Now these are super powerful Pokemon that can really dish out some damage, but only lasts for the one battle, and on top of that you can only have one in your party (or something like that) I am not actually far enough in the game to be able to comment much more on this, but I had to mention that it's there and I am kinda excited to try it out later.All in all, the gameplay is top notch and Fantastic.Music/Sounds 9/10I have always liked Pokemon music, this just seemed to take it to a new level. The only issue I have is that the 3DS/3DSXL's speakers don't give it justice, I hooked the system up to a speaker system in my apartment and then the music came to life, in fact more than I expected. Eery song was fantastic and fit the scene well the battle music is quick and gives an odd sense of urgency, the forest music was somewhat dark and mysterious and the town songs are nice and upbeat. My favorite song thus far is the Gym battle music which... I can't even describe but it's awesome!The sound effects are also as good as ever. Each Pokemon has their own unique Cry (Noise they make) and all Pokemon from previous games have had theirs enhanced to match the quality of the new ones. I noticed this first with Linoone as he is my favorite Pokemon so I noticed his Cry had changed since I've used him in every Pokemon game since he was introduced in Sapphire/Ruby. The battle sound effects also fit the attacks and meld perfectly in with the attack. I can hear that rock throw hitting my Linoone, and it sounds... heavy.My only minor complaint is that they didn't use the Pokemon's voices like the TV show does. The only Pokemon in the game that does is Pikachu, and I really think that they could have just made it that much better had they had all of them sound like they do in the show. It's a minor complaint but there it is!The New PokemonI didn't give this a rating because it's pure opinion, but I haven't found anything wrong with the new Pokemon. They keep coming up with some pretty awesome Ideas of new Pokemon to add... and yes some not so awesome ideas. (I don't' think I will ever forgive them for the Garbage Bag Pokemon from Black/White). I've encountered a Pokemon based on the Robin, A Panda, I've ever seen a Sword Pokemon (Ghost type). Heck my favorite Pokemon is based on a badger. All have their own personalities and it shows during combat and in the Pokemon-Aime thing. It's all a matter of what you like and what you don't like.Graphics 10/10Ok, the biggest update the game has received is to it's graphics. Up to this point, Pokemon games have been nothing but Sprites and sometimes a little movement. All your characters, sprites. All the Pokemon, slightly moving in combat sprites. They didn't have a life of their own, it felt somewhat empty... but no longer.This game, looks, FANTASTIC. One of the best looking games on the 3DS, and it doesn't suffer from poor framerate. I didn't quite realize how much effort they put into the Pokemon's Models until I started battling with them. Every Pokemon past and present has been redone with a 3D model, and I couldn't be happier. Anyone who has played any of the Pokemon stadium games will be familiar with how they look, but now we have them in the Pokemon game! Each Pokemon has their own movements and animations which is even more amazing to me. Take ZigZagoon and Linoone for example. ZigZagoon is known for moving in a ZigZag pattern, so when it attacks it does just that, running left, then right, then left, then attacking. Due to irony, when it evolves it no longer runs in zigzag patterns, it runs in a straight line but is unable to turn easily, so it's attack is no longer a zigzag, it's a straight dash at the opponent, then a jump backwards. This is just one of many examples of each Pokemon's different movements. Attacks also have their own looks and animations, some look better than others but that is to be expected. Now will they look as good as they do when fighting in the show? No, they still for the most part stay in their own battle &#34;Circles&#34; but they just look so much better when fighting I love it, I can't complain at all about it. I really can't praise the game's graphics enough... they took their time with it.Outside of battle, the game still looks amazing, the grass and tall grass still look like they used to and in a tile format, but your character and the other characters all have nice 3D models, even if you don't see them all in combat. You can change your characters clothes, get a little customization there but sadly it's limited to just a few different outfits. I suppose it's better than nothing though!Multiplayer 10/10Lets talk Multi-player. A lot of us as kids got this game and loved to trade and battle with each other, trying to have the better team, etc... But it has always been restricted in many ways. until the DS games came out, internet battling never happened. And even on the DS versions it was still limited and somewhat sluggish. Black/White added the GTS (Global Trade System) why became a great way to obtain hard to find Pokemon, or Pokemon from previous entries in the series you just didn't have the ability to get. But it was still a tad bothersome as you had to go to a specific location, or go to the Pokemon centers to activate these features.NOT ANYMORE!Pokemon X/Y said screw all that moving around, you can battle, Trade, etc... On the go! you wanna trade with a friend? Tap on his avatar on the bottom screen and say &#34;hey I wanna trade&#34; same with battling. If they accept POOF. You trade/battle right then and there. You can even do this for random passer-bys. On the bottom screen will be a constantly updating list of other random players you can challenge to battles or trade with.That not enough for ya? The GTS Is also here, and available world wide. Search for a Pokemon you want to trade for, and it will bring up a list of players that have put that Pokemon up for trade, and what they want in return. You can deposit one of your own, and ask for another Pokemon. For instance say I want a Zangoose, I can deposit a Seviper into the GTS and say &#34;I will trade this for a Zangoose&#34; if someone accepts it the trade occurs and you can pick up the Pokemon later. That's the best part about this, you don't have to sit and wait. It's all done even if your game is turned off. You merely have to check up on it later! you also don't have to Have the Pokemon on you to trade, trading anywhere allows you to access your Storage Bank of Pokemon and trade from there, this is a new feature and one i welcome with wide open arms.This time around they added 2 new features to the Multiplayer!The first is Wonder Trade. This is an... interesting New one. You trade one of your Pokemon , any one ya want, to another random person. You don't know what you are going to get until the trade is completed. And you can do this infinitely. You will probably get a lot of junk Pokemon , but I have already received some things I didn't expect. I got an Eevee, and a wierd other Pokemon I had never seen before. Along with like 3 Caterpies. But still, it's random fun. And each time you use an interaction like Wonder Trade, Trade, Battle... you gain PokeMiles which can be traded for useful items at a vendor in the main city.The other thing they added is O-powers. these are short term buffs you can give yourself or other players. Things like &#34;raise Attack, Raise Defense, Increase Capture Rate, etc...&#34; They last about 3 minutes (at least at level 1) and can be sued as long as you have.. O points I guess they are called. you recover the Points as time passes, using the ability in yourself costs the full point value and using it on a friend or other player costs 1/2 the value. It's just a fun way to help others or yourself out.Final Score:I give Pokemon X/Y, 9 Linoones and a Zigzagoon (9.5) out of 10.It's not perfect, but damn it's close. This is the Pokemon game that I have always wanted ever since the original Pokemon Stadium came out, showing off the Pokemon in 3D. I am a little sad that there isn't a version on the Console, I'm sure they will still make the Stadium U game, but Those only deal with combat, this is the whole game and I adore it. My only complaints I have are really the same complaints I have had from the start of Pokemon's Existence. I hate HMs. Always have, always will.If you are New to the Pokemon series, this is probably the best to start on, even if the start is a bit rough for new players. (They don't explain a heck of a lot it just assumes you know some things by now). But it's also the best in the entire series for experienced and casual returning players alike.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2013"}
