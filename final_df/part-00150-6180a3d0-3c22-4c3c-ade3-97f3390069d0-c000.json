Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Just plain awesome","reviewText":"As of this writing, Mario Kart DS is hands down the absolute best game available for the DS.  As one would expect from the long running series, Mario Kart DS allows you to play as Mario and co. in a series of go-kart races.  The gameplay mechanics will feel like putting on an old glove for longtime fans of the series, while newcomers will have no trouble getting into the game.  As you progress through the various circuits, you'll find bonus tracks, karts, and characters to unlock as well, which adds a nice amount of replayability to the single player mode.  Along with the new tracks, there are some retro tracks available as well taken from the past incarnations of the series.  The real main attraction of Mario Kart DS however, is the fantastic Wi-Fi multiplayer mode.  There are only a handful of DS games which support Wi-Fi capability, and none is better at it than Mario Kart.  This is where the real meat and potatoes of the game lies, and you'll have a hard time putting down your DS after getting a taste of it.  The game looks, sounds, and plays phenominally, and all in all, Mario Kart DS is yet another excellent, must own, first party title for the DS, and the Wi-Fi options make it even more of a smash.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2006"}

Mason","summary":"Good game, lacking quite a bit.","reviewText":"I am not a fan of linear games nor am I a fan of first-person shooters. The setting and storyline is what drew me in to  play it. I read the reviews and such, but everyone has their own tastes in games. Another post-apocalyptic (for whatever reason caused it) game pumped out by Bethesda. I have Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas both of which are great games. There is a linear storyline, but it can be abadoned at anytime and returned to later.I'm a casual gamer so I don't have hours to spend everytday playing. I used cheat codes/trainers/commands when possible, however using a fraction of them so I don't ruin the gameplay. Not much fulfillment in playing a game for 3 years before completing it. As of the automatic patch which CANNOT be turned off, no cheats out there will work even if entered correctly. The codes that allow so are LOCKED upon updating the game. I'm sure it would be more enjoyable on the PS3 or the like, but sometimes I prefer the PC version.Pros: Post-apocalyptic (minor backstory during intro)First-person (not my fav, but this one is good IMO.)Vehicles (can be upgraded via Racing Certs from winning races)Cons: Linear storyline (Side missions can be done when availible, but eventually must return to the story.)Only first-person view. (Can't see what you look like unless in a cutscene.)No character customization.Small variety of guns, ammo, engineered items, suits. (BAD>.......)Main character doesn't talk. Pre-determined responses.NPC are clones. (Pre-determined responses, their attitude won't change toward you like in Fallout 3.)Cash flow is LOW. (Must be picky about upgrades, ammo, etc. Endless questing for decent cash takes too long.)Endless, repetitive racing for Credits to upgrade cars. Most upgrades can't be switched to another car.There are other PROS and CONS with with the game; each person should make his/her own preference in playing it or not.It only got three stars for the PROS I listed. Bethesda usually puts out some good ones including the Elder Scrolls series and Fallout. Here? I see no reason why they rushed the job. If it was more like Fallout then the game would be much greater.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2012"}

Second, the graphics is quite poor, and the games are simply not realistic at all (for the most part, way too easy to get high scores).

Being a late owner of both the PS2 and PS3 there were a lot of games I missed out on and later regretted not getting and this series was one of them.  The big prod about getting this collection other then the entertainment value is that all three games still cost about $20 dollars so this collection is a real bargain.  The next pros is that you get three individual games to play on this blu-ray disc game instead of having to swap out the game disc to put another one in to continue to play throughout the game series,also for fans of the Infamous game series who might not know that the makers of this collection and the Infamous games are one in the same.Obviously this collection is not going to be for everyone so if you want games with high graphics contents like Uncharted or Farcry then this collection is one you might want to pass up though I say give the games a chance you might be shocked and amazed at how much fun you really have playing these games...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2013"}

I truly enjoyed experiencing this game and all it had to offer from a story and experiential point of view. Unfortunately, it was far less enjoyable to play than to experience because for all its strengths, this just isn't a very fun game. The controls are overly simplistic, enemies are a bit boring, and the overall combat mechanics are generally poor. I would almost rather spend all my time exploring this complex world than to be troubled to stop every so often for yet another brief combat encounter with an enemy I neither care about nor get any sense of accomplishment from vanquishing.

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"James L.

Not to mention, they&#8217;re poster children for the argument of video-games-are-art movement.  They have also paved the way for other games, like Journey, to be accepted by the masses.  And that&#8217;s quite a feat in a day where Call of Duty is the norm.I won&#8217;t go into too much detail here because chances are you already are familiar with these games or have heard about them.In Ico you take control of a little boy with horns cast away into a labyrinthine castle.  You must escape this castle with a female, Yorda, who&#8217;s stuck in the same boat as you.  All the while fending off shadow monsters who attempt to abduct Yorda.  It&#8217;s an escort mission at its core.Shadow of the Colossus throws your character in a large beautiful but desolate land in an attempt to awaken an unconscious woman.  (Love interest?  Friend?)  It&#8217;s just you, your horse and sixteen giant colossi.  Beat all the bosses and you win.Minimalistic in concept, stunning in execution.Frankly, the games are better on this collection than their PS2 originals.  These games were built for HD before HD was even a standard!  I mean that in the sense of the scope and presentation of the visuals lend themselves quite well to large format TVs that have become more and more the norm than, say, a 32 inch tube TV that I originally played Ico on back in 2001.The remastering is Bluepoint Games&#8217; typical standard of excellence.  (They did, after all, work on the God of War Collection and Metal Gear Solid upgrades)  And stereoscopic 3D is thrown in the mix for those of you who may be into that.

See, the game originally had \"hobo\" Sam Fisher for awhile before last year's E3 when Ubisoft unveiled its dramatic makeover with a focus on more faster, fluid and more dynamic gameplay, compared to the slower-paced, methodical and patience-requiring previous games. Only the game was met with 2 delays from October to February than finally then till April 13th and the demo wasn't exactly released to high acclaim from some fans saying it wasn't Splinter Cell anymore and it felt more like a 3rd person shooter with stealth bits which happen to involve Sam Fisher. But given Ubisoft's pedigree and the delays intending for further polish, how's the final game? Well that's kind of where my difficulties since it's a really fine game on its own and nicely put together yet it doesn't hit me as \"game of the year\" which I was kind of hoping it was and it doesn't feel like the game I'm going to revisit throughout the year. But the campaign is great, co-op's an absolute blast and owners of the game will be given access to the Ghost Recon: Future Soldier multiplayer beta in the summer so there's some bonuses there but as far as longevity and breadth of material for such a high price point might turn off people.Story: Agent Sam Fisher is no longer at Third Echelon and is gone into hiding though it doesn't take long before his former colleague Anna Grimsdottir and tells him that people have been sent to kill him. Interrogating the leader, Sam finds out who is responsible for the death of his daughter Sarah and from there Sam delves deeper into the plot inside Third Echelon and the conspiracy behind it all. The reason why I left the story bits so vague and small is that the fun of it is discovering it for yourself and all the twists and turns are more compelling the less you know. Also another reason why I kept it vague is that I haven't actually played a single Splinter Cell game before, maybe playing Pandora Tomorrow at one point but some of you fresh to the series might be entirely clueless as to what the hell's actually going on when names, organizations and events are recalled with fans completely in the know and nodding while others are like \"um...what?\" But the game's length, normally something that elicits whines is actually a perfect length for the game: it tells its story, it doesn't bore by excess and it gets out before it overstays its welcome.Graphics: Looking at the game graphically, you can't really say the game's ugly but when so many games are really pushing the bar as far as graphics go, a game long in development as Conviction as well as Ubisoft's ability to create some stunning looking games (Assassin's Creed II, Prince of Persia, Far Cry 2), it's somewhat underwhelming looking at this one but by no means is it a slouch. Character models are really well-done, lighting's excellent and some of the scenes with large crowds look stunning. Conviction also adds a color/B&W; scheme to its stealth where in hiding, everything's in monochrome while if you're in well-lit areas or in danger of being seen, it goes to color which is quite handy though strange at times since the game doesn't impress graphically in black and white yet it's recommended you play in it. As seen in the E3 demo, all your objectives and hints are displayed on the environment itself so as opposed to the \"press Back button to see objectives\" or an on-screen text telling you what to do, it's projected onto walls and even flashback sequences in certain moments are projected as well. Sometimes it works incredibly well while other times, which have stuff like \"anger\" and \"lies\" onscreen is kinda much.Sound/Music: Now let me say that everyone in the main cast do their jobs exceedingly well. Michael Ironside returns as Sam Fisher who brings that anger into the role nicely when he needs to while everyone else doesn't feel out of place. But it's the enemy VO that is going to seriously grate on your nerves. Like Batman Arkham Asylum and Borderlands, your main baddies have a habit of talking a bit too much and not only that, saying the same thing too much so \"come on out, Fisher!\" can get repeated ad nauseum by more than one guy which tends to make you want to kill them as fast as possible. Music's well done but the sound design is awesome and the explosions of grenades are seriously some of the best I ever heard cause those things sound threatening and dangerous for once, same with gunfire.Gameplay: Many stealth games are built on assessing the situation and figuring out how to dispatch enemies with little trouble and if you're caught, doesn't matter since they don't know where you are anyway. This also means however that it can become really slow paced to the point where you're almost waiting a bit too long for the right opportunity to do something which can wear out its patience. Conviction is built more like James Bond or Jason Bourne: get in, get rid of everyone quickly and get out before anyone realizes what the hell hit them. While this makes the game way more intense and action-oriented, it also feels like like a stealth game and more like Uncharted 2 starring Sam Fisher. No problem in it really but in other games it was usually never a good idea to be seen since a whole battalion was dropped on you. Here? Just throw some frags, exploding cameras and remote detonated mines so it becomes less about not being seen entirely but more like somebody who's shooting and exploding stuff from who knows where. But Sam does have quite a few tricks up his sleeve from the mines, flashbangs to shooting things in the environment that can take guys out. It's a lot more action-oriented which might turn off the stealth purist but for those on Realistic, it becomes more intense because of making sure things go right without getting caught.The new feature Sam gets to play with is the Mark and Execute which works like this: get a melee kill on someone and you have the option to \"tag\" enemies where pressing Y goes into a cool cinematic of Sam dispatching the enemies in one shot. This doesn't make it the \"win button\" as some people were worried about since melee kills are not always readily available or accessible without being seen but it also makes clearing out a room sweeter. For example: say there's 5 guys in a room, chandelier overhead 2 of them and another 2 on the other side and one right below where you are. Bit too much forces huh? Nope, just tag the 2 guys on the other side tag the chandelier and drop down on the one below, chandelier gets knocked down taking down the 2 while you shoot the other 2. There, room cleared. It becomes immensely satisfying and just looks cool doing it as well. You can add more upgrades to the amount of tags you can do as well as gun stats by going into your weapon cases where you can add more tags, more stronger bullets or better accuracy. While it's worth it for the achievements, I found it was usually best to just stick with silenced weapons only as some guns can't be outfitted with one which kind of sucks. Why would I want to bring this noisy assault rifle that gives away my position when I can take a silenced SMG?Another added feature is the co-op mode which comes in several flavors from the story mode which takes place prior to Conviction's story to a horde mode type deal and several others. Playing with a friend is really quite fun though I'd bring friends you know since randoms have a weird tendency to want to treat it as a shooter and constantly get shot at or run off without you than whine about not keeping up. For those of you who want all the achievements you pretty much have to play every co-op mode there is and play them on Realistic difficulty no less so you're bound to sample them though how great you find them can be a problem. In a cool move, Ubisoft is adding free DLC to the game seemingly every week with new equipment and costumes most likely being added and like I said, owners of the game will be able to play the Ghost Recon multiplayer beta that is supposed to be out in the summer with the full game in the Fall so that's quite cool. Unlike other betas where you have to get lucky to be picked or to somehow receive a key, if you own Halo 3: ODST then bam, Halo Reach beta and it's the same here. If you have the game, off you go. Hopefully more developers will start doing this as it lets everyone have a shot at playing while also potentially giving people a chance to love a game they might not even bothered with at it not been included.Honestly? Unless you're a huge diehard fan of the series, I'd wait until this one dropped in price a tad. Even for a game this high profile, the price is a tad high given the amount of content but by no means is the content bad but considering the amount of it, it feels a tad much. But it's definately a game worth playing, if not outright owning but with May looking to be one hectic month for game releases, maybe you'll wait a bit.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000930DIM","description":"Rule the road by dominating your rivals and laying waste to rush hour traffic.","reviewerName":"David Foskin \"SneakyGoblin on XBL\"","summary":"Fast, very very fast...","reviewText":"One of the most anticipated games this fall is Burnout Revenge, the follow-up to last year's Burnout 3: Takedown, which actually garnered some votes for \"game of the year\" from a variety of publications last year. From being able to smash into traffic to improved visuals, the sequel has improved upon its predecessor in almost every way, and it even got faster. Yes, faster.Burnout's \"revenge\" factor is noticeable right off the bat. For starters, the A.I. for the other cars in the race has been improved and is now noticeably more aggressive. No longer do they passively drive next to you; they want you out of the race as badly as you want them out. When you take another racer down, rest assured they will make returning the favor a high priority. The game also encourages you to takedown opponents that have caused you to crash, highlighting them as a new \"revenge rival\" before the smoke has even cleared from your wreck. It doesn't seem like much, but it really gets you fired up to take make them pay for taking you out. There are new ways to take down opponents this year; from running traffic into them to simply taking a jump and landing right on top of them. Rival cars actually seem to position themselves under you when you get big air, so landing on top of them isn't quite as difficult as it sounds.The game also features a new Traffic Attack mode where your goal is to slam into as many cars as possible while racing through town. You'll get a goal of totaling a certain number of cars, and a short amount of time on the clock. As you smash into traffic (they must be going with you, not towards or perpendicular to you), you get more time added to the clock. In addition to there being a certain number of cars to hit to earn the gold, there's also a target number to earn a trophy. Traffic Attack is so much fun that you won't need the added incentive of a trophy to keep smashing cars well after you've earned a gold.Burning laps, which where many people's least favorite part about Burnout 3, are back, and they are just as frustrating as ever. Driving a flawless lap with the game's faster cars is difficult, and racing the same course ten times in a row to shave off a few seconds is nowhere near as enjoyable as slamming into traffic or taking down other cars. Sure, they help you learn the course, but they're not much fun.Crashbreakers are a little more effective this time around, and different cars have different power levels for their crashbreakers. The camera is still problematic, which makes steering your car into a passing rival mostly a matter of luck. Should you nail someone with a Crashbreaker, get a Takedown, or just drive dangerously (yet successfully) you'll be awarded points and a ranking at the end of the race. These rankings open up new challenges and courses, and are a good incentive to play more. You'll often find yourself playing \"just one more\" to get your level up before turning off the game.Crash mode has been revamped, and despite it being hyped as \"golf with cars,\" which really doesn't sound that appealing, it isn't dissimilar from previous incarnations. There's a meter on the left side, which is ripped straight from Madden's kick meter, and you must hit X near the top, and X near the bottom to get god starting speed. Hit the X button too late near the top and you'll blow your engine; hit it too late on the way down and your car will stall. It does add a little bit of strategy to the mix if you don't get the optimum start, but for the most part it's a frustrating and rather pointless addition. Wind is also a factor this year, as you must take it into account when launching your vehicle off a ramp. For some reason a 20mph wind can wreak havoc on your two-ton vehicle, so lining up your jump to compensate for the crosswind is key. Like the starting meter, this feels like an unnecessary addition.The good news is, once you get moving, crashing is just as fun as ever. Gone are the crash multipliers (something I liked), but their removal does give you more freedom as to how you're going to tackle a challenge, so it's not the end of the world. A \"target\" car has been added to the mix, and it's primarily a bonus car that comes around late into your crash, provided you've caused enough carnage to last that long. The camera is still problematic, often not showing the action from the optimal angle. This is mainly an issue when you're about to deploy your crashbreaker and launch yourself into a new group of cars. The camera shifts at the last instant, forcing you to orient yourself while madly pounding the R2 button to charge the crashbreaker. All in all, it's just as good as last year, and perhaps better, depending on how you like the start meter and the wind.The game's tracks are also an improvement over last year's, not only because they look better, but because of new shortcuts. These shortcuts will save you tons of time, which is a necessity when trying to get a gold medal in burning laps. Most of the shortcuts are marked with flashing blue lights, making them easy to spot, but you still need to have a decent idea as to where they are because you're often going so fast that you're passed the shortcut by the time you see the lights. The shortcuts are generally light on traffic, but they have their own hazards, like narrow paths, jumps, and junk that flies up when you hit it, obstructing your view. They are high risk, but they are also high reward.Controls are as tight as ever, and there's really no way they could be improved. Load times are frequent, but they've been shortened a little bit, and outside of crash mode, where you're constantly re-starting, they're not really an issue.Burnout Revenge supports online play, but actually getting online is a rather cumbersome experience. You'll need an EA account, which requires an email address, password, and usually several tries at a nickname - since so many are taken. If you're behind a firewall, or you're using a router, prepare to spend a lot of time learning how to open ports, because without certain ports open, you won't be able to play at all. Many people who aren't technically inclined won't be able to get online with the game, which in my opinion is inexcusable. If you think you fall into this category, and you've got an Xbox, then the Live-enabled version of the game is the way to go.Takedown was one of the first games to use the 900 degree rotation feature of Logitech's snazzy $150 Driving Force Pro wheel, and anyone that invested in the wheel will be happy to know that Revenge can utilize it as well. Using the wheel is a great way to play the game, and there's really almost no learning curve involved. You might not do as well right off the bat, but after a few laps you of whipping the wheel around and feeling the intensity of the force feedback, you won't want to go back to playing with a regular controller.The cars look more realistic than ever and are quite shiny, showing off real-time reflections. Like the vehicles, the courses are more realistic this year, and there's a great amount of variety to them. From industrial downtown areas, to snow covered mountains, there's a little bit of everything. Even the menus and trophy clips are snazzy; you can tell that a lot of time was spent polishing this game to perfection.The framerate is for the most part, rock solid and lightning fast. Somehow, it feels faster than the last Burnout, which is quite an accomplishment. There is some occasional slowdown, but it's rare and never affects gameplay. The game has a gritty look to it, so the colors are a little muted, and everything seems to have been run through a filter to give the game a more natural look. Sparks, flames, and vehicle parts fly during crashes, adding to the mayhem on screen. I found that the in-car camera view, which is my preferred view, isn't very useful because you can't see what's on either side of you. I was constantly getting slammed into walls by the aggressive CPU because I couldn't see they had me lined up.Revenge supports 480 progressive scan, but the only way to implement it is to hold the X and triangle buttons down when the first loading screen comes up. It doesn't make a huge difference in how the game looks, but it's certainly something you'll want to do if your TV can handle progressive scan. It would have been nice for this to have been placed in a menu somewhere, especially since the X and Triangle trick is nowhere to be found in the game manual.One of the best things about Burnout Revenge's audio is there's no more announcer. He's nowhere to be heard this year, which is, as anyone who played Burnout 3 will tell you, a good thing. Sadly, EA Trax didn't get the boot, and the soundtrack is just as much of a mixed bag as it always is. It's heavy on punk and rock, which would be a good thing if it was more than a bunch of new bands, who in my opinion all sound the same. If you enjoyed last year's songs, then chances are good that you'll like what you hear this year.Sound effects are another of Revenge's strengths. The cars all have unique engine noise, ranging from the high pitched scream of a sports car, to the throaty roar of a truck. Crashes are filled with the sounds of breaking glass, exploding cars, and metal being ripped to shreds. All of the sound effects are solid and add to the overall experience.If you were a fan of Takedown, you should already own this game. The same goes for anyone that enjoys racing games even a little bit. Hell, you should give this game to your mother for Christmas. It's that good.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Bobby Shornock","summary":"Play for the story, stay for the loot and co-op","reviewText":"Let's face it, Diablo 3 had a TERRIBLE launch.  The servers went through a multitude of problems on launch day, the day after launch, a few rolling restarts and server/game crashes.  However, being one of the most anticipated games of 2012, beating out Mass Effect 3, Max Payne 3, and probably all but Black Ops II, I can assure you that it's worth the wait.The loot system is just as complex as before, the rune system is re-worked so no longer is it item based, it now adds an additional effect to a skill, making certain abilities better for solo play, or group play.  Some abilities also are more useful depending on the difficulty.  Do you want to be a glass cannon on Hell or Inferno, or do you want to take reduced damage to kill longer?  Avoidance or Damage?  Heals or CC?  There are plenty of ways to play the game.  I wish that the game still allowed 8 players at a time, and who knows, maybe this feature will be re-implemented again in an expansion.How many people are going to be making Diablo 3 their next part time job come 5/22/12?  I think it's an interesting way to keep people playing, although I will have to laugh at the people that will actually pay money for an item you will never physically own other than in a video game.What Diablo 3 has done right:* Very easy to join games with your friends, open your Friends panel, right click the person, and invite or join to party.* The loot is still very complex and you will be scratching your head and seeing if this item is an upgrade* Skills are done to give diversity on how to play a class, no longer will you be forced to reroll if you screw up a talent point, or attribute wrong(Even though later patches in Diablo 2 fixed this)* Scaling difficulty the more people that play, that was a very good feature in Diablo 2 and made it a challenge and fun to kill Baal and Diablo in 8 player games by yourself.* No longer punished if you join games with people that are further along in quests.  You can play along with them and still progress.* Quest leeching, while it could be annoying in public games, at least it's an easy way to level up a noob without getting slaughtered.* Hardcore mode, definatly has the same feel as in Diablo 2.  This time around, expect people to die a lot easier if you don't stack Vitality along with your primary stats.* No USEast, USWest, it's all one.  There are still Asian servers, among others, that don't seem to have the issues the US Servers are having.* No Town Portal Scrolls, no ID scrolls(You still have to right click to ID Legendary and Rare items, but no longer do you have to waste inventory to do so, like in the Beta)* Achievements to up the replay value after you've gotten past Diablo 3 on Inferno with all 5 characters.* Being able to choose which quests to repeat, for missing books, side dungeons, or exploration puroses.* Banner porting and customization of your banner, the banner porting makes it VERY easy to get back in the game with your teammates that are rushing to complete quests rather than loot or take trips to town.*** The Collector's Edition, like all four Warcraft games, Warcraft 3, and Starcraft 2, feel like Collector's Editions.  If you didn't buy one for $99.99, have fun paying double.  You get the standard Soundtrack, Art Book, the making of Diablo 2, but the items that stand out, you get Angelic Wings, which make your characters stand out, you get a unique banner and sigil(If you played in the Beta), Diablo Skull and 4GB Soulstone Flash Drive glows red when in your computer!  It also comes with Diablo and Diablo 2(A $20 value) pre-loaded onto the flash drive, much like Starcraft 2 did with their Collector's Edition.What Diablo 3 has done wrong:* Always online DRM, not everyone has an internet connection, LAN and single player was a very big part of the success of Diablo 2, and well, some people don't want to play the game with other people.* Very limited chat channels, you have about 8 pre-set channels to join.  No more clan channels.* No guilds.  This is a feature that would greatly benefit players because it would be easier to communicate with your friends.* No guild halls with a stash, again, a great feature that would make it easier to give items to people in different time zones.* When Diablo 3 has to undergo maintenance, you can't play at all!  Single player should be allowed.* 4 Player games, I think 8 players would've done well, especially if everyone could complete every quest in a game even in different acts.A lot of people will knock Diablo 3 for various reasons, however, those same people will praise Diablo 3 for different reasons.  No games are perfect.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2012"}

Arkham Asylum is still a great game, and worth having! Here's why.First, the graphics. The dark, moody, atmospheric cinematography is just great. You are drawn into the story just as if you were watching a well done movie. Then suddenly you are Batman, with powerful attacks, a flowing cloak, swooping take-downs, and a real sense of being an action hero.You've got all the great toys to rappel up onto buildings and leap down onto enemies. You can upgrade your armor, weapons, and toys to keep things interesting. There's a combination of puzzle solving, action sequences, stealth, flying, balancing, sliding, jumping, and more. You are fully immersed in this gothic world.You've got a story mode where you work your way through the asylum taking down the bad guys. You are searching out \"riddles\" - question marks - along the way to make sure you explore all corners. The map system is great and keeps you on track.There are also challenges - the typical beat x enemies in y seconds type of activities. So you can rack those up as well.One might have thought that, after playing the 2011 Arkham City game that going \"back\" to an older version of Batman would feel dated. But it's just as much fun to play now. The levels hold your attention, the challenges are just the right balance of hard and doable, and again those graphics and feeling of the whole place is powerful. This isn't a shiny-new spaceship. You're down in the depths of a nasty location, and every surface reeks of the danger and destitution.The gamemakers definitely get kudos here for making a game that stands up to the test of time and remains enjoyable.Are there any caveats here? The game is rated T for Teen and this definitely isn't a game for the little kids. There's a harshness to the world which is fairly realistic. But for older gamers, that adds to the appeal. They are \"real\" bad guys you are taking down - not just pink cartoon bunnies. There's a satisfaction in making sure they are put out of action.Well recommended, even if you're just buying it now.I purchased Batman Arkham Asylum with my own funds for the purpose of doing this review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2012"}

Well, Brink disappoints me.  Other then the very beginning, I lost interest fairly quickly.  I wanted to like it as I always want to like something I spend my money on, but I just cannot do it.Graphics are good.  Background sounds are good.  The voices coming through your characters in-ear speakers is just too much static noise when you are playing the game with a TB headset.  The weapons seems to be plenty, but most are just outright useless.  The special items like grenades and turrets just simply do nothing.In campaign mode,as others have said, the AI are just about as dumb as they get. Plenty of times someone on my team is standing with the enemy and neither one is shooting the other.Maybe I expect too much for 60 dollars, but even so, Brink is not worth 60 dollars as is.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2011"}

First off I knew there was no real single player. It basically has as much SP as Unreal Tournament 3 which is to say it's just has MP bot matches. I'd be OK with that if the bot AI was good but it isn't. In fact it's terrible. The idea that it could replace humans (which the developer stated) is nonsense. So SP is terrible. MP is a little better but I have issues with the guns which just don't feel right. Splash Damage is a PC dev and they just don't get how to make a shooter play right with a controller. You can say what you will about the COD play-style but the controls in that game are spot on for consoles. Another issue is the graphics. I like the art style but the graphics look and perform like a first year 360 game. Again the dev's inexperience with consoles is probably a factor. The texture pop-in is crazy. You can turn away from an object and then turn right back and the textures will pop-in (yes I installed it to the hard-drive). Overall the in-game graphics look muddy and low-rez. The frame-rate also isn't great and many people are experiencing game-breaking lag. Gameplay wise I thought having grenades be weak would be a good idea but in practice it makes it impossible to clear out groups near objectives which leads to a lot of stalemates. I also think the game would play better with fewer players. More does not almost equal more fun. Finally for a full priced MP only game to ship with only 8 maps is ridiculous. Luckily I rented this game first so it's heading back to the rental service I use. If you want a good MP only game on 360 you can take a look at Section 8 Prejudice ($15). On PS3 I would suggest Killzone 3.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2011"}

I won't go into a whole lot of detail relating to gameplay, there's plenty of that in other reviews but I will point out just how unique and fun to play this game is.This guy, The Saboteur - Sean Devlin, is your stereotypical drunken Irishman. No offense is meant to any Irishmen but that is how the character is portrayed. Well, maybe he isn't a drunk. The game never states specifically that he is but he does love his booze... and his smokes which he claims he thinks he'd go \"t*ts up\" without. So funny. Mr. Devlin is also quite the ladie's man.So anyway, the guy is out to settle a score over his dead buddy, murdered by a particularly sadistic Nazi, and while pursuing his goal The Saboteur becomes mixed up with the French Resistance. Intrigue and a good dose of intentionally hilarious smartassery ensues.There's only one DLC pack for this game because Pandemic Studios went \"t*ts up\" shortly after it's release and it contains no additional gameplay as far as I know. It does, however, allow you to toggle nudity and get topless dances. I can't comment on it beyond that because I don't have it. No patches either but I have yet to see anything but very minor glitches that have no effect on gameplay at all.This is truly a one of a kind game that you should play through at least once.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0016BVYA2","reviewerName":"Tyler Johnson","summary":"A worthy successor in every way","reviewText":"Bioshock is a fantastic game, on that you will get no argument from me. Over time though, it has been elevated in the eyes of its fans from a fantastic game, to one of the greatest games ever, and that is where poor Bioshock 2's troubles began. From the second Bioshock 2 was announced, the fans of the first game cried foul, saying that the first game was perfect the way it was, and there was no need for a second game; a sentiment that I agree with. The problem though, is that when said sequel came out, many people had already decided to hate this game, no matter what. Had 2k released a hollow experience of a game in a shameless attempt at a cash grab, then those sentiments would be spot on. Thankfully that is not the case.Bioshock 2 is an amazing game, period. It is beautiful to behold, wonderfully written and acted, well staged, and a joy to play. Many people say the story in this game is so much weaker than the firsts, but those people seem to have conveniently forgotten how terrible Bioshock's ending was. All the twists, turns, and amazing acting culminated in a needlessly difficult escort mission, and an uninspired, superfluous boss fight. I am not bashing the first game; I am providing context for my comparison to Bioshock 2.In Bioshock 2, you are a Prototype big daddy, on a mission to rescue your little sister from Lamb, the insane cult leader who has taken over rapture in Ryan's absence. The story is solid throughout, but it is at the end where is truly shines. I won't spoil it for you, but going for the Savior achievement really shows you why Bioshock 2's ending is superior to the first.The controls and combat mechanics in Bioshock 2 are unquestionably superior those of its predecessor. Instead of having to cumbersomely switch between your weapons and Plasmids, you can dual wield, opening up a very satisfying array of strategic options. Throw out a cyclone trap in front of a charging enemy, and when they are shot into the air, pin them to the wall with your harpoon gun. The telekinesis ability from the first game was an interesting idea, but in Bioshock 2 its potential is finally realized. At its highest level, it allows you to pick splicers up bodily and fling them at their friends, further opening up what you can do in combat. The weapons and abilities in this game are varied, imaginative, and most importantly a total blast to play with.Another point of contention with this game was the fact that it had online multiplayer \"shoehorned\" in. Now, had the multiplayer truly been tacked on, and uninspired, I would wholeheartedly agree. Thankfully, that is not the case. The multiplayer in Bioshock 2 is well executed and a lot of fun to play. Unique to multiplayer plasmid abilities can give you the edge over your opponent, and there are few things as satisfying as becoming a Big Daddy mid match, and wreaking havoc on your foes. In fact, the only thing more satisfying is being on the opposite side of that equation, and being the one to slay the great beast yourself.Before I move onto the achievements, I would like to address the DLC available for Bioshock 2. For the most part, I am not a fan of DLC. Usually it is just an extra level or a couple of new abilities. Bioshock 2 however, goes above and beyond in the DLC department. The two multiplayer expanisons aren't really worth mentioning, and fall into the category of DLC that I dislike. Be warned that the Rapture Metro pack, while offering new levels, and rewards, was incredibly poorly executed, and not worth your time or hard earned dollar. What is worth a buy however are the Protector Trials, and Minerva's Den.The Protector trials sees you having to protect a little sister from waves of splicers. How is this different from the escort mission that you dislike so much in the first game? Glad you asked. Bioshock 2's greatly expanded weapon and plasmid list makes these trials less a chore, and more an exciting challenge. I very much enjoyed the protector trials, but to be fair, I enjoyed protecting my little sister in the main game as well. If you don't find having to set up ingenious traps, and fighting off waves of bad guys to be enjoyable, than you know the Protector trials aren't for you. It is the next piece of DLC however, that influences my thinking when I say that Bioshock 2 is superior to the first.Minerva's Den is my favorite part of this game. It is not a set of trials, it isn't multiplayer downloads, and it doesn't just offer a few new outfits. It is a microcosm of everything that made the first game great, combined with the gameplay mechanics that make the second game so much fun to play. In this stand alone story you play as a totally different character in a completely new section of Rapture. You are tasked with finding the computer that makes everything in the underwater city run. The story of Minerva's Den brings ties up loose ends left from the first and second game, while simultaneously telling a story, that in my opinion, is superior even to the first. The \"twist\" in the first game is legendary, and I acknowledge that, but Minerva's den has an equally surprising twist, and has a satisfying ending to boot. The new plasmid and weapon you get in Minerva's den have been called underwhelming by some, but I enjoyed them.The achievements in Bioshock 2 range from unmissable story achievements, multiplayer progress, and satisfying skill based achievements. Thankfully, none of the single player achievements are controller breakingly difficult, and they also don't take away from the flow of the story. As stated before, I suggest going for the \"savior\" achievement on one of your playthroughs, just because, in my opinion, it delivers the most satisfying ending.Bioshock 2, by itself, is an incredible game. When combined with the enjoyable Protector trials, it is even better. Minerva's Den, for me, as a whole was a more rewarding and enjoyable gaming experiecne than offered in both Bioshock and Bioshock 2, and its inclusion in Bioshock 2 makes this game an absolute must buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2013"}

There are so many elements of this game to be appreciated -- from the unique Zandetsu mechanic, to the ever-interesting war philosophy, to the Kojima-Japanese style cinematics -- but these aren't for everyone, so read on before buying this one.GAMEPLAY:The gameplay alone is what sets this apart as it bears the Kojima signature. Players looking for a stealthy MGS as before will be sorely disappointed. As I am sure you are aware, Raiden is a sword-wielding mercenary of sorts. MGRR centers on you cutting up your enemies with flair in a seemingly new way. How is this accomplished? It's called Zandetsu. When enabled, Raiden goes into a slow motion real-time mode where the player manually cuts enemies using the right analog stick. The game tracks how many cuts you have placed, and there are certain bonuses and unlockables for cutting certain limbs at specific times. It might sound too gruesome, but in this universe your enemies are mostly machines and cyborgs, so the human gore level is actually very low. Needless to say, if you had an obsession with swords as a young lad like me, this game will do a very, very good job of satisfying that if you are now a grown-up.Like most hack n' slashes, there are two main attack buttons which can be used in various combos to chain attacks. Some combos are unlocked as you go through the campaign, but you will learn early on that most combos in the game will need to be unlocked through points you accumulate by playing through each of the game's chapters. Speaking of these points, you are given a letter grade after certain engagements in each chapter. The better you are with Zandetsu and the better you are at blocking and not taking damage, you will receive a higher score and thus higher points to spend. Not only can you unlock combo moves for Raiden, but you can unlock upgrades to his health, Zandetsu-energy levels (this ability is not infinite), weapons, etc. This score-point system is well-done and will make you keep playing through chapters as you aim to unlock more combos and upgrades.Other cool features are blocking and the ninja run. When in combat, blocking enemy attacks makes for a great way to knock enemies off guard and keep yourself from getting damaged. Also, with the audio sound of blocking, as you get good at it (blocking will take practice to become efficient at) you will feel like a true swordmaster. As far as ninja run, holding down one of the triggers while moving makes Raiden run very quickly, allowing him to surprise enemies, auto-hurdle over scalable objects, and dodge incoming attacks if needed. Using both these features in boss battles makes for an extremely satisfying experience. There's nothing like keeping up with your enemies at high speeds and blocking all of their attacks with such a high level of gusto here.This leads me to my favorite feature of the game, the boss battles. I don't want to spoil anything, but every single boss battle is very creatively done, from the characters to their attacks and so on. If you've played MGS games, then you know how crafty Kojima can get when putting together his bosses. Like I said I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say a huge drawback for me is I wish they would have added in a few more into the game.STORY:Can this game's story keep up with its gameplay? It's a tough call. On one hand, it is definitely nowhere near as developed as MGS games in either plot or characters. On the other hand, this game-type is a first from Kojima so it's understandable if the story isn't on the same level. A plus is that this game centers on the philosophy of privatized war, with the controlled supply and demand, the justification of killing, etc., galore. By the end of the game some players can feel the game comes off as anti-American, but what's more likely going on here is America is simply an easy platform to discuss the game's philosophy. Not to mention with the rise in drone and AI use in today's combat, I feel Kojima's philosophies on privatized wars, new AI tech, and where humans fit in, this sort of discussion is becoming increasingly relevant.As far as characters go, I think Raiden's look and ambition are cool, but that's about it. His emotions rise up here and there, but ultimately without knowing much about his background he doesn't give much reason for players to care about what he's doing as much as they should care overall about the implications of war. Also, none of the other characters are developed unless you take the time to listen to all the conversations on the infamous comlink. At least, in my opinion, the dialogue isn't too cheesy. If you are familiar with the cheesiness of Final Fantasies and other JRPGs from trying too hard in recent years, you'll probably sigh a huge \"phew\" of relief as I did.One thing I appreciated was the saturation of cinematics. Gamers who loved the Playstation years where games from Japan covered their games in cinematics (as well as lovers of games like ME and MGS who dig cinematics) will have some great nostalgic moments with these.So overall, the story isn't terrific, but it certainly isn't terrible. Would I recommend you to buy the game on story alone? That I wouldn't do. Rather, it makes a nice accompaniment to the main reason you should buy the game: the combat.REPLAYABILITY:This is very important to address as I believe there are some misconceptions here, namely with how long the game is. If you buy this game to play the campaign once, will this game be short? Yes, very short. If you buy this game to be played multiple times, unlocking and upgrading what you will, will this game be short? Not at all. According to the in-game clock, I beat the campaign in 8ish hours. However, the game doesn't count deaths or cinematics. When Looking at Raptr, I beat the campaign in 12ish hours when all was said and done. Take into account several things. You can't unlock everything in a single playthrough. It's impossible. Want all the upgrades? You'll need to playthrough several times, getting perfect S scores along the way. There are also unlockable \"VR\" (Virtual Reality) missions, which will test your skills as you complete a set of combat-tasks with the aim to beat a record time. Lastly, with 5-6 difficulties that truly require you to practice to beat them, if you plan on keeping this game and playing it over and over, there is no reason you can't put 30+ hours into MGRR.So with so many things I appreciate, why no perfect score? Well, there are a few glaring drawbacks. First, while the dialogue is not cheesy, the music is horrible. Cheesy metal flows all throughout the game, and I absolutely hate it. Secondly, as is usual with hack n' slashes, camera angles can be an issue in some minor battles and did cause me to die a number of times. Finally, while the ninja run mechanic is too much fun in combat, when out of combat the auto-jump feature triggers a little too easily. There were more than a few times where I unintentionally leaped over an edge down into a heavily guarded area, only to blow my cover prematurely (Luckily, though, the combat comes in here to save the day). As a final drawback, outside of the character models and cinematics, the graphic textures on the environment are rather poor considering how late into this console generation we are.All in all, though, this game oozes confidence I haven't seen in a game for years. In every aspect, this game believes in itself 100%, which makes it that much more enjoyable. Seriously, though, Zandetsu is ingenious. It opens up a unique form of escapism, making it a great stress-killer from a rough day at work or school.This may come as a surprise, but I actually do not prefer hack n' slashes. I tend to get bored with them too easily, which should tell you how much this game accomplishes in making players feel like a swashbuckling ninja with incredible speed and style. Like I mentioned previously, this game isn't for everyone. But if you took the time to read all this and like what you read, give this game a shot. It's one of the better surprises of 2013.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2013"}

Looking at both makes me impressed with the amount of effort that went into giving a pretty old RPG a DS-style upgrade.  This isn't just a port to introduce people new to the Final Fantasy series:  this one seems like it was also for the fans.  It's not just that colors seem richer, the graphics are drastically different, and some of the cutscenes have been given a serious rework.  The devil is in the details, and here the goodness shines through:  dialogue contains speech, and the lines the characters speak have been reworked to give the characters more depth.  The voice actors don't sound so bad, especially given that they're coming through to you on tinny little handheld speakers.  What's more, this re-do makes good use of the graphics chip in the Nintendo DS, adding angular camera views (as opposed to the old top-down 2D look of the GameBoy version).  It uses the dual screens to enhance the interface and also to grow the screen size during cutscenes.  And to top it all off, the gameplay, while still rather typical of the early Final Fantasy Series, is just plain entertaining--you *want* to figure out the next piece of the puzzle, to get to the next part of the story.All is not perfect here, however.  If you're not used to this sort of game, this one isn't as easy to get into as Final Fantasy III DS.  The difficulty can get pretty tough, and the \"Wandering Monster\" battles that pop up about every 10 seconds or so can get pretty overwhelming.  The problem isn't easily ameliorated by spending extra time just wandering around grinding your experience and leveling the party, either:  you'd be at it a pretty long time to get up to speed.  Instead you have to have enough experience with the Final Fantasy way of doing things to apply some smarts to your strategy.  When you set off on your adventures, it's more important in this title that you have your party properly configured, your gear purchased, and a decent plan for your party members.  Otherwise you'll quickly find your healer dead, your fighters incapacitated, and your wizards all out of energy.If you're familiar with the Final Fantasy series, this should prove to be a fun and challenging next stop on your way up (or down) the scale.  If you're new to the genre and want to play the \"old school\" style in which the series' first entries were designed, you'd probably be better off going back a little further to Final Fantasy III.  If, however, you've already played Final Fantasy IV in one of its older incarnations and you'd like a bit of nostalgia, I think you'll be pleased with the quality of this rewrite:  thank you Square, for handling with care.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2010"}

The cactus thows down a barrier, lays down mines and launches an onion into the air for support. The sunflower can heal an inividual player, lay down a health pack and burrow to shoot a laser beam. The other two characters also do different things and have different shooting capabilites.Around the maps in Garden Ops, their are pots that you can put plants in for support. When you play in games you will get points dependig on how you do, these points can be redeemed for a card pack that will give you plants to lay down for support. The more points you save, the better the plants you can lay down with the most expensive being 40k wich 3 hours of gametime, im almost there.As far as the rest of the MP, I have enjoyed it.  One match you are zombies and the other you are the plants.  To rank up, you have to complete specific challanges per character like: kill 3 players, revive 3 players, kill 5 players from a antage point, and then more class based challanges like: heal, eat, blow up and hyper speed kills per each character.  Their is an overall level, which i am 10, and levels per character which i am 3-5 since their are 8 characters total.  It will take some time to level up each character if you wanted too or you can just play it your way.Their are more free maps coming soon and I think microtransactions which makes sense for people that want to good stuff now vice later.  If you are against this, it wont be the first game and it wont be the last.  Battlefield 3, 4 and bad Comany 2 have released shortcut bundles so players can get the best equipment up front for their online experience.Great game with no SP experience, if this bothers you, then wait for a sale.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2014"}

Everything is done right, from the variety of weapons, to the ridiculous graphics and spooky atmosphere, RE4 provides a truly great experience for any and every PS2 gamer.The only problem with the game is that everytime you fire your weapon Leon stands still. In other words, he can't run and shoot at the same time. So what you have to do is run to a corner, turn around real quick, and start firing at people's heads. The game is just plain scary at certain points and will make you jump out of your seat and put the light on if you're playing at night.

{"product_name":"B003O6ED7S","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"A wonderful game for both kids and adults","reviewText":"I am going to review this a little different than my normal reviews as if you owned LBP1 you pretty much know the gameplay, graphics, sound etc.  This review is going to be broken down into 2 parts.1. The Game itself2. The CE box edition____ THE GAME ____Okay Little Big Planet, if you have not played it before, is pretty much a platform'er w/ some adventure and wonderful creativity thrown into it.  The game is suitable for all ages and has almost infinite re-playability.  When you finish the campaign not only do you have item collecting to do but online user created levels, can create your own levels, dress up your pod, play mini games or redo the campaign with up to 4 people and have a blast just enjoying yourself.LBP2 made some changes to the formula which I think gave it a much stronger campaign.  While the levels early on can be a bit annoying or challenging (due to the grapple gun mechanics) the game as a whole is very polished and boasts a fantastic sound track, some really good and funny voice acting.  They implemented a more solid storyline this time and it gives each level a lot more meaning to it.  The new versus levels are a lot of fun also with friends.The online play is extremely fluid, hopping into random games or inviting friends is even easier than the first game.  If you loved Little Big Planet this game will easily bring a smile to your face once again.  If you loved to create levels in little big planet, LBP2 will blow your mind with what you can do.  You can recreate games like pac-man, asteroids, street fighter, even play a game of basketball; the versatility of this game is never ending.If you never played Little Big Planet but were very curious about it, this is definitely a title worth picking up.  Next to the Uncharted series, LBP is easily one of my top titles released on the PS3.9.7 / 10  ( 97% ... 5 stars ) for the game.  There are some minor bugs that aren't game breaking but can cause that happy smile to turn into a frown for a few moments but not enough to hurt this game.  I expect many of the little problems to be patched out within a few days as these are just your typical launch bugs____ COLLECTORS EDITION _____Now... I am going to review the collectors edition.  Essentially, is the CE worth +$20 ?  Lets review what you get with the CE first1. Book/Game ends (60%)** These actually are much better quality than I expected.  They do not feel like cardboard at all but I have a feeling they are probably heavy duty cardboard w/ plaster coating over it. They seem far to light for the material.  However, they do work quite well. I have tested it with a bunch of games and they hold just fine.  They also do a good job holding a bunch of books; though small books like paperbacks such as Lord of the Rings, The Wheel of Time  etc  Each end has small rubber/felt feet(4) on it and I think here is the problem with why people are having issues with them.  They dont' have enough \"grip\" to really hold these ends in place.  On a smooth surface like my polished PC desk they slide far to easy and a simple bump would cause it to lose its hold on the books.  Replacing the little felt feet with solid plastic/rubber would resolve the problem but overall, out of the box - these kinda-sorta work.2. 5 PSN avatars (50%)** What can I say, they are PSN premium avatars.  Nothing special honestly and they don't even look that good IMO3. Jax and Daxter exclusive costumes (100%)** These are exclusive to the CE.  The costumes look fantastic in 720p with high detail put into them.4. 11 DLC costumes (100%)** Who doesn't want more costumes!  Depending on pricing when the hit official DLC  it can be $6-$11 in savings (technically since you are paying $20 more for the CE)5. LBP2 game disk (100%)** Of course you get the game silly!  At least you better have a game in the box ^_^6. 7\" Plushie (collectible) (50%)** If you don't already own a sackboy / sackgirl plushie then this might be worth having as they do sell for anywhere from $10 - $30 depending on the quality. However they are all usually 10\" in size not 7\".  This is pretty much a smaller version of the standard plushie you find anywhere.  From the original pictures included of the box set when announced they showed a completely different , higher quality Sackboy plushie.  It was the first thing I noticed also was that this wasn't the advertised Plushie in fact it is all over the internet, in these reviews, my friends pointed it out also.  Is this a killer, not really as you still get a cute plushie!  Its just a bit of a let down as well as slightly misleading pictures/advertisingANYHOW as you can see , in my book  the CE scored 2  100's  2 50's and a 60  so doing some math that's 72%  (i'm not including #5 in the calculation for obvious reasons :) )72% is pretty low in my book for a CE box set. (C- aka.. BARELY passing)  With that said:*** The CE is a PASS.  Do not spend $20 on this unless you honestly want a 7\" plushie for the kids (or to add to a collection or something) and some bookends that sorta-kinda-maybe work half the time 0_o  the costumes are really nice though but I'm sure you can end up buying them as DLC later on.

U3 won't fall into that category.  It's a fun game, a little on the easy side when set to \"normal\" difficulty, with a pretty good story line and \"acting,\" a nice interleaving of game play and cinema, and some decent graphics and sound track.  Another substantial up-side (to me) is the lack of super-tedious jumping/swinging sequences.  However this game doesn't manage to introduce any new hooks that make it feel much different, or more engaging, than earlier installments.  The weapon selection doesn't really expand/grow as the game progresses, the bosses/enemies get a little tougher, but not too much, and except for the final desert sequences and a brief sequence inside a boat, the environments are a bit predictable (warehouse, shipyard, city streets, etc).  If this was the first one I played I'd be really excited, and I'd strongly recommend it for folks who haven't played previous versions.  If you're already a fan and have played the previous versions, approach it a twenty dollar DLC pack and you won't be disappointed.

{"product_name":"B000A76ZNO","reviewerName":"Andrew C.","summary":"Surprisingly good","reviewText":"I hesitated a good while before picking this game up at a bargain price. Based upon various reviews and player feedback, I assumed that this game would be like 10 hours long, a bit buggy, and dumbed down. Fortunately, none of this was the case. I had some good fun with this over a weekend (yes, it can be finished over a weekend) and didn't come across a single bug. Fable is not in the same league as Morrowind, Oblivion, Gothic 2, or some of the other great roleplaying games (RPG) out there, but it does provide an enjoyable diversion.Gameplay: The controls are the typical WASD keys and mouse commands found in most single-player RPGs. The game is fairly easy to learn and navigate. The story traces the hero from childhood through adulthood, when he'll have to, you know, save the world. There are no character classes per se, but you can roughly play as a warrior, magic-user, or stealth/archer character, or some mixture of these.  Much of the story centers around a main quest line, but there are a number of side quests available. Unlike most RPGs, quests are assigned by quest cards that you pick up at the Heroes Guild (lol! That's what it's actually called).  It's a rather artificial-feeling system, but it's functional.  Progression in the game is quite linear. In most instances, you will not be able to even leave the beaten patch, since fences, rocks, and invisible barriers won't allow it. Compared to more open-ended RPGs like the Elder Scrolls series, Fable seems restrictive and light weight in this regard. Overall, it's a decent story, but it is rather force-fed to you.The game includes several interesting touches. People react to you based upon whether you've performed good or bad deeds. If you roleplay like a saint, you'll eventually have a halo and butterflies floating around. Ladies (and guys) will worship you, and you do have the option to buy a home and marry (multiple times if you'd like). If you play as an evil character, you'll eventually grow horns and fall out of favor with polite company. The nonplayer characters in the game, at least in the towns, have jobs and schedules. They work during the day and sleep at night, though only quest-related characters have anything to say of interest.Although you can only play the game as the same guy, you can customize him with tattoos, facial hair, haircuts, and a (small) assortment of armor. You can control how your character's skills develop, but not as deeply as you can in a game like Morrowind or Baldur's Gate. There are other small things that you can do, such as fish, play games of chance, and treasure hunt. Overall, this game takes about 20-25 hours to do everything it has to offer, so it is rather short for an RPG.The things that I didn't much care for are not major, but simply underscore the light-weight nature of this particular game. The game is certainly designed to appeal to the adolescent crowd, with hotkeys for burping, farting, and so forth. The various tattoo styles and haircuts further highlight this point. There is nothing really offensive in the game; it just feels a bit immature in places. Also, the save system is based mostly on the checkpoint model. You can't save just anywhere (at least your quest progress will not save), but the game will autosave at important junctures.Graphics: The game looks quite good. Character models are convincing (though a bit cartoonish and often repeated), and the natural environment is screenshot beautiful in some places. Since the pathing is fairly restrictive, much of the scenary is noninteractive. It's not like Oblivion or Gothic 2, where if you can see it then you can probably travel to it.Sounds: Voice acting is pretty good, with the usual British accents that invariably seem to accompany such games. The music is particularly well done and appropriate for the various atmospheres. Ambiant sounds are also decent.Replayability/Technical Issues: The game is probably worth playing twice: once as a good guy and once as a bad guy. It will play similarly either way, but there are different ways to perform certain quests depending on your moral disposition. Technically, the game was perfectly stable on my computer--no freezes, crashes, or other problems. The manual is decent and explains much of the game, along with the in-game tutorial.If you like RPG games and can get this one cheap, go for it. It's a well-polished, though simple, rump through a fairly well rendered world. Don't expect the same character depth, engrossing story, or exploring options that you'll find in some of the games that I mentioned above.

In Chrono Trigger prepare yourself to journey into the forgotten past, distant future, and even to the very End of Time.The Worlds of Past, Present and FutureIn Chrono Trigger you'll journey back to Prehistory (65,000,000 B.C.) where humans and reptiles battle to wipe each other from existence. Antiquity (12,000 B.C.) is an age where the world is divided between people whose continent is buried in snow, and the magical kingdom of Zeal, a highly advanced civilization. The Middle Ages (600 A.D.) is an era of swords and sorcery, a dark time when the armies of Fiendlord rule over the land.The Present (1000 A.D.) is the time period in which Crono, Lucca and Marle live. It is a bright and peaceful age. However, in the Future (2300 A.D.), an era of despair has taken hold with rogue machines ruling the world. After the day of the apocalypse in 1999 A.D., the prosperous civilization of humanity crumbled and the remaining people struggle to stay alive. And, finally, there remains the End of Time -- a place with no era to call its own. This confluence of time's streams transcends spatiotemporal boundaries. It is here at the gravitational center for all temporal flotsam that Spekkio -- the Master of War -- serves as your guide on time's treacherous roads.Battle Systems and gameplayThis game utilizes a revised version of the groundbreaking Active Time Battle (ATB) System. Chrono Trigger features exhilarating combat in which the clock is constantly ticking. Characters must first wait as the ATB gauges charge, and then perform an action. This makes strategic timing a crucial element in your battle plan. In addition to standard attacks, each character has an array of special Tech skills and powerful combos known as Dual and Triple Techs. Cooperate with other characters to unleash over 50 unique and devastating moves!Chrono Trigger utilizes great story-telling, interesting characters, action-packed gameplay, and the unique controls of the Nintendo DS to deliver a fun and well-rounded role-playing game on a portable platform.","reviewerName":"Stephen A. Lambert \"DS Player, PC gamer\"","summary":"Revived from the Past...Chrono Trigger is Back","reviewText":"To many of us that had this for the SNES, it was one of the best RPG's of the time. Duel techs, triple techs, the animation...it was a thing of beauty that Square pulled off without a hitch. Many of us that played this game declared it the \"top\" RPG of all time. Flash forward to 2008, with the release of this timeless classic on the DS, many fans from the bygone era visibly shuddered in joy. I was one of those adoring fans that was waiting for it's re-release, and thanks to Square-Enix and Nintendo, I am now a very happy RPG camper. Despite the price being a little steep (I paid $40.00 for it at Best Buy), it was well-worth every penny. All the classic gameplay is there. The techs are there, the animation, the combat...rendered just as it was back in the 90's. Some may have wished for an updated version, but I personally am glad that Square left it as it originally was. Pros and cons are listed below:Pros:Classic gameplay...classic Chrono TriggerTechs are still in place, combos make the game very enjoyableInteresting enemies with many different attacksUpgradable armor, weapon, and tech skills, plus a magic tree to pursueExcellent sound, even from the small DS speakersSome extra features thrown in that do not distract from the original gameplayFirst-run on the game includes a posterAnime cut scenes make the classic really shineCons:Since it's not updated, this may turn away some potential RPG fansPrice is a little steepIn conclusion, if you were a fan of the original, I recommend purchasing this for your RPG and DS collection. It will round out your other RPG's quite nicely. Even if you've never heard of this game before, don't be discouraged by the lack of flashy graphics. Give this a try and you'll see why Chrono Trigger was and still is (in my opinion) one of the BEST RPG's ever made.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2008"}

How exciting","reviewText":"SquareEnix(formerly SquareSoft)  was often the leader in creating top of the line role-playing games.  Not only were a majority of the games beautiful in their graphics,  but the music and plot were superior to most other games in the genre.  While Square still does well in the graphics department, all other aspects have dropped off considerably.The original talent that made so many of the early Final Fantasies left after FFX and formed there own company.(There new company made Lost Odyssey for the Xbox360)  The plot in FF12 is erratic to put it nicely.  While the start of the game has a promising introduction, the plot takes a vacation about 5 hours into the game.  For the remaining majority of the game you will be wandering around doing a lot of fighting and searching with very little plot advancement.  While the plot does pick up again in the last 5 hours or so it is still very poorly developed.Perhaps the weakness in the plot would have been less noticeable if the character development had been better.  To be honest,  I never grew to care about the characters in the 60+ hours I slogged threw the game.  FFX didn't have the best plot either but the character development was top notch.  You definitely cared about Yuna and Tidus.I know many others have complained about the battle system but I didn't find it that bad.  I liked how the gambits could speed the game up, yet you could turn them off if you wanted more control in the battle.  The main complaint I have is the lack of different enemies.  The game rewards you by dropping better loot if you kill the same type of enemy over and over.  Since selling loot is the best way to get the hard to get gil in this game, you will be constantly killing the same enemies to get the chain reactions.  I will admit, killing 50 wolves in a row is rather boring.FF games are usually known for the decent variety of side quests they offer.  FF12 has a huge monster hunting side quest game.  You can read posts on bulletin boards and then you find the petitioner who tells you the monster they need killed.  This is a fairly decent diversion, unfortunately some of them are so difficult that you need a strategy guide to tell you how to find the mark.  I did enjoy the past FF card games and even Blitzball in FF10 more so than this.One last thing before I break down individual scores for the game.  Either get the Prima guide for this game or check out the FAQ sections on gamefaqs for help.  In order to get the best weapon in the game you can't open certain treasure chests in the game.( whoever came up with this idea should be banned from making games)While FF12 is a decent game,  it is far from perfect.  In many ways I believe the series is heading in the wrong direction.Graphics:  10/10  For a Ps2 game they are top notchSound:  7/10  Decent music but not as good as other FF gamesStory:  5/10  Starts well, but has huge pacing issues.  Little character developmentFun Factor  6/10  Battles are fun but repetitive.  Didn't have same charm as past FF games.Replay Val  3/10  Perhaps if you didn't hunt many monsters the first time you played.Overall:  6/10  Not a bad game, but I find it hard to believe most \"pro\" critics gave it perfect or near perfect scores.  I wonder if it didn't have Final Fantasy on the title if it would have received the same praise?  For those that love Role-playing games I say rent it to see if its your cup of tea.  The ps2 has many games in this genre.  To me, FF12 is somewhere in the middle of the pack.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2009"}

Agnew \"rothwyn\"","summary":"The Force shall free me. . .","reviewText":"If you liked Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic at all, you should already own the sequel. If you're on the fence, just buy the darn thing; it's easily more than worth it.Even though only a year passed for development time, and a new developer took over the series, KOTOR II: The Sith Lords still manaages to provide a high-calibur and enjoyable role-playing experience, rife with replayability. The story is set 5 years after the fall of Darth Malak and the Jedi Civil War, and you take on the mantly of the only known surviving Jedi Knight, final target of the Sith. As the Dark Side of the Force grows in strength, the Sith have been waging a silent war against the Jedi Order, already weakened, and have not hunted it nearly to extinction.One of the main advantages this game has over its predecessor is the characters, the main character especially. While there isn't a \"Vader is Luke's daddy\" level plot twist in KOTOR II, your main character is a very compelling individual, while still maintaining a high level of player customization. Your character has a definite past, but nearly everything about him/her is up to you. Once again, you have the choice to follow either the Dark or Light side teachings of the force, creating a savior of the Republic, or a champion for the Sith.However, this time, you'll take your party with you. Employing an Influence system (through the game's multiple conversations), you can transform a goody-two-shoes idealist into a cold, brutal killer, or a student of the sadistic Sith into a paragon of virtue and truth. . . provided you have enough influence over them. This plays out in dialogue trees (which you'll be familiar with if you played KOTOR), and feels like a very natural extension of the first game's mechanics.Which is pretty much the mantra for all of KOTOR II. The combat, the pacing, the character advancement, and even the visuals are very obviously building off of the foundation of the first game. However, as far as improvements are concerned, the devil is really in the details. For one thing, the game's Influence system makes managing your party far more enjoyable, as what you do affects their actions as well. Additionally, there have been tweaks to the combat, the menus, and the graphics that really streamline and improve the experience. Facial models are better, cloth looks much more realistic, the weather effects are better, and there are more options during combat, more skills and Force Powers, and more options for equipping and customizing weapons and armor.That's not to say the game is perfect. There are still the issues with friendly AI that KOTOR had (they seem to really love running over mines), and sometimes the dialogue will get into annoying loops. Additionally, while the graphics have shown some minor improvements, there are still some nastily long load times, and noticable slowdown in large areas or during hectic combat. It's not horrible, but even with only a year, it would have been nice to see more improvements on the game's engine.Also, as previously noted, the plot doesn't have the same kind of \"Holy crap?! No WAY!!!\" plot twist moments offered by the first KOTOR game. The narrative is still interesting, engrossing, and well-paced, but it lacks some of the punch and originality that its predecessor offered. And where KOTOR started out with a bang and a half, the first couple hours of The Sith Lords is fairly slow, and can get pretty tiresome and confusing. In addition, the villains this time around are slightly underused, though they are far more interesting than Darth Malak ever was.Overall, while KOTOR II isn't a ligh-year-sized leap forward for the series, it's still a highly enjoyable role-playing romp through a galaxy far, far away.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2005"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"The best superhero game you'll ever play","reviewText":"It's usually a foregone conclusion that licensed games, whether they be based on movies or comic books, just tend to suck.  Batman: Arkham Asylum changes all that.  This eagerly anticipated game is hands down the best superhero game that you will ever play, boasting big production values and enough fun for anyone to pick up and play, even if you're not a Batman fan.  The storyline finds Batman trapped in Arkham Asylum, and going toe to toe with waves of thugs and a number of villains from his great rogues gallery.  Utilizing some punishing attacks and inventive gadgets, Arkham Asylum is plenty addictive and offers up enough engaging, easy to pull off combat that you can't help but enjoy what you get here.  Not to mention that the game also offers up some great moments of stealth, detective work, and almost everything else you'd expect to do if you were Batman (minus drive the Batmobile, which personally would have the icing on the cake here), and it does it all spectacularly well.  There's also over 200 riddles from the Riddler (naturally) to solve in order to unlock a horde of extra content including Challenge mode maps, and the game as a whole looks grim, gritty, and superbly detailed and animated.  But singing the game's praises here hardly does it the justice that it deserves.  It goes without saying that if you're a Batman fan in the least, you need to get your hands on Batman: Arkham Asylum.  It is without a doubt the best Batman game, and best superhero game, to ever see the light of day, and it deserves your time and attention.  And even if you're not a Batman fan, this game is so good that if action games are your thing, you should definitely check it out regardless.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2009"}

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Kevin","summary":"Much more fun than Halo 1","reviewText":"I very recently (within the last week) completed Halo: combat Evolved Anniversary for the Xbox360, and I can easily say this game (Halo 2 Xbox) is much more fun than the former.

With the Daxter PSP game, the little otter-like creature finally gets a platformer of his very own. This is really quite fun!Don't judge this game by its opening levels. Like most platformers, you have to begin slow, learning the basics of movement, jumping, attacking and looking around. Daxter is out slaying bugs, so he begins with the most basic of weapons - the bug swatter. He's searching for orbs, killing enemies, picking up health, and generally having a grand old time.As the game progresses, you get a wide variety of levels to explore and ways to move around. You get to drive cars, ride on zip lines, and much more. You get new weapons to take on new, more difficult enemies. There are even cool dream sequences that let you take on movie character personalities, sort of like Gex.Most of the missions are go-at-your-own-pace, where you can explore and track down all the hidden secrets. There are a few timed missions which might get frustrating, but as with all games, if you are patient and take your time to learn the map you can eventually get through them.I do wish they had made this for the big screen as well as the small. As beautiful as the PSP graphics are, with great detail and level distinctiveness, there were times that for example brown boxes blended in with the brown background and things became very hard to see. You shouldn't die repeatedly because the screen is murky.The game is relatively easy to get the hang of - but also encourages you to replay to track down all of the hidden items in the levels and to get the top score.It's also nice that the game is all about killing bugs - a task that most people find to be OK for children to do :) You're not slaying humans and there isn't mature language. It's nice to have a game that is really fun to play and that is appropriate for all ages of players as well.Highly recommended - and as I said my only hope is that they'll make this for the big screen as well so we can enjoy it with a bit more clarity.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2007"}

Enemies vary between being 100% flawless (all of your moves are blocked, if not guard impacted, all of your throws negated, even though there should only be a 50% chance of that if someone's even fast enough to attempt negating it), and being 100% worthless.  It punishes you for even trying to fight, because immediately after the enemy blocks your attack, he immediately counters with a lightning fast move before you can block it (even moves that knock an enemy off balance don't protect you from this counter attack).The enemy alternates between sitting completely still and not trying to block anything, to becoming completely impossible to harm at all; there is no in between.  Skill is irrelevant, as I can beat computer opponents just as well with the character i've used since soul caliber 1 (which i consider myself quite skilled with) as with a new character who's moves I have no idea to enact (which I admit I am god awful with).  This is because any hit you get off the computer is because it allowed you hit it.  Tactics, switch moves, throwing off balance, fakeouts, etc do absolutely nothing against the computer.  You're as likely to strike the computer with the most comnplicated and flawlessly executed maneuver in the history of fighting games as you are by closing your eyes and mashing the triangle button (try it, it works).Second reason is massive load times.  Trying to play through story mode makes you wait 15 seconds to load out of a battle into the map screen, 15 seconds to wait for the next text box, 15 seconds again to load into battle mode, and then it makes you watch every damn cinematic on the way though.Chronicles of the sword seemed like an intersting new game, but once again suffers the same problems as the other single player modes, some of which are even worse here.  Frequent loading saps any amount of inensity the game might hold, and the rediculous difficulty of the computer AI is magnified here.  Everyone in this mode gets \"levels\" 1-60.  You start at level 1ish, and fight opponents usually ranging from lv 7-60.  Higher the levels, the more health/damage they have/do.  Also, just to spice things up, battles frequently have an effect like \"all the attacks the enemy makes are unblockable\", or \"any hits you make against the enemy don't slow him down\".  These benefits only occur for whoever controls the tower, and since 95% of it is you attacking towers, not defending, these benefits rarely if ever get applied to you.With all of this complaining, you might wonder why I gave the game 3 stars.  Remember, this is only the single player mode.  Multiplayer is still relatively fun.  It also suffers from load times (especially when picking characters and trying to see what they look like), and the problem with once you're on the floor you're pretty much a goner, but is otherwise loads of fun.  Once you go through the root canal of single player to unlock the characters that is.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2005"}

Being a remake for 2005&#8242;s excellent Most Wanted; this version is a whole new beast. The streamlined menus, AutoLog, and the massive amount of real world cars and the huge world to drive in is something to get excited about.My favorite feature has to the be the new navigation menu. Being able to select races, customize your car, and jump to various cards with just the D-pad is great. There&#8217;s not even a need for a map. Select the race you want and it will put the GPS line on your mini-map. Want to drive a different car? 3 D-pad clicks and you&#8217;re there. This just seems nearly revolutionary for the racing genre as they have been plagued with nasty menus for years. Outside of the menu are the excellent racing moments and various types of races to do.Sprints, circuits, fastest speed, losing the cops the fastest; these are just a few types of races in Most Wanted. The whole goal is to find all the jump areas where cars are hidden through the entire world. Win first in each race for each car and you will win part upgrades to make your car faster and better to drive. Some parts are better for certain areas like offroad, but will slow you down on the asphalt. There are also various parts to help against the cops like re-inflating tires if you hit a spike strip or a stronger chassis for ramming through road blocks. Like previous Need for Speed games (and any Criterion racer) you can takedown vehicles for more points to work your way to the number one most wanted.A fun feature here (and it threw me for a loop) was having to take down a most wanted car to win their car. Sure you can beat them in a race, but what about taking them down? It adds a greater challenge, but if you miss them you can always summon the car back via the navigation menu. It&#8217;s not hard to work your way up to the top if you try to get first in every race. Even long after you beat the most wanted vehicle you can earn parts and find every hidden vehicle in the city.If that&#8217;s not enough try AutoLog recommended objectives or try to find and hit every billboard in the game. There&#8217;s a lot to do in this game, and even though it can feel repetitive after a while there&#8217;s just a great sense of accomplishment from getting first in every race. Let&#8217;s talk about graphics. Most Wanted is one of the best looking games on Vita period. The sense of speed is great and the controls are amazing. It doesn&#8217;t look like the game took much of a hit from being downgraded graphically, but was hand tailored for the system. The game even sounds great and I spent hours just racing around completing races without ever getting board. Is there anything bad about Most Wanted? Mainly how repetitive the races can get overall, but the variety of cars keeps this played down a bit. Crashing every 5 seconds can get annoying, but that&#8217;s expected. Most Wanted is a must have racer for any system you can own it on.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00005NN5A","reviewerName":"tvtv3 \"tvtv3\"","summary":"Just an Average Video Game","reviewText":"THE SIMPSON'S ROAD RAGE starts off really fun and exciting. The premise of the game is that Mr. Burns has bought the Springfield bus transit system and it's causing more chaos in Springfield than normal. So, the citizens (led by Homer) decide to fight back and buy back the bus system. They start their own taxi service and need to raise a million dollars to buy the buses back from Burns. There are a total of six levels, five of which can be unlocked as you earn more money. Also, as you earn more money you can unlock more vehicles. Different characters drive the different vehicles. As you drive along, you can smash into lots of different things: knocking over trees, billboards, mailboxes, signs, etc. This game is great to play if you're a Simpsons fan because you get to see Springfield in much more detail than you do on the show. The negatives about the game are that it is quite repetitive and it takes an extensive long haul or a tedious intensive amount of game play (depending on how much time you have and you're gaming style) to beat the game. The sayings each character says are funny at first but after the 100th time of hearing the characters say the same thing, it becomes somewhat annoying. Also, you have to have 2 game cards to play the multiplayer mode and when you only have one game card and two people want to play, it can be aggravating. The game also has a slow load up time so that after you finish a round, it takes about 3-5 minutes before you get to play again.There is a mission mode on the game as well. It consists of 10 differet missions that are fairly easy to beat (I thought Grandma at the dam and Homer at Burns' mansion were the most difficult levels). If you beat all 10 levels a secret vehicle is unlocked.THE SIMPSONS ROAD RAGE can be a lot of fun to play. It's basically an average racing video game that's more interesting because of the characters and setting. However, it would make a nice gift for any Simpsons fan and is fun to play on a rainy day.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2004"}

So when Bandai Namco announced the sequel, there were sounds of joy - that is until the game arrives in the store.Bandai Namco, in a Square-Enix fashion, managed to shred good memories into pieces by changing the battle formula, the main characters, creating time wasting dungeon puzzles and ridiculously hard random enemies.About the story, it is 2 years after the dawn of the new world after the party in the original game regenerated and reunited the two worlds. However, in good old RPG manner, there were disputes and discrimination in the new world (which they dealt with already with the Desians in the old game) that the world is far from being united. To even make things worst, the original hero Lloyd Irving seemed to have become the biggest villain in this game. When you were thinking \"What the?\" the game introduced the two most annoying main characters in Tales history - Emil and Marta. Emil basically sulk throughout the game and acted like an idiotic coward. Every time he opens his mouth, you just want to fast forward the cut scenes. As for Marta, although she was supposed to have a greater mission, all the things she said in the game seemed to just want to get laid with Emil. It is extremely frustrating when you need to listen to those conversation again and again after each battle without an option to switch of the dialogues at all. Seriously if Bandai Namco wants to pay homage to the original game, might as well just make a sequel with the same cast tell about their after stories. The two main characters are so unlikable that you just couldn't really be bothered to find out what happened to them.Adding to that was a completely unrewarding battle and party system. The battle system stayed true but now the party only consists of the two main characters with a Pokemon style recruitment system. The thing is if they actually follow the Pokemon or even the Persona formula, it will be a great system. But then it didn't. Monsters fight with you in real time and evolve, but the AI and strategy controls are so limited you basically have no control over them. Unison attacks all look similar with limited variation so you don't really know whether it is a new move until you look at the name of that move. When monster evolved they reduced back to level 1 and lose their skills (which they can acquire later when they level up again). Now cooking became a means to evolve them and increase their stats but then if you already have leveled up monsters it might be best to stay put and just increase their stats instead of evolving them. So eventually it lost the whole purpose of recruiting new monsters because they all join you at level 1 and required substantial \"wait-in-line level up\" before you can deploy them into battles.Dungeons in Tales of Symphonia are ingenious and yet challenging. In Dawn of the New World, they are just mere existence for extending gameplay without much value adding to the game. You are repeating all the block pushing and button pressing and that's all. So they make it a lot in each dungeon so you can enjoy listening to the same sound effects again and again for two to three hours. Not because they are difficult to solve but they are so large scale that you just need to run around doing similar things again and again. And to make this even more \"challenging\" they have random enemies that can kill all your party in two or three hits. In one of the dungeons, you need to pick up one of the key cards in one of the rooms, but then suddenly they have random enemies that can cause around 700 damage each hit at a point of the game that 3 hits you'll be dead. To make things worse, Bandai Namco took away the easy on the fly character switching system and replaced it with a complicated and user-unfriendly nun-chuck and Wiimote system that you need a PhD to master it freely. So while you are busily trying to heal and revive your characters, you lost control of all your characters instead.Dawn of the New World has such potential to be a RPG that Wii owners who love the previous Cube game can embrace it whole-heartedly. But changes to the game just make it a very forgettable game that if you are fans of the old game should strictly stay away. Even the cameo appearance of the original cast won't be able to save it cause the game is overrun by level 99 annoying main characters, cheesy dialogue and exhaustive and uninteresting gameplay.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2010"}

{"product_name":"B006GHA8EE","description":"","reviewerName":"Decker","summary":"Hunting monsters","reviewText":"I heard a lot of good things about the Witcher 2 but was not able to try it out since I lacked a pc for gaming. After the Enhanced version came out on the Xbox 360 was available I was finally able to play through it. Personally I think a lot of the praise for it is pretty well deserved. The game play was very challenging, but satisfying. The story is good with great lore and characters to back it up. The visuals were beautiful, making the fantasy world very immersing.You take on the role of Geralt a witcher. The witchers are supernatural warriors with cat-like eyes who hunt monsters and break curses, for a price. Luckily there is no shortage of monsters so work for the witchers never seems to run out. The main story line continues off the first game, (which I haven't tried so I had to tediously read through walls of text to get a basic understanding of the overall setting). Geralt a career monster hunter is dragged along by a king as a glorified body guard. After the king is assassinated Geralt finds himself being blamed for the murder of the king and sets off on a journey to find the real assassin. Though that little bit only scratches the surface of the overall story. The medieval setting feels very true to history. The nobility are pompous and prone to betrayal. The peasantry is bigoted and superstitious. Wars are fought brutally with soldiers behaving more like bandits. While there is a moral choice aspect to the game its not as clear cut as other games like Mass Effect. Good and bad are blurred, and choices you make whether moral or amoral can come back to haunt you. In the end you just have to go with what satisfies you most. Example (Spoilers): In one part of the game you are given the choice to helping a ruthless guerilla fighter by setting him loose, which only seemed fair given that not long before hand he had done your character a favor. Without thinking much of it I let them go. Suddenly when I returned to the settlement that I had been based in for that part of the story you suddenly bare witness to a horrific massacre of innocent people with the release of the terrorist leader being the justification. Unpredictable and yet very realistic. No fairy tale endings in this story.The game play is very challenging, and if you tackle it on the hardest difficulty like I did, it can be downright infuriating on certain parts. Combat especially can be very difficult and unforgiving if not prepared for properly. You'll find yourself dodging and blocking more often than swinging your sword around relentlessly like Kratos. Sometimes it seems pretty straightforward, you use the steel sword on humanoid enemies like bandits, then you use your silver sword on monsters like the undead. Otherwise some strategy is required which sometimes turns into plain trial and error. You have your run of the mill level system as well with various branches that offer their own advantages. Like a branch for combat for more melee damage and better sword combos. An alchemy branch for better potion making skills for medicines or traps. As well as a magic one for better spells. While the difficulty can make some cringe I was pretty satisfied with it. After all fighting werewolves and draugrs shouldn't be a walk in the park. The only tip I can throw in is the Quen sign is extremely helpful when taking on groups.There are a few mini games on the side like dice games and pit fighting, but they are ridiculously easy when compared to the game play of the main plot. In the it was good game and I can't wait for the third release.In summary,The good-A good story and characters, like the moral choice system and different plot-lines you can follow.-Cool over worlds, gives a very authentic medieval feel.-Great graphics, character models look good and so do the monsters, environments are beautiful and life like.-Challenging game playThe bad-Somewhat confusing UI, did without grenades and traps for awhile because I couldn't figure out how to equip them.-Auto save system is bad, so you should save manually often.-Difficulty can become ridiculous in some parts.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2014"}

David Swan","summary":"Hyperkinetic Fun for Players with Fast Reflexes","reviewText":"I hadn't played a 2D Sonic game since the olden days of the Sega Genesis and have never been a huge fan of the formula. The idea of zooming around at breakneck speeds is appealing but there are some definite problems with going 60 mph on a narrow side scroller, sort of like playing Mario with the run button held down except 10 times faster. The problem is that you run into enemies long before you can react. The solution is to make a clear path for Sonic but then the game becomes too easy. It's a systemic flaw that is one likely reason why Sonic has always been a significant distance behind the slow moving Mario. My other beef was that Sonic (like Poochie the dog from the Simpsons) is just too cool for his own good.Sonic the hedgehog still has the appearance of a character created by a focus group but his latest adventure is an exceptionally good game. The once mighty Sega is barely limping along at this point but they still manage to release high quality games and Sonic Rush is a highly polished game that accomplishes one neat trick which is to synchronize both screens so Sonic can seamlessly move from one to the other without disorienting the player. The effect creates a uniquely tall viewing area that gives players a better look at alternative paths. To solve the enemy collision problem the game adds a turbo button so that Sonic can punch right through enemies without losing rings. The turbo button runs out over time but can be recharged by performing stunts. There are still times when the player will likely need to scout an area before completing it in order to figure out where the turbo button needs to be pressed.The boss battles are perhaps the most visually stunning parts of the game and also the least fun. I actually had a tremendous amount of difficulty defeating Eggman's first mechanized vehicle and was concerned that the game might turn out to be obscenely hard. It's not an easy game and some parts are a bit frustrating but a few tries should get the average player through most sections. One feature meant to extend game play is Blaze the Cat who appears on the cover alongside Sonic. In order to fully complete the game players need to finish each level twice, once with Sonic and once with Blaze.There are some mini-levels that utilize the touch screen but many players may never even locate them. All in all the game is an excellent effort by Sega and the most enjoyable Sonic game I've ever played.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2006"}

{"product_name":"B003H0CBYS","description":"","reviewerName":"Alexander Ayers","summary":"Bulletstorm - Not Just for Shock Value...It's Actually A Lot of Fun","reviewText":"From my blog: Buckeye829's Video Game Reviews - Games Under $40First Person Shooters tens to take themselves very seriously these days.  It's getting more and more difficult to tell every Battlefield Ghost: Fall of the Modern Rainbow Company from the others, and they're getting so precise.  I'll admit I had basically zero interest in playing Bulletstorm (from EA, Epic Games and People Can Fly studios) after reading and seeing previews for it.  It seemed crass and vulgar, just for shock value.  I expected a slim story with just lots of blood and guts.  Basically, all for show with little substance.  Video games are still getting a bad rap from mainstream media anyway, and I felt Bulletstorm was just adding fuel to their fire.  But something happens to me when a game falls below that $40 pricepoint.  My standards relax a little and I'm willing to give a chance to something I'd previously written off.During Bulletstorm, you play as Gray(son), a self-imposed leader of a band of mercenaries working for an elite, top-secret group, Dead Echo, which was in charge of protecting the Confederation of Planets (which has a symbol curiously similar to Halo's energy sword).  Gray is basically Marcus Fenix's baby brother with Han Solo's thirst for adventure (and wisecracking) and Duke Nukem's sensibilities.  A mission goes horribly wrong and the team is exiled and become the hunted, due to a large bounty on their heads.  Gray then becomes paired with Ishi, a fellow team member, who has undergone a bit of a transformation, which makes the pairing more unconventional than you might think.  The two set out, each with their own reasons, but willing to work together.  Gray is out for revenge, but also redemption.Gray and Ishi crash-land on the planet Stygia, which looks like a cross between Pandora (from Avatar) and Coruscant.  There are warring factions and mutants galore, which obviously leads to a fair share of combat.  The thing that separates Bulletstorm from other FPS, is the skillshot.  Anybody these days can just gun down countless enemies, one after the other, but skillshots take imagination and ..... skill.  Each skillshot warrants a point value (skill points), depending on difficulty and ingenuity, which can then be used to upgrade your weapons.  Simple kills, the old-fashioned way, only garner 10 points.  Traversing through the game that way would leave your weapons and ammo at a minimum.There are 131 different skillshots to master in Bulletstorm, and more than half of the fun is figuring them out.  Sure some are basic like kicking an enemy into an electrical source (Shocker), cactus (Pricked), or sharp metal object (Voodoo Doll), but the enjoyment comes from some of the more complex ones: Attaching an explosive to an enemy then kicking him towards a group before exploding (Homie Missile), killing an enemy with a shot to the throat (Gag Reflex), or snipe an enemy with a shot to his crotch (Nutcracker) or behind (Rear Entry).  I can just imagine the roundtable discussions that were being held coming up with the names alone, and pretty much every time I discovered a new one, I ended up smiling and the name.Gray also inherits another potent weapon, an Energy Leash, early on in the game.  The Leash is basically an electrified whip that can pull enemies that are far, closer to Gray.  When they get leashed, the enemies also slow down for more precise skillshot action.  The weapon selection in Bulletstorm gives just enough variety and spin-off from typical FPS, that it felt fresh and new.  When first playing, I felt uncomfortable not having any grenades to throw, but eventually got used to it.GameplayBulletstorm plays extremely cinematically.  As you would expect, loads of action and everything seems larger than life with explosions, blood, colors, sweeping cameras, etc. galore.  The story mode is divided into 7 acts, with 2-3 chapters into each act.  The pacing is excellent and most sections don't seem too long or too short.  I played the game on 'Very Hard' mode and it seemed like another FPS 'Normal' level.  That's the point of the game, it's supposed to be fun, not necessarily complicated or grueling.The first two-thirds of this game are really excellently done.  The eight available weapons (introduced slowly over the course of the game), especially The Leash, feel different enough from little tweaks here and there, and the variety of enemies (some fast, some charge, some stay back, etc.) really hooked me in using the full assortment of firepower available.  Pulling a pilot out of a helicopter instead of just shooting it down feels more bad-ass.  Guiding a sniper rifle bullet into an enemy's head is always enjoyable.  Kicking enemies into solid objects, with stuff splattering everywhere is always gratifying.  Adding to Gray's swashbuckling bravado, there are bottles of alcohol hidden, and if he takes a swig, the screen turns to double (or triple)-vision and the walking controls don't work as expected.  Being inebriated and dispatching of bad guys adds even more skill points.The gameplay is broken up once or twice an Act, with more scripted sequences such as rail-shooting, or eliminating waves of enemies, but is the action is unfortunately quite linear.  The pathways are all marked by invisible walls, so there is not much exploring, and if you're hunting collectibles, new checkpoints usually close previous areas.  My favorite part of the game was when I got to control a Godzilla-type creature, causing havoc with each step and shooting fire out of it's mouth at helpless thugs.The slight problem I had with Bulletstorm is that about two-thirds through I had pretty much discovered all of the skillshots I was going to discover (I think I ended up in the low 90's out of 131).  I began to rely mostly on the same few weapons (as you can really only equip two, as the basic machine gun always has to be equipped) and the same handful of skillshots.  Towards the end, I also didn't really use The Leash all that much in combat.  The enemies grew a bit stale as after a certain point, there was not much novelty.  I also thought that an online co-op mode was greatly missing, as my CPU controlled partners were never that much help.In addition to the story mode, there are a couple of extra experiences to be had.  First, are the Echoes, which are bite-sized pieces of the single player campaign in which the goal is to score as many points as possible using different skillshots.  The Echoes are timed, which factor into the score, but are a great way to try out different techniques with different weapons.  They are graded from zero to three stars depending on your score.As for online multiplayer, there is what's called Anarchy mode, which up to four players competing together to eliminate up to 20 waves of baddies, some with bosses and mini-bosses, culminating in the Blood Symphony skillshot, if you're lucky.  Initially, I was saddened by the lack of online competitive multiplayer, but the more I thought about it, I really would not want to be humiliated by some of the skillshots, via human opponents.  There have also been 2 DLC packs since launch, which bring more multiplayer maps, Echoes, and Leash colors.GraphicsThe graphics in Bulletstorm are definitely a selling point.  Bright colors mixed with the decayed steel of the city landscape really gave it a look of it's own.  The field of vision when Gray is running or sliding really puts you in the action and make the game more engaging.  The enemies are detailed, and amply filled with blood, guts, puss, etc. to make their demise a sight to behold.SoundBulletstorm proudly uses just about every curse word in the English language, but only occasionally does it feel like too much.  Sometimes a couple of curse words are put together in ways I had not heard before.  The soundtrack is appropriate ranging from heavy metal guitar riffs when you die to sweeping orchestral melodies that set the stage for the upcoming action.  The voice acting is top-notch as well, as the actors must have been cracking up at some of the lines they had to say.Replay ValueFor under $40, you get quite a bit with Bulletstorm.  The campaign should last 10-12 hours on the hardest mode then throw in the Echoes and co-op multiplayer, and you have yourself something worthy of your gaming dollar.  You probably won't go back and play the campaign again, but trying to get three stars on all of the Echoes is quite challenging.Don't go into Bulletstorm hoping for a Mass Effect story or even a Call of Duty shooter, as you'll be disappointed.  I went in with an open mind and got something that had been done before, yet fresh and exciting at the same time.  Skillshots are extremely humorous and simultaneously gratifying, and a twisted, adult sense of humor kept me amused throughout.  The game is crass, vulgar, graphically violent, and way over the top, but I smiled or laughed quite a bit and enjoyed it immensely.Score: 8.75","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2011"}

After playing Gears of War 1 I dont think they could have really beat it by a sequel. There are many great ideas and cool features about this game. The single player is just excellent no complaints there. The multiplayer is almost garbage. There are so many of my friends who I used to play the first gears with who either just dont play gears 2 and have sold it or who just play gears one now. Epic games has really messed up this sequel. There are a lot issues with the multiplayer aspect. The main problem is with the match making. Even after the most recent patch match making still takes very long in public matches. Public matches also match make you with people who are very far away from you in some other continent. Even when it does match make you with someone in the same country as you there seems to be so much lag because of the lack of dedicated servers. Epic games should have released a beta demo so they could test everything out. Instead the released the game and made us the beta testers. I am very disappointed in epic games. I am also seriously considering selling my gears 2 copy if things dont improve within the next few months. On top of that epic games went ahead and released more dlc for gears 2 when the game isnt even  fixed yet. How can we play and pay for more maps when you havent even fixed the basic game?? A lot of features and ideas of gears 2 seem to look very similiar to call of duty 4 and halo 3. Gears of war 2 also seems very complicated when compared to other games and also gears of war 1. Epic games doesnt seem to really care about its customers as they continue release more dlc and not release any patches. Which other game do you know that a huge percentage of people still play the previous version? Also there were a lot of problems with the first gears which everyone was hopping they would fix but they never fixed them in the second gears. The host advantage is still there in the second gears just not as much as the first. They could have made it like halo 3 or call of duty 4 so that there is no host advantage. Also in the first gears when you boot some one they are still able to come back to the game so you have to keep on booting them until they stop this was not fixed in the second gears. And last my biggest beef about both gears glitching there are so many glitches and worst of all people can still do them in public and ranked matches. Mainly the chainsaw glitches, going off the map glitches and the sheild glitch. Epic games has really got their work cut out for them if they want to make people start playing gears of war 2 again.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2008"}

W. Mullins","summary":"Great but it could be better","reviewText":"I loved Dragon Age Origin and looked forward to this expansion, though I waited some time to actually buy it. What I found is a great expansion, but one not as polished or with the wonderful character development of the first. Also considering the price for what is about 15 hours or so of extra game play it seemed kind of expensive to me. That said I very much enjoyed it.You have to have Dragon Age Origin to play this game, so it is an expansion, not a stand alone game. So the gameplay is of course very similar. Origin was fantastic when it came to gameplay already and Awakening is slightly polished in some areas. Combat seemed better scaled and much more enjoyable this time around. The managed to strike a decent balance of keeping it challenging while letting you use a character that starts out very powerful. You have the ability to port your character from the first game or start a new one (A very good thing Bioware did was include a book in game that allows you to totally relevel your character and/or NPCs of your party). There are several small parts from the first game that play into some dialogue in Awakening, but it does not have nearly the impact I wished it had. If you have played through any of the DLC for Origins you are also opening a can of worms when it comes to glitches in Awakening with an important character. I had no issues with anything 'game breaking' but there was some annoying glitches at time, more so with certain quests and equipment.The story is very good, almost better than the first, though not as epic feeling. But the characters are not nearly developed as Origins and I felt very little attachment to any of them. That is a big deal considering how important NPC development, romance and the like was in Origins.The new equipment, enemies, spells and abilities are all very good and very fun. That said I didn't feel like I had to have or use any of them. I think I could have played through the entire expansion with just original equipment from Origins and not had too much trouble.If you loved Origins and have been putting off picking this up I'd recommend it. If you played through it and thought it was okay, you'd be paying almost the price of a new game for as expansions that could be called 'just more of the same'. Since I enjoyed Origins so much I am quite happy with just more of the same. I am also glad to see support for the game after it has been released and while there are still a number of glitches Bioware has released several patches which has helped clean it up slightly.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2010"}

All I have to say is that this game has way of a storyline than the first Ultimate Ninja Storm.  This time, you can actually feel like you're in the Shippuuden story instead of going on countless missions and have somewhat of a fight in Ultimate Ninja Storm.  I would have to say that I liked it as much as when I purchased Ultimate Ninja because those had storylines attached to them.  In over all characters, there's 40 with incredible jutsu and awesome graphics that can only come from the PS3 and of course X-box.  Then there are the epic boss battles.  I would have to say my favorite boss battle in both the series and game is when you go against Sasori, and the 3rd Kazekage and THEN his hundreds of puppets.  The game also lets you go to a guy in the Hokages office and let you relive the boss battles again if you want.  You just got to catch him in time.  The last thing I want to talk about is the online play.  When I first went on it, I was so excited to play with people online instead of playing the COM...which we all know gets pretty boring if you know how to play the game.  You can rank up and the more you fight people, rank up, win and lose battles, you can become more than a Beginner player, a Genine.

{"product_name":"B000069BD9","description":"Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliancebrings theMortal Kombatseries a new 3-D fighting engine, adds tons of features and extras, and still offers up classic gameplay.This installment features a 3-D battle system that still manages to maintain a 2-D feel. For example, pushing up on your controller makes you sidestep your opponent&#x92;s attacks, yet also allows you to jump in the air by tapping up plus a direction. A revamped fighting system offers up three different styles for each fighter (one includes a weapon technique). The multiple styles provide countless varieties of attacks for any given fighter. Different combinations of punches and kicks can be combined for very lengthy and powerful chain attacks similar to those in theMortal Kombatof old. Fatalities are also back and rich in graphic representation.New fighters join the cast of old favorites such as Sonya, Kano, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Kung Lao, Kitana, Quan Chi, Reptile, and Shang Tsung. The lavish environments surround your fighters with animated backgrounds and rich skylines. On some levels there are even breakable objects and hazards that you can interact with, such as pools of acid--the perfect landing place for a thrown opponent.In addition to regular modes of gameplay (arcade, versus, etc.), there is an option called Konquest mode. This mode allows you to learn more about fighting styles, read up on each character&#x92;s personal history, and gain Koins. The koins can then be spent in the Krypt, allowing you to unlock a host of new characters, costumes, and early concept drawings. The plentiful additional content offered with this title includes special movies ofThe Making ofDeadly Alliance andThe History ofMortal Kombat.Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliancesuccessfully reinvents the series by offering up a unique mix of improved graphics and stylized gameplay without compromising any of the features that made theMKseries popular over the years.--Carlos RodelaProsComplex gameplayRealistic 3-D graphicsHundreds of unlockable featuresConsWeak storylineUnbalanced combo system","reviewerName":"Katie \"Dark Musashi\"","summary":"I Love MK!!!","reviewText":"I am a veteran of the original Mortal Kombat for SNES, and didn't play any of the other games until this one came out. The great thing is, they didn't change it too much and the graphics are awesome. I don't like how Liu Kang is dead, but there are still a lot of good characters. You can now use weapons, which appropriately increase your offense but decrease your defense. Some characters can use their weapons to impale their opponent, which is irreversible and makes the other character's health decline slowly until the end of the match. Besides the weapons there are two other martial arts styles per character. This is useful for combos and enemies you would normally be weak against. The fatalities are AWESOME!!! They even added a humorous character who vomits as a special move and farts to regain health.

Fistful of Boomstick is definitely better than the horrible Hail to the King. It still doesn't stack up to the likes of BloodRayne or Devil May Cry. First off, the graphics aren't terribly great, but decent. CG is pretty good, though and Bruce Campbell( AKA \"Ash\" ) is the only detailed character on the game. Sound is great with the afforementioned Bruce Campbell lending his voice and his one-liners are hilarious as always, but music is barely adequate. Controls handle pretty well and there's no denying the sweet, sweet pleasure of chainsawing a Deadite and tossing a stick of dynamite in its mouth. Yes, FOB does give you such sequences of fun things like that, but also has parts of boredom as you wander around pretty generic levels( all levels consist of the same town, just different eras ). Now if you're a Evil Dead fan, you'll probably like it. I enjoyed it despite it flaws. But if you're looking for another DMC or BloodRayne, wait for their sequels or in DMC's case, wait for its prequel. I'm giving it a 3 out of 5.

I will admit that it doesn't hold up to Silent Hill 2 and isn't quite as scary as Silent hill 1... but I think the game is about as good as the third instalment. The story starts off really weak, with only the \"trapped in the apartment\" gimick to keep you going. As you get further, thigs pick up pace, and as your apartment starts to deteriorate and becomes haunted, things get far more frightening. In fact, everything up to the point where the apartment gets haunted is pretty lame (and considering there is a possibility that some people will never have a haunted apartment due to choices made in the game, it is possible your first play-through could be a little lack-luster to say the least). Combat is decent, and the story is good, when it does pick up pace. The monsters are well thought out and creepy, but due to brighter game areas, and a focus on fighting monsters rather than running, they are no where near as heart stopping as the creatures of past instalments. It is, despite a few changes, just more of the same in the Silent Hill franchise, which is a shame, As Resident Evil is off reinventing the concept of survival horror games, Konami is giving us a graphical up-date to a game that was released 8 years ago. It isn't bad, by any means, but Silent Hill 4 just doesn't quite live up to the legacy that the original built and the second and third instalments solidified. It is worth purchasing, for sure, but only for less than 30 dollars, in my opinion.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2004"}

You get three games in the Half-Life 2 series, an online multi-player game, and an incredibly innovative puzzle/adventure game, for a total of *five* games at a bargain price. This is a VERY attractive deal given that most new games go for around sixty clams these days.*Half-Life 2 and its two Episodes are chock full o' good, old fashioned first-person-shooter action. No, the graphics aren't the greatest and the story elements are a little on the light side (although anybody who plays Metal Gear Solid 4 before starting H-L probably will be looking for something with minimal cut scenes, plot, and character interactions!) but overall, they are all solid FPS games. Valve truly is a quality game developer. Nothing feels unfinished or poorly designed in any of the games in The Orange Box.*The highlight of The Orange Box is Portal. I'm usually not much of a puzzle gamer but I was quickly sucked in by Portal. All the superlatives you've heard about Portal are true; it really is incredibly innovative, witty, immersive, challenging, and, most important, fun.Bottom line: if it was possible to do so, I would give The Orange Box 4.5 stars because there are a few minor glitches in the software port, done by Electronic Arts, to PS3. Sometimes the frame rate slows way down, sometimes the controls do something odd (like shooting even though you didn't hit the trigger button), and there are frequent pauses for data loading. These are all minor issues, though, and do little to detract from the overall awesomeness of The Orange Box. So, I'm rounding my rating up to 5 stars, due to the extremely favorable fun/price ratio and for the inclusion of Portal.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2009"}

In the course of the first tale, Max loses his family, his job, and his self-respect.  Now, in this episode, Payne confronts his own ghosts as he gets caught up in a gang conflict, crooked cops, and a hard fall for the woman who helped ruin his life.The game unfolds using short cut-scenes and comic book style illustrations to provide the narrative.  From a purely artistic viewpoint, the game deserves high grades.  The settings are highly detailed, including a grotesque funhouse and a Washington manor house among other settings.  Levels are maze-like and sometimes the clues are subtle.  Not so subtle is the script, which has a style somewhere between Mickey Spillane and a sledgehammer.  Payne's narration is bitter, full of the knowledge that everything must die.The initial reception of this game was only slightly less than ecstatic.  I'm not normally a fan of pure shooters, but I decided that this one was one to try out.  What I discovered is that the PS2 implementation (I can't speak for the PC or Xbox versions) left a lot to be desired.  Control over the characters is quirky at best.  The player has no useful control over Payne's jumping ability - getting Payne to jump out a window to a small ledge just below it results in a low of reloading and cursing.  Turns are extremely slow, resulting in all kinds of maneuvers to avoid having to turn when in a full battle.The end result is that the game failed to capture my full attention - there never came that magic moment when I lost consciousness of the controller.  It was the enemy, not the geek trying to unload an AK-47 at me.  I just finished playing Prince of Persia, so I was acutely aware of what a game could do, and The Fall of Max Payne simply fell too short of the target.  Hopefully, this is the result of a poor port of the game from the PC version.

If I had to compare it to other games it would be Hellgate London, or maybe Stalker though I've never played that Multiplayer and am not sure if it even has the capability.One thing that stands out with Borderlands is that the game is never boring, never tedious, never a grind. You collect quests, then it kicks straight into FPS mode as you fight your way through area's or instances to the objectives. The balance is very well done and the area's feel dangerous requiring to really think your way through a fight until you outlevel the area. While the AI isn't the smartest I've seen they make up for it by sheer number and the environment you encounter them in. Sitting back in sniper mode isn't always the best solution to a battle and while it does work, I've found repositioning to take advantage of cover and a maps various explosives to be both more rewarding and often quicker than the headshot approach.Graphics, sounds and animations are all done very well. You will get a little bored of seeing the same wastelands after a few hours of play, and a larger variety of enemy types would be great (note: they already have one downloadable expansion pack that adds new stuff). There are a huge variety of weapons, most of them going directly to vendors to purchase ammo. Anything purchased from a vendor other than ammo is a waste of money, as you'll certainly find better as soon as you buy it. As a result all the various vending machines you'll find scattered throughout zones are more to offload what you pickup vice actually buy anything from. And money begins to hold little value. I've several mid level characters approaching the million dollar point even after buying some of the vendor trash for my friends when we team together. As bag space is extremely limited at first, you'll be visiting vending machines very often and spending alot of time just trying to compare equipment and looking at the games UI.While single player is fun, multiplayer kicks things up a notch when your with some friends and have vent or other voice comms. You can connect upto 4, and the more players you have the more enemy spawn. Enemies become much tougher and drop better loot. Loot you can take back with you in your single player game. So there's real advantage to working with others as you progress through the game, and I think game developers should start doing the single/multi player experience as Borderlands has it.I hope this game does extremely well, it's really fills a void and I see it having unlimited expansion potential. Only time will tell, but Borderlands is one of the top games of the year in my book.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2009"}

I have played online on Xbox live and PSN  at my brother in laws house before and I am just not that into it. I know I'm crazy, but I just am not that interested in team deathmatches and downloading a bunch of extra content. I am simple and really just enjoy playing single player campaigns. If you are like me, than this is the console for you. It has everything you need to just play games (except an HD cable, but I had an HDMI already) . For $200 bucks this is just awesome. It comes with a 256mb memory unit which has plenty of room to save game progress and achievements and so forth. I've got 6 saved games and I have 196 mbs left.  If you want to upgrade to a hard drive later, you can. You can find a 20 gig for about $40. So if you just want to play 360 games and have a blast, don't  spend more than you have to, like I said, it's completely upgradeable. I own a PS3 and I use my 360 more for gaming now.

{"product_name":"B00005QDPZ","description":"Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron IIfeatures some of the  best graphics ever seen on a home console, and it is a proper, old-fashioned,Star Warsgame. If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube. The only flaw is that the missions are  needlessly short, but there's plenty of replayability, and by gosh there's those  graphics.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"C.

Play it right now.","reviewText":"God bless Square Enix. Where would nerds be without them? Final Fantasy IX is the best example of the JRPG genre yet made, a game that most everyone can enjoy. If one were to distill the essence of all those 90's RPGs into a single game and ratchet the quality as high as it could possibly go, this is what it would look like.Final Fantasy IX follows the exploits of Zidane, a dude with a tail, as he and his partners in the travelling theater group Tantalus decide to kidnap the princess of the kingdom of Alexandria. A young black mage named Vivi gets involved as well, as does the princess' obsessive bodyguard, Steiner.This simple plot description should begin to show you how Final Fantasy IX sets itself apart from other JRPGs while using the building blocks of the genre. Obviously, a kidnapped princess with an obsessive bodyguard is a trope familiar to anyone who has played an SNES-era RPG, but a travelling theater group? Another twist on the formula occurs when Princess Garnet requests to be kidnapped once she learns of the plan against her.Throughout the game, many twists on these formulas culminate to create a product that's strangely familiar, yet completely new. Final Fantasy IX has a great villain, as well, contrasting Final Fantasy VIII's disappointing Ultimecia. Other twists on famous fantasy tropes exist too- two of the major characters, both knights, are female this time around, when most are male. The game offers a considerable challenge, too, though it doesn't mirror the frustrating difficulty of the pre-Playstation era of the series.The game's ability system strikes a pretty good balance between customization and individuality as well. Final Fantasy IX features an \"ability\" system in which party members are taught abilities through their equipment. Since only certain characters can equip certain equipment, it leads to a diversity of abilities split between the diverse cast of characters. The system itself doesn't have any major problems; it works intuitively and helps to specialize the characters. In addition, the party can have 4 characters in it instead of 3. The more I play modern RPGs, the more I wish another one would attempt to up that number again.If the game has a major flaw, and I think it does, it's that of the eight playable characters, there is an obvious party of four that the game seems to want you to play with. While the game doesn't force you into playing with these characters after a certain point, deviating from the obvious choices makes the game unnecessarily difficult, and doesn't exactly \"work.\" A little more balance amongst the characters could have gone a long way.Since the four characters I'm referring to are so balanced as a party, you'll be playing through most of the game with them. This, for me, is far from a deal-breaker. Final Fantasy IX was a tribute to yesteryear ten years ago when it came out, and now it simply remains as one of the Playstation's best games. Since it can now be downloaded for $10 on the PSN, it's also one of the best games for the PSP. Anyone who has ever loved a JRPG owes it to themselves to play Final Fantasy IX.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2011"}

As a tradition when placing a new game into any console for the first time, I refrain from touching any buttons, making sure to watch any intro movies first. Kinda like the initial sip from a bowl of soup before you tackle the guts of it. Anyhow, after the ooo-ing and aaaa-ing at the intro movie; with a giant grin on my face I finally pressed start. That's where everything pretty much turned to a steaming pile of minke whale crap and my excitement turned to bitter, bitter, frustration. Amidst the graphical glitches, broken camera view points and horrible, horrible voice acting (tails' IQ seems to be dropping as his voice gets dopier with each passing game), the game just lacked any excitement. My enthusiasm died pretty much at the shoe mission at the very start. Dear lord I can only hope that the next one is better than this waste of a blue-ray disc.

{"product_name":"B0050SXU3Q","description":"","reviewerName":"Genryu","summary":"My first-time in the Sly Cooper franchise and it was pretty fun","reviewText":"I'm probably not exactly in the target age-group for this game, since it seems oriented towards a younger audience, but I thought it'd be a fun game to play with my younger cousin and to test out cross-play functionality firsthand. Sly cooper and his merry band of friends are all pretty fun and have the tongue and cheek humor that kid's games are known for, though there are still some jokes that any age-group can enjoy for its own sake. They have a brief backstory video to get you caught-up on the franchise, which I really appreciated. The basic gist of the game as you can probably guess from the title is to help Sly and his team pull of various heists through different points in time as you try to uncover who's trying to change the Sly Cooper history. The fun part is that you get to use different country and time-period specific Sly Cooper ancestors that keeps things fresh.All of the characters you get to play as each control very differently, letting you play around and truly work as a team to pull off the various heists in the game. It's not a particularly tough game, but some of the puzzles and traps are still fun to pull off even for an experienced gamer. It's got a certain simple charm to it that resonated with me and put a smile on my face at many points. This isn't exactly a game-of-the-year contender so don't expect to be blown away going in. The story, while interesting, isn't really special. I do love the animated graphics though for this title, and I think they are very well produced on both the PS3 and the PS Vita versions. Last of Us this isn't, but it's one of the better animated cartoon looks I've seen in a game. The cross-play functionality works exactly as intended, and I'm able to pick up where I stopped before. I just wish Sony implements a better way to do the cross-buy feature, since it was a bit annoying involving me hooking up my PS Vita to my PS3 to transfer the game over for the first installation. After that it was easy.All in all, if you're looking for a fun title to play on the go with your vita and at home on the ps3, Sly Cooper gets my recommendation. It's great for kids and for all ages, but it's likely going to be a bigger hit with the younger age demographic given the nature and tone of the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2013"}

Imagine that Bethesda had a certain set of tools with which to create their amazing and inspired revamping of the FALLOUT series,Fallout 3; and then imagine that they handed that exact set of tools to Obsidian Entertainment (a company composed of people who created the series in the first place) before telling them to \"Run with it.\"What you get, then, is another Fallout game that has both the same look and feel of FALLOUT 3, but definitely has a new, rejuvenated spirit behind it. You don't get anything drastically innovative in terms of the formula, but you do get the same game from a very different angle, just like what VICE CITY and SAN ANDREAS were to GRAND THEFT AUTO 3.Welcome to New Vegas.THE GOOD:-THE STORY: FALLOUT 3 had you searching for your father in the Capital Wasteland, where you slowly discovered what he was up to, and what your role in his plans would eventually be. NEW VEGAS has you shot in the head and left for dead in the Mojave town of Goodsprings, where you come to with the aim of getting revenge (if that's your thing). What I loved was how the premise seemed so simple in the beginning, but gets progressively less than such as you traverse the Wasteland. You soon find that that shot to your head was probably one of the luckiest events in your life.-THE WORLD: I wasn't sure how New Vegas would stack up when compared to the Capital Wasteland. Just based on what I know of Nevada: the place is pretty much a desert all the way around. Didn't think that would translate well into a good place to explore, but Obsidian proved me wrong. What you get is the Mojave Wasteland, where there aren't ruins of skyscrapers everywhere, but there is a very tight-knit web of communities, all of which depend on New Vegas to exist.I loved the western feel that everything had, from the music down to the '50s Lone Ranger-esque advertisements all over the place. More importantly, the developers got the feel of what the real Las Vegas is today dang near perfect, even going so far as to get Mister Las Vegas to play the role of the game's \"Three Dog\" radio announcer, Mister New Vegas.Everything is about the dollar signs, and every indulgence that will bring in the greatest amount of it. You really get a sense of that just walking down the Strip. And there's just something great about seeing that lighted tower of a casino from just about anywhere in the world.-FACTIONS: This is one of the few changes that has been made in this sequel. You have the option of appeasing nearly every town and every gang that have made the Mojave their home. Doing bad stuff will get you snubbed, helping them out will make you one of them, allowing you some store discounts and pleasant conversation. It really helps the illusion that your decisions really have an impact on the world. It's the little things.-EVERYTHING: You could make the argument that this is FALLOUT 3 (2.0), and I wouldn't do much to argue with that. But FALLOUT: NEW VEGAS is a game that can stand all on its own, with just as much substance, replay value, and creativity as its predecessor. There are new items, new sidequests, and a whole bunch of places to explore. The writing is improved, as is the voice acting, there is some great humor laced throughout, and the lore of the Mojave Wasteland is insanely detailed.On this end, I would make the argument that when comparing FALLOUT 3 to NEW VEGAS (vanilla to vanilla), NEW VEGAS is the better game. The improvements are slight, but it makes all the difference.THE BAD:-THE GAMEBRYO ENGINE: This is one of the only major flaws I can think of with this game. I remember when I first played OBLIVION, and all was right with the world. This engine packed a major punch when it was fully utilized; it allows for a massive world to explore from end to end without loading screens (except if you go into a house or something), a ton of lootable items, and just a great RPG experience all around.But Gamebryo is starting to show its age four years later. It's still more than capable of some amazing things, but that doesn't mean it's not time for an update.  I mean, if Obsidian or Bethesda threw out another ELDER SCROLLS or FALLOUT game of the exact same quality, I wouldn't complain much - but I would just a little. I think the engine is about due for an overhaul.-THE BUGS: Obsidian and Bethesda are a match made in heaven. Both put out some amazing RPGs, and both have a tendency of releasing them with bugs and glitches EVERYWHERE! While I didn't run into any game-breaking glitches like others have, I did run into my fair share of tiny ones. The quest tracker would sometimes send me across the Wasteland, only to randomly turn me back around and send me the other way. People would levitate. My character would randomly throw his hands up into the air.The best one came after I left Helios One (I think that's the name) and suddenly a junkyard owner and her three dogs spawned in the same spot in front of me, even though I know for a fact they should have been miles and miles away. It was just a convulsing jumble of dogs and an old woman. It was hilarious, but still a very noticeable glitch...of course.-THE MUSIC: I did a little research, and the soundtrack (the old time music, not Inon Zur's wonderful score) is very extensive. But the only song I kept hearing was \"Big Iron.\" I felt like the game wasn't randomizing the songs enough; I'm fairly certain I've only been able to hear a few off of that long list of great songs.-THIS IS THE END: I saw it coming, but still. I don't like it when a massive RPG like this just ends. I like to keep going so I can finish sidequests and explore. The BROKEN STEEL expansion fixed this with FALLOUT 3, and I'm hoping Obsidian does the same here. I want to keep playing!TO SUM IT ALL UP:Obsidian really knocked it out of the park with this one. I can safely say this the best game they've made sinceStar Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, and will probably go down in my mind as THE best. It's the FALLOUT 3 experience that you loved, and it's back with a few new upgrades that definitely justify its purchase. This was FALLOUT as it was meant to be: made by the people who created this world in the first place. They have a firm grasp on what makes this world unique, and it shows.Basically, if you loved FALLOUT 3 like I did, I bet you'll definitely love this game, too.I hope that this isn't the last time Obsidian Entertainment get to contribute to the series, because between them and Bethesda, the games couldn't be in better hands.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2010"}

Burns \"Slackjaw\"","summary":"A great game until it freezes on you 7-8 times","reviewText":"I love the Fallout Series. I own 1,2,3, tactics as well as NV. It is hard for me to knock down a game that I love so much. I beat Fallout 3 multiple times. This game is just like Fallout 3 and this is not a bad thing. It adds some plot elements that the previous titles haven't. The status of your standing in multiple cities is fantastic. You will feel that you must carefully decide what to do as it will impact some other clan or gang in the desert.It also adds some melee attack improvement (including  VATS). The characters are not overwhelmingly interesting. There will still be a few you will like but overall there is a bit less character development in this game. That's not why I deducted points however. The game is great, especially if you liked Fallout 3 or it's expansions.My gripe is with the glitching and freezing that has plagued my time in New Vegas.I should say that I own 3 different Xbox 360s though I use only 2. (I also have a PS3 and the WII)I have the Elite, as well as the 250gb slim and even an old first generation that I have used for parts but still hold the 40gb harddrive. IF there is a difference I should state that I'm playing it on the Slim. Sometimes on the Elite. Both have had these issues. Below are some of my findings...Enemies stuck in rocks that you can't kill but that can shoot you!You getting stuck in a rock formation and not being able to get out.The game has frozen during play at least 4 times (about 1/4 plays) I do save often and that has helped me NOT have to retrace every step all over but ....A game that I pay retail on with the pedegree of Fallout should not be so glitchy! I have yet to see any patch come out to remedy this and it ruins some of the experience. As I've seen others write on this I felt the need to add my opinion as that will hopefully be heard by the developer. DON'T ruin a good thing by not taking the time to quality control a game like this. I think it would have gotten much higher praise if this were not the case. But it is. So be very wary.Thanks for listening","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2010"}

I really wish I could talk more about how fun this game is, but I haven't managed to get more than twenty minutes at a time before it crashes on me.  After about 5 attempts, I have managed to complete the second chapter of the main quest.  Save, crash, open box, crash, walk, crash.  Anything you do, crash.New Vegas is built on the same engine Fallout 3 was built on, which is the same engine Oblivion was built on, yet it crashes more than both combined.  Turns out Bethesda had little to do with this one, this beast is all Obsidian.  Recall, Obsidian gave us the unplayable day one patch game of Knights of the Old Republic and Neverwinter Nights 2.  Bethesda decided that Fallout 4 was more important and threw this trash to someone else.From what I have seen so far, this is the same game as 3, but less interesting.  Looks the same, lots of brown and gray.  Sounds the same and crashes more.If you feel the need to shell out full price for another Fallout DLC, then go for it.  I would say wait a while for a patch to make this mess playable.  I will certainly never click it again until it gets fixed.  For how bad this game runs, I would guess that it was never even tested.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0016PZYLS","reviewerName":"Jason Bean","summary":"Stupid but fun experience......","reviewText":"I must say, before this game came out I was really getting sick of these \"serious\" game titles like GTA4 and MGS4. I thought both had great gameplay mechanics but I felt like they were trying to beat me over the head with \"morality\" and trying to make you feel bad for doing immoral things.Thanks to Saints Row 2 we finally have a title that doesn't take ANYTHING seriously (least of all itself ;) ). The humor is VERY juvenile and the story requires no thought what so ever (though it is very stylish and well-voice acted). But I think this is a good thing. You don't HAVE to feel bad about mowing over civilians and casualties in gunfights. You can just jump right in and have FUN.The customization is awesome as well. The different clothing options are insane (and FAR more diverse than the overrated GTA4) as is your ability to customize (and keep) almost ANY vehicle to your liking. Also, you quite literally unlock differentclothes/vehicles/fighting styles/weapons for just PLAYING the game. I can't think of any other videogame that does thatThe only bad thing I can say about Saint's Row 2 is that it can be taken as VERY offensive in it's portrayal of different ethnic groups. I realize that it's making fun of EVERYTHING it possibly can but be warned if you're easily offended by stereotypes.In any case Saint's Row 2 is a game that gives players of sandbox titles exactly what they want: Fun without consequences :)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2008"}

We've all done our fair share of complaining about it. However this should be enough storage for me for a while. As for the long haul? Maybe. If you don't buy a lot of downloadable games this card should be all you will ever need. I on the other hand, intend on catching up on all those PSP games I never played because I never had a PSP, so I'll be filling this card sooner than most, I would imagine. Hopefully by the time I need another card, the prices will have come down significantly and perhaps even bigger cards (64GB-128GB). As for now if you plan on buying a lot of downloadable games, bite the bullet, because this is the only viable option.EDIT: As of right now there is absolutely no reason for there to ever be a bigger memory card for PSVita. Once you fill up all of the homescreens you can't put anything else on the Vita. 100 games and apps is the limit, and it's very short sighted on Sony's behalf.

But although it comes in a small package, this is a full-fledged game that stands on its own. With an all-new, deep story that approaches the familiar sights and sounds of the infamous Liberty City from a different perspective, an innovative control system and multiplayer options,Chinatown Warscaptures the tone and flavors of the long-runningGTAseries in unique ways that both longtime players and those coming to it for the first time will find hard to put down..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Grand Theft Auto:Chinatown WarsPlayers:Offline: 1; Online: 2Gameplay Modes:Single player; competitive &amp; coop multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.Kick some tail as Huang Lee.View larger.Use the DS stylus like never before.View larger.Reconquer Liberty via PDA.View larger.The Story: Left for Dead in the Worst Place in AmericaFollowing his father&rsquo;s murder, Huang Lee is given what seems a simple mission: to deliver an ancient sword to his Uncle Kenny to ensure his family retains control of the Triad gangs of Liberty City. Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme inChinatown Warsutilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons.Key Game Features:The Largest DS Game Ever- Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.Endless Gameplay- Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.Street Economics- Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.Play with Friends- Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.Bragging Rights- Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.PDA Interface- Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.Online Bragging Rights and MultiplayerCare has been taken to ensure that players can share theirChinatown Warsexperiences with friends and fellow players in different ways.

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth.

It's awkward in places, imperfect in others. Fragments of the legendary Disney magic peek out of corners here and there, met on occasion by pieces of the famed Final Fantasy atmosphere. The big names are there, the storyline is necessarily epic, even the voice acting is spot-on. This is one of the most beautiful games currently on the market, but there's something missing that's difficult to pinpoint. Perhaps it's a sense of motivation, as you'll often find yourself dropped into a confusing new area with no clue as to what's expected of you. Maybe it's sincerity, lost as you watch dozens of classic Disney tales blurred and distorted to accommodate the premise of a new storyline. It's really tough to say what it is, exactly, but the experience left me a bit let down in the end. I didn't feel as though I'd completed my work.Without question, this product is polished to a beautiful finish. Everything from the opening cinemas to the brilliant user interface to the visual style of the entire game is extremely well done. There's no questioning the fact that both Square and Disney pulled out their big guns for this one, and it goes an extremely long way towards erasing any and all fears that may have lingered for fans of either brand.This finely tuned attention to detail carries over to every graphical aspect of the game. Though the various worlds you'll visit in this one are much more cartoony and simplistic than the surroundings of, say Final Fantasy X, you'll find yourself just as easily dazzled as you were during your first few moments on the world of Tidus and Yuna. Bosses are legitimately intimidating, environments are detailed to the point of no return and non-playable characters are treated with just as much attention to detail as the central characters themselves. Visually, this is a masterwork. Worry not, that sweet tooth for eye candy you've developed will be satisfied by this one.The audio is almost equally impressive, and the voice acting in particular stands out as a triumphant effort with very few exceptions. They didn't actually get Danny DeVito, Gilbert Gottfried or Eddy Murphy to reprise their roles as bona fide Disney sidekicks in this one, but they still managed a very good impersonation. I was a little worried about the possibilities when I first heard that the eternally silent heroes Squall and Cloud would be given speaking parts, but it really worked out for the best in the end, as their voices perfectly matched their personalities in previous installments.Gameplay is exciting, despite a steep initial learning curve, and is handled well for the most part. Rather than controlling your entire party one at a time, as with the more traditional turn-based Final Fantasy games, you control Sora in a free-roaming live action environment. You're joined by two companions (generally Donald and Goofy), who are controlled by a mildly retarded artificial intelligence program. Through the use of a special menu on the pause screen, you can give suggestions to the A.I. to better serve the kind of offense you'd like to build, but in the end the final decision is completely up to them.One area that provides for endless hours of frustration is the camera's control. Rather than remaining directly behind Sora or using the right analog stick to provide a more user-friendly, customizable view, the screen swings wildly out of alignment with little or no notice, serving as an immediate point of confusion. When you've locked on to an enemy, the screen will vaguely follow that enemy's movements, even if that enemy leaps off the edge of the screen.I also have a small bone to pick with the control scheme itself. While it's relatively easy to move Sora around the field, attack a nearby enemy or leap into the air, performing secondary actions such as casting advanced magic or using an item in the heat of battle are unnecessarily difficult and frustrating. Your character is maneuvered around the field by using the left analog stick, however the D-Pad is used to change your actions from an attack to a magic spell to an item and back again. This means that, if you're badly injured in a fight, you must frantically run away, switch your grip on the controller so that you're using the left analog stick with your right thumb, decide on an action with the D-Pad, activate it by pressing the X button and then hope to god you don't get hit in the process of casting the spell or using the item (thus canceling the action and starting the process over again.)Despite its multiple flaws, this is still a very fun game to sit down and play. As you progress through the story, you'll start to pick up various skills and techniques, preventing the game from reverting into a straightforward hack-and-slasher. You're never forced to try out a new style of attack, but it's something just about everyone will find themselves doing unconsciously after a couple hours of play anyway.When you get down to it, Kingdom Hearts is about expectations, hype, anticipation and eventual disappointment. There were a few genuine moments when I was excited and happy with the end product, but for the most part I was mildly annoyed by the controls, frustrated by the cameras and let down by the end result. This is a story of what could have been, a few shining moments of legendary gameplay, a slightly vague yet entertaining storyline and an awkward association between Disney and Square's worlds. Above average, but not nearly to the level it could have reached.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2003"}

Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth.

That game is THIS monstrosity. I was at least able to find Sonic 06 to be a guilty pleasure of some sort, but THIS game is just BAD! There's a lot of questions raised that shouldn't even be here in the first place! Why does Shadow have to have weapons? Why do the characters curse all of a sudden? To make the game &#34;edgy&#34;? Give me a break! Arguably the worst offender in this is: Why do there have to be branching paths?Truth be told, I bought Shadow the Hedgehog (via FeaturePoints for Amazon gift cards....Didn't exactly use real money) just to play through its &#34;neutral&#34; pathway in the game, which only requires me to get to the end of each level, and nothing more. There was a bit of fun to be had (In fact, the gunplay isn't too shabby), but that fun was bombarded with tons of unnecessary things!The level design is bad. In the first level, Westopolis, don't be surprised if you run straight into several inexplicable explosions while just trying to get a move on. Other levels don't exactly have as much frustrations, but there are still general problems like not being able to get a good view of where to jump at certain points, and control that feels slipperier than in Sonic Heroes. Instances such as the Shadow clones to fight in one of the later levels, though, get very tedious. Playing through the game would really suck if you do not grab a gun to shoot with, because Shadow's Homing Attacks don't deal damage nearly as quick, and you can FORGET about his punch/kick attacks!If you thought the voice actors in Sonic Heroes were too cringing for you, then you're going to be absolutely ANNOYED with the new 4Kids/Sonic X voice cast's work done here! At nearly every turn in a level, a character Shadow meets earlier in the level feels the need to say something! And if you're not doing what he/she says you should do, the character will just complain or scold at you for not doing so. Leave me alone, NPCs! Either way, the voices here are AWFUL (With the lone exceptions being Sonic and Dr. Eggman)! Yes, I even disliked Shadow's new voice actor. He didn't even sound much like Shadow in the game!You'd think at least the music would be good right? Welll.......not really. Shadow the Hedgehog's soundtrack is mostly crappy, with few exceptions.If all of that wasn't bad enough, you apparently are not supposed to be happy with the ending you get after playing through the handful of levels you've chosen to play through. YEP! In one playthrough, you just have to play six levels, but for the sake of replayability, doing a Hero or Evil mission will lead you to different levels entirely, but each and every mission in this game (With exceptions being to just make it to the end of a level) is a boring, dull, painful chore. Most of them consist of nabbing excessive amounts of objects. I'll leave it at that.Oh, did I say &#34;for the sake of replayability&#34;? Oh I'm sorry. What I meant to say was &#34;for the sake of UNLOCKING THE FINAL STORY SEGMENT&#34;. Yeah....Like Sonic Adventures and Heroes, there's a Final Story segment. They really shouldn't have done that for this kind of game! It completely throws the whole premise out the window!Ugh.....I believe I've gone long enough here. Just stay away from this title if you're looking for an even decent Sonic title. Whether it be the Adventure titles, Heroes, or even recent ones like Sonic Colors, Generations, or Unleashed, they're ALL better than this game.

Garrelts","summary":"Better Than Expected - Online Issues Severely Over-hyped","reviewText":"I'll admit that I had no plans on buying or even playing Call of Duty: Black Ops. I only own the game because it was given to me as a Christmas present. The series has it's fans and it's detractors and seems to incite so much heated debate between the two groups. Personally my main reason for avoiding Black Ops was that I felt the series had grown stagnant and offered very little new experiences from game to game. To some extent the same can be said here. If you're reading this review and have never played a Call of Duty game, you'll be amazed by Black Ops. If you have played CoD before then be prepared to take a familiar journey, albeit still a quality one.Single-player Experience:Expect the single player campaign to last you about 7-10 hours depending on the skill of the player and the difficulty level. The storyline is all Call of Duty - a continent hoping affair that takes you from the jungles of Vietnam to the frozen tundra of Russia. The story places you in the roles of several characters but mainly as Alex Mason. The game is set during the Cold War/Vietnam War era of the 1960s. When you start the game Mason is strapped to a chair and is being interrogated by parties unknown. Each level in Black Ops is really a flashback that Mason is reliving.Personally I found the story to be a bit confusing. It's almost like the movie Inception at times - very complex and if you don't pay attention for a moment you'll miss out on a tidbit of important information. The confusion is enhanced with the chaotic graphical presentation of the cut-scenes. All that said the missions are generally very enjoyable and offer a fair bit of variety. True to form, Treyarch vary things up by including vehicle segments that are on a scale not seen before in a Call of Duty game. These are very fun segments that are a nice break from the standard run-and-gun gameplay.The graphics are a mixed bag. I had the chance to play Black Ops on a friends PC using nearly maxed settings and it's a sight to behold. Not Crysis but very, very crisp graphics. On the PS3 the graphics aren't so polished but still generally good. There are occasions where the game has some muddy/blurry graphics. Textures on vehicles for example are generally poor. We all know that given the right developer the PS3 can do much better. But this is a multi-platform game and it does show in comparison to some PS3 exclusives.Multi-player Experience:Let's face it, multi-player is why people buy Call of Duty games. It seems that each new iteration of CoD features the same 5-10 hour single player campaign and loads of attention to the multi-player. The same can be said here. New maps, new Perks, new Kill-streak rewards and new modifications. This time around the name of the game is customization. As you progress through the multi-player portion of Black Ops you'll unlock more and more ways to customize your character. Only instead of solely relying on rank based rewards, Black Ops uses and in-game currency to allow you to modify your character and weapons. It's a fantastic system that streamlines the gameplay greatly.So say for example you reach level 24 (Lieutenant) and finally unlock the AUG you've had you're eye on. In CoD's past you would have needed to unlock the weapons attachments by racking up kills. So if you wanted that ACOG scope you knew you needed to get a set number of kills. That system has been replaced. Now, once you unlock a weapon you have instant access to all of it's attachments as long as you can pay for them. A red-dot sight you say - $1000 credits and it's yours. No fussing with iron sights or any other attachments that you don't care for. The same system is in place that allows you to customize the camouflage pattern of your gun and even create your own emblems that are displayed prominently. It's a fun, efficient and addictive system.Sadly I haven't noticed any new online game modes besides the tried and true CoD favorites. Maps are thankfully very good and offer a nice variety of environments.Online Issues:Before I ever popped CoD into my PS3 my plans were almost derailed by the amount of complaints regarding the online stability of Black Ops. I'm happy to say that thus far I've found these reports to be greatly exaggerated. That's not to say that I don't believe what some folks are saying - just that I've experienced very few problems online myself with Black Ops. There are occasional disconnects and games where the host cannot be migrated but that has been a small percentage of the many, many rounds I've played online.One of my major complaints with the CoD series is the balancing issues that continue to plague the series. There are rounds where teams are simply not accurately balanced thus leading to very one-sided victories. It seems that given the stat tracking already built into the game it would be easy to implement a load balancing algorithm to more evenly split teams up.All in all, Black Ops is another quality entry in the dominant FPS genre. While the game doesn't offer much innovation it does offer very approachable gameplay, competent graphics and an addictive online mode. Good but certainly not great. Black Ops is worth checking out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2011"}

There's not much difference between the two games other than the fact that SCIII has more features and extras.  The graphics on the newer game is also slightly, not noticeably, superior to the older game. I admit buying Soul Calibur only upon learning that KOS-MOS from Xenosaga makes a cameo appearance in SC3.  You can use the Character Creation Mode in the third game to build a fighter that looks just like KOS-MOS. Eventually, I got addicted to Soul Calibur.Both are fun games.  Each offers you many characters to choose from.  SCIII even offers you the option of creating your own character.  Each of these characters have unique weapons and attack moves.  You can replay these games over and over, using different characters and you will never get tired.  The combination of characters, costumes, and weapons, make this a game that will have a long replay value.I rated Soul Calibur 2 higher than I did for Soul Calibur 3 simply because the battle AI in the older game is more consistent.  You will play just as well with your character no matter who your opponent is.  That doesn't mean that you will have the same challenge facing every enemy.  If you choose a short range character and fight a long range character, you will naturally have to work harder to deal damage.  However, unlike Soul Calibur 3, here you don't get the feeling that the AI is cheating on you and playing \"favorites\" with some characters like Seong-Mina or Talim.  With SC2, you don't get the feeling that the AI is holding you back.  In other words, if you get your rearend kicked, it meant that the enemy outplayed you and not because the AI put your character in slow motion.  I'm referring to single mode, when you play against the CPU.I highly recommend this game.  I am new to playing the Soul Calibur series.  I'm glad I gave this series a chance.  It's a very, very fun fighting game series from Namco.  I guarantee that you will spend countless hours in Practive Mode to learn the very complex character moves.  As for me, I spend so much time with these games, SC2 and SC3, that I have actually developed a callus on my left thumb from playing so much.  I get so worked up during battles that I tend to slam the left analog stick while entering my commands.  Rough on the controller and hard on your thumb.

However, it is wireless, extremely light, and has tilt sensors in it. This seems a great trade-off during gameplay.First, let's get through the \"bad\" that many people have gotten upset about. They took out the rumble controller from the PS3 controller. This was for legal reasons - a company which developed that rumble technology took issue with Sony using it. Some people feel it really affects gameplay not to have that rumbling.I have to admit that I am VERY happy, personally, that the rumbling is gone. I always turned off the rumble in games where I could. I am on my computer pretty much 24 hours a day, and if I play a game with rumble on, it *kills* my wrists.  If you're a rumble fan, this is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.Now, to the good parts of the controller. First, they all come wireless for the PS3. I *love* love wireless. Wires cause huge clutter in our living room, with all our systems and equipment. You only have to plug the controller in to power it up. It's a regular USB power-up so you can use your iPod's plug (assuming you have an iPod) or plug it into your computer or XBox 360 or anything else with a USB on it. That is to say, you don't have to power it up from your PS3 if you don't want to for some reason.Next, it is super light! I imagine this is because it doesn't have to hold the motors that cause rumbling. I really appreciate the lightness. You might not notice if you only play a game for an hour or two, but if you're doing marathon sessions of multiple hours, the weight of the controller really does begin to matter.Just like the Wii controllers, this controller has a tilt sensor in it. It actually knows when you tilt and turn the controller, or shake it. Depending on the game, you can use those tilts to look around or to shake off an enemy. That really gives you much more interactivity with the game, much more than button pushing.The general controller shape is exactly the same as the PS2 controller. You have a pair of shoulder buttons on each side, two joysticks, four buttons on the right and four directional buttons on the left. There's a PS button in the center, just like there's an XBox button in the middle of the Xbox 360 controller. Also, there are four lights on the unit, to let you know if this controller is #1, #2, #3 or #4 if you are playing multi-player games.The center PS button lets you turn the unit on and off, which is great if your console is off in a shelf or corner of the room.In general, I think they did a great job with the PS3 basic controllers.

{"product_name":"B001ASJISG","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Fantastic story, gorgeous environments, cruddy gameplay","reviewText":"I was a bit wary when I learned of the Princes recent foray into the use of magic. While the Sands of Time wasn't exactly grounded in reality, the previews I saw smelled more of deus ex machina magic rather than the nifty game function the Sands presented.The Prince, or whomever he is in this incarnation, encounters Princess Elika, priestess of Orgasmo. That's probably not the right name, but with how often she talks of fertility, it might as well be. After her father cuts down a glowing tree, freeing Arhiman, god of darkness and evil, Elika and the Prince have the heal the surrounding countryside to reimprison him. Along the way, they fight the Corrupted, lieutenants of Arhiman, named and cliched to a degree that'll make your eyes bleed at times.Several aspects of the game have improved over the Sands series. You can be as verbose or as tight lipped as you want, and there's almost more dialogue that's accessible in the first twenty minutes than there was in the first two hours of Prince of Persia. Wall running and climbing are nifty, and fun to watch, and the far jumps with the use of magic don't lose there charm. The powers you develop by collecting Sand-I mean Light Seeds, don't have much application in combat, and are used to access new environment areas, all of which are richly detailed and pleasing to the eye, even if you feel like an ant in a canyon or cave half the time. The contrast between healed and corrupted lands is also well played, and cuts one to the other in such a way it doesn't feel like your entering another stage, more like leaving a garden and entering a demonic hell.The problems thus far are solely with the gameplay, or rather lack thereof. Firstly, its difficulty is through the floor. Its impossible to die during simple travel, and the boss fights thus far have been simple in the extreme, a combination of button mashing and timing blocks and parries, with little of the free form or flow that they'd done with The Warrior Within. And while I'm not a fan of constant slugfests when there's story to be had, outside of a single NPC fight, I saw not one regular bad guy in maybe the first 2 hours of playing.All told, the game is gorgeous, engaging, and incredibly entertaining. The Prince has ditched the emo lifestyle, and is back to being the sarcastic smartass we all know and love, who presents that he has a lot more wisdom than he's letting on. Interactions are pleasant to watch and have a nice tension to them that keeps you wondering how the characters interaction will develop, and the overall story is peeled back like an onion, leaving you guessing as to whats really going on.DLO content update: These are the kinds of things that annoy me about the ability to produce downloadable content, as it seems to give developers the excuse to release a game, then what amounts to a patch under the guise of a regular games. The \"expansion\" amounts to a 5-6 hour lengthening of the original plot. They had the option of recreating based on feedback, but decided to close out the storyline with a cliffhanger that would've had better placement in the original game. The fact that they made people pay for this borders on the criminal, though I have to appluad their ability to get blood from this turnip.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2008"}

Now I'm not as die hard a follower of the Mechwarrior titles as some people and I've only played a few here and there including Mechcommander 2.  I think some people who were really into the PC version of this game will be slightly disappointed in a few things.  The control and views of the Mech are a little dumbed down for the users; I think this has more to do with controller limitations because there's no keyboard.  The second major difference is you can only use in game stock Mechs during the campaign.  You can't customize any of them unfortunately.  However, if you can get over these changes I think you will still have fun with the game.I felt like Mechassault had a bit more of a cogent story line than some of the other Mechwarrior titles.  In Mechassault you are playing the role of a member of the Wolf Dragoons and you've been commissioned to infiltrate a planet controlled by the Word of Blake.  For some reason I never felt like I had this precise of a purpose in Mechwarrior game before.  The campaign mode is pretty much a solo mission where you have to do everything on your own; unfortunately you don't get any help from another group of Dragoons, even though you hear about reports of them fighting in other parts of the planet.  The new stock Mech designs are actually pretty cool along with some old favorites and I did like using most of them.  The favorite Mech called the Atlas is available in this game as well, but I found myself using the Timberwolf a lot when I played this game through a second time.  Although, I think I favored the MadCat IV my first time through and I outright hate the Summoner.  You do get lots of Mechs to choose from so I'm sure any Mechwarrior can find their favored machine to use.  Unfortunately there are a couple missions where you are forced to fight with a specific Mech, this is alright because it's only for like two missions worth.The graphics and environment are quite awesome.  The graphics are pretty comparable to the Mechwarrior IV game for the PC.  While I have seen better graphics on other Xbox games, I felt these were decent enough for Mechassault.  The environment you get to interact with is really awesome though.  You can destroy anything to your hearts little desire.  Even though you're trying to save the people of the planet from the Word of Blake faction... you can still destroy all their houses and cities in the process!  One major downfall of this game is the saving function.  There is no mid-mission save ability.  If you do not complete the mission you fail and thus have to restart the mission.  This is incredibly annoying if the mission is kind of long.  This happened to me a couple times; I made it to the final part of the mission to essentially fight the boss Mech and was destroyed at the very last part.  I had to restart the mission in order to get back to where I left off which took another hour of game play.  While I'm not complaining about a game being challenging, I'm complaining that as a user I don't have save options which is really annoying not to have.Overall I think this game was quite a lot of fun with a better story line to follow as well.  There are a few things I would change here and there, but they are technically minor over all.  I've enjoyed Mechs and Battletech stuff ever since I was a little kid, being able to enjoy this on Xbox was a lot of fun for me.  I have to spend a lot of time in front of a computer for my job, so being able to have this in a console format when I don't want to play a computer game was great fun!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2008"}

MechAssualt is one of those games that, when it's allsaid and done, you can really look back and say \"that was an AWSOMEgame!\"  Not many games leave you craving more, and even fewer gamesthat do leave that feeling, have more to offer.But for MechAssualt, when the INCREDIBLE story and game play is over,you realize that the fun is just beginning.Here's a review of MechAssualt for the Microsoft XBOX:1) Single Player: This game was one of the best games I have EVERplayed.  Your living in the 34th century, and there's a planet with agroup of terrorists, called \"The Word of Blake\" who threaten the restof the world.  Your part of a Space Army.  Your sent to restore peaceto this planet, and take out anyone who threatens to do otherwise.You are the future's cops!So you and your co-workers are the 1st team.  Your sent in to securethe planet for the rest of the Dabloon to arrive and destroy theenemy.  Your in enemy territory from the beginning, trying to securethe safety of the rest of your Dabloon.  You are part ofthe \"Icuras\", and you have some of the coolest weapons ever thoughtup of.  They're called BattleMechs.If you fail your mission, THOUSANDS COULD DIE...  Good luck!That's just the beginning!  You must now plan, think, destroy, andfight your way through dozens of Mechs.  You start out small withlittle Mechs.  But as you get deeper into the story, you begin to usesome of the more powerful Mechs as they become available.  You mustdefeat the \"Word of Blake\", before they defeat you!The game really begins to kick in later on, as there are so manytypes of missions.  One has you inside of a stolen Mech, trying tosneak into one of their bases, get information, then make a run forit.  You must blast bridges to cut off enemies, bring cities down inrubble (on top of your enemies if your lucky).  There is strategyinvolved, too, as you can sometimes avoid hits, take out stronger Mechs first, etc...Another strategic element is trying to decide how to fight eachmission.  The smaller Mechs are TWICE as fast, and some of them canbecome invisible for 30 seconds.  They vanish before your eyes,giving you (if your using one) the ability to sneak around and getaway from massive Mechs, without damage.  Or perhaps go for big andslow, as they have some of the coolest weapons ever thought up.Electric shocks, machine guns, time bombs, etc...It's all worth it, too, as if you beat the game, there's a nice little prize waiting!2) Graphics: INCREDIBLE!  Your Mechs, when damaged, are smoking, orif you aim for a leg, you'll see them dragging along a broken leg.Sparks fly across the Mechs huge bulk, a sign that a few more shotswill result in it's destruction.  Any building, in 2 words, CANFALL.  And the explosions are awesome!  The windows break, fire iseverywhere, dust chokes the entire screen after a HUGE buildingfalls.  In the end, it creates a feeling of all out war!When you shoot at the ground, dirt flies up, when you walk throughthe water, water splashes.  Basically...ANYTHING CAN BE DESTROYED!  Hech, your Mechs even leave footprints.  The graphics here are incurable, along with the story that leaves you craving for the sequel!3) Multiplayer: Even without XBOX LIVE, the Multiplayer can besweet.  You can play with you and a buddy and go 1 on 1 with the mostpowerful weapons in the world, or work as a team, trying to destroyas many Mechs as possible.  The longer you survive, the more Mechsyou'll be facing at once.  Buildings (and Mechs) will fall!System link is awesome, too!  As you can have 1-8 players in battles of even 4-4 in ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION, or several other mini-games to play!!!  Sweet!4) XBOX Live: The greatest feature of all.  Get a team of 4 and takeon another team of 4.  Or take another human Mech Warrior 1 on 1.With dozens of Mechs to use, and a ton of games to play and places tofight in (and soon destroy), the multiplayer is endless!  With gameslike Deathwatch, Grinder (4 people fight endless Mechs until no human player is left standing), etc...(over 6)  But that's not all!Rankings!: Compete for kills.  Can you get to 10,000 , 20,000? Willyou be the #1 Mech player in the country?  Will the world fear you?It's pretty cool.  And when you try 4 player Grinder, and try tofinish off as many computer controlled Mechs as possible, it's reallycool!5) Downloadable Content: Within a few weeks, we should have somethingthat's never been done in the history of video games!  DownloadableContent.  That's right!  In a few weeks, you can download to yourXBOX hard drive *NEW* Mechs, *NEW* game types, *NEW* arenas to fightin, etc...  And they'll just keep coming.  The possibilities areendless!  *NEW* downloads, to begin with, will include:A) New Level to play in: \"H*ll's Kitchen\".  A volcanic level!B)New Game Type: \"Capture the Flag\" 2-4 new Mechs (not yet beenannounced)And much much more!

As one reviewer mentioned, you do feel like you're being cattle-herded to the end. It's a first person shooter and nothing more. Since its a game based on a movie not yet released (Quantum of Solace was released after the game I think) much of the story is vague and often lacking.Is it worth $15? Absolutely. In fact, thats a bit of a steal. I would say it was worth $25 at least. The visuals are good, the sound is great and the controls are solid. The real star for me however, are the guns. Have you ever played a game with guns and wished you could put sound suppressors on them as you pleased? Well you can in this game. Virtually every weapon, except 1 or 2 (shotgun... duh), has a silencer that you can attach or remove when you feel like it. I absolutely love the sound of a silenced gun!If you want a great FPS thats dirt cheap, then I strongly recommend this game.Its simple but fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2010"}
{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"Joshua Glowzinski \"Gman\"","summary":"A gift of the present that may have future in it's DNA.","reviewText":"I got my Wii U in the mail the day before Thanksgiving.  I was super excited.  I had read some bad things online.  I had read that the update takes around 4 hours and the battery life of the controller is short among other things.  I will tell you what I got from using the new Wii U for a bit.First, the dreaded update.  Being someone of at least average intelligence, I knew that the time in which it takes to download something on any system all comes down to the speed at which the server lets you download it, the speed at which you can download it and the size of the file.  When I read people saying 4 hours, I thought the file must be very large.  Then I read that it was 1gb.  Come on, iTunes songs are larger than that.  So, I started the download at 12:58pm and went out to do some stuff.  There were people here still, I would not leave it on if no one was home.  Anyway, I got back and looked at my clock and it was exactly 2pm.  The download had finished.  Now I can not say exactly it had taken, but I know for a fact that it was less than 3 hours.  I saw the bar before I left and it was a little bit full.  I would guess that it took 1 - 2 hours to download.  So there's that.  Anyway, if you must download the update, you either do it or you don't use the system.  People need patience.  Now I read in a review that every game you play you have to download an update.  I have Mario Bros. U and Nintendoland.  They both started downloading an update when I started.  Mario took 9 - 10 minutes.  But, I saw something on the bottom of the screen that said play game.  I was to nervous to hit it.  Later I was playing Nintendoland with my step sister and I just hit the play game button, it was just as the update had started downloading.  It told me I could install the update later.  So, while some updates may take a bit of time, it seems as though you can continue to play your game while it does so.  I thought that was a good thing.You do need to set your system up after the update.  You need to put things like your age, name and email.  This took a while.  I started at 2pm and actually did not finish until about 5:30.  This had to do with a system transfer that stopped.  More on that in a bit though.The system software.  Ok, this seems exactly like the Wii software to me.  Everything looks the same as far as image goes.  I did go to the store and it may have looked a little different.  I have not really spent much time with it yet though.  I will update when I use it more.  But everything seems to work, feel and look great.  Some were saying the new store is like Xbox 360s store or Playstation 3s.  I say \"so what?\"  I am happy with what I've seen so far.The new controller.  The new controller feels freaking great in my hands.  Everything fits and my hands did not feel cramped at all.  My step sister and I would share the controller and her hands are half the size of mine, she did not complain at all.  The screen seems to work very well.  It never missed when I hit something on the screen.  The buttons all respond fast as well.  When Nintendoland started and the character was talking to me, I actually got tears.  It is something new and exciting.  I actually found myself forgetting to even look at my TV.  Also, it told me I could set the controller up as a remote for my TV and cable box.  Normally this is a pain.  You have to look for model numbers and try again and again.  This though was the easiest it has ever been for me.  I hit the first letter of the company who makes my remote.  It is Verizon, so I hit V.  I scrolled down and hit Verizon and I could turn my cable box on and off.  As easy as that.  Same for my TV.  Took less than 20 seconds.  I was so happy with that.  You can charge your controller while you are playing games.  Just like that of the 360 or PS3.  It did not take away from the experience for me at all.  It's not like you have to move around the room when playing.Have a Wii?  Well you may want to transfer your files from it to your new Wii U.  It took a bit, but here is what you have to do.  First you have to download the transfer software on your Wii U.  Then you must but the software on an SD card with at least 512mb of space.  Then you put that card in your Wii.  You then download the software on your old Wii system.  Then you put the memory card in your Wii and it transfers everything that can be transferred onto the card, thus erasing it from your Wii.  When finished, you put the card into your Wii U and everything is put from the card onto your Wii U.  The things that took the longest while I was home in front of the TV was this.  I had saves and games on the card.  I just did other things while it was in progress.  It actually said error once and told me to re do the transfer.  I did so and the second time it worked fine.  This is why it took so long.  You do get to watch a cool animation while it happens and the music or sound coming from the controller is very zen.  So if you want to put stuff from your Wii to Wii U, no worry.  It is very simple and only requires you to follow simple on screen instructions.  You can not transfer the thing that allows you to take polls though.  There were some other things I could not transfer over as well.  It's alright, I can just go back to my Wii for that.Speaking of Wii, have some Wii games?  The ones I tried play on the Wii U worked fine.  I am not sure if they all will, but mine have.  What you have to do is switch from the Wii U, to the Wii software.  You do this by tapping on the Wii icon on the main screen.  It turns the system off, and when it comes back on, it looks like the Wii menu.  Though the Wii U menu looks like that as well.  It is very easy to switch games.Saving your game.  Well, I got the 32 gig system.  When I read online about how the Wii U would allow an external HD up to 2 tb, I was excited.  I emailed Nintendo and they told me that they recommend an external HD with a usb cable and a A/C adapter.  So I got a Western Digital 2tb drive.  I plugged it in and it formatted for the Wii U.  It took less than 15 seconds.  Now it is part of my Wii U.  You must plus it in before your plug your Wii U in and can not unplug it.  I have not seen anything on the games I've played that says saving.  But the saves are there.  Very cool.  I am not sure the size of all the games, movies or whatever else.  But I am almost positive 2tb of space will be all I need for the Wii U.  The drive cost me $149.99.  I had $20 credit to best buy so that was good.  I know some may be saying that that adds to the cost of the Wii U and they would be right.  But, external hard drives are so inexpensive now.  you could get a 250 gig drive for a very low price.  Even if you know nothing about computers, I do not believe you will have a problem setting the drive up.Ending thoughts.  I am very happy with and excited about the Nintendo Wii U.  I can see so many great things that could happen with it.  Imagine a game that could teach kids math.  They could watch the screen to take the lessons, then actually take tests using the gamepad.  Very cool.  I want to try Rockband with the thing.  I think it would be cool to have a racing game or a flying game.  You could have the TV screen just with the action and use the new Wii controller as your hud or your mirror.  That is exciting to me.  RPGs, puzzles, shooters, action and survival horror.  There seems to be so much more you can do with something like the Wii U.  I am happy the other systems will be a few years off so I get time to really enjoy the Wii U.  I look forward to the updates and features that will be available as well as the already great games that I own.  Whether you want the 8gig or 32 gig system, and no matter what size HD you get, I believe the Wii U will offer fun, excitement and something new for the entire family to enjoy.  It is one of the best purchases I have ever made.  Now please excuse me why I go actually play Mario for the first time.A couple things I thought I would add.  First, the 32 gig system comes with a stand.  The stand is great.  You can only put the two pieces in the spots meant for them.  The feel solid and safe.  Second, I have had the system on for a couple hours.  It does not feel hot at all.  The back left may feel a little different than the rest, but the system is not hot at all.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2012"}

My experience with other similar games has not always been positive.  These are ergonomic and I felt that I could easily reach all of the buttons quickly and without discomfort.Once the number of players are selected, the first task is picking avatars.  Buzz! presented a wide selection of male and female avatars to chose from; something to fit everyone's personality.  Along with picking a \"look\", you may also select a sound effect to go with your avatar.  This is used when the avatar chimes in to answer a question.  The last part of this process is selecting the clothing - again, numerous options are made available.Once the avatar is picked, it's onto the game, itself.  This involves 5 different formats, all allowing the choice between different categories.  These can range from films, to world events; animals to nature (just some examples).  With the exception of the first round, typically the person who is behind in points will be the person picking the topic.The final round is approached in such a way that no matter what the standings were coming into it, everyone still has a chance to win - even people who are far behind the pack.  Going into the final round, each player is placed on a pedestal that is set in height according to where the current point standings are.  As questions are asked, the person who answers both accurately and the fastest will be raised on their pedestal.  Those who were correct but not the fastest will stay in place.  Those who answered incorrectly will have their pedestal lowered.  Once (if) your pedestal is lowered to the ground, you are out.  The last person standing wins.  This approach allows for anyone, even the person in last place going into the final round, to win.While the game is playable for 2-4 people, I think that having 3-4 is more fun - especially when being allowed to take money from someone because they were too slow to answer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2008"}

Romano \"Avid Gamer\"","summary":"Army of Two is a Great Game","reviewText":"My review only applies to the single-player part of the game.  I love this game.  This is one of the best games to come out so far this year for any platform.  If you love shooters, you'll love this game. This is a very well made and thought out game.  Also the graphics are very good in this game.The game takes place in different hot spots throughout recent history.  You play the first mission in Somalia in 1993 to take out a Somali warlord.  Then you go to Afghanistan in 2001 to take out an Al Qaeda warlord who uses chemical weapons against his enemies.  Then it's off to Iraq to fight the Iraqis in 2003.  Then from Iraq, you go onboard a U.S. aircraft carrier in 2008 to fight terrorists who have gained control of the ship.  Then it's off to China to fight the terrorist mastermind who commanded the terrorists who took over the U.S. aircraft carrier.  Finally, the last mission takes place in Miami, Florida where you fight terrorists while a category five hurricane bears down on you.You play as a war-hardened mercenary with a partner throughout the game. You can play either as a mercenary named Tyson Rios or as one named Elliot Salem. You work for a private corporation who handles security detail throughout the hotspots of the world. You get paid a large sum of money everytime you do something special in a mission.  With that money, you can customize and  upgrade your weapons, face masks, and body armor throughout the game. (This reminds me a lot of the contractors who work over in Iraq who get paid a lot more money than regular military would ever get paid.  I was thinking of the Blackwater Corporation as a good example.  Of course, I think those private security detail guys deserve every penny they get.  They are usually protecting high profile individuals in Iraq. Those are very tough assignments.)This game reminds alot of Soldier of Fortune: Payback.  In that game, you play a mercenary, just like you do in this game, who is fighting terrorists around the world.  You can customize and upgrade your weapons in Soldier of Fortune: Payback just like you can in Army of Two.  The only real difference is you're fighting with a partner in Army of Two where in Soldier of Fortune: Payback you mainly fight by yourself throughout the game.  Also I think this game is a lot more fun than Soldier of Fortune: Payback and the controls on my Xbox 360 controller are more easy to use.  I also don't like in Soldier of Fortune: Payback where you have a constant crosshair in front of you all the time for your weapons. (When are game developers going to learn to give us a option to turn that crosshair on and off by now?  Game developers, are you listening?)This game is definitely a two man show.  I can't tell how many times I got wounded and my partner dragged me off to safety to heal me.  Or when I came to a cliff or a wall where I needed to climb up and my partner actually helped me climb up.  Then there was times we parchuted together and one person guides the parchute while the other person shoots at the enemy below.  Or about when we are both totally surrounded by enemy soldiers and me and my partner go back to back blasting away in a circle at all the enemy soldiers around us. Then there is the hovercraft that you use in the water to get around in.  You have one person drives the hovercraft and the other person blasts away with a machine gun at everything that moves.I'm telling you, this game is fun.  I definitely plan to go back and play through the single-player campaign again.  This game is worth the $60.00 I paid for it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00BGA9YZK","description":"","reviewerName":"Ryan J \"Ryan\"","summary":"A by the numbers first person shooter whose main draw is its graphics and multiplayer","reviewText":"Killzone Shadow Fall, the latest in the long running Killzone series from Guerilla Games, is being promoted as the showcase game for the new Playstation 4. For the most part, the game does a good job of introducing the capabilities of Sony&#8217;s new console. It checks off all of the requisite boxes on the first person shooter checklist, but it never really manages to achieve anything great.The story takes place many years after the previous three games, where after repelling a Helghast invasion of Vekta, the Vektans followed the Helgast to their home planet and basically ended up annihilating their planet. The Vektans, in a terrible act of judgement, decide to let the remaining Helgast come back to Vekta with them. The Helgast are given half the planet, allowed to militarize, and a giant wall is built between them. That, more or less, is the completely unbelievable setup to Shadow Fall: the Helgast are right on the other side of that wall and are plotting revenge.The story is told primarily through cutscenes that set up each mission and occasional radio messages sent to you during gameplay. There are also audio logs that you can find in the levels, but they tend to contain secondary information that is not very important. The audio logs play out of the new speaker on the Playstation controller. I found this to be rather obnoxious for a couple of reasons: the audio quality of this speaker is not great, you cannot adjust the volume of it from in-game, and it&#8217;s awkward to have audio come from my controller when I am using headphones for everything else.The narrative tries to add some moral ambiguity over who the &#8220;bad&#8221; guys really are, but it is hard to care when none of the characters are particularly likeable and everyone is in a bad in a situation of their own making.The actual shooting mechanics feel tight and responsive, and there is a good selection of weapons to use with some of them offering secondary fire modes. The highlight of the gameplay is a little hovering drone you have called the OWL. You can send it out to attack enemies and provide covering fire, deploy a one way shield in front of you that allows you to shoot out of it, and EMP strike an area disorienting enemies and removing shields. It also has an ability to deploy a zip line allowing you to reach areas you otherwise would not be able to, but this sees limited use in mostly pre-determined areas. It can also heal you if you die, given that it&#8217;s not currently recharging and that you have medical supplies available. You have to swipe in various directions on the touch pad to change which mode the OWL is in. It is a bit inconvenient as you have to take a hand off of a thumbstick to do what basically amounts to a button press. Hopefully developers will come up for more creative uses for the touch pad later on.Speaking of controls, the game only has two control layouts to pick from and both of them only swap what the triggers and shoulder buttons do. There is absolutely no way to change what the face buttons on the controller are assigned to. This seems sloppy, as it should be pretty trivial to allow remapping of buttons.It is a bit disappointing that you are required to hold on to your primary weapon at all times. Since you can only hold two weapons at a time, this really limits the number of loadout configurations you can have. Want to have a sniper rifle and a shotgun? Sorry, you have to hold on to that Assault rifle you started with that has no ammo left.The enemy AI is not particularly smart. They will run around corners into your line of fire one after another, decide to climb ladders in the middle of a gunfight, and don&#8217;t really make much of an effort to flank you or seem to work together in any meaningful way. The game tries to make up for this by either sending large amounts of them at you at once, or giving them energy shields that turn them into bullet sponges. It can make for frantic fights at times, but for the most part they are not particularly interesting opponents. Repetition also becomes a problem later in the game, as there is just not a lot of variety to what you fight. They do add some robots in towards the later stages, but they are used sparingly and don&#8217;t really do enough to keep the combat feeling fresh.The game has a fairly limited cover system that allows you to crouch behind cover, but it feels really unfinished.  There is no button to go into cover, but if you crouch behind cover of the right height you will automatically peak over when you aim down the sights. It is often hard to tell if the cover you are hiding behind is actually tall enough, and when you aim down sights you get anchored to that cover preventing you from moving. The cover also only works vertically, so you cannot take cover around corners or at doorways.What really kept me playing the game was the level design that included a number of cool setpiece moments. You are constantly on the move from one area to the next. Some of the more interesting highlights include a ship that is flying into the sun, where you can shoot out windows to burn enemies and melt parts of the ship, and a floating train yard where high speed trains are flying all around you as you jump from platform to platform.Killzone earns its highest marks in presentation. The graphics are undeniably better than last generation consoles, although anyone with a high end PC has been seeing graphics as good as this for a few years now. The biggest improvement is that is it actually rendering natively in 1080p at 60 frames per second. The game has a nice artistic style that unfortunately often goes overboard with the lens flare and reflective surfaces because apparently almost nothing on Vekta absorbs light. Texture quality and lighting is impressive, although the lighting is completely static. You cannot shoot out lights or otherwise effect the lighting in the environment. Characters are a bit mixed. In the pre-rendered cutscenes they look pretty great and are expressive. During actual gameplay they tend to look a bit stiff with faces that don&#8217;t move much and eyes that don&#8217;t blink. There also seems to be some issues with lip syncing at times as well. It is also worth noting that the graphics quality seems to have been turned down a bit for the multiplayer, perhaps to provide a more reliable framerate in the unpredictable online modes.A lot of people are going to be picking up Killzone for the multiplayer, and I am happy to say that I can recommend it for that without any reservations. Pretty much everything you need for a good multiplayer experience is here: fast matchmaking, unlocks and customizable loadouts, solid map design, lots of game modes, and the ability to customize to your satisfaction. When you set up a lobby you can determine everything from which weapons and abilities are allowed to which game modes pop up. The highlight of multiplayer is the Warzone mode, which consists of a variety of different game types that change during the match. For example, a match might start out as team deathmatch, change to a capture and hold mode, before finally switching to a defend and destroy mode. The side that completed the most objectives by the end wins.Overall, Killzone Shadow Fall is a by the numbers first person shooter whose main draw is its graphics and multiplayer. The single player is a mostly repetitive and forgettable experience that only occasionally reaches greatness during certain setpiece scenes, while its multiplayer offers enough depth to keep people playing for a while. As a launch title it does a decent job at introducing us to the new capabilities of the Playstation 4 and is worth picking up. A year from now though, Killzone Shadow Fall probably won&#8217;t be worth your time.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2014"}

{"product_name":"B000UZVL58","description":"Set after the events of Contra III: Alien Wars, the game follows mercenaries Bill Rizer and Lance Bean as they battle to save the world from a new extraterrestrial threat. Contra 4 takes advantage of the dual screens of the Nintendo DS to deliver larger than life action, with massive enemies, detailed platform gaming and mind-blowing set pieces. Using a variety of upgradable weapons, take the fight to the alien army of the Black Viper and reclaim Earth for Mankind in single-player or 2 player co-op mode.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Old School Right Down to the Core","reviewText":"In the mid to late eighties a run and gun shoot 'em up game called Contra hit store shelves.  It's a game mostly remembered for being insanely difficult.  So much so that the developers gave players a code (which would later be dubbed the \"Classic Konami Code\") that would give them thirty lives and they'd still end up seeing the game over screen.  But with persistence (and a good memory) Contra could be conquered.  Later, we got Super C as a follow up and later the all time best: Contra III: The Alien Wars.  Unfortunately, after that, many Contra games to follow (save for Hard Corps on the Genesis) were not good games at all.  The Playstation games were said to be the worst of the series, and even though Shattered Soldier returned to old roots, it just wasn't enough.Now, fifteen years after Contra III: The Alien Wars, we finally get a true Contra sequel.  And it's everything the original Contra back in the 80's was.  That is to say it's insanely hard, you only have so many lives and you'll see that game over screen millions of times, maybe within the first level alone.  When I say this game is difficult, it's no joke.  This game was specifically made for Contra fans.  So if you didn't like the series before, you are surely not going to like this game by any means.Contra 4 takes the basic run and gun gameplay of the original and does nothing to mess with a tried and true formula.  You'll go through the levels blasting anything and everything that moves while you jump from one platform to the next to avoid falling in chasms.  You'll also be avoiding enemy gun fire and watching out for enemies that are running blindly from one side of the screen to another.  Your eyes must be sharp if you want to survive.  You begin with a basic rifle, but along the way you'll be able to find other guns.  Such as the Machine Gun, the Laser, and the Contra classic: The Spread Gun.  There are more weapons to collect.  You can carry two guns at a time and switch between them on the fly. You can also \"upgrade\" a weapon by collecting it a second time on top of the original for an extra punch. Very simple game to play, but insanely difficult to master.  Luckily, there are difficulty levels to choose from, but choosing Easy will cause you to miss out on the real experience of what Contra is.Unfortunately, like the previous games, once you get enemy movements down, it will actually become insanely easy.  That is to say if you memorize where every enemy appears and when you'll succeed.  The problem is learning this trick of trade as you'll have to die several times.  Each level also ends with a boss who is just as difficult as the level itself.  Many times you'll do well in a level only to be killed by the bosses.  This Contra has the biggest, baddest boss battles yet.Contra is also unforgiving in the fact that its one hit and you're dead.  You have a set number of lives to begin with, depending on which difficulty level you choose. Once all those lives are gone its game over.  You have a set number of continues to use.  This is not a game for the casual gamer.  It doesn't let up for a second.That may ultimately be the problem with Contra 4.  The simple fact that it's just an insanely difficult game overall.  So much so that most gamers will be turned off simply because of being frustrated to death.  Not even the first level is simple.  If you really want to test how good a gamer you are, by all means, pick up Contra 4.  Another small problem is that it spans two screens and keeping an eye on both screens when there is literally danger coming from all around can take a moment to get used to.  It doesn't help that the little space in between can hide some of those dangers as well.Contra 4 doesn't use the DS to its full potential.  This is a 2D side scroller through and through.  There are some 3D effects brought out, but not a whole lot.  Your character sprites are a little pixilated.  It doesn't push the DS to its limits but the levels are incredibly detailed with great looking backgrounds.  The level design of this game is ingenious.  For anyone who is a fan of the Contra series, there's a lot of nostalgia in the level designs (the very first level, for example, is a jungle).  The game also sounds fantastic, with some great sound effects.  Some of which were lifted from the original games.  Even better, some levels use old classic tunes that are remixed.There is also challenge mode.  This is a mode where Contra veterans can really test their skills by having to do certain task in some stages.  Here you'll do some things like go through a challenge without missing a single enemy or going through a challenge using limited ammo or sometimes even no ammo at all!  There are 40 challenges in all and they'll test even the best Contra players.Contra 4 really is a good game.  A game that relies heavily on the old school roots that made the first three games such a heaping success.  If you stick with it and don't wimp out, Contra 4 is rewarding.Pros:+Intense gameplay to keep you on your toes+Really great soundtrack+Simplistic gameplay+A good challengeCons:-When I say a good challenge... I'm not kidding.  And while many will like a good challenge, there will still be some gamers--perhaps even Contra fans--who will believe this game to be a little much","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2007"}

{"product_name":"B000GEDN5E","reviewerName":"goldentoaster \"goldentoaster\"","summary":"A bad game","reviewText":"Rayman Raving rabbids is not really a game, but more like a tech demo. Sure, Wii already has tech demos, in fact, most of the launch line up (except for Zelda) is filled with tech demos. But what makes this one different? It has retarded screaming bunnies. From this already, your good instincts should tell you to stay away  You play as a limbless creature named Rayman, who has been kidnapped by retarded bunnies, and you have to partake in something like 70 minigames to plunge your way to freedom. The premise is stupid, just a way to tie together all the minigames. The minis themselves range from barely playable to just plain abysmal. You will not want to play most of these games, because they are either stupid concepts or badly designed. Very few of the games are fun, but they lose their charm after playing them once or twice. Many of the minigames also share the same gimmick,, which wouldn't be a issue if the gimmicks were less simple and easy to spot. The minigames alone makes the game horrible and not worthy of anyones money.There are really only two upsides to owning this game. One, the first person shooter boss battles. After every stage (composed of 4 games) there is a boss battle, and sometimes you are treated to a very fun arcade style shoot'em up game. These are some of the best use of the controller on the system, and are increadably fun, but you will have to suffer through the rest of the crap to get to it. The other upside is humor. The Bunnies are so stupid and they are so horribly exploited in some of the minigames that it becomes funny. Of course, you are lowered down do retarded humor, but if you just need a good laugh, this game will provide entertainment.Otherwise, this game is just a bad minigame collection that may provide some fun in the form of a boss battle, or just retarded humor, but usually it is just frustratingly bad, not worth the time or money. Save both by giving this one a pass2/5 overall","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2007"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"CastleD","summary":"R2 is a mixed bag of greatness and frustration","reviewText":"This is a tough game to review because at times it can be spectacular, and then it can be extremely frustrating. One thing is certain, overall I had fun and it's worth playing. Avoiding it because of all the complaints is a mistake, but I do I have complaints though!Before R2 was released Insomniac kept talking about how this game was all about \"scale\", and they weren't lying. Some of the set-pieces are incredible. The size of some of the enemies and environment is huge and the way things look and move you really get a sense of the grandeur. I've never seen anything like it in a videogame, just a great achievement by Insomniac. It's strange though that the graphics are inconsistent. Sometimes the games looks breathtaking, colorful, and sharp, and other times it looks bland. Mostly though it looked great and it was nice to see color in a game instead of all the grey and brown out there.Like the first game, there are a few epic battles with many Chimera to take on, and they are a lot of fun! Very satisfying mayhem. Nothing better than flinging a grenade into a crowd of Chimera and watching them all go flying. However, I didn't like that there really was no meaningful way to try different tactics like flank or a little stealth or anything like that. It was basically just blast away and fling as many grenades as you have (usually not many). You get to a set-piece, enemies storm you like maniacs, you blast em, then move on the next set-piece. I guess this describes most FPS games but in R2 it felt very linear and repetitive. There were some cool sniper parts though, can never get enough of those, and the two sniper rifles are excellent.The other guns are cool as always but some of them feel a little weak, particularly the Carbine. My favorite gun by far is the Auger. The way enemies glow green so you can see them through walls is extremely cool, and it has a shield which comes in handy in this game, which brings me to another point: I died a lot in this game.I played though 2 times on Normal and I died more times than I care to admit. Modesty aside I think I'm pretty good at FPS games but there are quite a few cheap deaths in this game. You walk into an area, get bombarded by overly powerful enemies, your Bullseye Mark II suddenly feels like a pea shooter, and boom you're dead before you barely even knew what hit you. I like games to be very challenging, I hate dumbed down games, but this game can be very frustrating, and even infuriating at times. Somehow the balance is a little off. Hale is constantly on the brink of death after only a few hits, in other words the screen starts to go black and white and red like most games nowadays and it gets annoying being in that state too often.Another thing I didn't like is the way Hale moves. He just feels sluggish. God forbid you need to run away to get behind cover. He's really slow.The way the story is told is ineffective. Like I said, you just move from one set-piece to the next, shooting Chimera, not really caring why. I hardly paid attention to what the characters were talking about, because the entire game they engage in the most annoying military-speak:\"Rendezvous at the LZ! We'll secure the perimeter! Move soldier that's an order!\"It gets so old. It's hard to relate to any characters when they yell military jargon the whole game. I like games to have real people in them, not just military caricatures.So it sounds like I complained the whole review, but the bottom line is I had fun with this game. It's epic at times. I just feel like it could have been a lot better because Insomniac is one of the most talented developers in the industry. They did an amazing job with the \"scale\" aspect, but other parts of the game suffered. (I didn't play online and don't plan to so I can't comment on that part).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2009"}

It was originally a classic on the MSX2 computer in Japan, but the series became really good when it debuted on the PlayStation. Developed and published by Konami with Hideo Kojima being the director and producer, this was the first game in the series to become very popular. The games ground breaking graphics, addicting gameplay, challenging stealth action and its amazing storyline heavily influenced games that would later produce well detailed story lines. It was originally released on PlayStation, but would be re-released on the PlayStation Store as a PS One Classic, a remake on the GameCube and there was even a port on Game Boy Color which apparently got good reviews (I find that hard to believe, I&#8217;ll have to check that out some day).The storyline is the most complex and most detailed of any video game that was released at that point. There are tons of cut scenes, character dialogues and we didn&#8217;t see a game like this back then. The story takes place in 2005, about six years after the events of Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake and 10 years after the events of the first Metal Gear. A genetically enhanced Special Forces unit called FOXHOUND has invaded a nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses island in Alaska&#8217;s Fox Archipelago. The forces demand that the U.S. government turn over the remains of Big Boss within 24 hours or they will launch a nuclear weapon. Big Boss was the main antagonist in the first two Metal Gear games who is one of the greatest soldiers who ever lived. The terrorists want the body so they can take his genes and put them inside the soldiers so they can become an army of super soldiers and take over the world. The main hero Solid Snake is forced out of retirement and is sent to go to the island and stop the threat. I won&#8217;t say anything else about the story because my reviews are always spoiler free, you have to play the game to see it for yourself.Like with Super Mario 64 and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time on Nintendo 64, Metal Gear Solid was making a leap into the third dimension and the graphics for their time were very well detailed and the game has aged pretty well. Details such as seeing the characters breath in the cold, very high draw distance, seeing smoke from cigarettes or footprints in the snow is all in this game. The gameplay is very similar to the 2D Metal Gear games on the MSX2 computer. The game is all about sneaking by without detection rather than a straight on shooter, but there are moments where you do go in all guns blazing, but it&#8217;s mostly a sneaking mission because going in guns blazing makes the game much harder. I like stealth games like this because it makes us cautious and can even be scary at times because everything is quiet and suddenly a security camera or guard spots you, the alarm goes off and you&#8217;re slightly startled and have to hide and hope they don&#8217;t find you.The most innovative feature in the game is the radar which shows the terrain and your enemy&#8217;s field of vision. It&#8217;s very useful and you&#8217;ll see yourself looking at it all the time. But in some areas, the radar gets jammed and you won&#8217;t be able to use the radar if you are spotted so you shouldn&#8217;t get too used to it. Ways to get by undetected include crawling under objects, hiding in boxes, hiding behind walls and making noise to distract the enemy. The game also includes many gadgets and items such as infra-red goggles, night vision goggles, mine detectors, rations, binoculars, the famous cardboard box and&#8230;cigarettes?The weapons include hand to hand, you can choke your enemies to death, use a standard pistol with a silencer, grenades, C4, machine gun, proximity mines, a remote controlled missile launcher, a sniper rifle and even a Stinger missile launcher which uses heat seekers to follow your target.The boss battles are very epic and every one of them has a strategy to defeat and it&#8217;s always best to use your radio to contact your support crew for tips on how to defeat them. The radio is also used to provide info about the games back story and even the controls.The game also features a training mode called VR Mode where you can practice hiding techniques, weapon use and sneaking. This is one of the best games on the original PlayStation and the only flaw I see with this game is that you can&#8217;t aim in first person view mode which can make it difficult to shoot some of the enemies. But other than that, the game is practically flawless, it has great graphics, is challenging and one of the most detailed story lines of all time. It is simply a masterpiece and a must play for any kind of gamer.FINAL RATING: 10 out of 10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2014"}

The way they meshed turn-based combat with real time was a revelation that no game has since matched.  But this game was boring as hell.  I played it for over 5 hours, and all it seemed to me was a running simulator with a bad third person shooter mechanic thrown in.  Sure, the conversation mechanic was interesting for the first 10 minutes or so, but after a while it was like watching a movie I had to also direct, instead of just enjoying it.  Generic sci-fi themes also abounded, lacking the cohesiveness of the Star Wars universe for an underlying premise.  I would say Bioware is great at interpreting a story that has already been realized for them, but awful at trying to come up with an original concept, AND executing it in an interesting fashion.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00064MUIA","reviewerName":"Phantasmagoria","summary":"Oh the possibilities","reviewText":"I have been intrigued by this unit since its announcement and intended to pick one up just so I could play the new CASTLEVANIA game that Konami has cooking.  I had a few concerns with the DS namely the supposedly suspect screen hinge and the bigger worry that the lower screen would scratch with any kind of play.  The hinge on the screen feels solid enough intially, but I can't vouch for how it will hold up.After charging and booting up the unit I was most pleased with the way the R and L buttons feel (solid and attached well) good for gamers with big hands and lots of GBA games this is helpful.My next concerns were the battery life and the image quality on both screens.  After comparing the image on a GBA SP with the vibrant and stunning colors on the DS, there was no comparison.The GBA SP with its backlight tends to wash games out, not true here just pop in GRAND THEFT AUTO and you will see the colors come to life in the game as they never did on your GBA.The ability to choose either screen for GBA games is also a plus.For anyone who plays alot of GBA games and finds the SP a little cramped this is a good upgrade.  However if you use your GBA to play alot of multiplayer titles or connect to the GCN, this is hardly a replacement for the SP.  The sound produced by the stereo DS is vastly superior to the SPs mono speaker that tended to distort on alot of units.  Other than the Metroid Demo I haven't played with any DS specific games, but it is terrific for what it is.  The screen is responsive to the stylus and easy to get used to, any scratches that appear to develop wipe away with a clean cotton cloth.  The lith ion battery appears to be more than up to the task of handling the brightly lit dual screens with 10 to 15 hrs of gameplay, while keeping recharging times to a sparse 4 hours to boot.  The touch screen should usher in a whole new era in gaming if developers run with this system.  Bring on CASTLEVANIA DS and its many sequels.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2005"}
{"product_name":"B003C1I06U","reviewerName":"Dr. D","summary":"The Joke Was On Me!","reviewText":"Alright, I bought the original Batman: Arkham Asylum from Amazon two years ago.  You can check out my review on it somewhere in my profile.  Everything I said about AA then still stands now, with a couple of new exceptions...First off, I didn't purchase the Game of the Year edition from Amazon.  Thankfully, Amazon lets anyone review whatever they want on this site without having to have purchased the item directly from them.  I got Arkham Asylum GOTY free from Walmart with the purchase of Arkham City.  Good deal, for sure.  However, I was very disappointed that it did not come with 3D glasses.  Why it didn't come with it, I don't know.. If the game specifically has 3D capability that's to be viewed with its own brand of glasses (TriOviZ), then geez, INCLUDE THEM WITH THE GAME!!!Now that that's out of the way, I also encountered a few glitches in the game.  After I beat the main story, I was trying to collect all the riddles for The Riddler's Challenge.  That couldn't be done because apparently, there were no more Joker Teeth around in certain areas.  I guess once you beat the main story, the teeth are gone forever.  How ridiculous is that?  I couldn't achieve 100% completion due to that fact.  And believe me, I scoured every single area and passage in the designated facility...to no avail.  This also prevented me from unlocking all the challenge maps.  It would have been nice to achieve total completion of the game, but the challenge maps are mostly for those PS3 trophy junkies.  I stopped at Riddle 205 and just put the game on my shelf for some excellent dust aggregating.On another note, let me add that I didn't really like the selection of villains in this game (now that I've played it fully for a second time).  The main in-the-flesh villains are The Joker, Killer Croc, Bane, Scarecrow, Dr. Zsasz, Harley Quinn, and Poison Ivy.  I'm just hoping that once I start playing Arkham City, we'll see Catwoman (definitely confirmed as DLC), The Penguin, The Riddler, Two Face, and Mr. Freeze as actual characters.  If they aren't in AC, that's an automatic one-star deduction from that pending review!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2011"}

The Anthology is $30.00 and is the same price as the Deluxe Edition plus Secret Weapons. Getting all three separately will cost you nearly $40.00 so get the best deal in bundle packs.**Want to play the best war simulation? Go play the old Operation Flashpoint and pray that the spring 2006 Operation Flashpoint 2 deadline will be met with the best war multiplayer simulator ever conceived. Want to play a single player war game that matched the experience of Medal of Honour: Allied Assault? Then go play Call of Duty and get the expansion pack Call of Duty: United Offensive. Want to the play the best SWAT type tactical one on one? Then go get Half-Life 2 and play Counter-Strike. Fancy a futuristic sci-fi multiplayer with huge maps? Then get the latest Unreal Tournament. So what else is there? Well to be honest Battlefield 1942 is straight up probably one of the best multiplayer games I have played, but be warned, the simulation experience does call for infinite amounts of patients and the game is extremely buggy to install. There is very little good technical support except for what the community offers, updates can be patchy, people end up can't playing it, and it suffers from fatal spawn point easy target syndrome that has rendered many of the maps unplayable... however new maps are updated, but just don't expect the BF1942 community to be as responsive as let's say STEAM. The bottom line here is that even single player mode is not supported. The game comes pretty much as it is served so expect to spend more than a day, maybe a week, to get it to work on your machine with lots of google searches for your problem. The solutions should be found in forums troubleshooting guides. Be prepared for discs that don't appear to like firewalls, anti-virus checkers and other background processes. This is the game of games in terms of installation bugs and crashes. In short - Requires broadband INTERNET.Single player like we said is not supported. Multiplayer is one big CAPTURE THE FLAG, but what a game of CTF! Problem right away is the lack of classes that looks restrictive but it is actually okay, with five types of soldiers to choose from - sniper, machine gun, rockets, medic, engineer... so it is closer to Team Fortress than Operation Flashpoint that allows full configuration of up to twenty classes. Having said that it does not reduce the impact of the game, but does leave the realm of simulation, deviating into more Unreal Tournament territory where there is very real possibility of just leaving your team behind and going on a frag-a-thon across the map. If you are into that sort of thing then maybe the more recent, but certainly not as good, Battlefield Vietnam, can offer you that type of solo bush mission multiplayer experience like Far Cry with lesser graphics, but if it is Pearl Harbor, Petersburg, German Forests, French Country, Operation Overlord, multiplayer style, where you can pilot lots of vehicles, and use a little team commands, then sir, Battlefield 1942 is really what you should be playing across that 1MB connection you got jacked into that modem.So limiting by its nature of being a multiplayer only game, with a difficult install, that is quite old'ish by today's standards, still manages to provide the best World War II multiplayer entertainment you have ever seen with Operation Flashpoint beating it for realism and detail as a simulation, but this is the war game that people play online, and it still has quite a large community, meaning plenty of 60 (30/30) servers are still up and running with Battlefield 2 coming out sometime in 2005 (hopefully early) you can still live with getting this just because it offers world war II as you want to play it, on-line. I must say that even though I am an avid CS:S player, this one has stolen it for a bit. Battlefield 1942 really is worth it, after you get it running, and after you have the patients to actually play it like a solider ---- crawl for 2 minutes before sniping 3 enemy over the space of 10 minutes with guys above you on a score of 44... patients is the virtue while playing this if you want to win.... Or if you have the skill, grab a bomber and go drop some bouncers on a spawn building for mass kill. Personally I prefer to play to the sneaking sniper. You know I 0wned u. &#61514;Pros:- Multiplayer must-have.- Fairly realistic simulation experience that you will play again and again.- The only World War II simulation worth playing on-line right now.- Good game engine. Solid playing.- Replaces Operation Flashpoint as best on-line war simulation game.- Really big player numbers of servers.Cons:- Harsh reality of enduring install problems and updates.- Expensive.- Needs broadband.- Spawn points have exploit bugs.- No voice-com.- Not much of a team communication interface either.- 2002 graphics... but still nice. Models need work.- There is a bit of a learning curve.- Not as vast as Operation Flashpoint.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

Why?  Because I COULDN'T see the screen!  It got to a point where in broad daylight, riding in the car, I'd need to turn on the snake light to see (which causes a glare itself).  It's always had great games, great graphics, and great sound.  But the problem is, it's always been difficult to play all of those awsome games on the Game Boy Systems.  Well, the new and improved GameBoy Advance SP, replacing the less than 2-year old GBA (GameBoy Advance), is a HUGE improvement for one simple reason.  Here's a sort of preview of Nintendo's latest GameBoy:Facts: The GameBoy SP is the most sophisticated and stylish handheld system ever to be released.  It has a folding screen, and when folded, is smaller than even the current Game Boy Advance, and claims to fit \"perfectly\" into one's pocket.  The system itself is powered by a battery, which has ten hours of gameplay and is rechargable, taking only 3 hours to recharge.What else is new?  It has a frontlight, making it possible too *gasp* see the screen!  It makes all the colors and details hard to usually make out in past GameBoy games crystal clear on your screen, so u can play it anywhere, anytime.  Even at night in a pitch black room!  You don't need to use endless batteries anymore, as the GBA: SP recharges itself after 3 hours for 10 whole hours of fresh use (this includes using the light).  When the screen is turned OFF (light), the battery lasts an additional 8 hours, meaning u can play your GBA: SP without tripple AAA batteries for up 18 hours after it's recharged.  That's a HUGE improvement!The GameBoy Advance: SP plays all Game Boy games ever made, so u can trade in all of your GameBoy systems and play all of your favorite games (including Pocket, Color, and of course, Advance GameBoys) on the same system, NOW WITH LIGHT.  See why u have to get this!?1) The system is actually smaller than the GBA, and fits perfectly into your pocket.2) You can play thousands of games on the GameBoy Advance: SP.  Every GameBoy game ever made works on this sytem.  It's time to get the old Mario's and Zelda's and Pokemons's out!3) It will be released in 2 colors ONLY at launch: Platinum and Cobalt.4) The system features a front light (so u can now c your games), and a built in battery.  So u can play for up to 10 hours with the front light, then recharge at the hotel, and play for 10 hours on the trip the next day.Well, this is the FIRST Game Boy system I've actually counsidered buying.  No batteries, a front light, and u can play all those games u were playing 8 years ago.  Could it get any better?Well, I hope I gave u a few facts, and proved to you that NO, this is not another GameBoy, or even just an add-on from GameBoy Advance.  This is a new and improved GameBoy people, and will be available everywhere March 23, 2003 (North America only).(Notes: The GameBoy Advance will NOT be discontinued, but will continue to be manufactered and sold by Nintendo.  Don't worry GBA owners, you can still play and buy your GBA games.Oh, one more thing.  Game Boy Advance: (SP) (stands for *Special Project*).)Thx!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2003"}

If you start to get cheesy and perform the same tricks over and over (my case), you will start to get rated: TAME OR STALE.  The nicer and more advanced the trick than you can get a nice FRESH logo!  The \"fresher\" the trick, the more boost (nitrous) and points you will receive.At first you will find that you are gunning it because you want to stay ahead of the pack... when that tires you start to dig deeper so that you can truly perform the \"freshest\" tricks possible.

Madden is NOTORIOUS for having such Boring presentation so it doesnt suprise me. not to mention the lack of new modes. youv got Franchise...which they should just call Head Coach 09. if you played that game, thats basically what the franchise mode is..and that MIGHT hold you over for a few days. theres Superstar mode...which is interesting...but since 06, they havnt really done anything NEW to that mode at all. there is NOTHING ELSE TO DO but practice and play games in Superstar mode...thats it...thats all. they could have done ALOT with the Superstar mode and made it SPECTACULAR...and even promoted that mode as maddens Main Attraction...because it has the potential to be something Phenomenal..but i guess recycling is good for the environment :) also, some of the tackling physics are Horrible. 1 man pushing 3 guys in pro tak moments, smaller players COMPLETELY TRUCKING THROUGH 340lb linemen, defenders \"shifting\" by ball carriers right Infront of them and O-Linemen Not Blocking, just to name a few. if a RB is running down the sideline and i position my man to Bump Him Out...i shouldnt SLIDE OFF OF HIM AND FALL TO THE GROUND :l he should just be Bumped Out. thats called REALLL FOOTBALLL. and there are WAYYY TOO MANYYY \"Slip and Slide\" missed tackle moments...where u just gracefully slide off of the runner like he has Chicken Grease on his jersey. it was enough to annoy me when i saw it happen to 3 of my men in a row on 1 play. thats when i put the controller down.end of the day, this is basic x and o, A and B football. nothing new...nothing really exciting...and Gameplay Wise, a step Back from 09. i personally say stick to 09, which has a dramatically Better and More Exciting gaming engine...and is the best Madden since 99/2000. or get NFL2K5 :) &lt;- iv got 3 copies of that game...because it is the BEST. watch me get 30 thumbs down for that comment alone :p ONLY BUY THIS GAME if you really think you will enjoy it ONLINE. this game is NOT going to hold u a WEEK on single player modes alone. atleast online, you can have a Blast laughing at your opponent when you shed 7 of his defenders and take it in for 6...iLL .","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2009"}

They are functional but can get annoying when your trying to hit the enemies in different angles only for them to constantly block but at the same time I think this was intentional so the game isn't too easy. And the game is easy thanks to the godess fi by your side, this is the easiest zelda game I've ever played sometimes i had to slow down and make it hard for myself to have a challenge. You'll rarely get game overs. And the text for some reason is painfully slow, maybe because this the only zelda game with a lot of exposition thanks to the godess fi who I feel talks way too much and states the obvious often. You'll want to hold down A most of the time.Even though I nitpicked, I gave it a perfect score because the overall experience is a zelda game experience that only nintendo can deliver and its a must have for any wii owner.

{"product_name":"B0022TNO7S","description":"","reviewerName":"Terrence A. \"cinemaparker@twitter\"","summary":"My newfound obsession with Max Payne 3","reviewText":"THE SHORT REVIEW:Max Payne 3 is quite easily the best of the series so far and sets the bar very high for any other third person shooters released here on out with both the single player and multiplayer elements of the game.THE SLIGHTLY MORE DETAILED REVIEW:Setting the story in Brazil was a great move on the part of the designers. After two games set in and around New York City, MP3 trades in those old duds for a livelier, more robust world that sucks you in right from the beginning with its colorful palette and insanely detailed reproductions of favelas and the overall Brazilian cityscape. Even though the choice to set this in Brazil was met with raised eyebrows by many gamers including myself when it was initially announced, Rockstar proves that this was a gamble that was totally worth taking the risk on.Max works his way through an incredibly bleak tale of failure, betrayal and ultimately, redemption. I liked the arc of the story very much and it definitely surprised me on several occasions, especially during the moments where I thought I knew what was coming and was completely shocked by what ended up happening. Seriously, there were moments where the insanity unfolding before my eyes left me wide eyed and slack jawed with shock. Kind of glad to see that MP3 has moved away from the first two games in the series storywise and didn't try to shoehorn characters or plot elements from the originals. There's hardly any looking back, save for some flashback moments that explain just what happened to get Max Payne heading over to Brazil in the first place. All we need to know is that Max is totally screwed up and still trying to get over the terrible events from before with the help of plenty of painkillers and booze. One thing about the way the story is told is that it reminded me a lot of a couple of films, namely Tony Scott's \"Man on Fire\" and \"Domino\" and also the amazing \"City of God\" directed by Fernando Meirelles. When you start the game, you may be a little distracted by the crazy subtitles and the video glitching you see happening quite often but after a while, you accept it as part of the medium and as another way to get you involved in Payne's story.The graphics are gorgeous and everything looks fantastic. Make no mistake, games don't get much more visceral than this. It's pretty violent and really, you've never seen people get shot up in a game the way that they do here. Bullet time is present once again to slow things down and there really aren't too many experiences more satisfying than emptying your weapon into some idiot's face and body while he jiggles around in slow motion and blood spatters everywhere like a Peckinpah or Woo film. A friend of mine watching me play asked me if those moments ever get old and I'll tell you the same thing I told him.\"HELL NO!\"The sound is also wonderful, utilizing the surround speakers (if you use those) to full effect, immersing you in gunfire, screams and explosions throughout the game. The character animation deserves special mention as it's some of the most detailed I've ever seen in a video game. Max looks and feels like a man his age and while he controls a tad slower than his younger self, he controls pitch perfect. As usual, Rockstar delivers a title with an incredible amount of polish and it shows. There's hardly a hitch between any two actions that Max can perform and it creates an incredible seamless experience that translates over to the cut scenes as well. The action will stop for a second while the story plays out and when the cut scene is over, it'll finish in a way where you're right back in it with no pause in flow. If you've played Mass Effect 3, it kind of does the same thing but there's a slight pause right before you're able to play again. MP3 has no such break and technically, it's very impressive and something you really don't see. In terms of difficulty, you can expect to die quite a bit but it's always fair deaths and never frustrating, even if you have to repeat a scene several times because they keep taking you out.The soundtrack provided by the band HEALTH is good enough that I downloaded it last night (Max Payne 3 Official Soundtrack). MP3 is already intense; the music makes it even more so.The nice surprise with this title is that the multiplayer component is off the wall. This is the game that Stranglehold wishes it could have been. It plays just about the same as the main game but it's so polished and so deep and so much fun to play that I would recommend the game on the basis of the multiplayer alone. The competition is fierce and in a room full of 15 other people, it's a combined performance of mayhem, violence and \"Did I really just do that?\" moments. And to think that this is a taste of what we're going to be getting with Grand Theft Auto V... I can't wait!RECOMMENDED?Oh, most certainly. This may not be everyone's cup of tea but if you're a fan of Rockstar games like the Grand Theft Auto series, Red Dead Redemption or games from other studios like Mercenaries, you'll go bananas over this. This game takes everything the first two did and amps everything up to the highest levels. It's polished to a shine and simply one of the most fun games I've ever purchased. This is without a doubt my favorite game of the moment.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2012"}

First, you'll find a story which masterfully weaves between 3 different races in grand, interstellar conflict, with a cast of hundreds.  This story comes to you in movies, in briefings, and in the game itself, such that you actually play the story, and react against it (or drive it forward).  I've played this game from start to finish 4 times now, just to relive the amazing tale.But Starcraft is a strategy game, and its strategy is so deep you could spend years exploring it (and people -have- been playing this game for years!)  The three different races play in different styles.  The Zerg &quot;grow&quot; their bases and attack in overwhelming numbers, winning thru overkill. The noble Protoss conjure their buildings out of thin air, and their armies are often small, very tough, and invisible.  The Terrans are the happy medium, with a little bit of everything.Also of note are the wonderful graphics (still potent after 3-4 years), and of course, that biting Blizzard humor, which shows itself in the peculiar comments that your soldiers make.  There is so much polish and shine on this game, it's no wonder it was a best seller for years and years.This package includes the orginal game Starcraft and its rather weak expansion pack, Brood War.  All the lavish praise I gave above was for Starcraft, but if you want to save some money, you can probably do without Brood War, as it only includes about 6 new units, which hardly changes the way the game plays.

The environments are varied and look great, the animation is good, and the comic element that made the 1st installment just that little bit more fun is still there.  The weapons are great, too.The camera works fine and rarely refuses to let you get the view you want, and most of the game can be figured out without having to restort to a walk-through.But, there are two major annoyances.  The first, and smaller of the two, are the hovercar races. If you're not in 1st place by the end of the first 10 seconds, you may as well start over.  I really, really dislike the races.  The second is the amount of money (bolts) it takes to buy weapons.  They are quite expensive and the only way to earn bolts at any decent rate to buy them is to play the arena games or hovercar races over and over and over and over.  Each time you play a race or arena level the amount of winnings drops, so you can't just pick one or two and fill up.Plus, there's an area where you can get \"all\" your weapons from the 1st R&C; game for free (if you have a completed R&C; on your memory card), but they don't give you the RYNO, and it's ONE MILLION BOLTS.  I'm sorry, but the arena games and races are not the answer to this.It also takes some weapons forever to upgrade, even ones you use a great deal.  So you end up between a rock and a hard place:  You have to use a weapon for it to upgrade (you can see the scale move on the weapon icon), but then you have to keep spending to reload (free ammo isn't rare, but you don't always get what you want); which takes you farther and farther from affording better weapons.In short, the hovercar races are rare, so if it weren't for the money/buying weapons problem this game would get 5 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2004"}

It taught me that even adults can love cartoons.  Since then, I've been obsessed with the Toy Story universe.  On first glance at this game, it's just another video game adaptation of a movie and should be looked over.  But the voice inside my head said what the heck and bought it.  I am not disappointed.  The game play is sandbox, like the Grand Theft Auto games (only no violence or sex) and you get to choose from a wide variety of characters.  Of course, I chose Buzz Lightyear.  There is always something to do in this game as on top of sandbox, it kind of runs like The Sims in that you can build some buildings and customize them.  The graphics are nothing short of impressive, either.  If you're any sort of fan of the movies, even in the least, get this game and you will not be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2010"}

Daneker","summary":"Medocre Port","reviewText":"For the 25th anniversary of NES's classic game Nintendo decided to use an earlier anniversary edition and simply give it to use through the Wii console. Well, fairly pointless really. What you get here is neither the original games nor a great upgrade, in fact you could just play the cartage for any old SNES system, same thing.Graphics: The Wii is a 480p system, painfully outdated when it arrived on store shelves so can you expect much of an upgrade? Yes. Do you get it? No. There are many computer emulators that play these 4 games in 16:9 widescreen effortlessly and also sharpen and clean up the graphics, for Nintendo to neglect this was a crime. What's worse, the original NES graphics are not here either, these are the SNES edition only. To have offered both a 16:9 upgrade and the original NES graphics would have been worth every penny, but to just port an old cartridge to a disk and sell it as something new is a crime.Sound: Again, the SNES stereo sound track, nor original mono, no upgrade to 5.1. So it neither feels new or vintage.Control: Here the ball was dropped the worse. These games where hell to play with that idiotic square control in the 80's, it's not much better now. One, the Wii controller is no more comfortable, two, the better controllers do not have customizable keys. The other issue here is that the control itself is clunky. Jumping is stiff, characters keep moving when they land from a jump and are generally not very responsive. Most of the lost lives are due to the crappy control. Anyone who plays these games then Super Mario World will note the 100%  improvement from parts 1,2 &3 to part 4.Summery. Graphics are neither vintage or updated, sound is bland and not the original or a new mix and the control is just as clunky now as ever. This is not a Wii update, it's actually better on an original SNES console. Not worth buying.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2011"}

A game comes out that is on everyone's top 10 list, it's practically raved about and you try it and you sit there going \"so when's the awesomeness going to kick in?\". God of War to me is pretty much the only game I'm interested in right now(besides Jade Empire and Conker but I don't have an Xbox) so I tried it out and it's not the greatest game ever, but it's still fun for what it is.Story: Kratos, this pale, scar-riddled man takes a plunge off Mount Olympus as he can't deal with his inner demons any more. The narrator decides to show you what led him to do this. 3 weeks earlier, Kratos was giving a mission: defeat the god Ares and the troubles and nightmares of Kratos past will be relieved.Graphics: It's funny when people say it looks like an Xbox title cause while I don't find a lot of Xbox games to get excited over, their graphical capabilities are quite a force. God of War has nice pretty polished graphics. It also nicely details the gruesome deaths you're likely to unleash on your enemies.Sound/Music: The soundtrack is sweet. Big epic scores worthy of a Hollywood score. The voice acting is alright, whoever did Kratos does his part well but it's not a huge standout that made me laugh and emphasize with him like Prince of Persia.Gameplay: To me, it's pretty much a Devil May Cry style engine but with different attacks and spells and graphics set to a greek mythology view rather than a dark gothic look. You got 2 main attacks: medium and strong which you'll be pretty much going back and forth throughout the game. When you grab you have 3 options: square stabs the enemy and throws him around the room and possibly hitting the others; triangle is the more gruesome as Kratos grabs his enemy's waist and rips the guy in 2 while circle just throws him to the ground and repeatedly stabs him. You get new attacks as you upgrade DMC style like uppercuts and rush attacks.You also get magic spells like Zeus's lightning or the ability to hold Medusa's head and shine it on enemies turning them to stone than shattering them. Boss fights are quite a thing to see...the little you see of them anyway. Also extremely cool is that certain enemies have different death options. Some enemies only have the aforementioned button ones but some are unique and equally gruesome. The minotaur death is where you have to press O repeatedly, if you get it, you stab him right through the mouth. You can rip the wings off these bat guys or rip the arm off this other one and beat him to death. This is definately not one for the kiddies.It's not revolutionary as a game title and it's certainly not the best thing in gaming but still if you're looking for something, can't go wrong with this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2005"}

What I got was an adventure-type story game, with a great fighting aspect in it, as well.Setting-The Lilty kingdom holds dominion over all over tribes, but they aren't evil.  However, the Selkie tribe bears a grudge against them, and refuses to live with them by living on land apart from the Lilty tribe.  The Clavats are a peace-loving tribe that tries to get along with everyone.  The last tribe, the Yuke tribe, vanished years ago, never to be found.  You play as Layle, a Clavat crystal-bearer.  A crystal bearer has a crystal embedded in them, giving them powers for them to use for good or evil.Story-While you are escorting an airship, it is attacked by a Yuke, who steals the crystal power from the airship then takes off.  You chase after the Yuke, using your powers to try to find out why it stole the crystal's power and what it plans to do with the crystal's power.Gameplay-The gameplay is a little hard to learn, but once you do learn it, it's quite easy.  You use the attached nunchuk to move around, and you use the wiimote to pick up items/people/monsters using your mind.  This is your \"special ability\" because of being a crystal bearer.  You can then throw the item you picked up at anything you would like to by using a flick of your wrist, allowing you to break open things and attack monsters.  In fact, throwing monsters and throwing things at monsters are the only ways to fight in this game.  However, you are not required to fight in this game (except for special, main battles); that is not how you level up.  You level up by finding items and money and having moogles (white, flying creatures) make things such as amulets for you, in order to raise attack, defense, luck, and more.  However, the majority of the game is to go from town to town defeating \"main\" enemies, following the Yuke, and basically keeping the story going.Graphics-The graphics are very well done in this game.  From the backgrounds to the tiniest details, these pictures are beautiful.Sound-The music is nicely done in this game, overall, but it does get a bit boring, as the same songs are repeated over and over.  The voice acting is very nicely done, as well.Fun-This game is really fun.  Whether you enjoy fighting or following an adventure story, this game will be great fun.  It isn't boring like the gamecube version; instead, it has a very interesting story and nice combat.Length-The one reason I took off a star is because of the length.  Although, some people have said it lasted longer for them, it only took me about 15 hours to complete this game.  That was really short, in my opinion, and unfortunately, I don't feel a strong need to replay the game.  There are some extra goals that will keep some gamers playing after the final battle, such as finding the hidden item here, or using this monster to defeat this monster, but as for the main story, it is over rather quickly.All in all, I recommend this game to most gamers.  It isn't hardcore fighting like some of the games in the Final Fantasy series, but it has a great story with some really fun combat options.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2010"}

Last Christmas, one of my friends got me this game. I got bored with it not long after turning it on, and I didn't really contemplate playing it again until a couple of days ago. It's actually a pretty fair game with a lot to offer, but it also has some serious problems.Basically, it's an adventure game. You're a Crystal Bearer named Layle. As a Crystal Bearer, Layle has extraordinary abilities. He soon gets caught in-between this robot's struggle to revive a dying race and all this other stuff. It's pretty interesting, storywise anyway.The Good:1) A fully interactive environment: I was pretty impressed that your character can interact so many objects throughout the world.2) Tons of achievements: The actual game is very short, but you could spend forever and a day working to get 100% completion on the achievements.3) Very good cinematics and voice-acting.4) Some of the achievements are quite interesting. For example, when you get off of a certain train, there's a woman falling down steps atop a barrel. If you're quick enough, you can prevent her crash landing with your Crystal Bearer power.5) Some very good Wii graphics. It's certainly one of the better looking games on the console.The Bad:1) Mini-game Festival: Instead of engaging in routine battles like you normally would in a Final Fantasy game, the vast majority of this game plays out through mini-games. But to their credit, they're integrated very well into the game's storyline.2) It's quite short. I'd be a tad upset if I'd paid $50 for this game.3) Your character only has one attack. Granted, it's used in a wide variety of ways, but the Final Fantasy universe should allow for him to have a more interesting arsenal.4) There's not a good way to grind for money in this game. The most reliable method I found was playing the mini-games. There are treasure chests, but there's not enough in there to get the good equipment for your character. (a smaller gripe: equipment is totally unnecessary)Despite everything that's wrong with it, I really do kind of like Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: The Crystal Bearers. If you found it for $20 or so, I'd recommend it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2012"}

The added a couple classic suits back to the game like the fire flower and the raccoon which is a joy to see and they also added some new ones like the boomerang suit which is extremely fun! The only thing i don't like about this game is the music they went from an orchestra in the galaxy games and retro remixes of new super Mario bros to just ughh i cant even explain but that's just my opinion and shouldn't be that big of a deal. To me the game is feeling to be a bit short seems like their are only 4 levels + bonus' to every world but like most Mario games it gets alot harder on the later worlds and i haven't played enough to fully judge the length of the game.

When the Dead Kennedys share the same set list as Iron Maiden and Winger you know that an eclectic representation is what they had in mind. The guitar FX are crunchy and varied throughout the tracks and other than the songs sung by the original artists, the background band is weaker than in previous entries.  The actual controls themselves feel slighty tweaked and shifting chords feels easier than in the other 2 as well.  This should have retailed at a lower price considering the # of songs but as this will be one of the last GHs on PS2 its worth picking for the nostalgia and fun factor, if you can wait for the $ to drop the skimpy trimmings on offer will be easier to swallow.  5 to 10 more songs would have gone a LONG way here.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2007"}

THis is my third Xbox now and they seemed to have finally fixed the heat issue with a newer processor and more heat sinks. Xbox is brilliant; the exclusive titles are excellent, and the multi platform titles are superior on Xbox in my opinion. I have a PS3 too for Blu-ray and Sony's exclusive games, but I prefer the Xbox controller and Xbox live for COD4, AC2 etc.....and of course they have the Mass Effect series.So with such a brilliant system, why do I give it three stars? Well for starters, they charge for Xbox live. I realize that the service is a little better than Sony's and I enjoy it a lot, but the fees seem a little excessive. Especially considering the amount of problems it encounters with big game releases.The other gripe I have is that there's no integrated wifi connection. Seriously? Even the DS can connect to the internet, but my $300 Xbox needs a CATV cable. I've had the wireless adapter for a couple of years now and I had to pay an extra $100 bucks for it; that's absolutely insane considering it's free with all of the other gaming systems. Now they've come up with an N type adapter and they want another $100 from me; Not this time Microsoft. Fool me once...etcFinally, I had to pay $200 for my HD player add on that is no longer supported. It's not exactly Microsofts fault that their format failed, but they sold me an obsolete feature and I have 15 HD titles; I'll take your apololgy now Microsoft. At the very least, I would expect you to accept defeat, create a Blu-ray drive and allow people who purchased the HD drive to trade it in. This is the repsonible thing to do. I thought that was the intent of not integrating the HD drive originally was so that if they lost the war then they could just make a Blu-ray one and still allow their system to have an HD movie functionality. Ehhh..whatever then; I had to buy the PS3 to play new movies.So, what's the total damage:1) $400 for original Xbox 3602) Waiting a month to get a replacement (replacement failed too)3) $400 for third Xbox 360 with two worthless games4) $200 for obolete HD drive5) $100 for WiFi adapter6) $60 in replacement microphones made way too cheap7) $50 in replacement rechargable batteries that all failed mysteriously and stopped recharging8) $50 a year for Xbox live (4 years) = $200Total: $1410 for my Xbox gaming experienceOh yeah, $300 for the PS3 to play HD movies after Microsoft backed format bombedPS3 hasn't had any issues, and Uncharted 2/ Killzone 2 were great.I still prefer the Xbox 360 and would gladly pay another $1400 to continue playing, but I just want to make sure that potential purchasers of anything Microsoft are prepared to get screwed.Some people have been really lucky and are still using the original Xbox without issues and connect CATV straight to it since their Router is near by.

After a rather interesting comic book prologue that plays as the game is downloading, the main game opens in a place called Sky City (think Tokyo meets the Jetsons) where CIA agent Sonia is asking around for Ryu Hayabusa because she needs his assistance with a little Fiend problem. She's then ambushed by Black Spider Ninjas, but then everyone's favorite Dragon Ninja shows up and gives chase to Sonia's captors. The story in this game is actually more interesting this time around, but it's still not Oscar winning material either. As we all know by now, Ninja Gaiden is all about sword swinging, shuriken throwing, fireball launching action. Once again, I never played the X-box version, so don't expect any comparisons between that and the PS3 version in this review. In a move that earned the ire of the series' hardcore (a.k.a. insanely masochistic) fans, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 is a much less difficult game than the one that came before it, but not because they dumbed-down the ferocious enemy AI. Instead, improvements have been made on Ryu himself: he controls more smoothly, he takes less damage from enemy attacks, he regains a portion of his health after defeating a group of enemies, he transitions between dodging and attacking more quickly, his Ultimate Techniques charge more quickly, and he can aim his arrows from an over-the-shoulder perspective and even move around while firing them. These improvements make this game much less of a frustrating chore than the previous one, especially the fact that Ryu can sustain a lot more punishment. In this game Ryu can take several sword swings to the face and lose about a quarter of his health to maybe half of it, while in the first Ninja Gaiden Ryu loses 75% of his health if he stubs his toe.As a result, there's now more margin for error on the part of the player when fighting enemies, so less hardcore, yet experienced gamers like myself and even casual gamers will find themselves dying a lot less as they figure out how best to deal with these enemies. Make no mistake, for the most part this game is still not what most of us would call \"easy\" and there are plenty of challenging battles. If you want a more concrete comparison, then I'd say Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 is slightly more difficult than God of War and less difficult than Devil May Cry. Three other characters, all of them very buxom female warriors, are also playable in this game, but each character only has one mission. First is Momiji, a Dragon Ninja shrine maiden armed with a large naginata and a bow and arrows who is the only character that can perform a double jump. She's a more well-rounded fighter with decent speed and strong attacks. Next is Rachel, the Fiend Hunter from the first game armed with a huge war hammer. She plays much of the same as she did before (not too quick, but very strong), only now she can wall run and has a big machine gun for a ranged weapon. Last is Ayane, the little purple haired ninja who appeared in the first game only in cutscenes. She's armed with two short daggers and explosive shuriken. She's the fastest character in the game, but also the weakest. Just like in the first game, Ryu is the only character who has access to several different kinds of weapons such as a sword, a staff, twin swords, tonfas, flails, and a huge scythe, once again making Ryu the most versatile fighter in the game (although one could say that Ryu gets too many different weapons this time around). All four of the main characters fight the same collection of enemy ninjas, Fiends, and in some cases, giant moving statues (one of them a very familiar statue that hangs out in New York). As usual, you have to be quick and merciless when fighting a group of enemies, making sure to dodge, block, and attack like crazy in order to survive.One cool addition to the combat is the fact that strong or sustained attacks on enemies will usually cause them to lose limbs (legs, arms, even heads), and once that happens, the player can instantly execute those weakened enemies with the press of a button; however, if a wounded enemy gets a hold of you, they tend to use kamikaze/suicide moves that take away a decent chunk of your own health. Most of the boss fights are rather challenging, although some are almost ridiculously easy; strangely, the final boss was one of the easier ones. Even the game's graphics have improved. Environments and character models are more detailed, and the wide array of physical and ninpo attacks are flashier and more colorful. Despite these improvements, there are some things this game does that keep it from earning 5 stars. For one thing, this game is much more straightforward than the first one. There's almost no incentive to go exploring the few nooks and crannies of the levels, and the levels themselves are all completely separate from each other (some of the levels in the first game were interconnected). Even the few puzzles that broke up the monotony of the first game's constant battles have been removed from this game entirely. Normally this wouldn't bother me, but in this case it kind of does; not enough variety in the gameplay. Also, ranged weapons like arrows and explosive shuriken are now unlimited, which makes certain easy boss battles even easier than they should have been. Even upgrading weapons no longer costs you in yellow souls (your currency), instead you can only level up one weapon at a time when you visit specific upgrade statues; because of that I had over 100,000 yellow souls by the game's halfway point, so I didn't really have to worry about running out of currency to buy healing items.Fortunately, this game only allows you to hold three of each restorative item that will replenish your health and ki (magic). While that may not sound like much, trust me when I say that if you could hold more of those items at one time then this game really would be much too easy, especially since your health is fully replenished the first time you save your game at each save point. The camera isn't quite as bad in this game as it was in the first one, but there will be times when it goes pretty nuts when Ryu fights enemies in tight spaces. Despite the fact that many limbs are cut off of enemies at a pretty regular rate, there's not that much blood in this game, instead most of what comes out of an enemy's grievous wounds is a purple mist with a few splatters of blood here and there. This isn't really much of a con, but it's worth pointing out (on a side note, blood is left on Ryu's weapons after he kills an enemy and it will remain there unless Ryu stands still for a couple of seconds, after which he will automatically shake the blood off his weapons... I just thought it was kind of cool). Overall, this game is indeed less frustrating than the first one, making it more enjoyable to a certain degree, although they kind of went overboard with the \"easiness\" in some respects. Still, I appreciate that Team Ninja decided to make this game more accessible to gamers who don't enjoy dying 20 times before defeating a boss on the second level. Most \"hardcore\" fans despise the fact that this game is less difficult, but I don't care, they could always play on a higher difficulty level. I for one am glad I didn't have to yell and curse my way through most of this game. Casual gamers who are interested in this series should probably start with Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 first, and then try the first Ninja Gaiden Sigma if they're feeling up to it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005ML10","description":"One of the most anticipated titles in PlayStation2 history absolutely  lives up to the hype.Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Libertyis the  follow-up to one of the most captivating and intelligent adventures on the original  PlayStation. Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M. PadillaPros:One of the best and most complex stories in gamingOutstanding graphics with many interactive elementsExcellent soundtrack and voice actingCons:Long periods of watching instead of playingSome extraneous dialogueSolid Snake may inspire gamers to grow mullets","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"not too good","reviewText":"Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty is the sequel to the innovative original MGS game that appeared on the Playstation One. Even though the game is quite fun, I probably prefer the original. Here's why:- First of all, the amount of cutscenes in this game are *incredibly* high. I'd say you have TWICE as many cutscenes to deal with in this game compared to the original. True, these cutscenes might end up telling a good story (if you actually have the patience to watch them all) but it doesn't really excite me on a personal \"overall video game experience\" level. Years from now the only thing I will remember about Sons of Liberty will be all the cutscenes I had to sit through, or skip (if I chose to do so). To make matters worse, many times I'm interrupted with spoken conversations during critical moments where I REALLY can't afford to be interrupted, such as during a moment when I'm trying to find the best way to eliminate a guard blocking an important path. I can't be distracted during these moments, and that's a shame. This was never a problem in the original.- Sons of Liberty is just about the same length as the previous MGS game (if you choose to skip all the cutscenes, that is). I'm serious. A sequel is ALWAYS supposed to be a longer and more interesting game. However, this is not the case with the Metal Gear Solid series. I can beat this game in 2 hours and 30 minutes. I can beat the original in 2 hours and 20 minutes. So it's only about 10 minutes longer overall. I'm not happy about that at all.- The very reason the original Metal Gear Solid is a much better game overall is because of this- the boss fights. In Sons of Liberty you only have 5 or 6 boss fights total, and none of them are very creative or interesting. What's up with that? One fight has you shooting between crates trying to locate and eliminate the enemy. It's fun, but not THAT great. Certainly not sequel-worthy, in my opinion.Another boss fight has you running from the first to second level shooting stingers at the enemy. This is sort of fun. Another boss fight has Snake diffusing bombs. I don't particulary care for this one because for the majority of the first half of the game it seems like you're going around making sure bombs don't go off in certain places. I don't want to continue doing the same thing during a boss fight. It also seems like there's an exceptionally long period between the first and second boss fight.In the original you had up to 11 or 12 boss fights, and they were more creative than the ones here, too. You had a helicopter battle, a sniper fight where you had to guide missiles through a winter forest to find the sniper, a battle with a large army tank, a fight with a ninja, a really fun fight with a HUGE mechanical robot where you were required to take down the big thing with stinger missiles, and more. The boss fights in Sons of Liberty come up short and feel uninspired compared to the original Metal Gear Solid.However, the one thing this game does better is that the guards you encounter are MUCH smarter this time around. You can't just walk by them- they will easily see and kill you if you dare to attempt that. This game encourages you to find the correct way to deal with each of the guards that happen to be in your way. Sometimes you have to stun them, and drag them out of the way because other guards might walk by and spot their dead bodies, and then suddenly a search for you will go out, which would then require you to find a way to get out of there and FAST. Smarter enemies in this game are certainly a nice welcome, and probably the only thing about the game worth mentioning.Some people say that walking around in first-person view makes this game better than the original Metal Gear Solid, but I don't buy that because it seems like EVERY game nowadays has a first-person view. The original was unique.Stick with the first Metal Gear Solid game if you are given a choice between the two. It's more exciting, and thankfully doesn't feature an overkill of cutscenes in all the wrong places. That's where Sons of Liberty fails, unfortunately. Too many unnecessary interruptions. Still, it's a pretty good game. Just not the \"major improvement\" we were led to believe.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2006"}

Even if you're not a boss killer, you'll have fun with this game.  Being able to have your character scale walls and have maps with verticality is really something that other shooters don't have.

The action is always fast and there's constant chaos everywhere.Now, I did play the beta extensively so I knew the strategies of the game somewhat.  However, I didn't get my copy of Titanfall right away so by the time I started playing the final retail version, many gamers out there had already leveled up significantly which put me at a significant disadvantage.  But now that I've leveled up somewhat, that disadvantage is slowly going away as I have unlocked more weapons and abilities (to match the abilities and weapons I had when in the beta).  You will likely get killed a lot until you can unlock the weapons.  But once you do, the game is amazing.The game hasn't had a perfect launch (seems like most games these days need to get patched after release), but it's still surprisingly robust of a game of this caliber and it's already being patched quickly by Respawn (PC needed the update first).Every generation, there are certain games that make you fall in love with a system.

If I said that about most games I'm sure I'd be giving it 5 stars, but Bioshock set a standard that was very difficult to match, much less surpass.  I would say (and most seem to agree) one of the best parts of the original game was the sense of discovery in exploring Rapture.  I remember many times thinking things like: \"What is this place?  What was that?  What the heck is going on here?\"  Bioshock 2 really doesn't have those \"whoa\" moments, as everything is for the most part all too familiar.  Clearly the developers for the first Bioshock realized this and decided to go in a different direction with Infinite.  Perhaps that makes Bioshock 2 more or less \"let's make some money\" filler material, but even given that it's still a very good game.  I loved Bioshock, and ultimately greatly enjoyed Bioshock 2...it's greatest sin was in having followed one of the most original games on any next-gen console.

Definitely play it if you have never given it a try.This sequel is way better than the already excellent first game. The single player, although not long compared to the average video game these days, is much longer than the original. In addition, there is a whole cooperative mode that is as long as the single player. This can be played online or locally. The puzzles are significantly more complicated now, requiring the player to use many new features such as repulsion gel, thermal discouragement beams (read: lasers), and many others. All of these new tools greatly add to the fun and depth of the gameplay.The story is unsurprisingly a continuation of the first one, with the return of the delightfully mad GLaDOS, who is less than happy with how you treated her in the last game. Her character is as funny as ever, and is only made more entertaining by the addition of Wheatley, another comical and insane A.I., and Cave Johnson (voiced by J.K. Simmons). Each character is hilarious and entertaining.All in all the only downside to this game is an inevitable one; low replay value.

I even tried to love it. But I couldn't, and here is why:1. DRM that sucks the life out of everything good the game has to offer. We as consumers have got to stop accepting this garbage. It limits playability, prevents legitimate use of the game we purchased, and treats the consumer as \"guilty until proven innocent.\" I really wish I had NOT bought this game for that one reason. Never again will I give my money for a product with DRM.2. Poorly ported. As many others have noted, the camera that follows Shepherd around is frustrating, and doesn't allow for the immersive quality of a first person view.3. Control of the rover vehicle thing is clumsy and frustrating. The physics on planet surfaces is so poor that I didn't want to do many of the side quests. You can drive up nearly vertical surfaces, bounce hundreds of feet down the sides of mountains without suffering any damage, all using slippy controls that don't feel right for a bad-*** personnel carrier.4. Many sound bugs. The processing of sound in this game is horrible. The sound fades out during many of the movie sequences. The only option is to turn on subtitles, which hurts immersion into the game. At other points in game sound glitches cause ambient noise to disappear while shooting a weapon, or the opposite, so that you only hear ambient sound, and muffled or nonexistent weapons fire. I have a extremly high quality sound card, theAuzentech X-Fi Preludeso this is NOT due to my system. Even the recently released patch does not solve this issue.5. Inconsequential rewards for accomplishing side objectives. There are two levels to this. The first is that if you take the time to find all the rare earths, gases, metals, etc., you are rewarded with nothing more than cash. That would be fine if there was anything worth buying with it. However, once you're level 25+ all of the weapons you can buy are either the same, or inferior to what you already have. The mission based side quests provide little reward also. There are very few bosses, and they never drop weapons or equipment that is specialized or unique. I was hoping that side quests would allow access to weapons and armor that were otherwise unavailable. Unfortunately, that isn't the case. Other than being a completenic, there is no reason to pursue side quests at all.6. Short main campaign. The main campaign can be completed in 20 hours or less. That would be fine if side quests were more rewarding, but they're not (see #5). I liked the main campaign quite a bit, and thought the story was fairly interesting, but it would have been nice if the story took less of a linear path. What I mean by that (given that you can choose to go to the planets in any order) is it would have been interesting if the game required you to return to planets you had previously visited (other than the Gate) for additional objectives/story arcs. For example, a mission that required you to travel to several different planets. The main campaign would not have been disappointing in the slightest if they had made it less linear.So all that said, why 3 stars and not 1? Because the game is not a total failure. The storyline is much better than average, the voice acting and writing is of a very high quality, and the combat is pretty fun. This game is not a failure, it is just not that great. It doesn't deserve 1 star anymore than it deserves 5.Again, the principle reason NOT to buy this game is the awful DRM that infests it. We as gamers and consumers need to show that we will NOT accept crippled games that we are essentially leasing. We need to put our money where our mouths are and avoid these games until their makers start to pay attention. If enough of us refuse to buy games with DRM, eventually they will get rid of it.The principle reason to buy the game are quality writing and acting, a good storyline, and entertaining combat sequences.***Whenever I write a review that mentions DRM, I like to give a plug for Amazon. They have DRM free music downloads. If you're going to buy digital music, buy them from Amazon.***","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2008"}

It's (yet another) first person shooter (FPS) set in New York and the alternate reality of the Darkness - a demon which posses your character at the start of the story.There's a lot that this game does have going for it - the facial graphics are really outstanding.  The levels designed in the hellish alternate reality of the demon are really nightmarish.  They're a tad cliche, but well executed and I never was bored looking around in those levels.  Some of the kills (using your \"demon arm\") are strangly satisfying; although the standard \"executions\" are very poorly animated and just look plain silly.The gameplay is very standard for a FPS.  As many reviewers have noted, there are a variety of weapons; but there's rarely any reason to use any weapon other than your dual pistols.  The AI is nothing special and will generally let you hide and recoup your health and simply stand its position and let you pick them off one at a time. Since your powers depend on darkness; much of the game is spent shooting out lights.  Annoyingly, there are very few light switches to simply turn off the lights.The multiplayer on Xbox live lags something awful.  If you manage to spend more than a few minutes online, your patience is greater than mine.  This feature was probably tacked on last minute and adds nothing to the game's value.The worst part of this game is the way you have to travel from level to level.  You travel between parts of town (most often) via subway.  In the subway, you cannot kill or be killed; and it's mostly there to get you from one point to another and occasionaly move the plot.  The problem is that, often, you'll complete a mission, then go back to the subway, then have to travel to another subway station, and then go to a new level - and god help you if you take the wrong subway or get off on the wrong platform.  Each time you move from level to level there's about a minute or two loading.  The point is, after you complete a mission, it can be five or ten minutes before you're back shooting stuff up.  The pacing is maddening.This game wasn't bad for renting.  The story is mildly interesting and some of the gameplay was OK.  But this game will soon be eclipsed by other games and I seriously doubt anyone will be playing this game in six months.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2007"}

Reason being because it sort of looked like Oblivion in the few videos I saw of it, which kind of turned me off. But I decided to just try it and see if it was any good, since I enjoy a challenge. I am so happy I decided to go for it, because this game delivers better then any game I've played to date. The thing I enjoy most about this game is, yea its hard, but it also gives you the chance of balancing out the difficulty by being able to go kill mobs for a while and level your characters stats up. Like I ran into a boss that gave me a little trouble, but after a few levels I went over and dominated it. I love that they give you total control over where your stats go. So if you want to be a powerhouse, you can just pump all your points into Strength, and you'll be 1 shotting everything along the way. I played a melee character (A Knight), and I read about how magic users in the game werent made well. I however did not find this to be entirely true while playing a Magician for a few hours. If anything I very much enjoyed playing a magic class, with my only complaint being I'd run of of MP pots a little fast, but otherwise they are a blast. I'd say this is a game that anyone could enjoy if they gave it a chance, but this is based on the fact that you can level up your character, so its not as though you'll never be able to dominate the adversaries. Like when I first started playing, I had to take each enemy one at a time at a fairly slow pace so I wouldnt lose health, but once I got the feel for it, I find myself now flying from enemy to enemy just hammering through them fast as hell. Oh also, the Deluxe Edition is actually worth it. The Artbook is very beautiful and comes with the Soundtrack to the game, which was amazing. Then you get to the actual guide. It is amazing how much detail is in it. I have this game and I have Uncharted 2, and I played Uncharted 2 for about 5 hours the day I bought it, but am back onto Demon's Souls and have yet to pick up Uncharted 2 again, and I loved Uncharted 2 lol","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2009"}

This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible.

ME3 was nearly equally entertaining, but it suffered from dumber dialogues (I don't know why this happened, I was so disappointed) especially in the beginning half, and then the ending was a let down.

{"product_name":"B004FS8LYK","description":"","reviewerName":"Subject7","summary":"Lara Croft: First Blood","reviewText":"This was an incredibly fun game with a few flaws that kept it from being a perfect 5 for me. The island location is engrossing from start to finish with every nook and cranny possibly hiding something to discover. Exploration and combat is a blast thanks to butter smooth controls and very impressive audio. Lara in particular is a shining point in the game. The way she moves, her emotional and physical hardships, her child like fascination with the tombs and relics she discovers, all culminates into an engaging adventure made all the better due to the fact that she's a girl. I imagined playing this game as a male protagonist and was instantly bored. Something about a girl going from hunted to hunter on an island filled with very dangerous men makes the game so much more interesting.I only wish she wasn't quite so...emotional. Maybe I'm confusing Lara Croft with Angelina Jolie but I always assumed Lara was mischievous and adventurous in her youth. The type to scale her boarding school's wall at night to steal her principals underwear and hang it on a 50 ft flag pole, not the type to cry desperately for her dual pistol wielding daddy figure, Roth to come get her. And then there are the other characters who were bland, clich&eacute;d and forgettable. Their dialogue was simplistic and showed a lack of personality beyond black chick, asian chick, white nerd guy, etc. I also found the overall tone too serious. I understand their situation is a dire one but a bit of comedy sprinkled throughout would have made this a more fondly remembered experience. Although the game grips you from beginning to end, the plot was obvious and Lara's \"ah-ha\" moment close to the end fell flat as I'd figured it all out two hours in. Finally the game lacked unlockables, something Legends and Anniversary did quite well. I understand how impractical and dumb it would be for this Lara to be running around in a bikini but I still would have liked rewards for completing the game's many challenges, even if it were simple color swaps.Regardless, Tomb Raider is a ton of fun and one of the very few games I bought day one without regret. If you love third person action adventure games and are tired of staring at Nathan Drake's behind, then I highly recommend buying this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2013"}

Great multi player too, generally instantly accessible to people who have no or little gaming experience. In fact, this game pretty much would win over any gamer skeptic...As usual, the games tests your ability to multi-task as far as things happening on the screen; it can be no easy feat, and memorization often plays a key role in completing some levels; the tutorial option in some levels is cool for those who may need it.Huge worlds, highly re-playable(boarders on obsession at times--'just one more level' is a common phrase playing this game...), and very colorful. Lots of hidden items and mini-games too. Funny voice stuff at times, although not much. Mostly just the sound effects that you have come to know and love--from smashing bricks, power-ups, and collecting coins. Music to a gamer's ears. And the classic music, redux. Good times.Between this game and the new Ratchet & Clank, there has never been a better time to take a trip back to the concept of platformer games.So grab a few friends and some milk and cookies...or whatever(who am I to advocate what you ingest during this game...).

Don't get me wrong, Deadly Alliance is a great fighting game, the best I've ever played.  It has intricate interesting characters, unbelievably cool combat moves,  detailed backgrounds and good quality sound.  There is some long-term playability in learning combos and special moves for your favorite characters, and in unlocking hidden characters as you earn coins to go the the Krypt.  But, when it comes down to it, there is little or no strategy or planning involved.  The player is not rewarded for a well thought-out battle plan or character development, but rather how fast he/she can pound their bleeding thumbs onto the game-pad buttons.  The Konquest mode has some style combination moves that are riduculously hard to perform (you would never be able to do them in an actual fight).For pure fighting gaming I give this game 5-stars.

{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"Michael J. Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"Would you kill a child to get ahead?","reviewText":"\"Imagine that you are creating a fabric of human destiny with the object of making men happy in the end, giving them peace and rest at last, but that it was essential and inevitable to torture to death one tiny creature -- that baby beating its breast with its fist, for instance -- and to found that edifice on its unavenged tears, would you consent to be the architect on those conditions?\"--Fyodor Dostoyevsky, The Brothers Karamazov===============================================================I didn't really want BioShock.  The name didn't exactly thrill me, and the concept was a little hazy.  Some guy underwater in the 50s being attacked by weird monsters in diving suits?  What the heck was that all about? But my brother talked the game up so much that I put it on my wish list.  I got it for my birthday and was instantly hooked.BioShock has a vision, just like its creator/villain, Andrew Ryan (Armin Shimerman).  And that vision is Rapture, an underwater city built with 1940s style architecture and Ayn Rand's (note the similarities to Andrew Ryan's name) principles. You are plane crash survivor named Jack and you are trapped in a hell that was once supposed to be Eden.BioShock's central philosophical question is the plight of children.  There are Little Sisters wandering throughout the complex, little girls who have been merged with some kind of mutant parasite that allows them to process ADAM from dead bodies.  ADAM is a mutagen that bestows superpowers on whomever uses them, which puts the girls in a precarious position.  Fortunately for them, they are protected by Big Daddies, diving suit-wearing behemoths with drills and rivet guns.Running around Rapture are the shattered remains of civilization, the Splicers.  These poor people are deranged; listening to them at length is a sanity-straining experience.  Warped by their own mutations, Splicers argue with each other, weep over their fate, and of course try to kill you.  Throw in a series of automated weaponry and robots dedicated to snuffing out all who cross Ryan's path and you've got one exciting first-person shooter.BioShock is retro-sci-fi, all viewed through a 50s lens.  There are hilarious instructional videos that explain how the various mutations work, vending machines that cheerfully solicit you, and public service announcements worthy of a Leave it to Beaver episode.BioShock is well written.  The plots take twists and turns and the villains aren't who you'd think.  It's well acted too.  You meet very few sane people, but interactions are largely through old-style cassette tapes that play in creepy, grainy fashion as you stalk the halls of Rapture.  I'll still be haunted by one actor screaming, \"I CAN'T TAKE OFF THE F****ING EARS!\" over and over.The graphics are phenomenal.  Fire and water are rendered realistically, with bits of water beading on the screen.  The Splicers are all creepy, from mask-wearing debutantes to crazy doctors in surgical masks, to Spider Splicers who crawl along the ceiling. And the Big Daddies are disturbing and a little pathetic, groaning and moaning as they pound their way through Rapture.The game play is fun.  A variety of styles can be used to win the game.  Bad at combat (like me)? No problem; hack the robots and automated weapon systems using a series of tube puzzles.  I'm a sucker for puzzle games, so the hacking really hooked me and kept the game from ever getting boring.  I got really good at hacking. More than once I turned the entire security system against the bad guys.  Using the right mutations, you can be stealthy, you can just blast your way through, or you can even turn your enemies against each other.BioShock also gets all the basics of gameplay right.  If you get lost, it tells you where to go.  It helpfully lists your goals.  A map is always available.  These should be ingrained in every game created post 2000, and yet it's far too rare.But back to the Little Sisters.  The main question BioShock asks is: would you harm a little girl to get ahead?  Maybe it's just the fact that I have a newborn son, but I found the idea revolting.  You're given a choice with every Little Sister you rescue, harvesting her or saving her.  Harvesting kills the girl and garners more ADAM, while saving her gives you less ADAM but the gratitude of their creator (who gives you a gift for every three girls you save).  It struck a chord with me, and soon I was determined to save every one of the little girls.I thought this was just yet another means of BioShock hooking you into the game.  But in actuality your decisions in how you treat the Little Sisters affects BioShock's conclusion.  The Little Sisters are integral to the plot and how the game ends.  They are the future, the future Ryan claimed he wanted but could never see.Everyone else I've spoken to gleefully cracked the little girls open and took their stuff.  As one gamer put it, \"I'm a powergamer and that helped me get ahead faster, so of course I killed them.\"  I still find that notion chilling.  In fact, the very first opportunity to harm or save a Little Sister is very traumatic, with the little girl begging for her life. I couldn't bear the thought of killing one, even in a sci-fi video game.  Maybe I'm getting soft.In the end, BioShock isn't just a retro sci-fi shooter.  It's a moral test.  Of us.===============================================================\"No, I wouldn't consent,\" said Alyosha softly.--Fyodor Dostoyevsky, The Brothers Karamazov","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2008"}

Everything works perfectly with both hands controlling the action and shake of either the Wiimote or the Nun Chuck to shake the table. I also like that the games do not tilt as easily as the Gottlieb version of PBHF.The only gripe I have is I would like to see some of those acrade video games as unlockables or a hidden pinball machine or two, that is a fairly minor gripe as this is an amazing pinball collection. It just seems its awfully bare for an arcade and all those fake machines are kind of an annoyance. They could easily add a dart board or pool table as extra unlockables, just in case you want a break from Pinball. But hey this is pinball hall of fame, just putting out a few Ideas.

Now, working together with Rockstar Games' New York-based production team, Remedy has combinedMax Payne's hallmark gameplay with all new innovations and unmatched production values.Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payneis set to raise the bar for action games all over again when it's released fall 2003.","reviewerName":"Sixto Limiac","summary":"Stylishly Honorable to the Action Platform","reviewText":"I was foreign to the world of Max Payne.  Because I was not exposed to the frenzy of the detective's game back in 2001, I felt nonchalant towards the coming sequel.  Now that I have experienced the sequel, I must profess that I have been stunned, then mesmerized, and all the more thrilled to have this game land on my laptop.  Max Payne 2: The fall of Max Payne is a barrage of devilish quality saturating all through the game and then some.  From the gutsy gameplay to the direction of the story, this game falls into a certain pizzazz of stylish coolness.I can crack the code as to why the first game ignited a stir.  An action game has never felt so empowered to be reckoned as the high  octave blast that is Max Payne 2.  Playing as a pessimistic detective, you must blaze through he dark, gritty streets of New York city.  The story alone is topnotch suspense bundled with extraordinary twists and turns that'll have you gasping throughout your day.  Driven by the story, the game's focal highlight is the gameplay's Bullet Time implementation.  Heck, Max Payne is one of those games that is truly augmented by the graphics and sheer physics of the environment.  With eye-candy in every so direction, it's a joy to shoot baddies with a multitude of weapons.  Further adding to the bountiful fun, is the Havok engine which has the environment fully interactive.  There's also rag-doll effects where spectacular combat scenes are distilled in slow-motion scenes and the best part is your in control.  The gist of Max Payne 2 is the more baddies you gun down, the faster Payne is in a slow-motioned surrounding.  With the environment flinging all over the screen and the slow motion of the game setting in, it's a delight to control this gem again and again.Payne romps through New York City at its absolute darkest.  As you go guns-a-blazing, you'll notice the graphical powerhouse.  Each nook and cranny in the game is a stellar high point.  What hit's the stride even more is the detailed photo realistic textures and the maw-gaping lighting effects.  Like the story, the graphics stand on its own.  A spectacular soundtrack kicks in to add to the already fascinating atmosphere.  There are plenty of compulsive tracks, but the best part of the audio derives from the firefights where the signature sound of Payne's heart gallops as enemy gunfire sounds distorted.  Plus, the voiceovers are good and suit the personality of Payne.  The gritty comic book scenes heavily attribute to the overall atmosphere of the astounding game.  You can easily tell that the makers of the game, have put sweat and effort into this wet-dream-come-true production.The first game has been known to be very short, and the second one follows suit.  Under the circumstances, its honest to say that fans of this game will not go out aching.  This game is really something, but does leave the gamer wanting much more.  Aside from that  quibble, the stunning action warrants a purchase.  Max Payne 2: the Fall of Max Payne is stylishly honorable to the action gaming platform.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2003"}

As inLegends, the single player game is good, but it's the multiplayer mayhem  that attracts people to theGauntletgames.Gauntlet: Dark Legacywill feature the four realms fromLegends,  plus four new ones and a fantastic new battlefield section.--Todd Mowatt","reviewerName":"E. Batica","summary":"Gauntlet Dark Legacy","reviewText":"Gauntlet DL plays just like the revamped Gauntlet Legends. It's a very cool action game to play with a couple friends and now you get to pick some of the better characters that were hidden in Legends (ex the Knight, Jester and Dwarf). It's still a very long game so you have to have a lot of committment for it. If you need just a quick little fix, then I would suggest a different title because this one is rather long.The graphics look just as good as Legends and the game plays almost to a T like it as well. For some people, that might be a bad thing because beyond that, you are pretty much playing Legends with different boards and more detailed scenary. It's still a great game, but for those of you looking for an UPGRADED installment of the Gauntlet series, it's unfortunately not in Dark Legacy because of the fact that it's still way too much like the original.Even so, check it out because you may like it. And of course, like I said, it's great with a few friends because that always shakes things up a little.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2002"}
{"product_name":"B0017Q4DGI","description":"Bundled with Wii,Wii Sportsintroduces a whole new way to play your game. This is what video games should be: fun for everyone.Wii Sportsoffers five distinct sports experiences, each using the Wii Remote controller to provide a natural, intuitive and realistic feel. To play aWii Sportsgame, all you need to do is pick up a controller and get ready for the  pitch, serve or that right hook. If you've played any of these sports  before, you're ready for fun!Play Tennis, Baseball, Golf, Bowling and Boxing in the comfort of  one's living room. No ball boys scurrying about, no oil from the  alleys to get players dirty and no rain to keep anyone from a day at  the court, park or course. Use the Wii Remote controller to mimic the  actions of swinging a racket, bat or club, roll a ball down an alley  or bring the left jab.Players can use their own Mii caricatures in the game and play them  against their friends' Miis for a more personalized experience. As  players improve, their Miis' skill levels will increase, so that they  can see exactly how much better they've become.People of all skill levels can pick up and play any of the games in  the unprecedented Wii Sports package, making this truly a title for  everyone!","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A Great Intro to the Wii","reviewText":"Pros:+Very involving games+Mini games for the main games+Controls are intuitive and inventiveCons:-Sensitive controls in some games like Golf and Boxing-Not the best graphics in the worldWii Sports, if you live in America, is the pack in game that comes with the Wii. However, there is still a chance you might find yourself having to purchase it because either your game disc is so damaged (or broke) that you need to get another one, or you bought the system used and whoever sold it didn't package the game with it. There's also the possibility that in the future Wii Sports will not ship with the system and will have to be bought separately.Anyway, as an introduction to the Wii, Wii Sports is a simple game to pick up and fairly fun to play. The Wii remote makes playing these games more fun. Before you boot up this game, however, you'll have to make yourself a Mii. The game is played using your Mii and as you play the games other Miis that have been created on your system will show up too. Wii Sports includes five games: Bowling, Baseball, Golf, Boxing and Tennis. All of them controlled with the Wii Remote exclusively.Using the Wii Remote is what really makes playing these games a treat. In bowling, for example, your Wii Remote is your bowling ball. You'll have to make the motions of bowling to actually toss your ball in the game. In Baseball this not only serves as your bat but also the baseball when you pitch. In golf it is your golf club which you'll swing to hit the ball like a golfer would. In tennis it's your tennis racket you'll use to hit the ball. Boxing is the only game which requires the nunchuck. The Wii Remote is one hand, the Nunchuck is the other. None of these games are hard to pick up and play at all.I'd love to tell you all five games are winners but that's really not the case. As stated, this game serves more as an intro to the system and getting you adapted at using the Wii remote. It's fun, but there are a couple of controls issues that come up every now and then. When playing golf, for example, you'll find the motion sensor controls aren't always pot on. You might swing forward on the back swing when it's clear that wasn't what you wanted to do. In boxing the controls can be somewhat touchy. You might jab using the remote or nunchuck but it won't respond. It's a great idea, but sometimes its annoying. Other times it works flawlessly. The Bowling game is easily the most enjoyable in the compilation while the Baseball may actually be the worst.Another thing to keep in mind is that none of these games are pushed to their full extent. In Golf, for example, you won't play for eighteen holes and in Baseball you don't have 9-Innings. It's probably a good thing, however, because if you really get into it you'll find yourself tired out after a while.Multiplayer works great in this game as well. Get more than one remote and nunchuck and you can take on your friend in boxing. You can play a two on two match in tennis or against a friend in baseball. Don't have more than one remote? You can still enjoy Bowling and Golf by switching off using just one remote and several Miis.There's more to Wii Sports than playing the main games, however. You can also do training, which will help you improve your game. There are plenty of mini-games in training as well. You can practice power throws in bowling, where they slowly increase the amount of pins you'll have to knock down. There's a punching bag mini-game for boxing. A mini-game for golf where you can hit the ball and see just how far you can drive it. These are just a few examples. Each game has three mini-games outside the main game you can play. So there's more here than you actually think you're getting.Lastly, there's the Wii Fitness test. This will pick three mini-games from the training at random and force you to play them. After the test is over they'll tell you your fitness age. The lower your fitness age, the more \"in shape\" you are. Each Mii can only take one fitness test a day.All this is really fun stuff and the Wii Remote works really well with it. It is sometimes a little over sensitive at times, though. For those who are worried about having to work too hard you can relax. To do most actions requires a simple flick of the wrist and nothing more.It's no surprise that Wii Sports doesn't look all that great. The Miis are very cute looking and the game itself is very cute looking. There are a lot of colorful environments but no real actual detail is given to them. It's just your basic looking game. It actually looks worse than some Gamecube games. Luckily the graphics won't bother you at all because the games are so involving. You won't have much time to notice the graphics anyway when your swinging at a tennis ball or trying to bowl a strike. The music is surprisingly good. Nothing you'll want the soundtrack to but it fits the style of the game very well.In the end Wii Sports is a great introduction to the Wii. Chances are it'll still remain fun years later. There's more you're getting than you think, even though in some areas you still feel the game could be bigger. As an introduction to the Wii, this is the perfect game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2008"}

No more pop songs or songs with lyrics during the race, as that got rather annoying in the last game hearing the same song over and over again, so this time through it is a lot more fun!Needs more fast mid and full size Station Wagons, though, as there is only one, an Audi RS2...BUT...The Career mode/World Championship is broken and WILL NOT let you set the A.I. Difficulty level like in the previous games. Turn 10 is apparently using some sort of CHEATING \"Adaptive A.I.\"So be warned that there is \"RUBBER BAND A.I.\" in the Career Mode/World Championship. This means that even if you have a car that, is by all means, better and faster than all the other cars you are racing against, that for some weird reason, there will ALWAYS be a close grouping around you and one car (in the front) that is magically upfront by a long shot, and stays there, in most races. The A.I. cars, also, seem to have NITRO BOOST on most straightaways, so even if you DO have a faster car than the others, the closest A.I. cars will be on your rear bumper in a heartbeat even if they were a quarter mile behind you before the straightaway. I spend more time looking in the rear-view mirror and trying to block the CHEATING A.I. from passing me than I do enjoying a race in a customized car. This basically makes the game WAY TOO arcade feeling and it goes from being a wonderful driving simulator and racing game to an overly competitive demolition derby.I do not know WHY Turn 10 took out the advanced race difficulty options for the World Championship mode as it makes an otherwise awesome game into a bit of an annoyance.In the World Championship mode, the A.I. WILL NOT let go of the racing line! I've seen races where the A.I. cars will take a corner (in the same car I am using) at 3 times the speed I am going without so much as a squeal of their tires, it is literally like they are on rails! So if you want to play a Racing Simulator, you will have to stick to the Event List mode where you can make the A.I. cars behave a little more realistically.Also, for some reason, Turn 10 Left out the single player Vs. A.I. Drag races! It looks like the only place you can do the drag races is on Xbox Live mode.You can still set the A.I. Difficulty in the Event select, so I am only taking off one star for the moment. Hopefully this will be fixed or patched soon.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2011"}

It came with the drive, and a remote. I smelled a bargain. The remote that came with the device was $20.00 new (retail). And the HD-DVDs that were for sale...were REALLY CHEAP. Again, I smelled a bargain.Most people don't own hundreds of movies, heck, most people with HD TVs don't own ANYTHING in high definition (none of the people that I know anyway), and seem content to watch TV in HD. Personally I don't watch Television (I have better things to do with my time than watch commercials for hours a day). What all that means is...your mileage may vary....but still...If you want to watch movies in high-def on the cheap, and don't mind losing out on modern releases, this is definitely the way to go. The reason simply being, most HD-DVDs are cheaper than the dvd versions of the same movie, and a fair number have the dvd version on the other side of the disc!Aside from being able to watch HD-DVDs on your HD-TV on the cheap, this drive also serves several useful functions that never occurred to me until I owned it. With this device plugged into your Xbox 360, movies play back much quieter than they did on the Xbox 360's internal drive. And even better, you can have a game in the internal drive and a movie on the HD-DVD drive (it also plays DVDs) and switch back and forth without having to ever eject a disc! This function alone is worth the price of the device if you watch a lot of movies and play a lot of games (and especially if you switch back and forth frequently like I do.This device is a bargain and gets a high recommendation from me for anyone who wants HD on the cheap and doesn't mind bargain hunting for HD-DVDs.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2011"}

It seems well balanced in the sense that there are equal parts of action (shooter action) and adventure (searching, problem solving).  There were times I got annoyed with the shooter aspects such as fighting a dinosaur that it took me a week to beat.  That kind of thing is as fun as banging my head against a wall.
