I was even more enthralled when I saw all of the work that went into the motion capture for the game. When I finally got the game I was floored at how amazing it was. The details that went into the characters, the cars, the music... everything. Then I actually played the rest of the game.The cases all the way through homicide were amazing. Grizzly deaths, intrigue, mystery, car chases, multiple suspects. Amazing! This is exactly the kind of game I was hoping to play!But then it all changed. Vice was dull and Arson was even worse. Much duller cases and more of the same all the way through to the end. The character turn for Cole Phelps (the protagonist) made absolutely no sense to me, especially given light of his sanctimonious attitude through the course of the game. Nothing new was introduced gameplay wise as the story progressed, it became more of the same: chase -> apprehend -> interrogate.I actually because bored of the game and stopped playing for a few months before going back to play the DLC. The only standout case in all of those was Nicholson Electroplating, which at least introduced a fun web of intrigue and some shoot outs!Overall, a great concept, a great technological leap in gaming... only they could have done so much more. Worth playing through once but that's about it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00006F2ZQ","reviewerName":"G. Guberlal","summary":"Metal Gear - The Remix","reviewText":"XBOX owners, this is what you have been waiting for. MGS2 was an enjoyable game for the PS2 in the Winter of 2001 and still is. I'm not sure why it is always considered a &quot;short&quot; game, really it depends on how you play and what you decide to do. Let's pick this one apart:Controls:A few minutes acquainting yourself with the feel of the XBOX controller vs. the MGS2 controls on PS2 and you're right back in the game.Visuals:This is where I differ from the extremists and be honest. The game is a port, sort of an expanded &quot;Director's Edition&quot; of MGS2. The XBOX hardware creates the illusion that the game surpasses it's PS2 version, but it doesn't. You'll notice faster frame-rates, load times, and smoother transitions...sure, hey it's on the XBOX hardware. That's about as far as it goes, yet, that in itself is enough. If you're thinking of a &quot;Halo&quot; or &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; MGS2 retooling or tweaking, you're going to be disappointed.Gameplay:The added missions, being able to play as Snake, and different stories will keep this offering as superior to the PS2 original. It's still the same essential story, but with so much added outside of the original story, it's worth the money. There's many things you can do with &quot;Substance,&quot; such as:1. Play the original story2. Register your name and play as any unlocked character and choose what you want to do in VR missions:a)Sneak, weapons, first person, alternate missions, and many other modes.3. Take on the 6 campaigns called Snake Tales, all involving Snake.4. Well, I'm going to leave out all the spoilers ;-)Sound:Hey, this is the XBOX version! The sound whips the PS2, especially in Dolby.I recommend this title even if you have the original. The new offers are sure to rattle your chains again. Though, while we play, we sit and wait for MGS3. &quot;Substance&quot; will keep the franchise and fans growing stronger.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2002"}

InManhunt's Carcer City, nothing matters anymore and all that's left are cheap thrills. The ultimate rush is the power to grant life and take it away, for sport. This time, James Earl Cash, you are the sport. They gave you your life back. Now, they are going to hunt you down. You awake to the sound of your own panicked breath. You must run, hide, and fight to survive. If you can stay alive long enough, you may find out who did this to you. This is a brutal blood sport.Continuing in Rockstar North's tradition of world-class gameplay with high production values and sardonic humor,Manhuntexplores the depths of human depravity in a vicious, sadistic tale of urban horror.","reviewerName":"Matthew Warner","summary":"Guilty Fun","reviewText":"By this point, the violence in Manhunt is well documented. If you're unaware for some reason, here's the gist: The player controls a death row convict who, instead of actually dying at his execution, is given a powerful sedative and carted off to an abandoned section of the city under the control of a wealthy ex-Hollywood director, who now makes his living by providing high-concept snuff films to well-heeled clientele. The main character, James Cash, is now the newest star of these snuff films, whether he likes it or not.Catch all that? Obviously, the setting alone should be a fair indication of what the player is in for, and rest assured that the game pulls very few punches in this regard. The game has the player stalking various &quot;hunters&quot; the Director has placed to hunt him down and essentially killing them before they can kill him, preferably in the most gruesome manner possible. The more painful the death, the more points the player earns. You can practically hear the meetings at Rockstar: &quot;Everyone keeps complaining about the violence in 'Vice City.' They think that's bad? We'll give 'em violent.&quot; They do. It's not that the body count in Manhunt is particularly higher than any other game in the stealth genre, it's just the light in which the violence is portrayed. When you cut someone's head off in &quot;Tenchu: Stealth Assassins&quot; and a geyser of blood splashes everywhere, the effect is cartoony enough that it doesn't stick. However, when you grab someone in Manhunt and hack their head off with a Machete while you hear screaming and then gurgling noises, the effect is a lot more gruesome, even though the act itself is technically the same thing.Still, if the incredible level of violence was all the game had going for it, it would've gone about as far as most shock-based games do: Nowhere, really fast. However, the folks at Rockstar can craft themselves a quality videogame, and whatever issues people may take with the game's morals, there's no denying the fact that this is a very well constructed and fully realized game. Everything fits the overall motif, from the way the game's intro plays like a VHS-quality tape to the game's so-evil-it's-funny manual. It's all flawlessly done, and most games wish their art direction could be this good.This quality extends through the entire package, and is really what makes this worth getting (again, provided you've the stomach for the subject matter). Everything about the game, from the grainy graphics to the superb voice acting to the exceedingly twisted humor, just reeks of quality construction and serious commitment.Gameplay is straight-up stealth, with the player at a serious disadvantage in hand-to-hand combat against more than one opponent. Often, there are objectives for the player to get through, and each level in the game is designed with a specific flow in mind. One level may only allow for stealth kills, while a later level may be all about gunplay. There are escort missions, treasure hunts, infiltration attacks, and it's all varied enough that the player is constantly kept on their toes.The enemy AI, while easily taken advantage of, is still competent enough to provide a serious challenge. They do the type of things one would expect in this sort of game (respond to dead bodies not properly hidden, call for reinforcements, etc.) and do it well, particularly in the later levels of the game.And really, that's all there is. It's a superbly constructed stealth action game, and while a 5-star rating might throw some people, there's seriously nothing the game doesn't do that isn't done exceedingly well. It's sort of telling that what hurts this game most in the sales department is, in fact, the subject matter. The quality of the game is somewhat wasted when the one thing that seems to affect people is the game's level of brutality.Provided you can take the game for what it is without too many reservations, Manhunt is a total blast. Just know what you're getting into beforehand, and purchase accordingly.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2004"}

This game is a 3rd-person view of your character as you work your way through levels killing people in your path.  It has this goofy control system, whereby you are pretty much always crouched behind something - moving from one desk/box-thing to the next as you make your way through each level.

I admit I thought it wouldn't be very good, since it was on the same shelf as dreck like Two Worlds. The game store I use is trying so hard to get rid of their last copies of that horrible excuse for an RPG that they've reduced the price three times. Last I checked it was ten bucks. I got my copy of FEAR for twenty. And let me tell you--it was worth the full sixty most games fetch these days.I popped it in and started playing. At first I couldn't quite get the hang of the controls. Enemies mowed me down a few times and I had a bad experience with a game glitch at the end of the first level. It didn't load the cutscene, and I didn't know any better, so I thought I still needed to do something. I spent almost two hours going through that level, searching every nook and cranny, before it occurred to me to try and play the level through again. This time the cutscene played and I could move on.And good lord I'm glad I stuck with it.The story gets a little better with each chapter, though it's not the main focus (this is a pure shooter, after all). It's not bad. There are several paranormal influences in the game, and your character is subject to intense visions that are genuinely creepy at times.The action, which is the core of FEAR, is GREAT. This game features \"bullet time,\" in which you can slow down time enough to get the drop on your foes. The animation and graphics are so tightly executed that you really get your blood pumping in a firefight as bullets ricochet around you and kick up clouds of brick dust from walls and concrete.The physics is excellent. I found the most satisfying thing in the game was to go into bullet time, move up on a foe, and blast him point-blank with a shotgun, then release bullet time and watch him get blown backwards over a railing by the slug. It's all very slick and entertaining.While it's billed as being a horror experience, don't be fooled. It's definitely a shooter first with horror undertones. But those undertones are well-done, too, and you'll have a few anxious moments between the firefights.You'll have a lot of fun with this game if you enjoy first-person shooters. I highly recommend it. If there's any reason why I didn't give it five stars, it's only because there is no one area in which it stands out. It's a shooter, plain and simple. In short, you've played this game before--but you'll still have as much fun this time around as you did last time, and the time before that.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Bilbo Baggins \"mighty hobbit\"","summary":"Star Wars done right!","reviewText":"First off, I bought this game a while ago but I wasn't able to get to it as I was absorbed in Elder scrolls III morrowind(but that is another review altogether) but when I finally got tired of that other game I found that this game was almost as addictive.  There are not quite as many sidequests and what not but the story is quite compelling with many surprises and plot twists.  The game does a good job of combining the strong points of console rpgs like the various final fantasy games(intersting story, plot twists and fleshed out characters) and the strengths of more hardcore rpgs like morrowind by allowing you to venture off the beaten path of the main quest from time to time.  The game allows you to develop your own character with his own appearence and customized attributes.  Too bad your main guy has to be human.  I wanted to play as a wookie.  You do get a wide variety of looks for your character, although to be honest, the character models you have to choose from are not very good looking compared to the various npcs you interact with which made me slow to get into the game but once you start delving into the story you will forget how homely your character is and lose yourself in the story.The main plot element is the choice of following the light or dark side of the force.  I have played through the game as both types of characters and both games have their rewards however the darkside ending is somewhat underwhelming.  But I won't spoil it for you.Anyway, this game is terrific, I must admit I still prefer Morrowind but this game certainly deserves the kudos that it has recieved.  It's too bad the last couple of Star Wars movies couldn't be this good.  Oh well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000PS4X7S","reviewerName":"Scott Peterson \"I.T. Sme\"","summary":"Disappointing and strange","reviewText":"I bought this game on a whim, having seen it advertised.  The best way I can describe Left 4 Dead is it's like one of the newer shooters that has a multiplayer component which lets you replay the same maps you did in the single player campaign.  Trouble is there really isn't a single player campaign, only four sequences of maps that are tenuously linked together.Supposedly the developers did this as they wanted to focus on replay value and found having a traditional storyline with cut scenes would hinder that.  However, I was confused trying to figure out what was going on or who these characters are you were playing.  You only have six shooting weapons and five types of enemies, and to be honest it gets boring trying to see how difficult a predicament you can get into.The graphics are great and the action when the hordes of zombies come at you is intense, but I would have much preferred the immersion of a traditional shooter where you have a story behind the action.  (And it turns out the zombies aren't really that but some sort of mutagen infected people akin to 28 Days Later. Your troop is immune to the disease, but that's what I read, the game doesn't tell you anything.)A post-apocalyptic zombie setting could have spawned all kinds of improvised weapons, traps, and scenarios.  Instead with the lack of variety this game didn't even take me a week to set aside.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00005Y4Q1","description":"Unreal II: The Awakeningreturns to the fascinating futuristic setting ofUnreal, first visited in 1998. Since then we've had to content ourselves with the excellentUnreal Tournamentmultiplayer combat series. For this first true sequel Epic Games hired Legend Entertainment, who made a name for themselves with theUnreal: Return to Na Paliexpansion pack and the woefully underratedWheel of Timegame (based on the books by Robert Jordan). The result is fun and frantic, if a bit too short-lived.Unreal II's best feature is its lush graphics engine. It's state of the art. All the locations, which range from bizarre alien worlds to those based on the filmAlien, exude dynamic realism. Human and alien characters are well-animated and rendered, but have a cartoonish exaggeration that clashes with the realism of the architecture. The designers were undoubtedly shooting for a comic-book look, which explains why the women look like blow-up dolls with bare midriffs and the men have hulking muscles. The monsters, too, ripple with strength and menace. This style will please some, but is less effective than the more realistic styles employed by similar titles--although at least the art direction is consistent throughout the game.Unrealcast you as a prisoner who--through both good and bad luck--was freed from confinement, but marooned on an alien world. He goes on to become a sort of messiah figure to the four-armed natives, while other, scarier, natives want to kill him. It ends with a cliffhanger that this game does nothing to resolve. Now, you play as a new character who works for the Terran Colonial Authority. You're a space marshal on the ship Atlantis. You and your buxom partner, who looks more like an exotic dancer than a police woman, have to solve problems in a game only tenuously connected with the originalUnreal.Core gameplay and mission design are good, but uninspired. Legend has taken a conservative, almost minimalist approach. They've made a solid shooter that takes full advantage of Epic's state-of-the-art graphics engine, but did nothing to set the shooter apart from the crowd. One hopes thatUnreal II: The Awakeningawakens Epic to the fact thatUnrealis a genuinely interesting franchise that deserves more.--Andrew S.

{"product_name":"B0014ULQB2","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"To break in?.....or break down?","reviewText":"As games progress in technology and power under the hood, certain things just have to go into the game or it kills the illusion. Remember how you can have a grenade launcher or RPG in say a Resident Evil game but you couldn't access the door because there was some stupid medallion hidden in some bizarre puzzle on the other side of the mansion? In Red Faction: Guerrilla, it essentially allows you to the missions you want but also how you want. You could just walk into this mission and kill everyone floor by floor...but why not just set charges to the support legs and have the building cave in on itself? It's this level of destruction that drives the main hook of Red Faction but it also comes with its issues as well which makes this a fun romp but not really anything substantial.Story: In 2120, Mars has been terraformed and taken over by the Earth Defense Force (EDF, naturally) who have turned to the dark side shall we say from the original and have now become the oppressor. Alec Mason, having just seen his brother killed for suspicion of being part of Red Faction, the rebel group against the EDF, and Alec tries to drive the EDF off of Mars and free the people.Graphics: Red Faction's graphics can be divided into 2 categories: the physics...and everything else. The former is mighty impressive as the layout and the basic building structures are very realistic with the stone and the rebar and the support beams and everything things collapse will usually have a specific destructive look as opposed to \"it just explodes\". For the other graphics? They're impressive sure but they're not really \"wow\"-inducing. They look nice and character models are good though odd-looking but Mars itself just looks rather bland as it's all rocks, mountains and it's just not unbelievable looking but it's serviceable.Sound/Music: The music in the game is pretty good but it's either barely there or it'll show up when things get all action-y but you're so wrapped in the action you might not even notice but when it is on you're like \"hey yeah, that is kind of nice\". The voice acting on the other hand is rather meh and the dialogue as well doesn't help since some VA's can make bad liners listenable (Gears of War, anyone?) but here it's just terrible or it's just not as good. The sound mix though is good and the sounds for the basic assault rifle has a really cool shooting sound and the destructive elements have a nice kick to them which is really all you need.Gameplay: Typically, Red Faction games were first-person shooters but now it takes on a 3rd-person view similar to not so much Resident Evil 4 but rather even Silent Hill: Homecoming, the upcoming Alan Wake or if you want, a Zelda. The camera can frustrate since it has a tendency to zoom into you in tight quarters and when you're getting shot, it makes things annoying. But the shooting elements are quite fun with RB controlling your weapon wheel with your face buttons being your weapon selection. They're customizable so you can switch on the fly from your assault rifle to your sledgehammer and back without the game \"pausing\" so you can bring up your weapon wheel a la Ratchet and Clank or F.E.A.R. Cover is in the game though sometimes you'll be off your cover or you're being surrounded on all sides you might feel like \"screw this\" and just run around but it's definately needed in areas.The game is a lot more open world like a GTA where you can take on side missions which range from time trials where you have to bring a building down or shooting enemy structures in a certain amount of time, side missions where you help faction members against EDF forces, bringing down important EDF buildings or the main missions. More you do, the more faction members will help out (Morale meter) and the less the EDF has a hold on the certain areas (Control meter) which would be good if your members didn't run you over, follow you INTO buildings you're trying to destroy and have them fall on you or stick so close to your vehicle that you can't help but run them over. The enemy AI is a quite ruthless; bit too much so actually since they follow you and more than once I went \"oh just leave me alone already\" and your members die rather quickly so they're not much help.It's an enjoyable game, which was surprising cause I HATED the demo but the main game is surprisingly good but it does get a bit repetitive, even early on in terms of missions so be prepared to feel a bit deja vu in the structure of the game but it's still quite good. Keep in mind I haven't checked out the multiplayer yet so I might edit this once I check it out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2009"}

USED.  I don't understand how anyone could wanna trade this collection in, but THANK YOU!  Now that I've had the chance to play Shadow of the Colossus... I can safely say how much I enjoyed and loved this game.  I spent a good 8 hours and 27 minutes going through all the colossi of the land, and when I was done I really wanted to start over again.Instead, I decided to play through ICO.  Once again, I loved it.  Not as much as Colossus, but still a very good game.  A lot of frustrating moments though, if you keep distracted too much it's so easy to have that girl taken from you.  I admit I still haven't completely beaten it yet... but when I do I'll update this review to give my final opinion.  In the meantime though, I've been checking out the hard mode on Shadow of the Colossus, and I plan on trying out Time Attack to get the unlockable stuff, such as items and upgrades to help you take down those beasts a lot easier.  I may even just play another regular game of it just because I can!ICOPros:-Most likely a new game for a majority of its audience.  I hadn't even heard of Ico until I was reading up on Colossus a while back.-Easy to learn gameplay... but if it's too weird for you there's a button configuration screen.-Beautiful graphics-No need to rely on a HUD.Cons:-In spite of that, some sort of HUD would have been useful.-When overwhelmed it's easy to lose the character you're supposed to be rescuing-The repetitive \"come on\" voice or whatever gets annoying after a bit (lol)SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUSPros:-Absolutely stunningly beautiful graphics.-Configurable controls--otherwise the default setup is easy to get used to-Provides just enough challenge, yet feels extremely rewarding after taking down one of them giants-Great story line, surprisingly.  There's one part that had me absolutely gripped.-Has that \"okay, just one more\" factor to it.Cons:-I noticed the camera isn't its strong suit.  Patience is required, especially while swimming.-Other than that... the only thing I can really complain about is that it ends.Basically, and I'm saying this as a first-time player of either of these games... if you have a PS3 there's no reason why you shouldn't own this collection.  I don't own a 3D TV to test the 3D on either game, but I hear both of them benefit from it.  Either way, get this!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005BW7Q","reviewerName":"C.E.","summary":"Deep...Very Deep...","reviewText":"This game is one of the best games that I have ever played.  Period.  It rivals the Final Fantasy series in terms of gameplay and visual impact.  The story is deep and convoluded and full of twists, making you scratch your head at one moment and then at the next- you get this great AH-HAA! moment where you piece something together.  True, Some of the cutscenes are quite lengthy, but if you watch them, you get the feeling that you are playing an interactive movie...they are important to getting all the story. In the beginning of the game, they may seem quite boring, but as you progress deeper into the world of Xenosaga, they become necessary and more involved.The gameplay is great!  Xenosaga has one of the most innovative control/battle schemes that I have ever seen in a game.  You have skills, tech attacks and ether.  Each of these can be upgraded to make them more powerful, faster, and in some cases- easier to pull off.  The ether (magic) system is neat too; ether can be evolved into better spells and bigger status effects.  During battle, you have the option of jumping into an A.G.W.S. which is basically a big mech that can pound the heck out of the opposition.  These battle machines can also be upgraded, outfitted with different weapons, generators, and armor- all depending on your taste and the style of gameplay that you prefer.The game has a great help system as well.  You can enter a simulator to teach you the basics of battle and item management.  There is a &quot;dictionary&quot; of sorts on the game disc.  When you stumble across a &quot;keyword&quot; or phrase, it will show up in this database.  I have found myself referring back to this in order to clear up some points in the game and some pieces of conversation that dont seem to make sense at the time.  It is a great help and a wonderful addition to the game.Personally, I reccomend getting the strategy guide so that you can go through the game and acquire all the secrets and cool items that you would have missed or otherwise not known about.This game is a great additon to any RPG fans library of titles, and I am eager to see the entire six-part saga unfold itself.  Anything that can effortlessly incorporate elements of psychology, biblical refrence, philosophy and a lively debate on humanity and the soul should definatly prove to be worth the time and effort that I put into it.

{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Andariel Halo \"Disillusioned Smark\"","summary":"Best F****ng damn Star Wars game I've ever played","reviewText":"This game alone is like three or four or seven games in one.

The way you interact with characters and make decisions to change the entire storyline is amazing, but I'm a newbie to the RPG gaming world.Battles lack the speed and realism of an actual SW battle, or something like in Jedi Knight or the ground battles in Rebel Strike.  Then again, I hate the battles in Jedi Knight games.  Especially in the online games, with all those friggin h4X0r people who play the game since its released and prey on us regular people with their stupid Force-push off a cliff as soon as you spawn or choke you before you get to attack, or kill you with one lightsaber swipe *end rant*The battles are still fun, with choosing what to attack with, the most effective way to kill and which weapon etc.  It's like a third person view of Diablo II, with more options and animations etc.The only graphics issue I don't like is that despite the fact that you can hear your character talk when you send them to go do something like unlock a door or something, but they're mute during cutscenes.

I could have done without including all the glitches, but at least the game is fun. Most of the glitches are minor annoyances, but on two occasions I had to restart a chapter because it kept giving me the \"get back to your area!\" message, even though I had completed that mission already. This was a problem in the mission where you are to destroy the first plantation and then head on to the second plantation. Annoying, yes.The graphics and environments are pretty well done I think. If you venture to the ends of the on screen graphics you will notice things like rocks and grasses get very block-like looking and this is also where you can encounter more glitches and get stuck in rocks or in corners and find it difficult to get out! I'm usually a big fan of in-game music, especially if it is well-done like in the Metal Gear series. But I found the in-game music for this game so annoying that I have it turned down to where it is barely audible.This is a stealthy game in some respects and using stealth is your best option in most cases, but you can also run & gun your way through most levels, too. In fact a good way to get through the game fast, if that is your angle, is to run into an area, and arouse the enemies, then run back out of the area and find a hiding spot. If you go far enough the enemies won't come looking for you, and then they will appear on your GPS map as red dots and you can then easily sneak up on them and snipe them.In most of the game you are working alone, but in real-life most snipers work in 2-man teams. I wish that was the case in the majority of this game and that you had control of your spotter but you don't. Also, I would like the option to occasionally drive a vehicle in the game, too. Like steal a Humvee and move to the next area for example, instead of only riding on a boat and shooting or hiding in the back of a truck.

You could easily call this game an ACTION/RPG with all of new things to do that have been added to this installment of the GTA series. On the action side they have added  bike riding abilities now in this series & its incredibly fun & addictive ,you can do bunny hops, ride in bowls, ramps, back yards. etc. On The RPG side you can eat, get fat ,get thin,work out, get buffed, buy clothes,get haircuts, get girlfriends, run gangs,etc.etc. The Mini-games you can play pool,shoot hoops,horse betting,dance in clubs,etc.The list goes on & on.I could go on  for hours how awesome this game is . There is just so much to cover & review. GTA: San Andreas is easily a 60 to 80 hour game to get the coveted 100% game completion. GTA: San Andreas is (NOT) & I repeat (NOT) the the standard rent & beat it in one week type game.  San Andreas is a definatly MUST OWN game.

The game looked pretty much the same on both systems, and while it was ok i really didn't realize what i had missed till i played it on PC. I saw it for cheap remembered that it was at least interesting, so i downloaded it on a wim.  Well after setting it to full 1080p, and maxing out the other details i was more than impressed the third time around. The graphics look amazing even though most of the surfaces etc are white, it really just stands out and gives you vertigo from the start. In a good way that is. The tutorial is great, very helpful, the moves are very easy, even on the keyboard, and the gameplay over all is very very slick. I like that even when you play the actual story everything you \"need\" to jump on is red, which makes if easy to find out where to go. Now you can go elsewhere but that usually ends with a fall to your death, but still its fun sometimes since you respawn back not far from where you left off.I think this game was pretty overlooked although it did get good ratings, it kind of came in under the radar and went out the same way and now costs like 10 bucks or so on consoles. I just started the story so i'm not far along at all, but from what i've played i can tell i'll enjoy it a great deal. If your epileptic you probably wanna steer clear of this one being that the movements will definitely give you motion sickness. On the PC its even worse since your very up close and personal, but that makes it more intense to me. The combat is also good and simple thus far, and running away from the baddies is even more fun then fighting them. Most of the time. Course you do wanna kick a little A%% eventually. So go pick this up for cheap or download it for PC, its a great looking game, with a pretty basic story, and great graphics. Hanging, climbing, jumping from buildings, zip lines, ledges and pipes never gets old, so i was pleasantly surprised and glad that i reconsidered this title, its a keeper, and actually i think it will have some replay value. We'll see, so far so good. To bad i waited so long.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2010"}

Footprints will be left in mud, for example, but only until it rains and then they will wash away. Lara's shirt will also get wet, and she's more likely to lose her grip if she is standing on a slippery, rain-soaked ledge. When the sun comes out, her shirt will dry and the slippery surfaces regain their friction.In Underworld, Lara also has a lot more flexibility in how she makes her way through a level, as there is often more than one way to get from here to there. She can now climb walls with texture and rocky outcroppings to reach areas she previously wouldn't have been able to access.All of these additions have been made to give the game a non-linear, open feel. Players can interactive with the environment by doing things they find to be intuitive, and the game will respond in an appropriate way. When Lara interacts with trees, for example, she will push aside leaves using either one or two hands depending on whether or not she's holding something. These details give a lifelike, immersive sensation to the game.New Melee Combat SystemUnderworld introduces a new melee combat system that requires players to strategically strike with offensive, defensive, and evasive maneuvers. Lara can now attack enemies with different punches, kicks, knees, and other acrobatic onslaughts. Items lying on the ground, such as poles that were previously walked on, can be picked up and swung at enemies. Players can also perform a greater variety of actions with weapons; for example, Lara can now hold onto a ledge with one hand and fire a gun with the other.Realistic Enemy and Animal AIThe AI in Tomb Raider: Underworld has also taken a big step forward--both enemies and animals now make independent decisions based on their surroundings, employ ambush and squad tactics when fighting, and will retreat if deemed necessary.With updated graphics and a more immersive and realistic gameplay, Tomb Raider: Underworld will have both fans and newcomers excited about the newest installment in this popular video game-pinup franchise.Tomb Raider: Underworld is loaded with a new melee combat system, various weapons, and smarter AI for both enemies and animals.","reviewerName":"Charlie Spivey \"Gamer\"","summary":"Uh Oh - Revised.....Again","reviewText":"This game is a good addition to the series.

I even tried to counter air attack but timing is very difficult.  Also, some people are using something called counter-cancel to extend the combo... no casual player will ever pull this off...

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M4","description":"It's often argued that Nintendo makes the best video games in the world,  but one thing the company isn't known for is scary games. If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"\"uber_gamer\"","summary":"Eternal Darkness Delivers!","reviewText":"Have been playing this game for 12 hours and I must say it is one of the finest games I have ever played on any system to date. The story is immediately engrossing and lasts for a good 20 hours if you just run through it with no intentions to actually play the game thoroughly. If you want to see everything this game has to offer I hope you can afford 30+ hours easy.The graphics are very good, everything is real-time 3D unlike Resident Evil so resources of the CPU have to render everything including backgrounds, which means that the backgrounds and characters don't look as good as Resident Evil but they are nothing to worry about because details are still very rich and well done. Real-time lighting and volumetric fog and reflections, they are all there. Pictures do NOT do this game justice, because when in motion you immediately can tell it is way beyond the clunky movement of Resident Evil.Sound is very good and surround sound is perfect. The music is moody and dark and the sound effects are outstanding. The voice acting is the best I have heard in a long time, it is actually one of the best parts of the game for a change!Sanity effects are a new addition to gameplay mechanics, now your character can actually go insane and see and hear weird things!This is not close to Resident Evil in any way other than the fact the camera is 3rd person perspective. The game includes a deep magick (yes that's the way it is spelled) system which is more important than how big your gun is since spells play an intricate part in exploring the vast environments. For instance you ca cast a spell that creates a little scorpion type device which can walk into small areas you can't reach. Also, you can create unique and new spells thru combinations of runes to spell out a spell. Basically an enormous amount of combos, almost infinite! Of course you have melee weapons like swords which are not regulars in Resident Evil. Plus the puzzles are not silly but actually BELONG in the environments they are in. No strange gems to unlock the bathroom. ;)The game is very detailed and dark and interesting. It can not be said enough that if you plan on buying this game you seriously need to set aside the time to play in thru well, there are 3 paths you can take with alternate endings and an uber ending.

I'm not sure what possessed me to go back and buy Sonic Adventure DX, except that it was cheap, and I'm a completist. After all, Sonic Heroes should've been the best version of the 3D Sonic games, just because it's the newest right?As it turns out, I'm liking Sonic Adventure DX a whole lot more than Sonic Heroes, mostly because it doesn't have the cumbersome team-switching dynamic and force you to alternate between three characters. Here we get 6 characters total, and each is given a seperate path with varying gameplay; Sonic gets the traditional speed levels, Knuckles is a \"marco polo\" treasure hunt, Tails must race Sonic, Amy must avoid capture, Gamma gets a shooting gallery, and Big gets to...fish. Honestly the last one is a little odd and pointless, but otherwise the gameplay modes are all decent and enjoyable. The Sonic levels still hold up the best, but it was interesting to play through the levels in different ways.A lot of things really hurt this game though. The graphics are dated, but it's not really a problem if you know this was a Dreamcast port and go in with the right expectations. The \"adventure\" aspect of the game that places Sonic in an overworld much like Mario 64 doesn't really work. It feels too confining for characters that move really fast, and doesn't connect the story together that well. The story also takes itself a little too seriously, with horrible voice-acting that made me skip the cutscenes the first time through. The worst offender though, and the one that makes every other fault a minor nitpick, is the horrible camera. It gets stuck on corners, shoots at awkward angles, and needs to be constantly adjusted. It's hands down the worst camera I've seen on a 3D title, especially one featuring a mascot character.There's a lot to do here, and ultimately if you enjoy what you're doing then the game's problems aren't so bad. The game also packs in a fistful of the old Sonic Game Gear titles as unlockable goodies. They're actually pretty bad, but its fun collecting them for nostalgic value. Overall, Sonic Adventure DX is worth the investment as a discounted/player's choice title. The faults are many and obvious, but the game still has enough charm to earn its place in an expanded Gamecube library.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2005"}

Where you play as a male, and I could always find a character I really liked (Sephiroth for 7, Squall for 8 and Auron for 10). So the thought of playing a female just didn't appeal to me, so I didn't even bother picking this up. I'm really glad I had a change of heart. This game adds some great concepts to the series.If your new to the game, or have it already and are looking for reasons to play your current copy, my advice is to stick with it for at least 3-4 hours. When I first put the game in and started playing, I was kind of annoyed because for the first 2 hours (depending how fast you move, could be less or more) there is no exp system or any form of character progression to speak of. But then after about 2 hours they start to slowly introduce new gameplay elements, and they continue to do so as you play though out the game.I am at the end of the game, where just before the final boss encounter, they give you the option of going back to the different maps of the game, and finish anything you wish to do (finish side missions, upgrade weapons/accessories or pick up items you didn't grab previously). And I'm still messing around with the game trying to upgrade all my characters and do everything the game has to offer before beating it.I've already purchased Final Fantasy XIII-2, and plan on jumping straight into it right after I beat this game. I'd definitely recommend this game for anyone on the fence. I'ts different from previous Final Fantasy games, but in a good way. I'd go as far as to say that if they were to ever make a Final Fantasy 7 or 8 remake (I like them both a lot) I'd be very happy if they used a combat system like in these games, as well as using the same art style for a more modern look (due to FF7 being originally blocky and intended for Nintendo 64)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2014"}

And while it might not be worth rushing out and buying a new console right this second because of the lack of games, it is definitely worth upgrading from the previous generation in the near future.Games aside, the PS4 is also a Blu-Ray and DVD player with Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon right out of the box. The internet browser also returns from the PS3, which can be used with the incredibly comfortable Dualshock 4 controller, or with a keyboard and mouse. The menus are familiar but also refined, cross game &#34;party&#34; chat is now available, and the PlayStation Store has ironed out the slow updates and load times of the PS3 and is now much more user friendly. Unlike the XBox One, which only offers 720p screen resolution,  the PS4 supports 1080p. All of these improvements really make the PS4 feel like a professional machine, and not so much a fancy, flashy toy like its predecessors.While you are now required to purchase online play, Sony has improved its reliability, so it feels like a good investment. They also throw in monthly free and discounted content after you buy the online package.Before you buy either the PS4 or the Xbox One, do some research on which exclusives you feel you will be more interested in. While the Xbox One tends to focus on blockbuster multiplayer action (such as Titanfall and Halo), the PS4's lineup leans towards crafting masterpiece single player stories and great gameplay (such as The Last of Us and InFamous).All in all, the PS4 is a great console, and I'm excited for what Sony plans to offer its customers over the course of its lifespan.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2014"}

Romano \"Avid Gamer\"","summary":"Call of Duty 4 Is Destined To Be A Classic!","reviewText":"Call of Duty 4 is by far one of the best games to come out this year for any console or PC platform. The game is even better than any action movie that has come out to local movie theaters this year.  The game is just slightly better than Halo 3 which up to this time was one of my favorite games to come out this year. Now my review is based on the single player portion of the game only.There is no comparison between Call of Duty 4 and Medal of Honor: Airborne as far as which is a better game to play.  Medal of Honor: Airborne has just six missions to play through and that's it.  I am not making that up.  Medal of Honor: Airborne takes place during World War II with American Airborne soldiers fighting the Axis throughout Europe during the war.  The first four missions in Medal of Honor: Airborne are very realistic.  The last two missions are like made up fantasy missions where you are fighting Super Nazi Soldiers that take forever to kill. Call of Duty 4 is a ten times better game to play than Medal of Honor: Airborne.I could tell from the very first minute that I started to play Call of Duty 4 just how great a game it was going to be.  The graphics in the game are just simply amazing.  They are by far the best graphics I have ever seen in any game except for Crysis.  Crysis is the game to beat as far as graphics go.The very first mission in the game takes place on a Russian freighter out in the middle of the ocean where you play the role of a British soldier fighting Russian terrorists aboard ship at night in stormy weather. Just to look at the water come up against the ship is amazing.  I just had to stop to look at the huge ocean waves hitting the sides of the ship.  I couldn't believe how real the ocean waves look hitting the sides of the ship.In another mission, I play the role of an American Marine fighting terrorists in the middle of a Middle Eastern city. My character, along with some fellow American Marine soldiers, are supporting an American tank going through the middle of this city.  Well an enemy tank approachs us and the American tank you are supporting fires a round from the tank's main gun at the enemy tank.  The enemy tank gets hit and explodes and the turret on the enemy tank flies off into the air.  It was one best looking explosions I have ever seen in a game.In another mission in Russia you are again playing the role of the British soldier.  An enemy helicopter follows you around at night with a big searchlight trying to find you and some fellow British soldiers. Why you are trying to avoid being detected by the enemy helicopter, you get attacked by some enemy German Shepherd dogs that are the most realistic dogs I have ever seen in a game.  The dogs look very real.Call of Duty 4 reminds me a lot of what is going on today with the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan today. The game makes me proud of our American soldiers who are serving over in Iraq and Afghanistan today.  You learn to appreciate more our men and women in uniform and all the sacifices they are making today for our freedoms.  This game should definitely be added to your collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S. BubPros:Compelling, well-told storyGood action and combatFantastic sound and graphicsCons:Plot is familiar to fans of kung fu action filmsTask-and-exploration gameplay might seem slow to action gamers","reviewerName":"James","summary":"Groundbreaking Game","reviewText":"If you own a Dreamcast do not miss this game.

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or braving it solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house.Key Game FeaturesHunt Together- In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone. Hunt together with up to 4 players online or take on arena quests with 2-player split-screen action. In single player mode, you even have the ability to hunt with AI-controlled characters named ChaCha.Communicate Online- Because communication is key in coordinated huntsMonster Hunter Trisupports Wii Speak and text chat.Monsters with Unique Abilities and Attacks- Monsters have unique and dynamic personalities, abilities and defenses, increasing in complexity as the player progresses. They camouflage themselves to ambush hunters, but will flee or call for help if outmatched.Immense Living, Breathing World with Ecosystem- Monsters interact amongst each other in a living breathing ecosystem, complete with food chain. Monsters have stamina, migrate and even attack one another, the strong feeding on the weak.New Underwater Maps- For the first time ever in anyMonster Huntergame, you will be able explore land and sea and hunt monsters of the deep.Fully Customizable Equipment- With ten weapon categories &ndash; including the all-new Switch Axe &ndash; and new armor and weaponry created from the remains of slain monsters, there are almost limitless opportunities for equipment customization.Choice of Controls- Play with either the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, with the Classic Controller or Classic Controller Pro.Take Your Character with You- The ability to save your character to your Wii Remote lets you engage in multiplayer hunts anytime on a friend's console.","reviewerName":"mom2twoboys \"Writer, Reader & Mage\"","summary":"Good, but not like seen in previews and reviews.","reviewText":"I thought this game would be really intense and the graphics would be a lot like I have seen in many reviews etc. Well, it's a lot more like Zelda than any PS3 or XBOX game, at least that I have seen so far.I had gotten my kids a Wii for Christmas because they were finally tired of shooters :) I thought this game would be a nice way to ease them out of that and yet still be intense and not too cartoonish like most Wii games. Instead, it's got great graphics in the intro...but the game itself is a lot different. I can see that this kind of game is going in the right direction, but it's not quite there yet.

{"product_name":"B0012N5MIO","reviewerName":"Jared Burdick \"JBurd\"","summary":"Is it posed or is it memorex?","reviewText":"I would consider myself a Street Fighter vetran. My first console version was the Sega Genesis Street Fighter II Turbo and I've logged more hours than I would like to admit on Alpha 3 and Marvel vs. Capcom. I'm good enough to beat my friends and lousy enough to get killed in arcades (as a kid) and online. I NEVER use an arcade stick, I'm too cheap. So that's where my perspective starts.The game itself is largely unchanged as far as the nuts and bolts go. Two dimensional plane of fighting, moves are pulled off in front to backs, half circles and full circles. SF IV has 3 gauges this time around - ex/super moves, focus and ultra. Each one has a different strategic application, but more importantly, they are very, VERY easy to pull off. In fact, my six year old was able to pull off an Ultra finisher.SF IV is far more stripped down that SF III or the other various iterations. You basically have a move set this is pretty easy to learn, pretty difficult to master. The graphics definately play a part in the timing, as the smoother, more involved animations make the timing easier and let you see more clearly why you are getting destroyed. The PS3 version has A LOT of jagged edges and some of the backrounds are terrible. The fighters look great, especially some of the originals like Dhalsim and Honda.The arcade mode and two player modes play as great as you would expect, but online is a different story. I'm not sure why a shooter with 60  people playing runs flawlessly, but two people fighting is so tough. After a couple days of steady playing, there are still a lot of bad connections and lag when you're playing. It could be just me, but any lag and the game is ruined. So far, I would rate online as mediocre at best.I DID NOT download the game to my hardrive (it is an option). Maybe someone can comment on wether or not it speeds up the otherwise long load times.Overall, a must own for any fighting fans. The graphics are strong and the play is as tight as ever. Hopefully Capcom/Sony figure out the server issue and that would bump this up to a five star fighter.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"M.

The memory card was small and did not hold much so i couldent put music, photos, and have games saved on it so i just used my ipod. It is heavy and not very comfortable. The strap that comes with it is handy. U can choose the color of the menu background or use a photo. I paid 250 bucks for it and today even if u buy the value pack it is not worth even close to that much. The graphics and sound is not as good as the ps2 but better than a GC or a ps1.

Holding the controller to mimic arm movements can be fun but you really have to throw yourself into the dancing part (feet aren't recognized) to have any fun and fortunately kids are good at doing just that.  My 3 yr old has a great time holding the controller she tends to watch the feet of the dancers instead of the hand movements, when I remind her to move her arms however she does great and many of the moves are swooping and whooshing arm types which she really gets into.  Many of the songs are chosen exactly for younger gamers (itsy spider/hokey pokey) and are good clean family fun.  She has hit the PShome button on accident a couple times during gameplay but has also gotten quite adept at getting her controller set on the player selection screen.  There are avatars for gamers but no profiles which makes jump in multi play really easy.  The menu control which has you holding the trigger button to move the cursor takes some getting used to, and the options are hidden under menu choice for PARENTS.  The songs themselves are almost all cover versions some better than others and the 10 yr old has found many to dance to and is good about using the Team Score mode to let the littler one feel a sense of accomplishment.  They do fight over song choice but they have learned to do one song for each of them.  I am going to get another version of this for the Wii so I can get my Move controllers back, the kids have discovered that the songs are more fun when you start to memorize the dance moves.  The camera option doesn't work in the room I have my PS3 set up in as it is to dark but that is a problem with every game that uses the EYE to take pictures for me.  4 stars when the kids opinions are factored in.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2011"}

Indeed, I didn't want to believe it myself. During my KH2 experience, I wanted to think this was the best game I've played on the PS2, and at times, I was spot-on. Yet, in conclusion, there was an emptiness, a longing for something more, that i simply could not ignore.First, the good. KH2 is the long awaited sequel to Kingdom Hearts, disregading the GBA \"Chain of Memories\", which was a very different (but interesting in its own right) experience from the first. The story begins where \"Chain of Memories\" left off, although prior knowledge of that game is unnecessary to enjoy this one. I'd rather not spoil ANY of the story, unlike some other reviewers here, but I will say that you begin the game not as Sora, but as Roxas, a young boy who seems to dream of Sora on a regular basis.The good of this game is VERY good. The control is vastly improved over its predecessor, and with a free camera, you won't  be hating those long battles or that search for an ever elusive treasure chest. Levelling occurs in two varieties - on the one hand, you will gain standard levels for defeating regular field enemies, and will get gains in categories such as strength, defense, magic, etc. However, there are other \"bonus\" levels acquired by defeating boss monsters or surviving certain events, and here you gain new abilities, more HP, etc.The battles are excellent, and cure many of the ills of the predecessor. Rather than hoping you can change your stack command to make use of that special attack (as in the original), KH2 introduces \"Reaction commands\". By pressing the triangle button at opportune times, Sora and company can fire off amazing pre-emptive and counter- attacks against just about any foe in the game. Sometimes, these commands are absolutely vital (such as the fight against Sephiroth or other members of Organization XIII), for without them, you'll be wiped out. All in all, one must stay on his toes throughout the battle - many enemies use special attacks when near death (truthfully, I'm not sure if this is good or bad in the game).Unfortunately, there is much that is NOT good in this game. Despite some breathtaking battles, the actual discovery portion of the game is quite lacking. At times, your goal is to move forward, one battle at a time, along a completely linear map. This would be perfectly fine if the storyline was any better, but it is very disjointed. At one moment, you're fighting Disney villains and heartless out to rule the world, and then suddenly they're...helping you? No motivation, mind you, is given for this change in tactic. It just happens, and then the villains simply vanish. Moreover, characters are introduced and then ignored for most of the quest (Roxas immediately comes to mind).Finally, there is a \"cheese\" factor involved in many of the battles (I lifted this term from gameFAQ's, mind you). Here you are, moving merrily along through a difficult battle until WHOOPS! here are 10 water demons that you must destroy in 10 seconds or its GAME OVER! And just when you thought you were done with the cheese WHOOPS! Here comes Xaldin riding a dragon which makes him invulnerable against your attacks, while kicking your tail from here to Halloween Town! It makes the game synthetically longer, as you will simply lose the battles the first two or three times you fight them. As for the reviewer who says this game is easy, and you can level to lvl 99 in a matter of a week, don't you believe it. There is NOTHING easy about the battle against Sephiroth or (even worse) the 49th battle in the Hades Cup tournament.And when you finish the game, many of you will be left with a \"huh\"? or at best a \"meh.\" Things wrap up far too easily in KH2 (unlike its predecessor, which had a very strong story in retrospect). So to quote a famous poet, my final take on KH2 is this: Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2006"}

{"product_name":"B001PKHRUK","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Surprisingly great","reviewText":"When it comes to licensed video games, whether they be licensed from movies, comics, or both; the case usually ends up being that the game is a rushed and buggy mess that has little to do with what it is licensed from in the first place. Well, we should all rejoice because what we get with X-Men Origins: Wolverine is something that is quite the contrary. Wolverine is a bloody and oh so fun blast that delivers the action goods, and a good amount of surprisingly violent gameplay. The game is a simple beat 'em up at its core, but it is designed pretty well considering this is a licensed tie-in type of game, and utilizes Wolverine's claws and abilities to great effect. The enemies are actually pretty varied as well, which is a change of pace considering the genre, and there are some great boss fights to be had with familiar foes like Sabretooth, Gambit, Blob, and the Sentinels. Film stars Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber even lend their voices to the game as Wolverine and Sabretooth, and provide some good work as well. The only drawbacks to X-Men Origins: Wolverine lie in the fact that at its heart the game is fairly easy to get through, and isn't all that long either. Still, you won't find many licensed tie-in games that are better than X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and if you're a Wolverine/X-Men fan in the least, you should definitely check this game out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2009"}

{"product_name":"B006GHA8EE","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Best Atmosphere in a Fantasy Game!","reviewText":"The Witcher 2 isn't for everyone, but for a fairly large group of people, this could be one of their all time favorite RPG's.Atmosphere:  BEST EVER AWARD!The atmosphere in the Witcher 2 is fantasy with monsters, dragons, magic, and kings, but it is deeply rooted in folklore.  In fact, it is so deeply rooted, that it feels like it's a part of the old European Myths and Legends.  From the dialogue, character actions, art direction, and construction of the buildings, this game smacks you over the head with authenticity.  The characters aren't burdened with today's morality.  They all get medieval.  Guards get drunk and pee on the wall...  Leaders will hang peasants just to make a point...  Elder men talk about the local folklore and there are a few scenes that explain the story of The Witcher 1.  Prostitutes, gamblers, and thugs are abundant as well...Story: 9/10The story is \"Game of Thrones Complex\" and there are many twists, meaningful choices, and unholy alliances you must make.  Basically, Geralt of Rivia is a Witcher.  He is a bounty hunter for vile creatures that lurk in the deep woods, or unholy things that have risen from graves.  In a sense, he is also a Marshall, because he doesn't go out and kill X Monster.  He investigates the scene and decides what to do.  Some creatures must be killed on site, while more intelligent or noble creatures can be reasoned with.  Geralt isn't burdened with a high sense of morality either.  You do what you want and live with the consequences.  There are many dialogue trees in the game and these greatly impact your quest.  The first thing that I realized is that all of these choices are difficult to make.  There is no GOOD / EVIL framework around them.  Everything is in shades of grey.  Sometimes, the payoff is instant, other times, you deal with the outcome hours later.  What sets the Witcher 2's story apart is that there's no \"God's Eye View\" of the Story.  You're in it, the entire time, at the ground level.  So, things are happening in the world, but you only see pieces of the big picture.  You need to pay attention...  The story is told through Movies, in game cutscenes, and dialogue.  Most of it is well acted, too.Gameplay:  8/10If you approach this like a hack and slash, you're gonna have a bad day.  This is a semi-open world game, where large areas are opened up to you as you progress through the story.  You find a new town, talk to the locals, see what needs to be done, choose who you want to help, and complete quests.  The game has a solid quest journal that marks spots on your map.  There are also mini-games that involve arm wrestling, brawling, and 5 dice poker.Combat:  8/10This is not a hack and slash!  If you charge into battle unprepared, you will die!  In this game, you need to prepare before a battle.  If you are hunting undead, you should mix potions, coat your silver sword with necrophage oil, and make small alchemical bombs.  Being Prepared will make the battle 30% easier!  A lot of people won't want to do this.Geralt is armed with 2 swords.  1 iron for killing men.  1 silver for killing monsters.  Geralt will use both swords quite a bit.  Geralt also has potions, poisons, bombs, bear-like traps, and 5 useful spells:  Stun, Direct Damage, Trap, Shield, and Make an Enemy fight on your side.  You have a quick slash and a heavy slash.  You can mix and match these in combat and the game will pick the best move depending on the distance.  So if an enemy is in your face, pressing quick attack will quick-slash it.  If it is 5 steps away, Geralt will do a lunging attack.  This takes a bit of getting used to, but once you get it, it feels good.  For defense, Rolling is your best option.  You can block, parry, and repost, but when you fight multiple enemies, it's better to be quick on your feet.Combat is difficult because there are NO HEALING POTIONS in Battle!!!  That's right.  In an encounter, you must kill everything with your current health.  Your health does regenerate at a very slow rate... but it's not much.  You really need to focus and keep your guard up!Graphics:  10/10The Art Direction, style of characters, buildings, props, monsters, are exceptional, and the technical art is very well done!  It's one of the better looking games on the 360!Sound:  9/10The combat effects are great, especially in surround sound, and the music is very good.  I prefer the music in Witcher 1, but that's one of my all time favorites (with Shadow of the Colossus).Replay Value:  7/10No Multiplayer, but you can play the game over and make different choices through the game.  There are 4 difficulty levels, too.  1 Playthrough can take 20-50 hours, depending on how many side quests that you do.Maturity:  M!  This is the M-est game to date.  Sex, Drinking, Gore, Swearing, Naked Women, Taverns, Brothels, Horror, Complex Plots, Torture...  It's on par with Game of Thrones!Overall:  9.5/10I loved this game.  It's not perfect, at times the story was a bit confusing, the combat took some getting used to, but the atmosphere won me over.  And I really paid attention to every detail in the game.  The combat, alchemy, story, character motivations...  I came just short of living in the game...  and it was a very rewarding experience!  If you want to dive into a world and pay close attention, nothing beats Witcher 2.  If you want a Hack and Slash that you pick up and play once in a while, then move along.Buy it if you love myths, legends, folklore, fantasy, etc...Buy it if you loved the first Witcher (the combat is much better!)Buy it if you love deep complex stories that unfold!Rent it if you have 25-50 hours to go through the campaign on Normal Mode.Avoid this game if you don't like M rated stuff.Avoid this game if you like GOOD vs. EVIL.  Everyone here is Grey.Avoid this game if you just want a fun hack and slash.If you like this game, I recommend the Elder Scrolls Series!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2013"}

In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system.

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both?

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised.

It's a game that makes use of the open sandbox type game style as well as a third-person action game. I was a little hesitant seeing as I didn't like what seemed to be the status quo for open sandbox games, grand theft auto series or the assassins creed franchise. But there's just something about Infamous that works.It's a combination of super-hero action game, explore the open city, climbing sky scrapers, kicking butt, upgrades, collecting crap and completing missions. The storyline sucks you into the game and causes you to want to know how the tale will end. While I found the game frustrating at first and the storyline kind murky and the characters uninteresting-those initial problems didn't last for long. Eventually, the great storyline, characters, choices and game-play just pull you into the game.You might notice that the graphics aren't comparable to Uncharted 2 or whatever other standard is out there on the PS3, but this game just goes to show that you don't need to have the best graphics on the block, just immersible, incredible game-play, believable characters and an interesting storyline to boot.The sounds in this game really help. The wind, the music, the sound of the above ground rail train system (similar to the Chicago \"El\"), the cars driving, honking, the people talking, the news updates on the TV. It all helps make Empire City a believable place.In summary, infamous is a third-person action hero game using the open sandbox idea of gaming in an immersive wide open city with a great gritty urban feel proving that solid game-play, believable characters, an interesting storyline trump amazing graphics any day of the week.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2011"}

Yes, you can't save your progress if you're not hosting the game, but if you plan on playing the game with the same friends at the same time like we did, that doesn't matter at all. And the camera issue... I found a few spots where I wish the camera was pushed out farther, but not many. I've seen FAR worse and far closer camera angles. Dungeon-crawling co-op RPG's like these are oddly rare for the consoles, so it's worth a look for that reason alone... BUT it's good even not taking that into consideration.

{"product_name":"B00GANWVJE","description":"","reviewerName":"Nate","summary":"A Link Between Mediocre And Great","reviewText":"Overall I thought this was a nice Zelda game. Although it does feel a little rinse and repeat with a few new added features. Especially the wall fusion ability, very neat. Aside from that you've got your typical items, heart bar, meter, etc, but that's about it. I would have given this a four star, but I felt this game just wasn't there personally,First thing. I bought ALBW used, so \"Hero\" mode was already unlocked by the person who last finished it. Note:this is the hardest difficulty in the game. I breezed through it with very little challenge. That was a supreme disappointment especially coming from a Zelda game where I kind of expect to get stumped every once and a while and have to figure out what to do next. Even the boss battles were too predictable and offered a lot of openings for attack. Also dungeons were cake too even on \"Hero\" mode. Offering maybe 15 minutes of simply unlocking doors and opening chests. I probably could have walked away from my 3ds and the game would have beaten itself..... But seriously A Link Between Worlds is one of the easiest Zelda's I've every played. To expound even further. There's a guy in a tent who offers hints for ten Rupees and an item that lets you see helpful ghosts scattered throughout Hyrule that offer help too. Just what is Nintendo trying to say? That we're too dumb to figure these things out? Did they forget a crowd of fans that have conquered games like Zelda one and Majora's Mask? Were they trying to appeal more to kids with this new title? This is what truly had me stumped when playing through this game.Second. The whole cartoony thing just doesn't do it for me. Which is one reason I never played Wind Waker honestly. I was hoping for more beef with a newer console especially when it comes to Zelda. Ocarina Of Time 3ds really showed off some stuff and had surprising detail. A Link Between Worlds kind of feels like a downgrade from that which is more like N64 graphics.Those were my main gripes playing through, but does that make this a bad game? Nope. It can be fun at times even for adults, although I recommend this more for kids to be honest. My score for A Link Between Worlds is a 7.6/10.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2014"}

And I will bet that those reviewers didnt spend a lot of time with the game.

It's a shame theres a learning curve, or I would suggest all those house moms to throw away the Wii Fit and get this.

I know the game is called Saints Row IV but I will call it Saints Row 3.5 since it does not feel like a whole new game.A quick little bit of info here... Saints Row IV started off as DLC before THQ shut down, it was originally meant to be the final big DLC add-on (us older gamers would call it an \"Expansion\" pack) to Saints Row 3. THQ went bankrupt and Volition was bought up by Deep Silver. They took the final DLC, the core game, and stretched it out into a full game. I also wish I could give it a score of 3.5 but it feels good enough to go with 4 out of 5 for the moment.So to be clear, this game is still Saints Row 3. Same city, same vehicles (less of them though), same graphics, same game engine. Just certain things added or taken away.This game is absurdly fun and funny. So let me break it down as spoiler free as possible:Game engine: The exact same as Saints Row 3.Graphics and Models: Deep Silver took some vehicles and assets from the previous games and reworked them to the wonderful level of detail seen in the First Saints Row game, mainly the vehicles. They have a much higher level of fit and finish than even Saints Row 2 had. BUT, there are fewer vehicles in this game than in any of the other games. Boats are completely gone, so waterways are absolutely empty. Only 2-3 Airplanes remain and there is no civilian air traffic, though once you see the plot, it kind of makes sense to be that way as opposed to the same lack of boat and air traffic from SR3. The animation and characters are much nicer looking and seem to have had a once over by Quality Control. So all round the models are much nicer.Sound and Music: The sound effects are pretty much the same from SR3. The music on the other hand is absolutely great, they have just about everything, and lots of big name songs. The voice acting is wonderful, even Nolan North (of Drake, Deadpool and seemingly every male video game character ever made, fame) lends his voice to the player character list, along with quite a few name brand voice and film actors as other characters... The roster is rather impressive and makes the game all the more fun.Story: The story in this game is much more fun and involving than SR3 was. You will need to play all the previous Saints Row games to understand the back stories, banter, and in-jokes of many of the characters in this game. Plenty of \"OMG!\" moments, and lots of laughs. There is some great character development and banter that was sorely missing from SR3. Though at times it feels the game/writers spent too much time watching cyberpunk and action movies from the 90s and early 2000s instead of creating something entirely new. It was great fun, and worth seeing all the parodies of other games and movies, but at times the parodies feel more like blatant rip-offs. Also, the Choice/RPG style options are pretty much entirely gone after the first few minutes of the game and are there for comical reasons instead of giving you any rewards or boosts of any type. Example: In SR3 you could choose to destroy a building for a respect boost or keep the building for a cash boost, save someone or let someone die, and so on.Player Customization: The level of visual player customization is the same as SR3 and nowhere near as amazing as the player character customization from SR2. Though carried over from SR3 is the selectable player upgrades/leveling system.Vehicle Customization: The same as SR3 but with quite a few more parts and accessories for some vehicles, though you still cannot customize \"special\" vehicles, planes, helicopters, and VOTLs. Though for a game with cars and car customization it severely lacks in vehicle based missions compared to previous games as most of the time you are running, jumping, shooting, and fighting with super powers, instead of driving or riding shotgun like previous games.Weapon Customization: Weapons have non-visual upgrades now instead of the visual upgrades like from SR3 (when you upgrade a weapon, it does not change its base appearance with things likes scopes or suppressors and such that SR3 had). Though you can change the \"skin\" of the weapon to look like other types of weapons and most have 1-3 selectable paint jobs, but you cannot add or remove parts of a weapon.Other Customizations: Cribs/player bases are completely gone so absolutely none there. Gang customization is the same as SR3.Game World: Still in Steelport, or a simulation of so to speak, exact same map size and most every location remains the same as SR3 just add some cyber bits here and there. Also, during the game it is perpetually Night/dawn/dusk/dark and there is no day cycle until you completely beat the game. The city doesn't really feel as \"alive\" as SR2 did, but when you figure out the plot it makes a bit more sense to be that way.Super Powers: While they are fun, and have lots of upgrades, it ends up feeling too much like the game \"Prototype\" and not enough like Saints Row. Most of the game vehicles become pretty much pointless when you can leap, climb, fly, and run better than nearly any vehicle in the game rather early on.Controls: It controls nicely and has the exact same layout as SR3, though with the super powers, some buttons now have secondary functions when you hold them or tap them.Game play: You will go everywhere from space, to text adventures, to 2D fighters, to top down pixel battles, to platforming, robot fights, and more. The variation keeps things interesting, at least on a first play through. There is even a massive list of cheat codes built into the game as well to make the game even more fun, crazy, hard, or easy. So it works if you are a casual gamer or one of the hardcore challenging types of players. There are optional side missions that are basically just activity completions and rewards. There are no activities left over after doing the character \"side quests\" so at that point the end game just becomes a run around and collect random stuff/points you missed kind of thing. You can replay activities for money or better medals, but There is still no main mission or special character mission replay options... We had it in SR2 why can't it be in SR3.5?Re-play Value: As with most the Saints Row and open world games, it is pretty high in the re-play department. With the amount of character and vehicle customization, as well as upgrades, it is worth revisiting to see what can be changed or done differently on another play-through. Not to mention the amount of in-jokes, Easter eggs, and other things that you may have missed.Overall Opinion: This game is much more fun than SR3 was, but still not as much fun and time consuming as SR2 is for me. It has more polish than SR3 did, and I hope the future of Saints Row gets much bigger than Steelport or Stilwater combined as the map just feels small compared to many other games out there, especially when you have super powers. My biggest gripe is that it needs more side activities and player customization. In SR2 most side activities had 6-12 levels to them, whereas SR 3.5 has about 2-4 levels or so to each activity (seriously, we want more Genki and mayhem levels!). They still have not added back in the optional service vehicle activities and rewards (taxi cab, tow truck, ambulance, fire truck, police car, police helicopter, and so on that SR2 had). Still no \"Fuzz\", \"Septic Avenger\", \"Demo Derby\" and so on. There is a distinct lack of vehicle races as well. If you are going to give us all these customizable vehicles; give us something to do with them.---------------------------------BOTTOM LINE:---------------------------------It is a stupidly fun game, but many times felt too much like the game \"Prototype\" and not enough like Saints Row. The absurdity has been turned up to 11.5 and had the knob broken off, so don't buy this game thinking it will have an award winning plot or basis in reality in any way what-so-ever. (And that can be a good thing as games are meant to be fun to play. That is why they are called games and not movies.) The vehicles and player models seem much more polished over SR3 with the wonderful detail that was put into the first Saints Row game. The voice acting makes it worth replaying, as the different player character voices have different things to say throughout each play-through. Goofing around and being a completionist and rabid customizer will take around 20-30+ hours depending on how much of a \"collector\" you are. Throw in Co-op craziness and extend that time quite a bit more. (playing Telekinesis catch with a car or baddie, racing, cat and mouse, Vs, and so on.) It is just a fun and silly sand-box game and not for people that take things too seriously, and if you have a twisted sense of humor, make sure this game ends up in your collection.I say wait till it is more \"expansion pack\" priced, under $35 before getting it as I just could not get over the feeling it was an expansion and not a whole new game, since super powers were already introduced in SR3 add on content. Plus with the amount of DLC planned for this game, even if you get it cheap, you will likely end up paying full price or more anyway once Deep Silver finishes nickel-and-diming people for DLC for the rest of this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2013"}

They have their own credit system that is useless as soon as your Xbox breaks--and it will. Just give it time. I'm on my third Xbox now and it just broke on me a month ago. I recently refreshed my Xbox Live Gold subscription and the optical drive no longer works. It will just open disc. I've tried working on it because the warranty is voided and it costs 100 dollars for a repair anyway (might as well wait for another 360 to go on sale). To make the matter even more complicated the new systems are coming out later this year so it's not really worth it for me to replace the thing anyway.Either way I don't want any more Microsoft products. Windows 8 is garbage. Their Xbox is garbage. They try to weasel you into ways to spend your money and not get anything out of it (I have unspent live points and subscription worth more than 100 bucks at this point too). For the longest time they wouldn't even let you use external devices so that you had to use their expensive and bad add-on items that were years behind in terms or storage or performance.

{"product_name":"B000QD7BBM","reviewerName":"bixodoido","summary":"Surprisingly fun","reviewText":"I had no intentions of buying this game, but after seeing so many glowing reviews I decided to give it a shot.  I'm glad I did--Carnival Games is an incredibly fun collection of mini-games that are fun to play and remind you of a real carnival, though with much less potential damage to the wallet.Carnival Games features over 20 carnival style games, most of which will probably be familiar to most people.  There's an Alley Ball game (Skiball), dart throwing, a shooting gallery, frog launching, a dunk tank, and many, many others.  There are also unlockable \"super\" versions of some of the games, variations which don't give prizes but instead record a high score.  An example of this is the game where you knock over milk bottles--the super version has you knocking over enormous stacks of bottles.  It's silly and an interesting twist on the original.Each game you play rewards prizes in three sizes--small, medium, or large--and gives tickets which act as a sort of currency in the game and allow you to purchase unlockable items for your character (like a bike helmet or a guitar) and access other activities like the love machine and a fortune teller.  In each game you can trade prizes up just like a real carnival--4 small prizes for a medium, 3 medium for a large, etc--in pursuit of a jumbo prize in each event.  The prizes are nothing special at all, and they're really just a way of keeping track of how you've done in the events.As I mentioned before, Carnival Games features a slew of unlockables for your character, which can be customized to your liking.  Customization is pretty limited, however, at least until you unlock the silly accessories for him or her.  What a shame the game does not allow you to use Miis--this seems like a major oversight to me and would have added quite a bit to the fun of decking out your character.This is a great party game, but unfortunately the multiplayer options are somewhat lacking.  The head to head and competition modes allow up to 4 people to play against each other, but few of the games actually allow for simultaneous play (the horse racing is one that does).  This detracts from the fun of play since with four people you end up waiting for the other three to whack their frogs before you get another chance to whack yours.  Again, it's an unfortunate shortfall to the game.The game is still a lot of fun, however, and the simple fact is that the games are great regardless of the game's few shortcomings.  It's great for all ages--even my preschooler was able to play many of the games well and enjoyed it quite a bit.  One thing the Wii does not lack is collections of party games, but this one stands out as well worth checking into.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2007"}

Recently, I've been playing a LOT of games on my Wii, making sure I finish all of the good titles before I move onto PS3. After 15 hours of time clocked in so far, I can confidently say that SMG2 is not only the best game on Wii (even better than SMG1), but is also, quite simply, one of my favorite games of all time.Every level shines with ingenious creativity. You'll travel lush rain forests, desert wasteland, icy snow-tops, and a diverse number of levels that either refer to Mario's past or build upon old ideas in remarkable new ways. It's almost as if the team working on this game took SMG1's base engine and concept as its template, but started from scratch on everything else. Control wise, Galaxy was already perfect, but the camera needed fixing. Problem addressed. The new World Map in SMG2 is a welcomed addition, as it is much easier to navigate through levels than the hub in SMG1. Yoshi visits Mario in a number of levels, making great use of his tongue with the IR pointer for a number of incredibly clever challenges. So far, I have 60 stars in my first 15 hours of gameplay, at the end of world 5 out of 6(ish). Even though I am having an easier time through this than SMG1, I would still say that this game is more challenging (I'm just beastlier than before :). For those who are looking for extended play value, SMG2 delivers. If you collect all 120 stars and each galaxy's comet coin, you will receive the ability to collect 120 \"green\" stars. I can't wait!This game is, in my opinion, the greatest gaming experience to be had on Wii. Simply put, if you own a Wii, and either A) want the most fulfilling experience on Wii or B) want something to pass the time after wearing out \"Wii Sports\"--- this game will not disappoint. Buy it.

It includes over 10 different times and locations ranging from the old west to futuristic cities, plus over 20 different weapons overall (shotguns, crossbows, laserguns, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, you name it). Timespitters 2 takes itself less seriously than other fps.

I had seen the previews of this game on a video game show and I had to give it a try. They made it look so good. After playing this dud I realized that this game was a rush job and I kind of wonder who wrote all those rave reviews. If you look at critiques of this game on video game review websites, you will notice that the ratings are the complete opposite and I agree with them. The game play on this is so broken you end up wondering if they even knew what they were doing. For example, the stealth portion involves you ducking and hiding under cover. But the cover itself is useless as you end up getting shot while being under cover. And no matter how stealthy you are you will find yourself being detected in situations where you shouldn't be. The boss battles involve you being shot at by bosses that are able to run and gun like Michael Vick on a wild shoot-out while you are only able to move slowly. And they all are like that. It is a lazy way of designing games. In the end you will wish that you hadn't purchased or even rented this pile of poop. I pity those who spent sixty bucks on this expensive coaster. I suspect that the company that made this game ran over budget and just rushed it out the door hoping that it will make a quick buck. It was simply a case of the game designer being way over his head. Suffice it to say, I highly do not recommend this game unless you like being frustrated.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2011"}

Nintendo has been working with these characters (Mario, the Princess, Bowser) for 20 years now, and each new game manages to reference all the other games in clever ways.For example, in Paper Mario, much of the music is from older games -- not just the famous Mario theme, but a lot of other, more obscure stuff, too.  The dialogue constantly parodies older games.  When we first meet Bowser in this game, he climbs in his clown-faced ship and zooms toward the screen, then away into the distance, just like he did in Super Mario World (SNES), back when scaling and rotation were amazing new tricks.But the nostalgia is just a small part of the fun here.  Paper Mario features turn-based battles, where you must strategize in using different items and attacks and defending yourself against enemies.  I've played only two other games of this style -- Super Mario RPG and Chrono Trigger -- but I'm told those are two of the best example.  Paper Mario equals if not tops the great battles of those games.The gameplay outside of battle is innovative, with lots of challenges to figure out -- but none so hard that you'll ever be stuck for long.  I really liked how you play as different characters at different times (including Bowser and the Princess), and the romantic subplot between the Princess and a HAL-like computer is hilarious.  You even get to \"dance\" with a computer-generated Princess clone (and take a shower afterwards if you like).There's a lot of innovative touches in the graphics, too.  I love how the walls of houses collapse when you step through the door, allowing you to see inside.  The spiraling stairs of the first castle look amazing, and I like how, at times, pipes will take Mario into the distant background of a level.  I'm surprised there's no slowdown in some scenes, such as when you're mobbed by hundreds of Skeleton Koopas, or are being followed by 101 Punies (the giant tree level is the most clever level in any recent game I can think of).Some might complain that the graphics are too \"cartoony,\" but to me, they're perfect.  If I want \"realistic\" graphics, I'll watch TV or see a movie.  Games that create new worlds and new ideas my eyes have never seen before are much better than those that just re-create stuff I see every day.Paper Mario is another triumph from Nintendo, and once again strengthens my loyalty.  Nintendo may be losing the video-game wars, but they still know how to make a good game better than anyone else.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2004"}

David Swan","summary":"Don't Expect a Remake of the Original Classic","reviewText":"The Nintendo Wii is not a friendly environment for first person shooters which is a shame because the Wiimote/Nanchuk are an awesome substitute for the mouse/keyboard combo. No, the main problem is that FPS's tend to push systems to their limit and the fact of the matter is that compared to competing systems the Wii is a wimpy little girl at polygon pushing. I was playing FPS's on the PC well over a half decade ago with better graphics than the latest Goldeneye and a game like Call of Duty on Xbox or PS3 looks SO much better and runs SO much smoother which is why I tend to stick to games within the Wii's graphical capabilities like Punch Out and Mario Kart. Goldeneye is an excellent FPS compared to others on the Wii but compared to CoD4: Modern Warfare on Xbox it's quite ugly.The big question is why Goldeneye. Goldeneye was one of the most ground breaking first person shooters ever and a game that I put many MANY hours into. It's also by far the best Pierce Brosnan Bond movie. This Goldeneye is a re-imagining of the movie radically changing the story. The character names remain the same (Orumov, Trevelyan, Simonova) but they are completely changed and unrecognizable from the original characters and none of the changes are improvements. Onatopp, for instance looks like Cruella Deville in a pimp costume and sadly Boris Grishenko is completely jettisoned. The plot is changed so that Bond appears in all the events of the story for instance Bond is at Severnaya when the Goldeneye blast hits. In order to get Bond there the writers included a full attack on the Severnaya base by Russian soldiers under Orumov's orders. The Severnaya guards send out an alert picked up by MI6 who then send Bond to investigate. This doesn't make sense on several levels. First of all the whole point of stealing the EMP resistant helicopter was so that Orumov could draw as little attention to himself as possible as he stole the Goldeneye codes from the almost completely unguarded research station. Having this massive assault made the Tiger helicopter essentially superfluous and makes it pretty much impossible that Orumov could get with his scheme without everyone knowing he did it. The game retained the interrogation scene almost word for word but how could Defense Minister Mishkin possibly think Bond was behind the theft of the Goldeneye? Did Bond also command dozens if not hundreds of Russian troops to attack the facility? In almost every case where the characters or plot are changed it's to the detriment of the story.Goldeneye gets the control scheme correct with the Wiimote/Nanchuk. You move with the Nanchuk control stick and control direction with the Wiimote so your direction essentially follows the reticule. There is strafing, running and gunning and leaning which in my opinion are absolute musts but I still see FPS's that don't have them. Pressing `Z' button gives you limited lock-on but it can be frustrating when the game decides to lock on something other than what you're trying to hit. The biggest problem is that the gun seems to have SERIOUS problems aiming high and low. Targeting upward will generally give you an angry red circle with a line through meaning you can't fire which can be brutal when someone is shooting you from above. Likewise there can be some frustration when trying to shoot downwards. Also, the control can sometimes seem to get lost and just float around or lock up. By and large when I'm running and gunning through an area I'm fine and loving it but the targeting problems come along more than occasionally. There was one part in the game where I needed to escape a burning train by shooting off some locks and my aiming absolutely refused to respond eliciting more than a bit of profanity. I cannot overstate how much of a problem this can be when the controls suddenly refuse to obey.I can't deny there is much awesomeness to be had in the new Goldeneye. The sniper rifles and night vision goggles are done well and I loved the tank section although the ending where Bond stops Orumov's train was LAME compared to the movie. Players can play more of a stealth game (which is done exceedingly well) or shoot their way through the whole thing. The control scheme is done well if a bit bitchy and often frustrating. Personally I don't like that they used Goldeneye because it's neither an homage to the original Rare game nor an improvement on the story of the film. The Memorial Park scene is a great level but the ending is terrible compared to the film on the other hand the `cradle' scene is a sight to behold. This is the first Bond game I've bought in years and I would have to say that for its era this is the second best Bond game I've played after the original Goldeneye and the best FPS I've seen on the Wii. Goldeneye game shows a lot of effort put into it including a really slick menu system but there are some graphical gliches like floating guns and falling through the ground that take me back but not in a good way. I've criticized a lot but this is a quality game if you can overlook a few very frustrating issues. Just don't set your expectations too high or you might be disappointed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2010"}

Still suffers from the police out of nowhere syndrome. I check to see if I can proceed but when I turn around and turn back they are there. Had this same issue on previous games. Also they are just way too good at shooting from long distances through the car when it is moving.Park a car not in exactly the right spot and it will be gone if walk away too long. I just walked around the nearest building and when I cam back it was gone.I consider myself  a slow player.  When others are done in 50 hours I can take 500 hours but this game was just over too quick even for me.  Finished in a couple of weeks after playing a few hours a night.You still can not jump from a car before it stops but you can if it is going 100 MPH?Hiding still is sketchy because the character will hide in plain site even when there is a closer more suitable location right in front of him.  If the game is going to make decisions on it's own it should at least make them correctly.Again I wish the designers would separate the online parts from the game at sale because I will not play online and I would like to not have to pay for those that do.  Also it seems every time they include online play, they take away from the campaign.  They will never learn that some of the most popular games ever (doom) (older GTA's) needed no online content or complicated controls.  I challenge them to separate the 2 types of play see who buys what.  Online could be an add on.There is a casino but you can not enter.  What at tease!On the controls page they still insist on paging through the variations automatically and again too confusingly.  I never found the control designation for throwing a grenade but I did figure out how.Music is not very good or there is not enough so it would have been better had they let us play our own from the hard drive like other games do.In their favor, you can still play the game with no new story progression. You can get and do side jobs still. You can buy properties etc. I found at least one set of Easter eggs in the form of letters. Only found 2 of fifty. This could still be played with.They could sell more new games and not have to worry about people selling used ones if the game was just so long or good that no one would want to give it up.  But they would rather attempt to prevent us from selling used games like XBox tried to do.  That way they don't have to try.  Having a hard time figuring out why it took so long to release this since their seems to be no visible groundbreaking new stuff in this game.  I would still like to see the characters use my name when speaking to me (even if it was synthesized).  Would also like to see my face on the character.  More real cities maybe.  More stuff that stays destroyed for longer or at least shows a crew cleaning up the devastation.  More consequences for more actions all around.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2013"}

{"product_name":"B003L51GW2","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Posey","summary":"First Impressions - God of War: Ghost of Sparta","reviewText":"The God of War games have always been a staple on Sony consoles.  Starting with the PS2's initial God of War and the followup, God of War 2, Kratos has found a lot of success with the hordes of fans his series has garnered.  With the move to the next gen consoles, the PS3 release of God of War 3 may have ended his journey but there's still a lot of story left to tell.  With the success of the first PSP game \"Chains of Olympus\" it seemed foolish for Sony not to tread into the PSP waters again with another release.  Enter Ghost of Sparta.  Does this PSP game carry over the combat and story the predecessors are known for or does it fall flat as a portable release?I consider myself a fan of the God of War series.  I played the first and loved it, but never finished the second.  I'm still playing through the third and plan on finishing it within a week or two.  What I'm trying to convey is that I know about the Ghost of Sparta and his plight to stick it to the gods of Olympus.  If you are new to the series or haven't really delved too deep into your Greek mythology, you may be a little lost.  That doesn't mean you can't enjoy the game, you just might be a little behind on why this \"God of War\" guy is so pissed and his skin is white (hint: it's his family...literally).The game takes place somewhere between God of War 1 and 2.  After defeating the god of war Ares, Kratos takes over as the new god of war in Olympus.  While he is now a god and no longer a mortal, he still has mortal dreams and memories.  One such dream in particular has been tormenting him and he takes off on a journey to find out what it's about.  The journey will take you through the normal gambit of offerings of locations and bosses and if you've played any of the previous games you'll be instantly familiar with it.  The puzzles are a little lighter this time around but the combat is just as frantic as ever.Speaking of the combat, the developers did one hell of a job making the combat feel like the others in the series.  You'll have your weapons and special moves just like in the other games and it all feels just as smooth as before.  The only complaint I can think of would be the PSP itself.  At times, it gets a little awkward holding the PSP and performing the moves.  You get used to it, so stick with it, but it can be a little disorienting at first.The graphics in Ghost of Sparta are truly amazing for a PSP game.  You'd be hard pressed to find another game with graphics this nice of the PSP.  The devs seriously milked the PSP for every ounce of processing power they could to get the graphics as nice as they did.  Just like in the other installments, you'll awe at the architecture and ahh at the gore.The music is another strong suit of the game, just like the others.  While you are battling the hordes of enemies, you'll constantly hear the notorious God of War battle music playing in the background.  At times while exploring, the eerily haunting music of the more solemn bits will tone it down a notch and bring you into the story.  For me to notice the sound of a game is a big deal since I normally just blend it into the background.Ghost of Sparta is a solid PSP game that action fans will like.  Whether you love the game depends on how ingrained into the God of War story you are.  If you are looking for a solid action game this holiday, God of War: Ghost of Sparta has you covered.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2010"}

It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S.

Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"Mark D.

The characters and backgrounds are very well-drawn, the tunes set the tone well, the controls are top notch, the storyline is great, and the animation is perfect.In addition to be to being quite possibly the best side-scroller ever made, Symphony of the Night's music holds true to the title with well-orchestrated tunes that only a jaded misosymphonist -yes, I made that up- could hate.As the story goes, Dracula rises once every century to terrorize the the innocents of Transylvania. This is where a Belmont usually comes in to thwart Dracula's evil plots and send him back to where he came from. When Dracula dies (albeit temporarily) his castle vanishes with him. This time, however, things are a little different.Only four years after Richter Belmont defeated the Count, Dracula's castle rises again. Maria Rennard, Richter's cousin who helped him defeat Dracula, decides to investigate the castle after her cousin mysteriously disappears.Over 400 years ago, Dracula was betrayed by his son, Alucard, who aided Trevor Belmont in Dracula's defeat along with Grant (a nimble thief) and Sypha (a vampire-hunting sorceress). Now Alucard, who had put himself into what was supposed to be an eternal sleep, has risen again to put an end to his father ... permanently!As Alucard, you fight Dracula's evil minions while exploring the castle and the ground upon which it sits. The castle itself is made up of main halls, a church, a bell tower, a courtyard, and a library, among other things. Under ground are the abandoned mine and the catacombs. Things get even more interesting when or if you get to an upside-down version of the castle, where you face an evil grim reaper in earth \"above\" the castle, and eventually Vlad himself.What I also like about the game is the way it somewhat portrays the real Vlad Tepes Dracule, with impaled victims in the background and an equally menacing portrait.So is there anything wrong with this game? Ofcourse there is!  While you will get the chance to play as Richter, you'll never be able to play as Maria unless you buy a Japanese Sega Saturn (or an American one with a mod-chip) and Nocturn in the Moonlight.Konami also screwed Maria when they released Dracula X on Super Nintendo in America. Maria was playable in the Turbo PC-CD version in Japan.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2002"}

I should really hate this game for the hundreds of hours it has managed to detract me from doing things society would label as \"important\".  I love this game more than my mom and I've told that to her face.  Even if you don't end up liking this game I believe everybody owes it to themselves to try it out.With that said, this game is poetry in motion.  From the music to the artwork, everything is simply a pleasure for the senses and when coupled with solid simplistic and fun gameplay you really can't argue.The game has a sprite based watercolor feel to it and you aren't going to find an artistic direction like this in many other games because the lead character designer on this game, Ayami Kojima, is entirely self trained.  The art is perfect for this game though.  From the most obvious to the smallest detail you ARE in Dracula's castle.  Nothing feels out of place.  My only gripe here is that if you aren't playing the game on an overclocked Saturn then you're going to experience some lag when a lot is going on meaning that sometimes they were a little too ambitious with their work.The music sets the mood perfectly in this game.  I kind of like video game music from time to time, but I own this album and listen to it regularly.  The music can be serene and creepy for underground areas or drive powerful metal guitar riffs for those more intense moments.  Again, everything is paired perfectly (environments and music) and not a single area rubs you the wrong way.  There's also a hidden music track on this game if you put it in to a CD player which is kind of funny, so check it out.The gameplay, what's not to like here?  Taking everything cool about RPGs and pairing it flawlessly with everything good about action/platforming games.  The controls are solid, you can belt spells out Street Fighter style at a moments notice or backdash for dodging without thinking about it.  My only gripe is that the game can be super easy once you know what you're doing, but I really don't care because the game is such a joy to play.It's not necessarily obvious upon completing the game but there are TONS of replay modes and different endings to get.  You can play through with a different character, and several different sets of starting stats by entering a different name when you start the game.  There are also certain items, like the Duplicator, that are only available after you have cleared the game once.I could go on for days about the pleasures of this game but I've told you what you need to know.  With this game now being on the 360 arcade and supposedly coming out on the PSP there is no excuse not to play it.  I dream of the day when a true console sequel is made for this game with Guilty Gear Isuka quality graphics *DROOL*...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2006"}

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"mdizzog","summary":"Jeez, Square is goin downhill","reviewText":"I loved final fantasy 7. Final Fantasy 8 was pretty good. Then Final Fantasy 9 was the worst game ive ever played. 10 was pretty bad too. But now Square is doing something different. Kingdom Hearts is a way to make money off previous characters. I doubt anyone would buy this game if Final Fantasy characters were not in it.Lets be honest, its horrible. For once just admit Square made a bad game. The controls are the worst. Whenever you want to manipulate the camera, it goes spinning in the other direction. It took me like 3 hours just to beat this Alice in Wonderland level. And yes, it is a hack and slash game. All I do is hit X and the game locks into things and attacks. Pretty easy. There is no fun factor really.Cool old Square characters. I can see why they had to add those in. Without Cloud or Squall the game would have been thrown out by most. Now dont just say my review is horrible because you like the game. Most of the reveiwers have not even played it. The plot is probably one of the worst plots ever. You lock doors that seemingly hold the entire worlds existence, and you need to close them before they are opened by the bad people. So the bad people are looking for the 7 princesses to open the ultimate door. Wow that took real genius, not. I bet Square thought of this whole game in one day. ALSO, this is just like all the other final fantasys. Your best friend of member of your party turns on you. Kairi or whatever turns to hate you because he wants your girl. Some witch tells him to hate you because you hang out with donald and goofy, and Kairi is just like \"Yea, he should be hanging out with me. But I never want to be his friend again because he was so loyal to me!\". Its kinda stupid that we were best friends one minute, now he wants to slaughter me. Well I can tell you that hes just a sad Seifer rip off from FF8.Now before you go dissing my review, look at the facts I have given you. The only reason this games been gettin mad reviews is because 1)Square made it 2)Old final fantasy characters come back. Just before you go and play it let me warn you. It is NOT a final fantasy. IT IS A PLATFORM GAME. YOU WILL SPEND HOURS FALLING BECAUSE THE CAMERA AND CONTROLS.

Not KOTOR","reviewText":"Fable is, simply stated, a great game. But, IMHO, it is not a \"groundbraker\" as many people defined it.PROS of the game:1. Your character will evolve based on your decisions. He will age, show a Halo over his head if he is good, horns if he is evil, grow fat if he eats too much. Scars will cover the body of fighters used to close combat, magic induced wrinkles will wear out the skin of mages.This, ultimately, links you a lot to your character as you have a vivid image that shows your characters demeanor.2.Lots of sub quests, and they are VERY cool. Almost better than the ones that are part of the main plot.3.Vast economy of game, lots of weapons and equipment. Enormous possibility of character personalization.4.Awesome graphics and fighting engine. Some spells are so well done you'll just want to use them over and over again to see them in action.CONS1. This game is sort of a \"the sims\" meets Kotor. What comes out are lots of emotes, possibility of getting married, having sex, getting drunk, people liking you... etc. I really didn't get too much of a kick out of it. NPC (AI driven non player characters) do not have names, unless they are main characters from the main plot. You can get married, but what you base that decision on is probably just the looks of the maiden. You can rent and live in houses, furnish them, etc... but I couldn't really understand if the effort of putting such features in the game was worth the gameplay boost they should deliver. But I'm not a sims gamer so, this may be a PRO for other gamers.2. Talking about KOTOR... the game reminds of it. Actually the real time fighting engine is even better than the turn based Kotor one (expecially for those who like more action and less tactics)...BUT... Kotor had an awesome story, which fable lacks. Fable's story is as simple as the name of the videogame.3. Your character will NEVER say a word. I wen through the game and started thinking he was mute. People will talk to him and you will not have any possibility of interaction. It made me feel I was getting \"talked over.\" Very annorying.Bottom line:Overall Fable is a strong game and a MUST BUY for:1) Rpg lovers2) Those who loved the Kingdom Hearts and/or Kotor3) Those who enjoy sims games and would like to see it applied to a fantasy world","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2004"}

I have not come across a lot of the problems that people claim to have encountered. Some are really absurd such as claiming that the game stops working after such and such time. That is almost impossible. It is possible that the reviewer had a game that had a scratch that made it stop at a certain point. But that is not the fault of the game. Now, I am not a COD fan boy. I am a gamer who enjoy great video games. I have COD, Battlefield and Meddle of Honor and a whole host of military type games. But I always have gone back to COD because they have great multiplayer. No, they are not realistic. Those who think that shooting a gun in COD amounts to shooting a real gun has to have his head checked. Even a ten year old can shoot a bazooka in COD. And being able to play COD does not, I repeat, does not make you a soldier. Playing a video game is one thing. Shooting a real rifle is another. What is so laughable is the comments I hear over and over in multiplayer where players call others the put-down, \"camper\". I've got news for them. Real soldiers camp. It is part of military strategy. Despite the idiots who \"rage\" during the game, it is a fun game. The only knock I have for Black Ops is that the graphics for the multiplayer does not stand up to Modern Warfare 3's. Yes, it is an older game but one map in particular looks cartoonish. Some may like the fact that it is small which renders it a run-and-gun map but it could have used more work. If you are sitting on the fence, you should get the game. It is a whole lot of fun.

In 1995, Rare developed and released Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy Kong's Quest for the Super NES. It was an immediate success. The sequel to DKC was bigger and better in every way possible. Better graphics, better music, brand new stages with even more variety and new characters helped catapult this game into millions of homes.Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy Kong's Quest plays out like this: Donkey Kong has been kidnapped by King K Rool (now called Kaptain K Rool) and wants DK's banana hoard as a ransom payment. Instead, Diddy Kong and his partner, Dixie Kong, decide to rescue him. Like the first game, you can play a one player game (you control both characters), two player game (you and another player control the characters) and two player contest (players take turns in conquering the stages.) There are brand new worlds with new stages to explore and it's all under the \"pirate\" theme as old and new enemies dress and talk the part. You'll be going through the stages collecting bananas, letters and 1ups to rack up extra lives like before. This time, you'll also collect banana coins (the game's currency), Kremling coins (special currency to gain access to a secret world) and 'DK' coins. New animals join in to help you this as well as old friends like Rambi and Enguarde. You'll also meet new characters to help you along the way as well. Save your progress when you reach a certain character and you'll need to do so often because the challenge has been ramped up this time.The PROS: If you thought Donkey Kong Country was an awesome game, then this sequel blows it out of the water completely! Everything that made DKC great is here for DKC2 and more stuff was added: new worlds plus a secret one, more stages with more depth and variety, new Kong characters and friendly animals along with some old favorites, more stuff to collect doubling its replay value and even more codes to discover. It's also a lot harder so don't be surprised to replay certain stages more than once.The CONS: None.Rare went all out and produced a game that is worthy of being the sequel to Donkey Kong Country. It's easy to see why this game sold out just as quickly and had people amazed that the SNES was capable of playing this kind of game. It was another groundbreaking experience at the time and it still holds up as a fun game. You can get this game used or if you have a Wii, download this game from the Virtual Console Service for 800 points ($8.00.)

The beach volleyball that is supposedly the center of the game is just an afterthought.  It is a poor simulation, with only one terrible camera angle and simplistic control.

Rhodes","summary":"Extremely Fun","reviewText":"With Soul Calibur V hitting store shelves, it seemed apt to go back for a change and pick up Soul Calibur IV.  The game came out in the midst of the revival of the fighting genre.  It had to compete with the likes of Street Fighter IV, Super Smash Brothers Brawl, Tekken 6, and BlazBlue just to name a few contenders.  In terms of sheer combat and gameplay, Soul Calibur IV is remarkable.  It may, in fact, be the most fun of all the Soul Calibur games from a multiplayer standpoint.Story has rarely been a strong suit for Soul Calibur.  The relationship between characters is often interesting, but aside from that the main story isn't quite as interesting.  Soul Calibur IV seems to be self aware of this as the actual story mode with each character is really short and isn't really filled with a lot of story at all.  There is, however, a nice little handy chart that gives you character biographies and shows the relationship between characters that actually can make the cast of Soul Calibur IV interesting.  And while the story mode is laughable, each character has their own journey you can play through.  It consists of five battles.  Two standard fights, a mid boss, another standard battle and finally the actual boss.  It's a simple thing, but seeing as how you've got quite a few stories to play through it can suffice.  For those who just want straight shot battling there is always the Arcade Mode which puts you through eight different battles where you score as many points as you can and finish as fast as you can.As far as single player content goes, Soul Calibur IV doesn't quite go to the depths of the second or third installment.  There is the Arcade and Story Mode.  There is also the Extra Arcade Mode and Extra Versus, which we'll talk about shortly.  At the very least, however, Soul Calibur IV does have the Tower of Souls which can be quite attractive to those looking for a challenge.  Here you can either ascend or descend the tower.  Ascending has you going to different floors and taking on various challenges.  Such as taking on a horde of enemies with only a single life gauge, or defeating an enemy before time runs out.  There are also bonuses and unlockable content to behold should you fulfill certain conditions in some of the challenges.  For example, you might just have to defeat the enemy, but the game might reward you with treasure (usually a piece of equipment) or gold if you do something more such as pull of three grabs in a match, or switch characters three times, or perform a certain amount of impacts.  It gives you reason to play through some of the challenges a second or third time.Descending is a different story.  This is effectively a survival mode with a strange boss character appears every five floors.  It's much more of a challenge than previous survival modes.  As you descend your health will regenerate a small amount should you emerge victorious on each floor.  But it is definitely a challenge.The Tower of Souls is indeed a nice addition but it has nothing on the single player content offered by Soul Calibur II or III.  On the other hand what you do get is an extremely good multiplayer suite.  And when I say good, I mean VERY good.  Soul Calibur IV has one of the best multiplayer experience of the entire series.  The single player stuff will be over and done with soon (depending on how well you can get through the tower of souls, that is) but the multiplayer almost never gets old.  It's fast paced and intricate in the sense that newcomers and veterans will be able to step on in.  There are complex combos and such for those familiar with Soul Calibur, but for those just learning the series for the first time, there are plenty of simple moves to pull off.  Although this can lead to some people winning fights through button mashing, it's still a ton of fun given that anyone can pick up and play, and those who have already learned Soul Calibur aren't exactly punished thanks to what it offers.  It's always fun to pull of a surprisingly difficult combo and watch it succeed.  Especially because everything is flashy.  Soul Calibur IV also offers up a nice handicap system so that people can play according to their own experience and style against someone else.  Are you a beginner playing against an expert?  You can set your total health to be higher and his to be lower to give you a fighting chance.  And the game leaves this up to be your choice.There are certain elements to Soul Calibur IV's combat that make it stand above all else.  The first and most obvious change from the third game is that every person in battle has a piece of armor they wear.  There are three.  Top, middle and bottom.  Dealing enough damage causes a piece of armor to break.  If the armor breaks, attacks that correspond to that area will deal more damage (i.e. if your top armor breaks, high attacks will do more damage).  It adds an element of desperation when all your armor pieces are broken.The second big new element is the critical finish.  These are really flashy attacks that seem clearly inspired by Mortal Kombat's fatalities.  The idea behind critical finishes is genius, although the stipulations for pulling one off are quite hard to obtain in a battle.  You're likely to see one or two, but you won't use them that often.  In past games, players were known to block.  A lot.  Critical Finishes were implemented for to punish those who relied far too heavily on blocking.  Every character has a Soul Gauge.  The more attacks you land the brighter it glows until it's blue.  The more attacks you block the weaker it gets until your gauge is red.  When you're gauge is red and starts flashing your next guard might cause you to stagger.  At this point your opponent can execute a Critical Finish.  A critical finish is just that... a critical finish.  It doesn't matter how much life you have left, the battle ends.  You're more likely to actually pull these off on CPU opponents rather than actual players, however.  The critical finish definitely discourages blocking, but you're rarely likely to need them.  Like Mortal Kombat's fatalities, you'll be interested to see everyone's, but in order for that to happen you'll likely end up going into the training mode and setting it up to easily see it for yourself.What really makes Soul Calibur IV's multiplayer fun is that there are a ton of fighters to choose from.  Certainly there are clones, but the various fighting styles and diverse move lists of the characters make it so that everyone will be able to find someone they can play as with little to stand in their way.  But a layer of strategy is actually added to Soul Calibur IV thanks to the ability to create custom characters.While custom characters will be based off the style of other characters, there's actually quite a bit you can do with them.  There are tons of different outfits to put on and tons of different weapons to unlock.  And you'll slowly unlock all of this stuff as you play.  And there is a lot to unlock, giving you incentive to play through the Tower of Souls and to constantly revisit the various story modes.  At least all of this is fun, but what makes it unique is the layer of strategy.  The different pieces of equipment have an impact on stats.  Mainly our HP, Attack and Defense.  But they also enhance certain skillsets which will allow you to equip various skills.  This not only gives you reason to jump in... but to experiment as well.  There's a surprising amount of depth.  You can also customize the characters who already exist and give them better weapons or equipment as well.Figuring out just how to customize a character is actually a lot of work, however.  If you're having trouble in the Tower of Souls it's likely because you need to create a custom character and assign abilities to them to give you the edge.  And these abilities range from basic, \"Increase attack power of vertical or horizontal strikees,\" to others that can be extremely helpful when you learn how to use them correctly, such as the Venom Fang or the Impact Heal.  Yes, Soul Calibur IV will reward smart players.  Especially in the Tower of Souls, which seems to be catered toward the hardcore of Soul Calibur.  Button mashing in the Tower of Souls will get you no where, but creating characters with the right skill set for the right challenge definitely will.  If you don't actually take time to learn  the various mechanics of the system... the Tower of Souls WILL crush you.  And this is why Soul Calibur IV manages to have depth where it's sequel does not.  It's important to master the various guard impacts.  It's important to figure out which pieces of armor to put on to improve which stat... and which weapons to use based on their attacks or the inherent skills they may possess.  Soul Calibur IV can be surprisingly addicting just based off this mechanic alone.  Mainly because it gives you a lot of different ways to approach some of the challenges brought up by the Tower of Souls (or to power your way through each character's story mode).You can also use custom characters with their weapons and abilities in Versus Mode as well.  You can also do this for arcade mode.  And this can really make the multiplayer aspect fun.  And even those who just want to use them for aesthetic purposes can do this, as the \"Standard Versus\" grants no actual bonuses based on your weapons or equipment.This all adds up to make Soul Calibur IV more fun than meets the eye.  The extra layer of strategy used by this as well as how the game encourages players to learn the mechanics through the Tower of Souls.  You could easily spend hours on Soul Calibur IV thanks to this.  But playing against friends is also a lot of fun.  Especially when you both design custom characters and go into the Extra Versus Mode.Namco will not skimp on the presentation of a Soul Calibur game and it shows.  Soul Calibur IV is by far one of the most gorgeous looking and detailed games you'll find this generation.  Characters move smoothly and in conjunction with their weapon.  The stages you'll fight in are also incredibly detailed.  Soul Calibur IV has excellent presentation coupled with a great soundtrack to present it.  The music is absolutely astonishing.  As are the sound effects.  In terms of production the game is just all around good.  Degrading as always, however, is the voice acting.  Although by now fans are probably immune to it.  Some of the cheesiness of the characters dialog may even be comforting.  There's not too much of it, though.  And it's not like you'll want to jab your ears with something sharp that you'll go deaf.  Eventually the voice acting just becomes background noise.  The voices themselves actually compliment the characters.  What might be the take away is that some of the lines are just not so great.  Take the announcer who, upon gaining victory just simply says, \"Victory belongs to the last one standing...\" you kind of expect him to say more but it just ends there.  The words are spoken but it doesn't feel like they were there to mean anything.  Just feels like they were spoken because they know it can be done at times.If anything, Soul Calibur IV is a great game to play.  The multiplayer, especially, is incredibly addictive.  The game also goes online.  Your mileage is likely to vary from one match to the next.  I played in some rounds that did me some good, but I connected to some that just simply weren't playable.  For the most part the experiences were good rather than bad.  From a multiplayer standpoint, Soul Calibur IV is the best in the series.  From a single player?  That's a different story.  While Soul Calibur IV offers enough, the previous outings offered much more content.  While Soul Calibur IV will keep you busy to unlock all the various equipment, weapons, etc... you'll find that were it not for the multiplayer and in depth character customization you wouldn't really have a whole lot to actually do in Soul Calibur IV.  At the very least, Soul Calibur IV actually lets you set up a battle against the CPU if you like... this is something that previous Soul Calibur games simply didn't do.  If there wasn't a second controller plugged in you ONLY had access to the single player portion.  Here you can set up exhibition battles against the computer if you simply don't feel like diving into the Arcade, Story or Tower of Souls modes.  And yes, it's actually a lot of fun given how you can adjust the difficulty, life gauges and even set up battles among custom characters.  This is, of course, nice if you simply don't want to go online for the moment or if there are no friends to fight against at the time.  And because battling is so much fun, even going up against the CPU is perfectly fine.  One could easily spend hours just setting up their own custom versus matches alone.Soul Calibur IV manages to be fun because it's got mechanics that really work.  The single player experience isn't quite as big as one would expect, but at least it offers up something for players.  The multiplayer is fantastic, especially the online component and there is a lot of customization.  It isn't quite the essential Soul Calibur in terms of a complete package, but from a multiplayer standpoint... it stands tall.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2012"}

I xecpected to find a average game at best but came out amazed. This is truly impressive. This game has no campaign. The whole game is based on missions. Each mission has a different objective that you must go through that is anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes long. Missions are your basic survive mission. Then there are speed missions where you clear the area out as fast as possible. Then there are stealth mission. Ive never really been that big a fan on stealth but this game in those particular missions make it work. You can get up to 5 stars per mission depending on how well you play the mission. Once you get x amount of stars there are bonus missions where you have to take down a boss. And the missions as you go through get harder. The controls work great and it is easy to fire from the hip or you can touch the screen to zoom through your weapon. Tapping the screen to zoom is remarkably easy. The game as you would expect has challenges online that change quiet often. The graphics are very good. Cant say enough about the great game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2012"}

Excellence in open-world design.","reviewText":"I see that a ton of reviews are already up so I will just get to the important details. This game did have a day one patch that added a bunch of content and fixed some things. Expect more DLC and support as I am sure this game is selling well. People have been up in arms over the reviews being from C level to A level. The C's scaring some fans. I have no idea what those reviewers are smoking to be quite honest. And the one star reviews are here are just hilarious.This is a 9/10 game for this time period. The graphics for a PS4 title in its infancy are pretty damn amazing, even coming from a high-end PC as I do. It's really sweet to see what they are getting out of this machine. Some things are lacking but I'm giving this one a solid 8/10 here and I am very picky about things. The jaggies are pretty minimal and we are getting a decently stable 1080p/30FPS experience. Lighting is wowzers at some points as are some of the city's complexities. I think people looking for more of a toss between the first game and the second will love what they have here.As for the gameplay I see no reason why this game is a C or average if you will. I am having a blast still playing through it to 100%. Surfing around the city has never felt so good. The people that are being so harsh on this are just typical baiters if you ask me. This IS the best game released this gen so far in my honest opinion. Sure, the missions can be a little repetitive and it's not doing anything wildly new, but I can't tell you how much I have really wanted a next-gen Infamous and that is what this is through and through. Even people who are not at all enamored by the game can at least respect the technical details and the smooth gameplay. NO other game lets you have this much fun in a city with superpowers.But we are in a console war here. And as you can see from the preposterous 1 star reviews, and also from certain magazines totally glossing over the inherent quality in the gameplay dynamics despite it being a sequel, a lot of people don't seem to like that the PS4 has taken the lead back from Microsoft. Time will tell what happens but this is a clear GOTY candidate for me.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2014"}

{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"Talduras","summary":"Link's back, and looking better than ever!","reviewText":"I'll skip the history lesson and get straight to the point.If you're looking for more Legend of Zelda, this is it.  Don't be turned off by the cel-shaded visuals.  In fact, I think they add a little extra personality to the game.  However, if you're still annoyed, just wait for the next one, of which there are already some screenshots of showing off a more realistic visual style.Anyway, like I said, the cel-shading adds some extra personality to the game.  There are several emotions that can be shown on the characters (Link included), and in fact suit the more story oriented direction of the game.  Oh, there's still a lot of gameplay, but from start to finish they added some extra stuff that will appeal to Zelda fans.  In fact, I can't think of a single Zelda fan that wouldn't like the final showdown between Link and Ganon (yep... he's back).  The environmental visuals are also worth mentioning.  The world is so much more vibrant than Ocarina of Time (the Zelda game on the N64).  That says a lot, considering how incredible Ocarina of Time looked back then in the environmental effects department.Sound wise, this is standard Zelda fare.  However, it's worth mentioning that this game does well in the technical department here.  One great touch is how they add a little extra strength to the battles by using sound and music.  Not only that, tensity in general is aided by just minor touches added in the audio department.Now the gameplay.  One of the best things in this game is the fights.  The targeting system from Ocarina of Time is back, but along with it they've slightly spruced up how battles work.  First off, the different ways to take out an enemy has increased a little bit.  You can pick up enemy weapons from defeated foes, though only keep them for that area.  While not entirely significant, it's a nice touch that makes the fights more dynamic and fun.  Secondly, the enemies block better... or at least the ones that are capable of it.  Going up against some of the armored baddies and moblins is quite fun.  A full room of them is just an absolute blast (as well as challenging), and there are a few places in the games that are packed with these enemies.  Also, the game has added a new option called \"parry.\"  It's actually better than it sounds.  Basically, if certain enemies get into a certain attack position, there's an audio and visual cue that says you can perform a parry attack.  If you press it soon enough, not only will you dodge their attack, but then Link will do a cool attack on the enemy that's usually does quite a bit of damage, or breaks an enemy's defense.There is one big flaw that would likely keep me from playing this again.  The ocean.  The world of Wind Waker is separated into little islands.  To get to these, you have to sail on a boat (a talking boat that actually gives you hints throughout the game) and go from one island to the next.  This can be a problem, because there's quite a bit of traveling to be done, and there's also quite a bit of time consumed in travel.  On top of that, one part of the game actually requires you to go on sort of a \"scavenger hunt\" to find some items necessary for completing the game.  This is the only reason I give the game 4 stars instead of 5 (it's pretty prevalent, too, and non-avoidable).At the very least, anyone who has a Gamecube should play through this game once.  If you can get past the traveling element, you will find a beautiful, rich, and engaging world in Wind Waker.  If you can't, then at the very least rent it.  The world of this game is more fully realized than ever.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2004"}

Even if party characters can be tolerated, it's not easy to sympathize at times, especially the main character, which is rather unfitted to lead a team, to say the least. This game isn't heavy on story, so left me disappointed, since I had high expectation after playing its predecessor Till the End of Time.The graphic are what we can expected from a mid to low budget RPG, a couple of things the developers failed where the lack of details on environments and the shadows are absolutely awful, the worst I've seen on a PS3 game to this date. Once again, feels like Japanese game industry thinks that, delivering a quality experience in terms of visuals and sound are not important. Just as a quick example: compare this title and other JRPGs to Mass Effect 2 or Elder Scrolls series.The gameplay is really fun and never gets borings and this aspect saves the game from being a failure; similar to previous games in the series, but introduces some new features that makes it truly enjoyable. Not all is great though, one thing that I can't understand is why JRPGs still instill of having such few save points; one might argue that is because it adds challenge to the experience, but just let me say this: 5 to 6 hour dungeon without save point is abusing a players patience. Did happen to me not once but twice that, a power outage and the game got frozen during my gameplay, and it's highly frustrating to start all over, only because there were not enough save points.Despite all the major flaws this game had, I still felt much rewarded at the end; opinions might differ from player to player, but it's my humble opinion that Japanese developers need to take a look at US and European games, so that they know what the competition is doing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00020LZAW","description":"Killzone is a squad-based, first-person shooter, set in the near future during a period of planetary colonization. Drawing inspiration from classical military conflicts of the 20th century, Killzone demonstrates a unique graphical style that captures the grit and realism of intense military warfare.","reviewerName":"David Foskin \"SneakyGoblin on XBL\"","summary":"Pushes the PS2 to the limit, NOT a Halo killer though","reviewText":"Be sure to understand that Killzone is not a Halo clone. Killzone is about a handful of average soldiers being forced into working as a team as they fight through a war-torn world, often engaging in street warfare just to get to the next location.The game begins after the Helghan invasion of of Vetka. ISA forces have been vainly in heavy combat on Vetka, but the powerful Helghan forces has left a brutal impact on the populace. The game begins with the players taking on the role of Captain Jan Templar, who fights his way back to where General Vaughton is stationed. The General sends Templar on a mission to rescue a spy, and during the process of said mission, Templar picks up three additional playable team members. From this point, this mini-squad must take on missions in reaction to the events that play out in the story.Over the first few areas, you're only in control of the standard trooper, Templar, but as you pick up more allies, you'll get your choice of team member at the beginning of each mission. The four team members play differently and have various bonuses and detriments. Luger has heat vision, Hakha can sneak up on Helghast, while Rico is the all around heavy gunner who can take additional punishment. The action in Killzone is broken up into levels, which are further separated into sublevels. While each level features the occasional checkpoint, players can only save at the end of each stage. Rather than a seamless gameworld, Killzone's stages are broken up by lengthy load screens.The core gameplay of Killzone is your standard FPS fare, though you will find more of the game will be spent fighting behind cover to minimize your damage. A lot of running from cover to cover should be expected. To this effect, you have a sprint button that will lower your weapon and allow you to run a short distance. You'll have primary and secondary fire (on most weapons) and even grenades to your disposal. If you get in close, you can perform a melee attack to disarm and take out your opponent.While there is no ability to jump, you will find the occasional barrier that you can leap over. Along your path, you'll often find gun and cannon emplacements. With the tap of a button, you can use that firepower to your own. But, considering the legions of Helghast that come after you, the most heavy ammo you can drop, the better.While Killzone does feature a variety of weapons, there is some imbalance in terms of stopping power. With only three weapons a player can have on hand, it won't take long for players to figure out what they should keep on hand. The assault rifle is pretty solid, but never has enough ammo. On the other hand, the Helghast assault rifle takes way too many bullets to drop an enemy. The shotgun has a long reload time, which almost negates it's usefulness. Of course, there's heavy ordinance to be found and abused, including grenade launchers and a rocket launcher.Along with the main story are both online and standard multiplayer modes. Both provide extra enjoyment, but are dependent on the quality of your opponents. Fortunately, there's more of an arcade-like element to the multiplayer, allows for faster, more furious gunbattles. Of course, you can always try to play it more like the story missions, but with so many good weapons being spawned, why bother?Visually, Killzone has a wonderful art direction that works to deliver a solid and believable gameworld. The Helghast are successfully presented as an intimidating Nazi/Jin-Roh hybrid that the player must push on through. The game world does a fine job at setting up real world locations, whether they be war ravaged streets, a park, a swamp or soldier-infested docks. Levels are laid out in such a way that most of the scenarios provide both challenge and a certain level of intensity. From a technical standpoint, though, Killzone is pushing the PS2 for all it can get and still could use more power. While there is a lot of minor details, the limited color palette and repetitive and low-res textures wash out many locations and even leave some areas feeling quite repetitive. You'll also find a serious lack of enemy variety will leave you feeling like you're killing the same foes over and over again. I have to wonder if Killzone was on a brawnier unit, would the levels have more visual detail and larger? Would there be more enemy types and would the draw distance be longer?The audio portion proves to be a solid augment to the visual portion. Music is nicely done and works with the futuristic military theme of the story. Sound effects have a good bit of variety and range, especially in the gun sounds and explosions. In the story sequences, the voice cast (including Kal Webber, Tom Clarke Hill and Brian Cox) does a good job with the script they're given. During gameplay, though, their comments are limited and can get old pretty fast. Even worse is that the Helghast have even fewer comments, so killing them by the score isn't made better by the the repetitious comments.Is Killzone a bad game? Not really. There is certainly a good time to be had here, but it really depends on what you have available to you. If you have access to a PC or Xbox, Killzone pales in comparison to other titles already available. If all you have is a PS2, then Killzone is likely one of the best games the genre will offer you right now. With a little more power for the engine and more refinement, this could have been a great game, but there is still a good time to be had here.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2006"}

Though I gotta say, when first starting up this game the dusty and bullet ridden warzone first stage had me so excited I almost pee'd in my pants: you meet up with other soldiers and fight alongside them making you feel like you're really part of something big. You take down frightening red-eyed enemies and blow lots of crap up, always fun. The first few levels of the game are some of the most enjoyable in the shooter genre.But once you meet up with the three other main characters (which eventually become playable) is where things start to go downhill. For one thing, you KEEP taking down the same enemies over and over, using the same tactics because they all respond virtually exactly the same, the only differences being the number of them and if they're using more powerful weapons. Other times these enemies are so stupid they'll literally stand there and let you kill them, all the while uttering the same exact grunts and groans and one-liners again and again and again. If that weren't bad enough, the developers seem to have run out of good ideas for stages early on, whereas the first quarter of the game feels like gold compared to the sub-par increasingly linearized level design of the rest of the game. Did I also mention graphics tend to chop up when the action gets intense? The fact that some of your weapons are so hard to aim doesn't really help either (I kept playing with the analog sensitivity in the options menu and never found a comfortable setting).Now, tip for gamers: keep using Rico. First off, he's got the best gun in the game as his primary weapon, and he can take a lot more damage than his three other wimpy compadres (I have a question, why give the one female character in the game nightvision if it's never necessary in any part of the game whatsoever?). Anyways, you'll basically sit through a dumb cliched storyline between levels and some increasingly choppy cutscenes all to get to a final \"boss\" who's so easy and pathetic the bomb of this game's ending just makes you laugh at yourself in shame for having spent so much time for nothing. The challenge never really gets any higher, and \"puzzles\" are basically finding the switch to get to the next area. It's all pretty easy to say the least.BOTTOM LINE: (...), this mission is probably worth pursuing for those who want an action packed mindless FPS, but for anyone looking for challenge, strategy and a memorable experience, keep looking.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2006"}

The only big complaint I have with the game is the camera control, a lot of times you have to jump or swing across a roof or edge of a building to the other side and make sure you don't miss as you jump over and sometimes the camera angles in some of these levels don't let you see the other side you're supposed to jump to making it sometimes annoying as you see your character plummet and are forced to start again.

While the D-Day level in Medal of Honor: Allied Assault was a nice change from the typical John Wayne style FPS that involves almost no tactical thinking beyond cover and concealment, BIA slaps all players in the face with intense realism including realistic war violence, strong language and quick-thinking or you're dead levels.However, unlike Unreal Tourny or Soldier of Fortune where the graphic violence is just for kicks, BIA shows you the true nature and violence of war from heads exploding to just about anything you've seen in Saving Private Ryan or We Were Soldiers.  War is hell and Ubi Soft made a great effort to show just that as it was meant to be.  The soldiers also talk like real soldiers; foul and vulgar... then again, when you're being shot at constantly, one tends to lose his verbal temper.The gameplay is also quite impressive with easy to use command systems and a comprehensible overview map allowing the play to use real tactics in order to complete the objectives and the mission.  The enemy AI is pretty impressive compared to other WWII and FPS games I've played so don't expect to easily outwit your enemies.I also love how you actually have to use the ironsights to accurately shoot your weapon and it diverts your attention away from your surroundings.  This is exactly what happens when you focus on shooting rather then minding your surroundings, which can lead you into an ambush if you're not careful.The only real beef I have with BIA is the multiplayer; there's no co-op and co-op would've been incredibley fun and would've taught more teamwork then working with an AI squad.

{"product_name":"B00BMFIXOW","description":"","reviewerName":"Mike","summary":"AWESOME game.  MUST own.","reviewText":"This is simply an amazing game.  The game is HUGE, and the total size of the map is bigger than any other AC game.  They've added a lot of things to do that all feel conducive to the gameplay experience itself, such as attacking and boarding enemy ships to rob them of supplies, incorporating Blackbeard and other pirates into the story as well as factual events in history (which other AC games do, but this is PIRATES!), and I love the hunting aspects of the game as well.  There's just something satisfying about spearing a great white shark on a tiny little rowboat in the face when it tries to pop up and eat your boat.There are, as others have said, some quirks with the controls, but that's also something that's existed in other AC games.  There have been a few times that I've literally screamed at Ed Kenway because he's doing exactly the opposite of what my thumbs are telling him to do, getting me killed sometimes.  The fact that you can instantly reboot right before wherever you were makes that less painful, however.  I also loved the fact that you can expand your &#34;radio&#34; of sorts by finding shanties for your crew to sing, which makes long boat trips a little more entertaining as well as upgrading your ship to become a terror on the seas.If someone's focusing on the graphics, remember that this is a port and wasn't designed on the PS4 so it doesn't utilize the full graphical capabilities of the system.  That said it still looks great and crisp.One last note-I was pleasantly surprised to find that my past Assassin's Creed gameplay experiences were incorporated into this game through exclusive outfits worn by the assassins in those games.

{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Bean","summary":"An exciting, if unpolished conclusion to a great Sci-Fi trilogy!","reviewText":"After 28 hours of shooting monsters, playing diplomat and trying to romance fellow crew members my time with 'Mass Effect 3' came to a close and I had to decide whether or not to start up a new game. It's not very often I feel like I'm a part of a video game trilogy that's spanned almost five years and it's incredibly satisfying seeing how the gameplay has changed, improved and expanded in this series. Unfortunately 'Mass Effect' has been a surprisingly unpolished video game since the start and for every improvement 'Mass Effect 3' has made a lot of the flaws in this series have gone unchecked.Unlike the original 'Mass Effect' (and the 20 minute-long tutorial/character creator that began Mass Effect 2) 'Mass Effect 3' wastes no time throwing you from the character creator/importer into it's main conflict: series villains, the robotic \"Reapers\" are attacking earth and destroying everything in their path. As the hero, Commander Shepard you must escape off-planet and rally help from other alien races before things get worse. Needless to say the story in 'Mass Effect 3' hits on some serious levels and the feeling of \"this is the end\" is realized from the beginning with a powerful music score and images of buildings burning, people and children dying and Reapers tearing through cities in the background. Like 'Mass Effect' and 'Mass Effect 2' the narrative in this epic tale doesn't always hold up to scrutiny (and I would've loved to have more time with some of the returning characters like Jack, Jacob and Grunt) but 'Mass Effect 3' knows how to deliver it's emotional punches and I found myself cheering and choking up a couple times.As with the previous games, 'Mass Effect 3' has you playing equal parts Soldier and Diplomat: Before giving Shepard help the other galactic races have you solving their problems which involve fighting off the pro-human splinter-group Cerberus as well as brokering peace-treaties. While the dialogue wheel is present (with some, but not a lot of Paragon/Renegade options) solving conflicts and gathering resources in the Normandy gives you numeric score, or \"War Assets\". The total number of Assets you have determines how the story will play out in the end (i.e. how much \"help\" you have before join the battle on earth). I'm not completely a fan of \"numbers\" playing such a big role in decision making, especially with the added \"Galactic Readiness\" chopping things in half if you don't use the multiplayer but it's an interesting, if impersonal way for your decisions to impact the story.The story-moments in 'Mass Effect 3' carry the same strong cast and voice-acting as the previous installments (with Freddie Prinze Jr. a welcome addition as Lieutenant James Vega) but the combat has received a major overhaul. Gone are the Tom Clancy-lite moments of ME1 and the empty corridors and mini-games of ME2; Combat is fast and frenetic as guns have a lot more weight to them feeling more like 'Vanquish' or 'Gears of War' than previous ME games. Enemies rush you from every direction (in normal mode) and you'll have to dodge, cover and combine squad powers to take down the strongest of them. This creates great moments of tension while still making you feel like a total bad-ass! The only problem I had was that some of my class-powers didn't work half the time which became frustrating when I had to rely on them (namely the Infiltrator's snipe-focus).While I can deal with the \"War Assets\" and some unreliable class-abilites, as I played Mass Effect 3 I kept asking myself one question: why is this game series, after THREE GAMES still having the same technical issues? Graphics fade in and out, limbs and characters disappear, and to make matters worse I can't import my character appearance I've had since ME1. Again, nothing that really killed my enjoyment of the game ( I eventually came up with something that kinda-sorta looked like my character) but seeing these problems still present after five years is both disappointing and little heart-breaking.The ending of 'Mass Effect 3' has caused some outrage among fans, demanding both explanations and complete rewrites of the game. I understand the disappointment as there are no clear-cut story resolutions nor is there much difference in the endings you're given. But even if I hated the finale (I didn't) the ending's never been what I remember about a video game and frankly it doesn't come close to ruining how much fun the gameplay is or forgetting the moments that had me choking up on the Tuchanka missions.In the end I restarted 'Mass Effect 3' and am still enjoying the hell out of it (the multiplayer's surprisingly fun too). I really hope there's updates to fix the character importer and class-power-glitches (and as of 6/26 Bioware's added more DLC to flesh out the ending), but overall I'm very happy with the experience. If you're new to the series you definitely want to start out with the first game as there's so much carry-over from the previous titles (many conflicts from the previous games like the Krogan Genophage and Quarian/Geth War are finally resolved), but I think 'Mass Effect 3' stands very well as a conclusion to the trilogy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0001ADAME","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution.

All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Hadi Jones \"The Tree\"","summary":"The start of western games on ps2, this game ain't worthy","reviewText":"Hey, if you're looking for a vintage western shooter, this game is it. It's like one of those John Wayne movies, bad guys, Saloons and same plots, plus an ugly damsel in distresss. I didn't much like it because it was too vintage, not modern, and the gameplay was so slow, it took a total of 5 seconds to shoot a bad guy... after i pulled the trigger. But if you're a western fan, this will do for now, in the mean time, another western based on the movie Open Range will be coming out by early 2005 in PS2, PSP, X-BOX and Gamecube, that or John Wayne's Rio Bravo which was announced early this year at the E3 Show to be coming out fall of 2004.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2004"}

I pre-ordered this from another website a couple of weeks ago and I received it in the mail yesterday. I was actually surprised because the company threw in an extra controller; so I got the console, two black controllers (one in retail packaging) and the Titanfall Digital Download card. The only complaint I have with this bundle is the full game download card; the game took 6 hours to download onto the HD. The best thing about this download was that the Kinect scans the barcode and the downloading begins, no more typing in the 25 digit code (unless you want too). Other than this, I'm really happy with everything. This is the first of many highly anticipated game budges to come from Microsoft. Thank you...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2014"}

Blending unique gameplay, humorous characters and interactions, and the aforementioned graphics,Munch's Oddyseesimply feels unlike any other game in the 2001 console gaming lineup. Players control two characters in the game: Munch, a wheelchair-bound hero, and Abe, a character some gamers will recognize from previous Oddworld games. Their goal is to find and free the Mudokon queen, keeper of the remaining eggs of an endangered species.Both characters feature unique talents that, via a tag-team style of play, propel the player through the game. For instance, Abe can climb and jump to reach new areas, as well as temporarily possess an enemy's soul via a chant. The web-footed Munch can swim to new areas and, when on the roll in his wheelchair, use his sonar plug to control machinery remotely. Saving an entire race also requires a coordinated effort on everyone's part. To get the job done quickly, players can deliver verbal commands to kinsmen. They'll gladly greet you (in a witty manner), then gang up on a mean-spirited enemy or accomplish difficult tasks for you. As with the rest of the game world, the finely detailed characters and environments, as well as a refreshing charm, draw you into an experience with the quality of a Pixar film. Prepare for gaming to get very odd indeed.","reviewerName":"Seppo Helava","summary":"Not quite equal to its predecessors, but interesting anyway.","reviewText":"While it's beautiful, the characters are intriguing, and the premise is unique, as it always is in the Oddworld games, Munch's Oddysee is distinctly less fulfilling than its predecessors. Whether it's because Munch simply isn't as appealing as Abe, or whether it's because the game now feels like it's made up of distincly isolated puzzles, strung together by a story, as opposed to a traditional platformer, Munch is less compelling, less addictive, and in a sense, less interesting than its predecessor.Is it a bad game? By no means. It's often laugh-out-loud funny, the characters are quickly endearing, and the puzzles are often quite clever. It's a bit stilted in the actual fluidity of the levels, and the character-switching mechanic keeps the player from ever feeling any sense of real immersion, but overall, despite its problems, a worthwhile experience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2002"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"Christopher Deweese","summary":"Didn't Know What I Had","reviewText":"I'm a Resistance: Fall of Man veteran and was eagerly awaiting the sequel, Resistance 2.  After playing through most of the single player campaign, I have to say that I like it.  But I don't absolutely love it.  Here's why.  The graphics are good, but not as good as Gears 2.  The big monster bosses look flawless, but a lot of the environments have a bland, plasticky look to them.  For example, the rubble doesn't have quite the grittiness that you see in Gears 2.  I really miss having access to all the weapons at any one time.  Only being able to carry two weapons now isn't quite as fun.  I kind of miss the narration from the first game.  Most of the story in Resistance 2 comes from your squadmates barking at you, but it loses some of the cinematic quality that Resistance 1 had.  The ease of control, awesome framerate, and sound quality are all terrific.  The multiplayer is heads and tails above just about anything else on the market (60 player, co-op, etc.).  I would certainly recommend this title to anyone with a PS3, but I have to say I am finding more and more things from Fall of Man that I wish was still in Resistance 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2008"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"AeroEngineer","summary":"Eh! Pretty Good FPS if not anything too special","reviewText":"Another note is the whole Steam thing, it's a good way to avoid the virusware that is securom but it does have that drawback of when you try to resell a game it is a hassle. I had HL2 played it, resold it and of course the buyer said that steam said it was a copy and would not let them play so they returned it. What a hassle, you have to somehow do the whole transfer thing through steam after you just want to sell something you thought you owned when you bought it but didn't really.How about giving me back 20% of the original cost for shipping I had to pay and didn't get back, going through the hassle of transferring it through Steam, storing the discs/box and usage of my hard drive, also the usage of CPU power that I had to pay for? Not such a great deal if more equal terms are offered are they Steam?Oh I WON'T hold my breath for Steam to do that of course I'll also not bother to \"buy\" or \"own\" games that require Steam either, so what are my options for true ownership of something in that case? Well see the black market for that one!What can I say this is another FPS, it seems to bear some story semblances to the previous Fear which was a great horror action game with some genuinely scary sequences and great graphics at its release. I've played up and into the city interval which is pretty fun to play. I went back to play the original fear and found it to be pretty boring though with the much maligned \"industrial\" spaces and endless offices. I don't really see that changed much just substitute hospitals and other research bunkers into the mix. This one seems to have fairly updated graphics but I have not been blown away in any way or even scared much excepting the shock/reflex type of startling scared when good old Alma flashes in my face.The whole you being some special person in the context is okay if pretty overdone, this reminds me of the add on pack that came after the first Fear game just so obviously being an add on story that it's not much to get excited about. The mechanics of play seem not much changed since the first one with the exception of being able to move certain objects. One thing I didn't like was the absence so far of any exciting new weapons to play with especially when it comes to the audio part of using them. I suppose the campaign is of average length and the city level is pretty good although overhyped in my opinion. I liked the primarily audio oriented unfolding of intelligence in the first one, this on went the cheap route of sprinkling text intelligence to be picked up by you and read in little snippets, not very engaging and most of the time was ignored by me.The one new enemy that is neat is the spirit guy who controls corpses and is a genuine challenge to dispose of. This whole thing of the company covering up stuff is pretty blah as well as the executive that seems to play a part in it. I'm thinking that studios are better off doing more original works than just go into franchising mode as it seems that the meat and potatoes of the whole story were really presented and finished with the first installment. If you are going to design a game to have sequels you should tell only as much as necessary in the earlier installments like Gears or Halo did not lay everything out and then tack on stuff like Fear has done and that requires more original thinking and storytelling skills than it does graphical wowing. Maybe sequels are not the way to go in the future just flesh out a a selected main character in the first installment going forward, see the Iliad and the Odyssey for examples.Anyone with a pile of cash can just make a game that looks amazing but is a mile wide and an inch thick and in my opinion this one is not particularly amazing looking nor is the \"me special too\" storyline worth a whole lot. But that seems to be the business of VG's now, just put another sequel out there and get paid enough to do it again in another couple of years when everyone has forgot the first one and will be lead by the marketing to believe this is a new and worthy sequel, thankfully we now have opinion outlets like this to warn everyone who takes a more sensible approach to VG purchases.I suppose if you are a hopeless VG addict and need a fresh fix in these non-holiday season times you could pick this up, but I wouldn't recommend it at the retail price at all. However it's not awful in any meaningful way it's just that it's just more of the same with this generation graphics.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2009"}

I had a pretty good view of the flatlands that lay ahead of me down below and as far as I could tell, there was nothing to either side of me so I was free and clear of any danger. I finally made it to the bottom and maybe thirty, forty steps from the base of the hill, I was thrown into a scene of absolute mayhem.A dragon touched down unexpectedly behind me with a dull thud, creating a cloud of dust with its beating wings. The dust cleared and I looked up at it, merely a few feet away from me, sure I was going to be torn to pieces. Much to my surprise, it wasn't me the damned thing had its attention on. I turned to run and lo and behold, there was another dragon blocking my path, hovering a few feet off of the ground, roaring at the top of its lungs. Apparently they had a couple of things they needed to resolve and I just happened to be trapped in between them. With roars from both, they went at each other and it was in this moment, watching these two giant beasts attack each other in an epic battle that ranged from the earthen floor to the hazy skies above and to the mountain range in the distance that I realized that Skyrim wasn't merely a game. After the two dragons were well away from me, I simply stood there and watched them dance around each other in the sky, their bodies and wings a show of shadowed shapes silhouetted against the hazy sun above.That experience alone was worth not only the price of the game but the price of the console itself.The sheer amount of quests, collectable items and different characters is one thing. Chances are you will not get to see everything the game has to offer because there's just so much to see. The music, the graphics... spectacular. The inventory and leveling up system is a lot better this time around and a lot easier to manage. I played the bejeezus out of Oblivion and as much as I loved that game in particular, this one just takes the cake from it. It makes no sense to me to write you a detailed review. All I can promise you is that this is a game that is absolutely a must play title and will repeatedly show you things that will leave you slack jawed with amazement.  You'll get your money's worth, trust me. Play it however you want, complete missions however you want, join up with whoever you want, rescue anybody you want, etc.I've already sunk dozens of hours into it and I've barely messed around with the main quest. Generally speaking, I've barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer. There's really not much that I can write that could possibly justify the sheer epic quality of Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim in a few paragraphs. Occasionally, you might find a glitch or two around this world but let's be real folks. It's impossible to create a game of this scope and not have a couple of busted stitches in places. For what it's worth, I could count on one hand the number of programming bugs I've encountered.This is quite simply, adventure done right. Game of the Year for 2011?

Rhodes","summary":"A Great Game for on the Go","reviewText":"Truthfully, Yoshi Touch and Go is a game that shows potential, but there are a few things that keep it from being great.  It's a unique game, I'll say that much; and it definitely came out on the right system; however, I can't help but admit that this is just another game to show off the Nintendo DS's power.  There's gameplay, but no story.First and foremost, Yoshi Touch and Go was first designed as a tech demo for the Nintendo DS.  It's now been spanned into a larger game.  For those of you who remember Yoshi's Island, on the SNES (or GBA) this is quite a nostalgic moment for you.Graphically, Touch and Go doesn't really look much better than Yoshi's Island.  Some of it actually looks worse.  It's rather colorful, but the characters don't look as crisp as they did in Yoshi's Island. Ideally enough, for the DS this is lacking in the graphics department.The gameplay is a high point for this game, though.  Never have I seen a DS game that requires you to use the touch screen the way this does.  In fact, all your actions come from the touch screen.  If you can't get across a gap, you'll have to use the stylus to make a bridge cloud.  Sometimes you'll have to make a bridge to bypass enemies.  If you screw up when making a bridge you can just as easily blow into the MIC of your DS and it vanishes.There's more to using the touch screen.  Tapping on Yoshi makes him jump, and sometimes tapping on enemies will make him throw an egg at them.As with Yoshi's Island, you're goal is to protect Baby Mario.  There are challenges to this, and sometimes it makes the gameplay rather frustrating.  You'll have to draw clouds and jump on them to reach him, since most of the gameplay takes place on the touch screen, and sometimes that's easier said than done.  You'll have to draw clouds based on where you THINK Mario is going to be.  Looks can be deceiving, and a lot of the gameplay, I found, came from trying to memorize where he was going to be in the stages.The game is rather short, and since there's no storyline, the only thing you can do is play for the love of getting a high score.  I don't know about you, but those days of getting the high score and gloating to your friends are over.  Where are the secrets?  Sadly, this game is devoid of any.Multiplayer is also availible, but to be truthful, that's not a very large thing in this game.  It's nice to play against friends and make them squeal (and it only takes one game pack to do it), but it just becomes boring after a while, and it isn't nearly as impressive as the one player game.Yoshi Touch and Go is by far one of the better DS titles.  I just wish there was more to it.  More secrets, more levels and most of all, I wish it had some sort of storyline to it.  It's just another game to show what the DS can do, and while that's fine and dandy, DS owners have been waiting for a decent title since it's launch in November!Not a bad game.  If you're looking to see what the DS can really do, pick this up.  Otherwise, you might as well wait a little longer for a more decent title.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2005"}

Since i dont have a 60 or even a level 50 yet so i dont exactly qualify for a total complete package review. However since I am playing one of the two new races offered in the game I can offer atleast a review on the opposite side of the spectrum.First i didnt suffer a single installation or gameplay issues. I bought the game on the midnight it was officially released and I was able to install the game and jump right in on one of the new player vs envoirment servers. I am playing the new blood elf race offered for the horde which brings with it the Paladin class previously only available for the Alliance faction in the game.The blood elf starting areas have almost jaw-dropping graphics associated with. It almost looks like the graphic engine was given an upgrade. The blood elf capital city of Silvermoon is perhaps the best looking city in the entire game even surpassing even the former champion Stormwind(the capital city of the human race) in terms of scope and architecture. The quests are abundant, well-layed out and actually follows a story-line for anyone in intrested in reading the texts of the quests. Otherwise its still the same kill 20 things there or go deliver this to someone. However, even this mundane almost universal mmo questline is again made 'fun' by the casual and the patented fun gameplay associated with this Blizzard World of warcraft mmo. You will never feel bored or get a feeling of grinding(reptition) with these quests.After grinding the first ten levels in the colorful, pretty and scenic starting areas you will be moved into the new lvl 10-20 areas for the blood elf caled Ghostlands. The scenery changes almost to a brooding, dark, errie and sometimes even scary landscape. Feels right in place to showcase devastation the scourge assault bought to the high evles now called the blood elfs within the lore of this game. They are again abundant quests here to take you all the way to lvl 21 or even 22 if you prefer to grind.I have heard the same good stuff about the new Alliance race called Draenei which gives alliance access to the powerful Shaman class previously only avialable to the Horde faction. The Draenei also have orginal new areas as well their own hugely magnificent capital city called Exodar. You can expierience new content all the way to lvl 20 here.From there on the lvl 20-58 gameplay reverts back to the orginal world of warcraft gameplay. To me its all worth it as i always was a fan of the horde faction at the same time my favourite class Paladin was locked out for me. Now with the new race Blood elf i can expierience Paladin without having to change factions. I hope the same will go for people playing the Shaman class for the first time with the alliance faction.Burning crusade brings a host of new pvp content also but mostly for people in lvl 60+ located in the new continent called Outland. They have new world pvp in form of capturable spawn points or areas which gives powerful buffs to the wining faction. The other new world pvp content is the capture and hold of a real time city. One of the fun pvp aspect is being able to do aerial bombarding runs on the city defenses among the regular frontal assualt strategy. Last but not least is a new instanced Battleground called Eye of the Storm that have been introduced. Its combination of capture the flag and capture the hill scenarios.So all in all two-thumbs way up for Blizz. They have come up with a worthy expansion to the world's leading mmo out there. I still predict that World of warcraft along with the expansion Burning Crusade will be the reigning champion in the world of mmo for many more years to come.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"OoAK","summary":"Introduction to an amazing universe","reviewText":"Mass Effect. A title in gaming that I hold with very high regard. At a point when I had somewhat hit a wall in my gaming life, this comes along and just smashes right through. I've been playing video games ever since I could competently hold a controller and games like this are the reason I can give for still enjoying it so much. Just owning a PS3 & Wii at the time, Mass Effect was something I was only able to admire from afar in the beginning. Then when I was able to get a 360, I picked up a few games along with it and this happened to be one of them. I went into the game only knowing the name and very little information other than it being a Sci-Fi Action/RPG. I knew right away this would be something i'd love. Customizing my character, choosing their background story, selecting a \"class\" each with their own advantages and disadvantages, it all just meshed together so well. Then, sitting there watching the opening cinematic and the first time the dialogue wheel pops up. Being able to control where the conversation goes was a big deal and something i've missed in games ever since that don't allow me to do so. Whether you still end up at that \"point B\" or not doesn't matter. Just the fact that I had input in what was said and the conversation is slightly or sometimes drastically different was fantastic.The Story. Not since FFVII have I cared so much about what happened in a video game. The cast of characters in this game are amazing and brought to life by some great voice acting. I think everyone brought something to the table and gave their part to the overall cast just as they were intended. There wasn't any character that I didn't enjoy and for the size of the cast that is a very good thing. The main character of Shepard is a great hero and the character of Saren is a great villain. The story of trying to stop the bad guy from essentially taking over the galaxy may not be entirely refreshing but the way it's carried out and slight variations make it worthwhile.The Gameplay. This is the only aspect of the game that didn't really blow me away. It was of course vastly improved in the next game but if you're going back to playing ME1 after playing 2 or 3 then this can be something that may disappoint. It's a bit hard to explain but the combat here just sort of blends in with whatever else it is you're doing. If you've played the game hopefully you know what i'm trying to say, but it's definitely not the game's high point. It's not terrible at all, just pales in comparison to what they did with ME2. Then there's the Mako debate. Personally, I didn't have too many problems with the Mako other than getting stuck on parts of certain planets because of the vehicle's physics but it didn't ruin the experience. The amount of customization for armor and weapons is great as well. I'd always spend alot of time assessing what type of armor i'd need for each mission along with the right weapon and ammo mods. Another downer can be how most missions outside of the mainline story pretty much all evolve the same way. You land on a planet do some scavenging, find a building to go into, walk through some hallways and ultimately end up in a room with with your objective. This can become a bit tedious and again seems to pale in comparison to what how they did side missions in ME2.Overall, this is an amazing game. Something that brought back the love of the game for me and is the starting point to one of the greatest stories and cast of characters to ever be seen in gaming. If you're looking for a deeper more involving experience in games and are a fan of science fiction this is something you should no doubt enjoy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00D6PTMB4","description":"","reviewerName":"Don Walton Jr.","summary":"Bigger, Better, Faster","reviewText":"I want to love this.  I REALLY want to love this, but I'm having some technical issues that are killing the whole experience for me.  I played the first Rocksmith on the 360, with a '95 Fender Strat.  No issues, great learning tool, etc.  Playing with the same guitar, same TV, same surround sound speakers, but now with the new game on the PS3, I experience a ton of feedback whenever I turn my volume up (to 43 on my system).  It's just barely loud enough to hear, but not louder than the actual strings on my guitar, so it just sounds like I'm really sucking trying to play an unplugged guitar with the radio on in the other room.  No fun at all.  I've googled for help, but haven't found anything.  If I can fix the issue, I'll update my review.  I tried turning my speakers around, or facing them down and I'm already sitting as far back as I can.  I have messed with the guitar volume, and both tone dials.  I even tried raising and lowering my pickups.  No dice.As far as the actual game, I still played it for over an hour.  It's a great tool!  So many tools to nail down different tunings, different backing bands, different effects, timing, chords, structure.  Pretty much EVERYTHING you could ever imagine to want to learn about guitar technique is available here.  And, its all available right away.  There are things to unlock, but nothing that will hold you back or limit your ability to play or learn from the game.I was kinda indifferent about the song list, some great stuff, some duds, lots of stuff I hadn't heard of, etc.  but it's actually very well put together.  The songs are selected to highlight different techniques, and they are fun and challenging within each of those lessons (as far as I can tell from not being able to hear much!)  The minigames are very fun, and well done.  They don't feel like a tacked on afterthought, and they even have online leaderboards!  It's not just running scales or strumming chords either.  You're defending a saloon from bandits, riding the back of a whale, shooting ducks, etc.  Very fun, and a nice break from some of the longer lessons.One complaint is the controls.  There are a jillion menus available at any time, which is great, but can be pretty confusing at first.  RS14 seems to rely more on the SQUARE button, than the typical X button system that most games use, or even the CIRCLE/B button that Japanese games favor.  Took a little getting used to.  Also, when your selection is highlighted, its HUGE and on a different background, different color, etc.  For whatever reason, I wouldn't even notice the highlighted selection and always though I was selecting whatever was listed UNDER that giant highlighting bar.  Maybe that's just me, but I kept doing it and getting confused the first several lessons.  One HUGE plus is that you can invert the strings.  I learned guitar tablature nearly 20 years ago with EADGBE starting on the bottom of the screen.  The game defaults with EADGBE starting at the top of the screen.  I inverted it immediately and it was pretty straightforward.There is a 60 Day School kind of program too.  Play an hour a day for 60 days and... Well, they don't say what happens, but I like that the discipline and structure are there.  It gives an easy goal to keep your eye on, and you need that motivation when learning an instrument.  It doesn't have to be 60 days in a row, by the way.Overall, it's driving me nuts that this didn't work for me!  I'm taking it to a friends home soon to try out there.  Again, if I can conquer this issue, I'll edit my review.  Clearly, its a fantastic game, and I hope this huge technical issue is limited to my experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2013"}

The gameplay, a puzzle based real time strategy hybrid of sorts, is as unique as it is captivating with great controls outside of a small probble. Anyone can pick up Pikmin right away, but with time you realize just how many different ways you could play through it. It's one of those games i often paused and just sat with, considering m next move. You really want to be careful because cute little items, or the tiny trumpet that sounds as they march, quickly trick you into loving the lil [critters]. So much viciously tearing it apart from all sides like a pack of crazed hyena, becomes a strangely proud moment. The nice variety of bad guys has a weakness to dis that, like Luigi's Mansion, Pikmin ends right as it's find all 30 pieces, plus there are tons of reasons for replay. But just as the complexity of the puzzles is reaching that sweet spot, where you see all the possibilities and the true beauty of this game, it's over. A few more areas like the last level could have made this great game much better.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2001"}

{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

I traded in my original purple Game Boy Advance to get the Game Boy Advance SP system in platinum and it's awesome! It folds like a mini laptop, has a slightly bigger screen, improved back light so you can play in dark places and is backward compatible with all Game Boy and Game Boy Color games.The PROS: It's made from Nintendo so the quality is way up there. It's sturdy, can take a beating and with its new design and choice of colors it comes in, it's the definitive Game Boy Advance version to own that will last for years to come.The CONS: There is one small drawback that caused a bit of ire among GBA gamers. The GBA SP is so compact in design, Nintendo had to leave out one small detail: the headphone jack. Up until this release, every version of Game Boy had a headphone jack to plug in headphones while you play your games. In order to plug in your headphones to the GBA SP, you had a buy a headphone jack accessory and snap it into the back of the system. While it wasn't too expensive, it still caused some gamers to complain about this issue. Thankfully, Nintendo didn't repeat the same mistake with future portable systems.The Game Boy Advance SP is Nintendo's second revision to its popular handheld system. Though they did release one more revision with the Game Boy Advance Micro, the GBA SP is still the favorite among the three different versions and would prove to be more valuable in time: with the release of the Nintendo DS (and future revisions), it is backward compatible with Game Boy Advance games only. If you haven't owned any Game Boy or played any Game Boy games, get yourself a GBA SP. You won't regret it. *****HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*****","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2011"}

Now Nintendo has dared to do something different: Peach has to save Mario in this very unique DS 2-D game that somehow manages to be incredibly fun and worthwhile.WHAT? Mario's been captured? Apparently. \"Peach, don't go save him!\" Toadsworth pleads. \"OK,\" Peach says... only to set out for Vibe Island a few minutes later, where Mario and Co. are being held (against their will) by Bowser. So that's how our adventure starts. And then Peach goes around Vibe Island and eventually saves Mario and everybody. Hooray!The game progresses in the very linear fashion that most 2-D platformers do: you beat a level, go to the next one, and repeat. Of course you can backtrack and replay any given level in the game you've already beaten, which is good because there are a few things to collect that you may have missed the first time.These things include Toads (3 in each level); puzzle pieces, and occasionally music tracks. This puts a pretty big number on just how much stuff there is to find in the game and makes it last a lot longer than if you just played through to the last level. You can also buy upgrades (extra health, new abilities, etc.) at the shop with the coins you collect in the level, which also adds a lot to the game.The gameplay is pretty unique and very enjoyable. It plays differently from Mario games, especially in that you can press B to hit an enemy with your umbrella and use emotions to progress in the level and solve puzzles. Tapping one of the hearts on the touch screen activates these emotions. You can be angry (engulfs Peach in flames), sad (makes Peach cry like a fountain), kind of happy (makes Peach recover health), or happier (makes Peach able to fly). These are implemented into the gameplay well and come into play enough to keep you into them but aren't overused to the point where you get tired of them.Wait, what's all this talk about hearts and umbrellas? One of the things I didn't like about the game (as a guy) was just how `cute' it was. I mean I should have seen it coming of course as it is that kind of game, but the sheer fun of it shouldn't keep guys from ignoring it for its looks.The main downside to the game is just how easy it is. Any slightly experienced gamer should have no difficulties getting through the entire game, maybe one or two failed attempts to beat a level or boss but other than that it's easy rolling all the way through. I can almost guarantee you won't get stuck in any given area for more than ten seconds. It's not a particularly short game; it's just really easy.Super Princess Peach's graphics are very nicely done. They are very smooth and the colors are vibrant, and the frame rate is very smooth as well. The style is entirely 2-D, no 3-D character models or anything here, but the visuals are done just about as well as they possibly could have been. The sound is also good with nice music and relevant sound effects (after playing a game like Sonic Chronicles, the word `relevant' actually seems like it could actually apply to sound effects as that game had really strange sounds).Overall, Super Princess Peach is just a really fun game. Sure it's really easy and some guys won't like all the cuteness, but that still doesn't hurt just how enjoyable it is. Add that to all the stuff to collect and some very nice graphics and you have a hugely worthwhile game that will thoroughly entertain you and make you realize that Peach CAN be the star of a game, and a great one at that!Gameplay: 8.5Grahpics: 8.5Sound: 7.5Value: 8FINAL SCORE: 8.1/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2008"}

The graphics are outstanding, but that has come to be expected when a game rests on the sheer brute power of the xbox 360 game console.The two main playable characters are interesting and each has their own play style and abilities. Over time you will end up having a favorite of the two characters. Some might prefer that characters back story, personality or skills and abilities.The levels do tend to get boring and repetitive however. Though the graphics help bring the levels to life, they do still get very boring. With the game being set in the wild west, they all tend to look exactly alike. Dust covered trails, old wooden buildings and lots and lots of brush..and the occasional mine thrown in to add a splash of difference.The weapons are boring as well, but to be fair it&#8217;s the 1800&#8242;s, and you aren&#8217;t going to get anything that screams &#8220;Wow&#8221;. Sorry, no alien lasers. Just hand guns, rifles and TNT&#8230;although the bible does prove to be an interesting &#8220;Weapon&#8221; when using the rev.As far as vehicles go, there&#8217;s horses you can ride, though they are a bit difficult to control, and using a weapon while riding high in the saddle? Next to impossible.The difficulty of the game isn&#8217;t really that hard either, even when on the higher difficulty settings, which means most gamers will just zoom through this title, so if you are looking for a drawn out epic title, you might be disappointed with this.Over all, I would say this title is slightly below average, and could have been improved on so many levels. It has it&#8217;s upsides as well as it&#8217;s downsides, so it depends on what you look for in a game. To me? This just didn&#8217;t make the grade.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2014"}
{"product_name":"B000088KH1","description":"Taking place between the second and third movie in the motion picture trilogy, Enter the Matrix features a mixture of gunplay and martial arts that bends the rules. Insane driving and stunts and the chance to pilot the fastest hovercraft in the fleet proves that this isn't just a game that's set in the Matrix universe; it's an experience that's designed to be a true part of the entire Matrix mythos. Enter the Matrix is the story-behind-the-story and features slo-mo bullet time effects, never-before-seen live-action footage starring the cast of the movies, and plenty more. Also available for the Microsoft Xbox, Nintendo Gamecube, and Windows PC.","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Disappointing","reviewText":"Enter the Matrix had loads and loads of promise considering it was in development by Shiny for over three years and was overseen by the film's directors the Wachowski Brothers.  However, even with all the hype surrounding it and the time put into it, Enter the Matrix is just another licensed game which doesn't live up to it's license.  The game's storyline attempts to fill in some holes seen in the film The Matrix Reloaded, but the game's story doesn't have enough to hold on it's own.  You get to play as Niobe and Ghost; two characters sparingly seen in the film whose missions take place after the animated short \"Final Flight of the Osiris\" (which saw time in theaters as a short before the film Dreamcatcher and can currently be seen on The Animatrix DVD).  There is a plethora of FMV sequences throughout the game, some of the most I've seen sice the days of the Sega CD, but one of the most annoying things for me personally is that right when your about to do something really cool like in the films (such as jumping long distances and in a few battles), the game shifts to an in-game cut scene to illustrate the action.  Now while this may not be such a biggie for some, it sure annoyed me.  Also worth noting is the hoopla surrounding new sequences filmed for the game, and yes there are a few, but they aren't anything special or worth just owning the game for.  The game's action engine is pretty much standard third person action fare; ranging from firing guns to hand to hand combat with cops, security guards, and Agents.  The bullet time feature, which the first Matrix film popularized, is used to a good effect here, but the need to use it isn't often thanks to the game's unbelieveably easy difficulty.  And, last but not least, the game suffers from a number of bugs.  While each console version has it's share of problems, the PS2's has a very unstable frame rate and frequent audio problems, plus there is some weak animation here and there, and in the end Enter the Matrix just feels rushed and unfinished.  However, Enter the Matrix does have it's good points.  The controls are dead on and easy to learn, and the game's designers clearly knew their source material.  No matter what problems the game has though, it's sure to be a big hit namely because of it's license.  In the end though, just like a lot of other games of late like Blade 2, Reign of Fire, and X2: Wolverine's Revenge, Enter the Matrix is just another licensed game that doesn't live up to it's source material.  All in all, the game is definitely worth checking out if your a fan of The Matrix or action games in general, but I'd never lay down that much of an amount of my hard earned dollars for it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2003"}

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.PlayStation Network support including PlayStation Trophies.","reviewerName":"hammodi","summary":"Good game.","reviewText":"This game is awesome.

{"product_name":"B000GE7O9K","description":"Oblivion is the most richly detailed and vibrant game-world ever created. This new chapter uses next-generation technologies to create a fully immersive gaming adventure.","reviewerName":"eternal now \"roejoerrer\"","summary":"Expansive world...simplified and User Friendly...","reviewText":"One of the most common complaints about The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind that I encountered, was that there was so much to do that once could literally get lost within the myriads of exploration, quests and other random experiences that Morrowind has to offer. A player could literally have up to 12 quests at one time to complete, and for the non-hardcore RPG fan, this could get VERY daunting.One can argue that games like Morrowind are made strictly for the hardcore RPG'r in mind and that casual and non RPG fans should not even be dabbling in Morrowind's greatness. The level of freedom inherent in Morrowind is unmatched.And Morrowind is a great game, a very great game! Its vastness is unlimited and there is so much to do and so much to explore that upon first contact, a players mind can literally breakdown at all the possibilities.Never before has a game provided so much to a player. There a at least 16 different guilds to join, countless class structures and character types to choose from, endless objects to buy, sell and steal, and many NPC's to slay, and a super expansive world with oceans, mountains, forests, cities, ruins, dungeons and much more to explore, Morrowind is probably one of the best RPG games on the planet.Oblivion, the followup to Morrowind, is a very huge, open world in the same respect, however it is smaller. Many of the class types have been removed, weapons have been taken out, spells missing and some skills have been taken out. The traditional role playing configure that governs battle has been simplified, and generally much of the games core features have been changed in Oblivion.Why?The term user-friendly usually means making something so simple that an idiot could use it. AN example would be Microsoft WIndows.Oblivion is the more user-friendly experience than Morrowind is. Morrowind bombards the player with limitless paths to choose from, Oblivion offers only a few handfuls.Everything from the level up system, to customization has been simpified.Oblivion is basically an action/adventure game with an RPG mask. Sure, there are many RPG elements involved, yet the game screams action/adventure.For instance, combat has drastically changed. In Morrowind, hitting an enemy with a sword or arrow was largly dependant on die rolls and skill level, which lead to players frantically hacking and slashing at an enemy only to actually \"hit\" them occasionally (of course this changes as one advances levels). In Oblivion, the combat is not based on die rolls and skill level, but rather based on whether your sword or arrow \"actually\" hits the enemy.This, in my opinion changes the game from a traditional RPG to a more action orientated game.Levitating and transportation spells have been removed. I have been told that this was done to avoid glitches in the game that could occur due to how the towns and locations are set up. The major transportations systems have been removed in favor of instant travel and horses.However, even with all these changes, Oblivion is still one of the best games ever created. The level of customization, exploration and freedom given to the player is still much more than any other game offers, even more than the famed Grand Theft Auto Series.Not to mention the graphics are absolutely amazing. Trees actually look like trees, there is plant life, animal life (outside those that attack you), the sky moves above you, day turns to night, the ocean looks beautiful. Mountains that you can see in the distance can also be traversed. Character models have been greatly enhanced, with facial expressions and all! Graphically, Oblivion is up there with Gears of War.The sound is also amazing, characters speak with spoken dialogue, not just written text, and the ambient and atmospheric sounds all do well to keep your head in the game and immerse the player in the world of Oblivion.AI has been greatly improved, to the point where NPC's(Non playable characters) are all living out their lives and not just walking around randomly or standing in one spot for the whole game.You may be walking through a lovely grassy area only to catch yourself in the middle of two people fighting to the death (this is something Morrowind NEVER had, aside from scripted events).Shopkeepers have their own agenda and schedule, and will close their shops during the night (of which you can break in and rob them blind, and the shopkeeper will even talk about how he/she got robbed the next day!).NPC's talk to other NPC's and engage in conversations, all of which you can eavesdrop in on.The talking system has been enhanced as well. When you talk to an NPC it is much more simplified than in Morrowind. A mini game is presented when you select the pursuasion option. Basically, talking to NPC's is much more engaging, whereas in Morrowind it got tedious and boring.The world is lively and breathing and it is very easy to get caught up in this immersive world.There is much trash talking about how short this game is and how \"dead\" the world feels compared to Morrowind, however I beg to differ!Oblivion is much more alive, and who really cares if the game developers shaved off 200 hours off of the gameplay? There is still over 200 hours of gameplay in Oblivion to play with, who really needs 400 hours of gameplay? With 200 hours of gamplay, any reasonable gamer will have plenty to do. If you can beat this game in a week, you need to get a life.With much more action orientated gameplay and stunning graphics and AI, Oblivion does not disappoint and will provide you with hours of excellent gameplay that will seriously suck your life away. This game is just about as addicting as Gears of War is, which is VERY addicting!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2007"}

This amazing fighting game is a stunner in more ways than one. The dramatic victory of Ryu (not to be confused with the one from SF,though there have been a lot of crossover titles these days so I don't know...)in the last DOA tourney was not enough to avoid the end of the century Tengo disaster, causing mass destruction and global dispair. The story that unfolds in DOA3 doesn't make the convouled plot any clearer(but then again fighting game aren't known for engaing weaving tales are they? Fortunatly, DOA3 delivers everything else you could have hoped for in  a next-gen brawler. Anyone who plays this knows that graphics are where DOA3 shines, but I've seen seen screen shots and they can't convey the feeling of all the extra detail and amazing animation of the flowing clothes on the characters. The environments are also a stunning exercise in visual excess, with every object intricately drawn, not to mention the sheer size of some areas. The DOA3 fighting engine has finally found a distinct set of rules to round out previous game balance issues. Common counters are skightly hareder to time and do less damage while the brand-new advanced reversals not only separate the skilled from the button mashers, but also inflict extra damage. The numerous refinements manage to remain accessible to beginners, give experts the depth they crave, and achieve good overall gameplay balance.The games audio is the only thing that fails to hold its own. Having Aerosmith provide some tracks is cool, but it gets a little annoying after a while (and I'm a diehard fan)! The rest of the background music is well done, but it won't strike demand for a soundtrack. The sound effects are good, but they're not as good as one would expect from a sound workhorse like the Xbox.

Since I have many other games, I can never get around to purchasing one, so I was glad to get it.  From the very begining, the music is great.  I jumped right into practice mode and began to go ballistic. You can learn a lot of the moves from this mode, along with others like freestyle. You can spend hours on just practicing, before you hit the hard wood.  I subsequently stepped right into a game and the graphics are fantastic. It feels very close to watching an actual game, especially with all the camera angles.  The crowd in the arenas and the commentary really set the stage. The way the players move, along with the dribbling and dunks are well done.  They used physics to make it feel realistic, as far as momentum and using it against your apponent.  I can't say enough about the moves you can put together, like spinning, euro steps, jump backs, alley oops, bounce passes, just to name a few. There are many other things to mention, but do not want to get long winded.I have a lot of fun playing the association mode and have played about 10 games on pro level.

Marshall","summary":"Eternal Sonata","reviewText":"There are few things to note about this game. One it is very unique. The combat system is very different from most other games I have ever played. If you are a fan of the Tales series though you will probably pick it up very quickly even though it is a bit different from those games. This game is not as fun for co-op as the Tales series. Since the combat is based on turns players must wait their turn to take action. Fortunately the turns are pretty short so you don't have to wait very long, but it doesn't have that constant action constant fun for all players at once feel that the Tales games have.The story is quite interesting and very informative about Chopin's life. It's kind of a weird thing to base a game on, but it is quite fascinating and leaves you wanting to know more as you go. This is a pretty good game and I imagine anyone who enjoys anime-style games will enjoy this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

As many others have experienced, the plastic that rubs off gathers around the base and prevents the sticks from easy movement. They will get stuck and be hard to move. Other than that, the buttons work perfectly fine.

{"product_name":"B0049DYNNO","description":"","reviewerName":"ITBeast \"ITBeast\"","summary":"Super Mario Brothers All Stars, A Journey back in time.","reviewText":"As I am sure most people who are reading this and for those who do not know this is a compilation of the first 4 Super Mario Bros. Games from the original 8 bit NES Catalog (Yes, I said 4 not 3, I'll explain later in the review) that was re-released as a compilation on the 16 bit SNES back in 1993 (Also look up the Wikipedia entry \"Super Mario All All Stars\" for more details].  In addition to originally porting the original 4 Games on to a SNES Game Cartridge they also face lifted the 8 bit graphics and music/sound quality to the 16 bit era of hardware which gave the games a new look, feel, and sound without taking away from the original game play roots. There is also the option of now saving your game progress that was not available for either the NES or SNES back in either of its incarnations. The original 4 games are as follows...Super Mario Brothers - The Classic NES pack in that helped Nintendo make the NES and its company the dominating Video Game Console of its generation. The game is still very popular to this day with both 3rd Generation and Today's Gamers. This was originally released on the Family Computer Disk System in Japan and the US as the NES Pack In Game In 1985.Super Mario Brothers: The Lost Levels - This was originally supposed to have been the direct sequel to Super Mario Brothers and the official Super Mario Brothers 2 However; this was only released in Japan since the CEO of Nintendo of America felt that the gaming population of the United States would not like it due to it being to difficult and being too close to the original Super Mario Brothers. This sequel has the play and feel of the first game which both my son and I prefer this original treatment over the travesty of what Nintendo did release instead as its direct sequel in the United States. This was originally released on the Family Computer Disk System only in Japan in 1986.Super Mario Brothers 2: Mario Madness - As mentioned previously this is Nintendo of America's answer as a sequel for the original Super Mario Brothers. All this is a redesign of another of Nintendo's games that was originally released in Japan called Yume Kj: Doki Doki Panic \"Dream Factory: Heart-Pounding Panic\" that replaced that games characters with Mario, Luigi, Peach, etc. The Game had mixed responses from loving it for its new direction it had taken to despising it for not having the connection to the original Super Mario Brothers Game (As both my son and I responded to it). This was originally released on the NES only in the US in 1988.Super Mario Brothers 3 - The fourth and last of the Super Mario Brothers  Games for the NES, this game restored allot of its game play connections to the original Super Mario Brothers with adding new game play and elements. With that said those who shunned its Original American sequel (See above) this game restored the faith in the franchise of those who had been disillusioned by the above mentioned American sequel. This was the NES's most popular game for that system right behind the original Super Mario Brothers. This was originally released on the Family Computer Disk System in Japan in 1988 and for the NES in the US in 1990.The Wii's Limited Edition 25th Anniversary of the Super Mario Brothers All Stars also includes a 32 page booklet of the Original Games concepts and designs along with a Music CD of the games Music.WARNING! Do not expect this to have an upgraded face lift from what Nintendo did with the original re-issue of the SNES version to Wii technology level like in the new Super Mario Brothers Wii. It comes as it was when originally released on the SNES in 1993, with the improved 16 bit graphics and sounds of the original 8 bit games.For those who want the original 8 bit versions of the games and not the improved 16 bit improved version the original games the 8 bits versions are available for download with Nintendo's Wii ware directly to your Wii Console's system memory or SD Card However be warned! You cannot transfer the games to another Wii system and are tied only to the Wii it was downloaded (Even if you downloaded it to a SD Card).Overall, both I and my son love this re-issue of the Super Mario Brothers All Stars for the Wii. I would highly recommend it for anyone who want to enjoy a time when things were simpler and easier to passing the experience your children, this was well worth the 30 dollars we paid for it (About $7.50 a game).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2011"}

Almost no challenge until the end","reviewText":"The Good: Great graphics and 3D effects, solid platforming and gameplay, variety of levelsThe Bad: Same tired NSMB/Galaxy formula, only three different abilities, 70% of the game is too easy, the last 30% is way too hard, bosses lack variety, 3D effects don't enhance gameplay, star coins offer no reward, no extra modesHere we are again. Another Mario game to prove how good a new Nintendo system is. Super Mario 3D Land is another addition to the New Super Mario Bros./Galaxy formula that pushed Mario into a new generation. Honestly, I'm tired of it, but it still proves to be solid and entertaining.The game has 8 worlds to play through and each stage is completely different, so at least there's variety. Each world feels like a mini one from Super Mario Galaxy mixed with a New Super Mario Bros. level. The whole point is to just get to the end, but there are 3 star coins in each level. Here's the problem with collecting all those: There's absolutely no reward for doing so, it's just to scratch the completionist OCD itch. Mario has his usual NSMB abilities like the fire flower, Tanooki suit, Boomerange suit, and the white Tanooki suit. Honestly, the game lacked any new abilities which is a shame. I found that the Tanooki suit was vital to winning some levels and to even get to some star coins.At the end of each world you fight Bowser, but there's not variety to it. You work your way up to him then you just avoid his attacks until you get to the button that knocks him into lava. Every so often you will fight Bowser Jr. or the Koopa Twins, but they are all very easy. Speaking of easy, the first 6 worlds are a breeze with nearly zero challenge. The enemies are easy to avoid, and if you die more than 5 times you get the White Tanooki suit which makes you invincible through the whole level, they basically just let you cheat your way through. I really hated this, but at the last world I found that I needed it because the game went from super easy to extremely difficult in no time flat. It took over an hour to beat the final Bowser level.The 3D effects are pretty nice and work well here. There are a few instances in levels where 3D will benefit you to see the level layout better, but just like most 3DS games, it's just for flash, and not gameplay. I did find the graphics to look crisp and very pretty for a  3DS game, but they still look like Super Mario Galaxy and haven't changed one bit, I'm bored of it. There are no extra modes, and once you beat the game it's hard to have a reason to come back. The story in Mario games is pretty simple so I won't even go there.The severe lack of challenge throught 70% of the game just really brings the experience down. Enemies are a breeze to avoid and there's just nothing new to the overall Mario formula to make it groundbreaking like Mario used to be. Nintendo has been riding this formula for so long that it's a wonder people keep buying it. I thought this would be kind of like Mario 64 in a sense that it revolutionized the genre and console, this game had that potential. While the game is just plain fun, I wanted a challenge. I wanted something new like more abilities, a new art style, new enemies, and just a larger challenge. When you hit world 7 you will be in for a world of hurt because the game is just so damn hard. It's the way the level are laid out, enemies are placed in tricky spots, but it's not the fair type of hard.Overall, Super Mario 3D Land is a fun game, but not the genre changer like everyone thought. It sticks with the same tired NSMB/Galaxy formula that everyone is getting tired of. There's not challenge 70% through the game and the bosses lack any variety. There's no extra modes and the star coins offer no reward. What we have is just a fun Mario game with great graphics and 3D effects, that's all.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2013"}

I have never seen such graphics that stand out like this!

I appreciate sound but I admit, in terms of technological prowess, I've always kind of brushed audio off. If the sound works and the quality is moderate, I can live with that. I was recently playing Dead Space 3 with a friend and he kept commenting on things he was hearing that I wasn't. He was using a pair of Turtle Beach XP400s. For those unfamiliar with the Dead Space series, the sound is what really cranks up the horror. These are some of the most impressive games in terms of sound design that I've had the pleasure to play. Just because I don't hold audio in the highest of technological regards doesn't mean that I don't appreciate it when it's done well. Either way, this really made me re-think my position on expensive audio equipment. For the first time, I really felt like I was missing out on the experience because my headset wasn't up to par.Fortunately these Turtle Beach XP Sevens came across the Vine and I jumped on ordering them. The overall presentation is very nice, the box even looks expensive. Inside the pair of headphones are white and black, for some reason they look a little grey or silver in the product picture. They have nice white stitching on the underside of the head cushion. Overall they just look like a three hundred dollar headset should look. They're heavy duty. Metal stems join the headband to the earcups. The removable mic fits snugly in place. The arm of the mic is jointed to resist shorts. The wiring is coated in cloth. The attention to detail is great and there really isn't anything about the presentation or build that I would say looks cheap.Also included is every cord you could possibly require to hook the headset up to whatever you need to hook it up to. Cord extenders are also included. The processing module is a small square box with several inputs. The setting control module is essentially a large black remote. Also included are quick start instructions that work as their name would suggest. You can have your PS3, 360 or PC set up in minutes (probably less time than it took you to unpack everything). Instructions include easy-to-follow diagrams and screenshots from each console/PC.The settings control unit is a little intimidating at first. They don't include a lot of supporting documentation and there are a lot of dials and buttons. Checking the official site was helpful as well as just  experimenting with it. Essentially you can control the volume of the individual channels, control the master volume and control the (virtual) angles of the front and rear channel speakers. For those that complain that the sound is too quiet, you may want to cycle through the channels and max out the volume on them all. For the angles of the speakers, it's best to load a game where you can stand in a single place with sound coming from a specific direction. I chose Skyrim. I stood in the middle of Windhelm with the flowing river to my back. I selected the rear channel, closed my eyes and turned the selector dial, cycling through the settings, until it sounded like the river was directly behind me. I turned to face the river and repeated the process. It took less than a minute and it sounds amazing. The numbers on the controller are for saving presets (apparently you can download specific pre-sets for certain games, which I think is pretty amazing.) The side dials control the volume of your phone/music player (yes you can overlay your game with music or phone conversation), the volume of your mic and the volume of your personal sound monitor (how loud you can hear yourself through the headset when you talk). It's a full feature set that allows you a great amount of control over your audio experience. It's all very easy to use and works well. If you spend a little time setting it up just right in the beginning, you'll only really have to worry about adjusting the master volume later on.I tested the XP Sevens with Dead Space 3 (PS3), Gears of War Liberation (360) and Skyrim (360). All total about 10 hours of gaming was had over a single day. In each game I was able to hear things I was previously unable to pick up on. I was able to identify objectives, enemies and landmarks based on the perceived direction of sound. When an out of view adversary was within an earshot I could identify their location based on the noises they made. It really added an additional facet of gaming that I previously hadn't had and enriched my gaming experience as a whole. I found that the soundtrack, as well as the ambient sound effects, while traversing Skyrim was much more beautiful and immersive than I had previously known it to be. The bass punches of heavy artillery, married with the sticato of machine gun fire was much more epic in Gears of war. Dead Space was much MUCH more creepy. This is total game immersion. The quality of the sound coupled with the noise cancelling properties of the headset mean that you are really in the game (at least in terms of audio). Sound going out to my teammates was clear as was sound coming in.The XP Sevens can also be used as standard headphones for your phone or mp3 player. There's a standard mini-jack male connector that you plug in and you would just remove the mic from the unit. The sound, even without the processing box and setting control unit, is phenomenal.Some have criticized that the XP Sevens don't get loud enough. Well, I will say they certainly do not attain the volume levels of other headsets I have used. Does it get loud? Yes. Could get loud enough to cause irreparable damage to my eardrums? Probably not. I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing though.  I played consistently at 75 - 85% all day and that was comfortable. I could hear everything VERY well  and VERY clear. What they lack in overall decibels, they make up for in clarity. I've always thought that the hallmark of quality speakers was that as you increased the volume, they don't necessarily get significantly louder, their sound just becomes clearer. That analogy is how I would describe the sound of the XP Sevens.Another common criticism seems to be comfort. I have a fairly large head and, while room is not abundant, I didn't feel like the headband was exerting an uncomfortable amount of pressure on my temples. The cushions on the cups are ample and I don't feel like they ever became uncomfortable during the ten hour play session. As others have stated, they made my ears warm. However, it's an over the ear headset. It's essentially earmuffs with speakers. Show me a headset that doesn't make your ears warm and I'll show you a liar. My ears were never HOT, just warm. Overall, I wore these for an extensive period of time and I would never call them uncomfortable. I've had $25 dollar headsets before, THAT'S uncomfortable.Lastly, the fact that these are wired and not wireless is some cause for concern. I was a bit puzzled at a headset, just under three hundred dollars, being wired. From what I can tell, you just get a higher quality sound through wires than wireless. I may be wrong, again, not an audio expert, but that seems to be the case. Are the wires annoying? Of course they are, they're wires in a largely wireless world. However, if that's what it takes to produce sound of this caliber, I think I can manage. Also, not having to charge them is nice. As I stated, every wire you could need is included and the length is ample enough where you shouldn't have a problem making it to the couch or chair with length to spare. Honestly, after using them, the wires aren't as big of an issue as I anticipated.Overall, I am extremely happy with the XP Sevens. I foresee a lot of use out of these in the future. If you're looking at a three hundred dollar headset, it's because you have the income to afford it, you game enough to justify it or both so I'm not going to go into speculation of the price. It's a high price, but this is a top tier headset from a top tier company. I can, however, attest to the fact that with the XP Sevens, you're getting your money's worth.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2013"}
{"product_name":"B002ZJPYHS","description":"","reviewerName":"Schwe1nehund","summary":"Single player campaign is very middle of the road","reviewText":"Medal of Honor is a game that merits two separate reviews. For $59.99 you are essentially purchasing 2 games for what is the new de-facto price-point for military shooters (even for the mighty PC). Admittedly, I have spent just over an hour in what appears to be a very solid multiplayer component, so this review is essentially based on the single-player campaign.VISUALS: The Unreal 3.0 engine reliably delivers the graphical pizzas you would expect. Barring the rather weak looking night-time missions, the daytime missions are at times, simply breathtaking. I honestly don't think I've seen daylight emulated with such perfection. Having said that, lighting alone does not make up the visual department and some parts feel very unpolished. Texture pop-ins are regular if you switch your weapons after a minute or two (I am certain its not my hex-core, dual-GPU gaming rig). A couple of times I witnessed vehicles exploding without any flames - to great comical effect as there is a very audible boom and bodies ragdolling across the ground. Also, every soldier looks like a clone of the other. So they put a beard here, a stubble there and varied the eye colors, but in general the eye spacing, length/shape of the nose and mouths are all EXACTLY the same from one character to the next. (the notable exception is the bearded squadmate you see on the cover - who by the way begs the question as to whether spec-ops personnel really wear Oakleys during night-time incursions). Also, for a game striving for realism, its baffling to see all front-line troops portrayed as white. A single African-American colonel you only see in cutscenes doesn't really count. Even a certain hispanic comrade-in-arms appears to be hispanic only in name.SOUND: Probably one of the high points of the game. The various armaments you lug around sound very authentic and have the appropriate meatiness. Explosions are nicely done, battle-chatter is distinguishable but not intrusive. A neat little effect comes to play when your NPC squadmates or 'brothers' communicate with you; if you are several yards away from them, their voices are only audible through your in-game headphones, but when you are in close proximity, you actually get a mix of both their headphone and 'in-person' voice. All the other games I've played tend to take out the headphone effect if the person talking to you is right in front of you. Its subtle, but it helps with the immersion. Its also clear that a lot of the lingo is taken directly from the much-touted Tier 1 Operators who consulted with the developers - and it shows. Because of the writing, the voice acting feels even better. Rarely do you hear dramatic expositions as you did from Captain Price or General Shepard in Modern Warfare 2. The conversation is mostly terse, to the point, and sounds convincingly tense when your squad is under pressure or facing overwhelming odds.GAMEPLAY: Sadly, while the game does a very good job in certain technical areas, the single-player gameplay has some issues. My biggest gripe is the length. On normal, any long-time FPS fan should be able to plough through this in 4 hours, as I did. For a 60 dollar game, multiplayer or no, this is a farce. The guns look and sound great, but they don't have the fluidity found in Call of Duty. I like the fact that grenades are relatively scarce and that you're not dodging them every 5 seconds like you would in the Other Game. I don't like the fact that you can simply re-stock your ammo reserve by turning to the squadmate huddled next to you; although admittedly, I'm not sure if this feature holds true on the hard difficulty setting. Maneuvering is also... rather unpolished. I was generally very uncomfortable with the movement of my character as far as crouching and running went. There are some cool sniping missions here and there but it feels underutilized and extremely on-the-rails. In fact the whole game is designed that way. I would like to see someone develop a military shooter with the semi-non-linearity of Crysis. If I am to feel like a Tier 1 Operator on the field I want to be able to determine the path of best approach on the fly and not play through what is a predetermined route. With EA already publishing the Crysis games, I can't imagine it being too much of a problem to have Danger Close Games work on something with CryEngine 3.0.I realize a lot of the comments I make compare this game with Call of Duty. The fact is, if you have one publishing giant (EA) trying to cash in on a very specific FPS genre that has done so well for another publishing giant (Activision), these comparisons are inevitable. I am personally done with Call of Duty and Bobby Kotick's greed. I really wanted to like Medal of Honor and embrace it as a blockbuster. I was certainly sold by the trailers and marketing campaign. Sadly, talk is cheap and marketing in the end is all talk. Despite the input of real-world operatives, the single-player experience for Medal of Honor is very lackluster and really nothing special.At the beginning of the review I stated that although I had spent just over an hour on the multiplayer component it was an hour very well spent. The game visually looks better and the controls are more refined than the single player component and honestly my first impression is to give that portion a 4.5/5. Dice may single-handedly still save what could very well become an unmitigated disaster for EA. I am certain that over the next month or so I will be a regular on the servers, getting the bad taste of Danger Close Games's botched delivery of the single player campaign, out of my mouth.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2010"}

Ostrowski \"bra1n1ac\"","summary":"Chrono Trigger, Prince of all games","reviewText":"Chrono Trigger is a game I missed out on when it was first on the SNES, but I later purchased it as part of Final Fantasy Chronicles for the Playstation, and I can say with certainty that this game is better than the best in every way.  Going through the games one by one, the original final fantasy wasn't all that special, the second and third ones basically rode the same path.  Chrono Trigger has more and better plot twists and turns than Final Fantasy 4, more travel than Final Fantasy 5, and better technology than Final Fantasy 6.  Magus' back story is more believable even than that of Sephiroth, from Final Fantasy 7, Lavos is much scarier than any of the villains from Final Fantasy 8, and the game has more humor than Final Fantasy 9, but carries it off even better than Final Fantasy X, without annoying and unneccesary mini-games.  It has about 11 endings, and they're all better than the ending from Secret of Mana, a game that Chrono Trigger beats even in regards to the fight sequences.  Chrono Trigger has better music than even Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, more creative enemies than Earthbound, and more interesting characters than ANY RPG.  Characters, who by the way, can do things that even the gang from Dragon Ball Z would not be able to match (like visiting the future, then going back in time and actually changing it.)Lastly, the Legend of Zelda's Link has not been as likable a person as Chrono ever since he moved off the super nintendo and became a stiff.  Before that, he was a pretty fun-loving guy.  Anyways, even Zelda: a Link to the past couldn't match this game, because although Link was as likable as Chrono, the other characters of Chrono-trigger are all equally likable, especially Lucca and Magus.So that about covers it.  Those were all the best RPGs of all time, and I have gone through them, one by one, picked out the most outstanding trait of each one, and combined them against Chrono Trigger.  Doesn't matter.  This game still whips them all.

This is a showcase for the great achievements gaming has made.Other time-involve games either jumped years forward or back in time, or used cheezy VCR symbols to handle your time changes. In Sands of Time, it's extremely easy to use and VERY handy. You fall off a ledge? Just slide back in time a bit and try again!The graphics are just amazing. The character moves fluidly, and the combat sequences look like a well animated movie. The character can run along walls, do back flips, climb poles, leap chasms, and much more. When he runs along a wall and passes a banner, the banner ripples in the wind. The attention to detail - from shadows to textures to torches flickering and water rippling - is just amazing.Part of the game is slaying your enemies in new and interesting ways. But part is negotiating the terrain and figuring out how to get to the next area. Some of the puzzles are straightforward - run along the wall, jump up the ledges. But others are far more devious and require a lot of thought to get through.There are many great releases out right now that we are enjoying greatly, but Sands of Time is the one that always draws the most fascinated reactions from friends. They comment constantly on the graphics, animation and gameplay while we move from scene to scene. It's like poetry in motion.

{"product_name":"B003Z0LFF6","description":"body {font-family:arial, helvetica, san-serif;}EXPERIENCE EVERY DIMENSION OF SPIDER-MAN","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"They pulled it off.... OK almost","reviewText":"********REVIEW OF THE ART BOOK*************WORTH OWNING FOR SPIDERMAN FANS: Honestly I have loved how they have designed different spidermen and different dimensions. Having an artbook that has arts depicting all the spidies and villians truly adds value to this overall bundle. Now if you are not a fan of the spiderman to begin with, this may not mean much to you, but if you are into spiderman you will like it a lot. The dimensions of the art book are the same as that of game case.********REVIEW OF THE ACTUAL GAME************I am a big fan of Spiderman and seeing how this game looked, I had to give it a shot. I mean comic book like artstyle, 4 different versions of Spiderman and worlds and variety of villains, got to check it out. After spending 16+ hrs on this game (finished on normal mode and unlocked almost everything), here is what I thought.******************PROS******************AMAZING ARTWORK OF 4 DIFFERENT SPIDERMEN AND 4 DIFFERENT UNIVERSES: This is the first and foremost thing you will notice if you are a Spiderman fan such as myself. They have done really good job animating 4 different versions of Spiderman (Spectacular Spiderman, Noir Spiderman, 2099 Spiderman and Ultimate Spiderman), 4 different worlds and most importantly villains in 4 different worlds. As you progress further and further into the game, you will get to experience more and more of this variety and chances are you will like what you see.13+ VILLAINS OF SPIDERMAN UNIVERSE: To me, after artwork, this was the strongest aspect of the game. There are 14 different levels. First is just tutorial. Then the next 12 levels you have 12 different bosses with different powers. So each Spiderman gets 3 different bosses each and then all 4 of them get to defeat one final boss in level 13. The best part is each one of these bosses is very artistically animated and for most part there is some level of creativity and variety involved in boss battles. Loved it just loved it. If you are a Spiderman fan you should buy this game just for this.VARIETY OF SPIDER POWERS AND MOVES: While all 4 spidies have shared set of abilities and fighting moves (web swinging, sticking to wall, punches and kicking in combination with web etc.), each one has distinct powers, style and looks. Amazing spidy will do a lot of web based attacks, Noir has more stealth based attacks, 2099 can slow down time while ultimate spidycan use unique rage ability of venom based suit. Noir stealth mode was especially quite impressive. Reminded me of Batman Arkam Asylum.VARIETY IN GAMEPLAY ELEMENTS: While a lot of gameplay in 4 worlds share common redundancy in terms of beating thugs and then beating bigger thugs and saving some civilians before you face off with bosses, they all have some very different gameplay aspects. For example, in Noir world you will heavily have to rely on stealth and in 2099 you will be doing cool things like chasing bosses while gliding through futuristic cities. Happy they didn't make things too redundant.INTERESTING FIRST PERSON HAND TO HAND COMBAT MODE: Each boss you face, there will face them in first person view mode where you get to give them a piece of your mind by punching, jabbing and uppercutting them. If a boss has given you hard time or annoyed you this is the time to let it all out. Furthermore, they also have some cutscenes where you dodge through enemy attacks in first person mode. I personally enjoyed it.PLATHORA OF UPGRADES, COSTUMES AND UNLOCKABLE: Spiderman fans will love it. Every time you beat enemies you get experience points through which you can buy more moves, upgrade your abilities or buy costumes. This adds a lot to replay value to the game. Even after finishing it once (12+ hrs). This can get you to play it again and again. Some of the costumes you can unlock are pretty unique while others are just plain funny.VIDEO, FIGURINE AND ART GALLERY: If you are like me, someone who doesn't like to play through the game 10 times just to enjoy some in game cutscene, this is the game for you. Completing the game will unlock different movie, art and figurine galleries. Big plus.DECENT VARIETY IN ENEMIES: Now this game doesn't have as much variety in enemies as God of War or Castlevania games, but I am happy to tell you enemies in different levels are still somewhat different. My biggest fear in Spiderman game is having the same enemies over and over again. While in this game in all levels you will be fighting goons and bigger goons, they have have different looks from level to level. Not only that you will also need to change your fighting strategy to overcome enemies in different levels. Salute to the creators.*******************CONS********************REDUNDANCY: I didn't mind it as much, but if you are someone who doesn't like redundancy in games, then you will mind this. As stated before, one type of redundancy you face is beating goons and then beating bigger goons in all levels. But the one that can really get on your nerves at time is saving civilians. Fortunately, for most part, it is not as bad as these civilians won't die easily if at all. And also we have to remember that this is a superhero game so I guess they had to push it in. Just wish didn't have to save civilians so often.*******************CONCLUSION****************So the game is not perfect, but if you are a Spiderman fan like me, you will surely enjoy it. I truly enjoyed playing as 4 different Spidermen with different powers in 4 different world. Unlockables truly kept me coming back for more. I would give it 9/10 and highly recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMAQ","reviewerName":"JoeAZ92","summary":"Banjo-Kazooie didn't revolutionize the platformer, but it reminds us of why we like the genre so much in the first place","reviewText":"Positive:+ gameplay is very deep with new elements added all the time+ worlds are very diverse and have a lot of content+ music tracks are great and change in style when you're in different spots+ sharp controls that work well for the most partNegative:- you have to start your note count every time you re-enter a world- camera doesn't always give you the best view you needSuper Mario 64 revolutionized the 3-D platformer; and the amount of people who would deny that are probably fewer than the words in this sentence. But when a revolution comes, what's the point of it being so revolutionary unless something comes of it later on? In video games, a game is a revolution indeed when other games take the basic model and take it to a whole new level, and possibly delivering a game that's even better than the root. Whether it really is a beneficiary of the beloved Mario 64 or Rare is just really, really good at making games, that is where we find Banjo-Kazooie.Games of the platforming genre aren't exactly known for their amazing stories, and Banjo fares no different. Banjo's little sister Tooty is kidnapped by the stereotypical green witch Gruntilda. She has some sort of weird machine that will supposedly transfer Tooty's beauty to herself, and this will leave Banjo's poor sister ugly in the process! So Banjo and his grumpy bird friend Kazooie (who for some reason lives in Banjo's backpack) set out to Gruntilda's lair to save Tooty. The story doesn't take itself very seriously at all but there's a great, humorous tone to it that more than makes up for the lack of depth.The game doesn't move from place to place at all; the whole thing takes place in Gruntilda's huge lair, key word being 'huge.' This one location is just so big but perfectly balanced with the ease of traversing that it makes the perfect setting for a platforming game. There is a whole lot of variety within the mountain lair, with a sewer, swamp, graveyard, and many other spots. The areas of different theme will almost always take you to one of the game's nine worlds, which are all big, diverse, and have a lot of stuff to find. You'll find yourself at a mountain to begin the game, then moving on to a beach, and later a snow area and haunted mansion-like world, and so on. The game never really runs out of new material to throw at you, which is really nice, even if most of the themes are found in many other games of the genre, too.Another way Banjo always keeps itself fresh is with the moves you can learn. In most of the levels you can find a mole named Bottles who will teach you a new move if you can find him. These moves are sometimes confined to certain spots or items you can put on, and they all work together perfectly to make the game progress logically. You have to unlock some of these abilities, such as flight and invincibility, to get deeper into Gruntilda's lair, and also to accomplish more in the worlds. The game controls very well too, even with all the added moves, and it doesn't get too complicated. One issue though is with the camera, which you can control the angle of but you still sometimes can't get the viewpoint that's just right for a room or area.But the core of the game stays the same, no matter how many moves you learn or different worlds you visit. The main objects to collect are jiggies, which are basically pieces of jigsaw puzzles that, when put together, open the door to a new world. Ten of these can be found in each level along with 100 notes, which open up doors to new areas of the lair. Unfortunately the game's note total is merely a combined high score of how many notes you collect in each level; each time you re-enter a world the note count restarts. This is pretty annoying sometimes, and it would have been nice to just keep all the notes so you don't have to recollect all of them again to advance your total note count. Thankfully the jiggies are extremely well-balanced as far as how hard they are to get; in the first world most of them are sitting on the ground like Easter eggs, but as you progress through the game you have to work much harder to earn your way to more worlds.Graphically Banjo kept up to date well enough. The visuals are just a tad choppy, but they still look good enough, and that sort of thing happened all the time in the N64 era. Sometimes objects that are a little ways away won't appear on screen until you get closer, which thankfully doesn't prove to be too annoying but still would be good if fixed. Despite these few flaws, though, the graphics look great considering the times.One of Banjo's shining areas aside from gameplay is the sound. The characters speak in a gibberish sort of language (with text shown on the bottom of the screen) and this might annoy some but it's still good to add personality to each character. The sound effects are all good too, no complaints there. The really cool part of the sound, though, is the music. The tracks are cool enough as they are, but when you're standing on a different spot or in a different area, like if you're under water or at the entrance to a different world, the music style and sound totally changes while keeping the same song. Then as you exit the spot the music transitions back to the normal style, and this effect may sound small without actually hearing it but trust me when I say it's really, really cool.Mario 64 may have been the revolution, but some of the games that derived bits and pieces from it were possibly even better, in my opinion. Banjo-Kazooie is one such game, adding a lot of depth and value to an already proven formula. It may not be the game everyone looked to for inspiration in the game-making world, but Banjo-Kazooie is a real gem from Rare's glory days on the N64, and it makes me want to play the sequel even if it is ten years old.Gameplay: 9.5Graphics: 8.5Sound: 9.5Camera & Control: 8.5Value: 9.5FINAL SCORE: 9.2/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2009"}

The models, the environments, are all 2007 level so even though it's been up to 720P it's still PS2 graphics. And the trophies... Well if they mean a lot to you then you may buy the game can grab them, but they are really means nothing to me.So I strongly recommend NEW players to dwell in, you won't get disappointed; However, if you had played it before, probably you should save the money unless you really need the trophies, or your PS3 are not capable for PS2 games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2009"}

Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M.

Snake does end up saving things in the end, sort of, so that helped out a bit.  i liked getting the sword at the end of the game, it made me feel like the Ninja from the first game for psone, Gray Fox.  and i could deflect bullets, too.  and eventually i could unlock stealth mode and i didn't have to look at raiden anymore, which was a big plus.after the tanker with snake, you spend the rest of the game exploring the \"Big Shell\" in the middle of the ocean.  the overall look can get a little boring at times, seeing as everything has the same backgound.  but it's not enough to take away from the game.  the bosses are neat, but they are never really a challenge.  the game isn't all that long, like the first one, and a second run through would only take a couple of hours.  my first time through this game with no help whatsoever, took just a hair over nine hours.  i was impressed with the overall package, but i still can't stand Raiden.  i'm sorry that i bring up how much i hate him so often, but if you are like me and think Solid Snake is the coolest guy around, then you will feel the same way.  if not, then sorry for being repetitive.so all in all, a great game, even if you can't follow the plot.  the gameplay is water-tight and the characters (except raiden) kick ass.  so buy it if you're a metal gear fan, but get ready to hate a certain blonde guy real soon.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2004"}

Just needs more","reviewText":"This is probably one of the best designed and balanced games that have come out in a long time. It plays so smoothly and there is hardly any lag at all online. I have played this game close to a month now and I still enjoy it. My problem is it has been a month and we still only have 5 game modes, limited weapons/upgrades and many other features that should have come with a multiplayer only game. This game is already losing its luster. You cant keep people engaged for long periods of time with what is offered here. To me this is a solid base of a game.Pros:1. High quality and quantiy of maps2. Great game balance between pilot and Titan. Either one could be their own multiplayer game. Together they are fantastic3. Good solid weapons and upgrades that are very well balanced. There are some favorites.4. Very fluid gameplay. Everything works5. The offered gametypes work very well. (Attrition is my personal least favorite)6. Solid sound effects and graphic effects. You really feel the difference between being on foot and in a Titan. The guns all feel powerful.7. This game does not feel as frustrating when you are having an off night.Again all of this makes for a great experience but this game needs some updates. If you were to compare the multiplayer only features of some of the top games last generation to Titanfall it would not be able to stand next to them. Titanfall does not have a rich feature set at this point. If it changes I will update my score. Being a multiplayer only game it should be feature rich or at least have had stuff added already.Some Cons1. Match making is not of Halo quality. Most of the time I am destroying the other team or we are getting destroyed. The high intensity close matches do not happen a lot. (they look like they are working on this)2. Leveling up feels like a grind. Why should I do it3. 5 game modes. ummm yea4. No customization. Outside of a few loadouts.5. No clans, no hoard mode (i know not really applicable), no private matches, I could go onPvZ has been updated already and they sold way less then you. I will stop there cause you get the point. Like I said once or if this game gets up to par I will update my score. I still would recommend this game. They did some wonderful work in creating a nice base of a game. We just need the gravy now and it will be great.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2014"}

Many say it is the game of the year or the way games are headed or that it's brilliant. I agree with all, but with some hesitation about 'the way games are headed'.First of all, I put in Heavy Rain after I received it, not sure how difficult it was going to be, or how long it was going to take me to get used to it, but was quickly adapted to the technology and new style of remote control with a slow, introductory scene that sets up the story. The STORY that would soon lock me into a level of involvement that I've never experienced. The first time that I encountered a fight, or had to control a speeding car through cross traffic and ultimately flipped off the highway and had to scramble inside a burning car for a clue hidden for me in the glove compartment and unbuckle my seatbelt, while upside down before the car exploded... I knew that this game was something special.I could feel the adrenaline that the character in the game was going through. Well, some of it. Yet, what makes HEAVY RAIN work, isn't the new controls. In fact, the controls are pretty easy and the techniques are nothing New. What makes the game work is the story and the way, just by making YOU control the characters, that it gives you a feeling of involvement and relationship to the people you portray.Not to mention, the visuals and way they seemlessly blend are brilliant.Is it the way games are headed? Not sure. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another game like this in the future. I'm having a blast trying to figure out who the Origami killer is. Yet, it all seems kind of trapped in a box. The extent that you can go about your own plans is limited. Many scenes won't let you leave until you've done everything. The game should allow you to screw up. If I missed some evidence, it's my own fault.Still, that doesn't take away from the games ability to suck you into the picture and make you feel like it's you who's life is on the line or it's your kid who you have to save. That makes this game an experience I won't soon forget. Just hoping that someday this type of game allows you a little more free reign, but that may be asking too much.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2010"}

Where it fails, much like all yearly releases, is innovation. This game offers nothing new in terms of gameplay mechanics. Tower defense? We've seen that a million times before, and executed better. The hook blade? In terms of combat it offers some flashy, yet shallow moves, and in terms of transportation, zip-lines aren't exactly revolutionary either(The saboteur comes to mind, and that game rocks). Bomb crafting, seriously? Touting grenades as new and innovative? Give me a break.I'm not saying I need something as mind blowing as the original, but something at least as cool as calling in fellow assassins from brotherhood would suffice(although that level up minigame was a time wasting pain)It's hard to say this is a rental, because the game will last you a good 12-18 hours, but it's hard to recommend it as a purchase, because you are paying 60$ for what honestly feels like one giant expansion pack. Look for deals that offer it around the 30$ mark.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2011"}

The game play and controls are pretty much the same as the first three games so there's no need to learn any different tricks or anything really, the graphics and effects in the game are amazing and there are some comedic parts as you listen to the testimony of the four prisoners as they give their statements in the military inquiry,especially with the smart mouth Baird. Single player is fun but obviously like with Halo people wonder about multi-player online,while there are some new styles overall it's pretty much the same. So if you already have the Gears of War 1-3 then this is an excellent addition if you don't the game is still worth checking out,no worries if you haven't played any of the GOW games as this one deals with what happened before those came out so you won't be confused on what's going on to much.....","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2013"}

It's an educational game and I played this game when I first got a Nintendo DSi XL (The game is pre-installed on Nintendo DSi and DSi XL) which I down sized and upgraded later to a Nintendo DS lite which does not have DSi or DSi XL features nor is the game pre-installed but I did buy the game separately for the system. For someone like me who has Attention Deficit Disorder, it's really a great game to have and I really want Brain Age 2. Usually when my parents bought me something educational I was never really excited but when I bought this game I was excited. Now let me get to price, I actually didn't buy this online, I bought it at a pawn shop, it was sealed and it was only $10.00. I saw it at another pawn shop where I live and it was $19.99 used and it was not sealed. Thats a $9.99 difference, between a complete not sealed used game for twice what I originally paid vs. a brand new and sealed game at half the cost. Thats a difference I notice and hopefully you the consumer take notice of. For that price I would pay $10.00 all day long next to $20.00. So for me to get this game $10.00 sealed it was a bargain price. So let me now go into details of the game, it tests different areas of your brain, such as your Prefrontal Cortex, and other complex areas of the human brain that we everyday people don't think about on a daily basis that we use everyday. It tests your brain with three different tests, it then tells you the age of your brain, if you score high (bad) then you work on training your brain and you can take the Brain Age test again to improve your score/age, and if you score a low age then that means your brain is healthy, and of course you continue to train your brain to keep yourself up to speed. It tests you in Math, Reading, and there are other various mental exercises to help improve other areas of the brain. Trust me if you buy it for the right price, you won't regret it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2013"}

The controls are good and the mapping for the various force powers are well done. The graphics of the game are great and I enjoyed the combat. During the first game it seemed that everyone in the galaxy had something to stop a light saber. In this game you cut and carve through endless hordes of enemies. That said the combat is rather tedious at times and doesn't require any thought or effort. The force powers are great and this game captures the feeling of an awesomely powerful Jedi better than the first. But on the lower difficulty settings you are so powerful as to make the game too easy.Even worse the game is short, really short, I finished it the same night I got it. There is also no real story, character development or plot. It relies heavily on just continuing the plot from the first game, but has almost no story development. The dialog is sparse and poor, the pacing is poor, the platformer elements are few and far between. What you get is a couple hours cutting up bad guys with your lightsaber and brutalizing them with your force powers. There is no real need to play through the game again, sure you can unlock some costumes but why bother other than to feel you got your money's worth.Now with all my negatives why would I five this game a 4 for fun? Because while the ride was short it was a fun little time killer. And better yet I had rented it, had I purchased it I would have been livid. The game is a good play through for the Star Wars fan, but not a good buy. Try the demo and if you like it rent the game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2011"}

{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","summary":"The Video Game Novella Masterpiece","reviewText":"The Last of Us (TLoU) is one of those games that comes along every once in a while and reaffirms that gaming is a legitimate art form that deserves a place alongside more accepted formats such as movies and books. The primary aspect that sets TLoU apart from the pack is the storytelling and character development which unfold throughout the approximate year-long saga that makes up the game. Many games try to endear the audience to the onscreen character but few will ever succeed like Naughty Dog, the development studio, has with TLoU.----------------------STORY:The story unfolds in modern day America during the beginning of a fungal pandemic that quickly sweeps across the nation. The beginning moments of the story are an intense blur of panic as Joel, his daughter Sarah, and his brother Tommy attempt to flee from their home as chaos engulfs the world around them. The fungal infection known only as Cordyceps that is spreading across the world effectively turns people into mindless zombie-like creatures.After the prologue the game moves forward in time twenty years to what&#8217;s left of the United States. In fact you don&#8217;t actually know if the U.S. really even exists. Citizens live in quarantine zones and eek out a meager existence living in constant fear of the outside world around them. Supplies are scarce and the military regime that rules the quarantine zones is waging a two fronted battle &#8211; one against the infected human shells that prowl the fringes of the QZ&#8217;s; the other against very citizens they&#8217;re trying to protect. Many citizens in desperation to survive have taken to viewing their military protectors as oppressors and actively battle against them. Several factional groups have formed including one large group known as the Firefly&#8217;s who fight to restore humanity and the former U.S.Joel&#8217;s main partner is a female character named Tess. Together they engage in trading ration stamps for goods and services including illicit weapons and ammunition. At the onset of the story Joel and Tess set out to retrieve some merchandise that was stolen from them by a business partner. After meeting up with a contact from the Firefly&#8217;s named Marlene, Joel and Tess are asked to escort a girl named Ellie to the ruined capital building that lies outside the quarantine zone. This is really the moment where the meat of the game begins and you&#8217;re introduced to the Cordyceps-ravaged humans who are now known as Clickers, Runners, and Bloaters.Over the course of the next nine months or so you&#8217;ll visit a variety of locations across the U.S. from Boston to Pittsburgh, all the way to Colorado, Wyoming and Utah. Each area has its own distinct feel and appropriate climate to match the time period. For example part of the game takes place in the summer, fall and then winter.----------------------GAMEPLAY:Gameplay is similar to other third-person adventure games from Naughty Dog, most notably, Uncharted: Drake&#8217;s Fortune. The major element in TLoU that differs is the extreme emphasis on stealth and resource management. This is not a shooter and at any difficulty past &#8216;Normal&#8217; there is a severe penalty for using &#8220;run and gun&#8221; tactics. I would classify this game as Uncharted meets Resident Evil (the older survival horror oriented RE games).As you explore the varied areas it will be critical to carefully assess your surroundings. Do your risk killing the two enemies you can see in order to search the area freely and hope you find precious resources or would you be better off sneaking past the enemies and just moving on? That is an example of a typical encounter with enemies in TLoU. Enemies will come in both human and corrupted-human form. Although the variety of corrupted humans is limited you&#8217;ll find that each presents a unique challenge to overcome. Runners for example are the recently exposed form of humans. They look like humans, are quite fast and retain their vision. Clickers are a more advanced stage of humans who&#8217;ve been turned for a longer period of time. They don&#8217;t have eyesight but acoustic hearing similar to bats and make a clicking sound as they walk. They are, however, much stronger than a human and Runner. Bloaters are huge, hulking masses that retain little likeness to their once human form. They&#8217;re rare and quite difficult to kill.As you scavenge the landscape you&#8217;ll pick up a variety of weapons from a simple &#8220;shiv&#8221; to bow-and-arrow, handguns, a hunting rifle, shotgun and more. Each can be upgraded using components and tools that you find at specific upgrade benches. Joel too can get enhancements to his abilities using supplements that you find.One major advantage that Joel has is the ability to use his hearing to pinpoint enemy locations. Not all enemies show up mind you but most. This greatly helps your sneaking and attack planning.I would recommend after finishing the game another run through on &#8216;Survivor&#8217; difficulty. This is really how TLoU should be played. Resources are stretched to the absolute minimum and literally every bullet or band-aid makes the difference. Additionally, Joel&#8217;s hearing ability is disabled.----------------------ONLINE:The game features an online component; however, I&#8217;ve not tried it so I will not say anything more about that.----------------------GRAPHICS:Graphics are gritty and often used to lend moodiness to the environment. I wouldn&#8217;t call the graphics beautiful although there are moments where the game is quite pretty. But the graphics perfectly suit TLoU. There are a lot of earthtones, gray&#8217;s and other colors that constantly remind you that the world is not right. TLoU maintains the high quality visuals and animations that you would expect from a Naughty Dog game.----------------------CRITICISMS:I often wonder how someone could not like this game but the truth is that this isn&#8217;t a game for everyone. Certainly this is a slower paced survival game. Not a shooter. The brutal realities of the story can be quite disturbing in moments. The colors and world can be quite bleak. The lack of resources can be frustrating particularly at higher difficulty levels. So it&#8217;s up to the individual to decide. Certainly there is an incredible story here that I think every gamer should experience.----------------------CONCLUSION:Naughty Dog delivers another incredible experience that should not be missed by most. The lines between game and movie or book are again blurred. If you&#8217;re a fan of post-apocalyptic stories like The Road or I Am Legend then this is a game for you!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2014"}

Supporting optional 3-D hardware, the game features a free-look movement system, allowing players to pan 360 degrees in any location. There are five new ages to explore, each featuring a unique visual style. The story line focuses on a new character, a villain whose home world was ruined by Sirrus and Achenar (familiar to those who have played the previous games), and has returned to take revenge against Atrus and his family. Explore the environment and solve puzzles to uncover the mystery of this new adversary.","reviewerName":"Zachary Koenig \"K-Dawg\"","summary":"The Best Of Both Worlds","reviewText":"The original Myst created a genre all its own.  It's sequel Riven took things to a new level by creating an incredible interconnected set of islands with puzzles weaved through them all.  Exile takes the best of both those worlds and mends incredible puzzles with an engaging environment.This was always one of my favorite installments in the Myst franchise because it really simplified things after the often-agonizing Riven.  The environments are still lush and interesting, but this time a bit more contained.  No taking a trolley from one island to another over and over again just to pull a single level.  Instead, you just solve one puzzle in one basic location and move on to the next one.The storyline still moves on in this one too, as it focuses on Saavedro, a man looking for revenge on Atrus based on the earlier actions of Sirius & Achenar (Atrus' sons).Finally, one new addition to the interface is the ability to look 360 degrees around you.  It is no longer a true \"point-and-click\" game, in this aspect, but it allows much more range of motion.  No more clicking like a madman trying to find the right angle to solve a puzzle, or missing a key detail because the angle isn't quite right.Overall, Exile is a great third chapter in the Myst saga.  It takes the foundation of the original, mixes it with the landscapes of Riven, and creates the best overall game in the franchise to that date.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2013"}

Upon returning, they notice a new world, and there is a world war taking place between three groups for control of the world.Play As Three Different Factions for Varied game playIn Red Alert 3, you have the choice to play as the Allies, the Soviets, or the Empire of the Rising Sun. Each faction has its own story-line and distinct units with advantages and disadvantages that you have to master in order to win. The new faction to the series is the Empire of the Rising Sun, derived from Imperial Japan, with an all-new cast of units and characters.The three factions have many differences, exemplified by their wildly different types of units. The Soviets, for example, have armored attack bears, Allies have the Dolphin ship which can high jump and use a sonic attack, and the Empire of the Rising Sun features such quirky units as a giant transforming mecha and ninjas. As they've done with the series, EA injects humor into the game when possible, keeping a smile on your face as you wage war.Fight on Land, in the Air, and on SeaRed Alert 3 has land units, air units, and naval units, all integral parts of the game.

It has AI that stands out as an effort beyond any other FPS style game yet. The incredible fluidity of plot was much better than in the first.

I ran this on an athlon 900 with windows xp ,a geforce 4 4800 ,and 1 gig pc133 ram and it ran *almost * perfectly with EVERY feature cranked all the way up. My specs are far below the recommended specs on the box. Game length? Anyone who says they finished this in under 10 hours is missing out on the true grit of this game. The background conversations in the jail cells, police officer interrogations in the background, and 'noone lives forever' style conversations between the bad guys at the 'top of the stairs' or, wherever they may happen to be. As long as you stay out of sight, you can hear some juicy gossip that just may clue you in to the next step in this 'noir' mystery.

But, the beauty of the MAX PAYNE 2 world is that it is much more complete than the first. Including some haunting dialogue ,spoken by max himself from the first game, that will come back to haunt you in nightmares. There is one incredible 'escape ' moment near the start of the game that sets the scene for the whole game. This is more of an interactive movie than a 'shooter'. And, a funhouse moment in the game that will make your jaw drop. More than a pleasant surprise is this game. It is a shocking one. Rockstar games have outdone themselves once again.

{"product_name":"B001NJ28SO","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"There are 2 good things about this game...","reviewText":"...The loading screen and the trophies. And yes, I really was forced to point out that the look of the loading screen is one of the best parts of this game. The controls, cover system and enemy AI are all unruly. The game has a tendency to freeze. The look is bland, there's no guidance through these 9 short stages. The vehicle chases are as close to broken as any I've ever played; it will literally feel as though you're shooting at targets you're never sure if you're hitting during these. If you die, you often have to sit through long cutscenes you've seen before because you aren't sure how to defeat the enemy. And if you don't sit behind cover without getting shot for a full minute, you'd never realize your health regenerates (it does this not slowly and progressively, but after a long wait fills completely anew). But the enemy AI on the spiders, while frustrating, really did seem like what you'd expect to encounter; if they realize they're being flanked, they move their back away from your shots whenever possible. Try to remember that they made this game with AI that knows where you are, even if you haven't revealed yourself yet (these are heat-seeking terminators after all). I really recommend 2-player co-op. The computer is almost no help at all when your job is to flank the enemy. So again, a wicked loading screen and a platinum trophy just for beating the game on Hard. Rent it for a day, play it through with a friend, and once you've obtained the platinum, forget you ever endured this close-to-broken game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2011"}

A fine game and great conclusion to the Final Fantasy XIII saga, but not without its flaws.","reviewText":"The first Final Fantasy XIII was an extremely divisive game in this long-running RPG series.  Yes, it was a smashing sales success for Square-Enix, but its mixed reaction from critics and gamers made the fact that Final Fantasy XIII-2 existed at all somewhat of an oddity.  Still though, it happened, and XIII-2 corrected many of the issues that players had with the first game.  It also introduced a convoluted time travel story that had little to do with the &#8220;fugitives on the run&#8221; narrative of the first game.  The ending was a bit surprising, and left us with a &#8220;To be continued&#8230;&#8221; that frankly I doubted could&#8217;ve been adequately resolved.  The result now is Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII, and the best I can say about it is that it concludes the story in a highly satisfactory way.  The worst I can say is a lot of the game comes off as rushed and poorly planned, with possibly one of the worst game mechanics ever to be incorporated in an open-world role-playing game.  Though in the end, the good does outweigh the bad.Without going into spoiler territory, I&#8217;ll just say that Lightning Returns takes place 500 years after the events of XIII-2.  Time has stopped, and for those 500 years people live on the remnants of the world without aging and waiting for the world to end.  Lightning, having encased herself in crystal, awakens to have the god Bhunivelze make her &#8220;The Savior&#8221;, tasking her with saving as many souls as possible during the last 13 days so that the next work will be populated.  As a reward, her sister Serah will be brought back to her.  Right off, this is a pretty confusing beginning for players, as the actual ending to XIII-2 didn&#8217;t go into why Lightning was crystal.  You would&#8217;ve had to have downloaded and completed the tedious DLC for XIII-2 called Requiem of the Goddess to see how Lightning&#8217;s story began.  Anyway, Lightning and former companion Hope now reside in The Ark, and oversee the last few days of the world.  A lot of new, unrelated story elements are thrown at the player during the opening hour, and it may seem a bit of an overload of &#8220;what the heck!?&#8221; moments, but rest assured all will be explained during the course of the game.The game&#8217;s main quest takes place over five stories and a concluding chapter across the world&#8217;s four lands.  Each one involves one of the main characters: Noel, Snow, Sazh, Caius and Fang, ending with Vanille&#8217;s fate on The Final Day.  Outside of those main quests, there are several side quests available throughout the world.  After a brief introductory chapter, you pretty much have access to all areas.  Hope acts as a guide, giving suggestions and elaborating on story and side quest elements.  You, as the player, then have 13 in-game days to complete all main quests and as many side quests as you can before the world ends.  This is the dreaded game mechanic&#8230;a countdown clock is always shown on-screen depicting the current time.  At 06:00 every day, the day ends and Lightning is returned to the Ark no matter what she&#8217;s doing.  One in-game minute is roughly 2.5 real-life seconds.  I&#8217;ll say it right now, the time limit is invasive and more than a little stressful at times (especially during some of the many fetch quests).  It stops you from properly exploring everything, and something as seemingly-harmless as missing a jump and having to backtrack feels rage-inducing as it wastes minutes of your in-game time.  It&#8217;s not without a little reprieve though&#8230;time stops during battles, during cutscenes and conversations, and while in the menus.  Also, you gain an ability called Chronostasis which stops time&#8217;s passing for a little while which can be incredibly useful at times.  Should you manage to not complete the main chapters in 13 in-game days, it&#8217;s Game Over, and you will be given the option to restart the game in New Game + with all your equipment and abilities intact.As far as I handled the time limit as a player, I&#8217;ll freely admit that at first I was completely disgusted with it.  And I will always believe that no matter what, this mechanic should not exist.  However, it turns out that you actually do have plenty of time to complete the main quests and most of the side quests.  Then again, full disclosure, I used the strategy guide.  I found myself out of quests to do by around day 8.  But for those who don&#8217;t have the guide, I can imagine you might cut it close.The battle system is one of the best aspects of Lightning Returns.  Gone is the party system of prior games, instead Lightning fights on her own for the majority of the game (two story chapters give you an AI companion).  You set up three schemata for Lightning, which is basically a costume with unique battle abilities, a weapon, a shield and 2-3 other abilities of your choosing.  Mixing and matching garbs and all equipment is essential, and the possibilities are almost endless.  You pick three schemata and can switch between them on the fly during battle.  Each one has an ATB bar, and each ability uses up a portion of that.  When it runs out, you must switch to another schema while the ATB bar for the prior one recharges.  It&#8217;s a frantic system reminiscent of Final Fantasy X-2 and its dress spheres, and is highly engaging.  Battles are fun, fast, flashy and something I definitely looked forward to.  Unfortunately, battles only do two things: give you gil/items and give you EP, which is used for certain abilities like Chronostasis.  You do not gain experience points.  Furthermore, escaping a battle costs you one in-game hour, which adds to the stress.  Experience points to not exist in this game.  To enhance Lightning&#8217;s HP and abilities, you must complete quests.And that&#8217;s pretty much the crux of the gameplay.  Not terrible, but that time limit can be off-putting for some, especially considering that open world RPG&#8217;s should allow the player to explore at their leisure.Polish is another area where this game is severely lacking.  You can plainly see where the developers (Square-Enix and Tri-Ace) decided to spend the most time and where they cut corners.  Main story quests are interesting and move the story along fantastically.  Side quests are bland, boring, overly dramatic and poorly written.  As they are necessary to ensure you&#8217;re not under-leveled by the endgame, this tends to drag down the game a bit.  A lot of quests consist of &#8220;Talk to X character&#8221;, &#8220;Bring me X number of this ingredient and Y number of this other one,&#8221; or &#8220;Find me this special item.&#8221;  A couple of the more combat-oriented ones are fun though.  Graphically, this game is not the prettiest.  Character models for townsfolk are hideous, and the same model is used ad nauseum.  Creature design is poor and look decidedly prior-generation (as in, PlayStation 2).  Monster variety is very anemic, with just a tiny fraction of what&#8217;s in the prior two games.  Textures in towns are HIDEOUS.  As in, textures practically do not exist.  Again, looks like an upscaled PS2 game.  However, main characters look markedly better, and the game&#8217;s final moments are breathtakingly beautiful and detailed, making for a stark contrast to the rest of the game.  Compared to how the first Final Fantasy XIII looked pristine at every moment, this is a disappointment here&#8230;especially when you flashback to that game&#8217;s story and clearly see a huge improvement in visuals.  Finally, the music.  The tiny amount of new tunes are very good, but most of the music is just recycled from XIII-2.  Lightning Returns is so obviously a rush job at times, I&#8217;m surprised Square-Enix would allow it.Cosmetic issues can be brushed aside, however, and I can&#8217;t say that the game wasn&#8217;t fun.  It just didn&#8217;t engage like the past two games did.  Rest assured that gamers who stick with it till the end will be treated to one of the most explosively exciting and phenomenal endings in Final Fantasy history.  I will recommend this game freely to anyone who enjoyed XIII and XIII-2.  If you&#8217;re new to the Final Fantasy XIII series, this is not the game with which to jump in.  Start with and endure the linearity of the first game, trust me! For everyone else, Lightning Returns turns out to be a satisfying conclusion to this saga, even if it has an uncharacteristically large number of rough edges for a Final Fantasy game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2014"}

But surprisingly, they made it into a proper shooter in the vein of Starfox, rather than watering down the shooting elements to make it more accessible. Bravo!A few of the points I liked were the RPG elements that made collecting items fun. There are several different weapons and items, each with their own special features. You can use weapons as ranged or melee, some as both, others as one or the other. I found the bows to be my personal favorite, but it's fun to try each stage multiple times with different weapons and items.Another great feature is the sliding difficulty bar. It's actually called 'intensity' or something. But it goes from 0 to 9, but is actually 1 to 90 since you can hit each to the tenth decimal (so 4.1 intensity or 8.4 intensity). I played through at 4 the first time and it was tough, but not impossible. Going back through (you can play each independently on replays) and hitting it up to 7 or 8 spells suicide most often. But it's not impossible. It reminds me of the crazy 007 Goldeneye unlockables (beating the second level in under 2 minutes on hard or something crazy - I remember that nightmare).There is a lot of great stat tracking as well. You have a puzzle that contains the unlocked trophies (nice). You can also fuse weapons into stronger ones. You collect hearts which may be spent shopping or bet before replaying a level in order to up the difficulty. If you want to have a cake walk, you can set the difficulty under 2 by paying hearts and play as an invincible Pit. But that's lame! Only do if you are under 12 years old or just trying to get a feel for the level. Players should play at 3.0 to 5.0 through the main story so there is some challenge.The main game is rather long. There are a lot of episodes, and each is unique. The first half is a flying section lasting less than 5 minutes where the direction and path are controlled and all you do is aim and shoot. The second half of each episode is a ground attack with free roaming travel. The controls are still using the stylus, circle pad and L button and movement can sometimes be a struggle. But with practice it gets easier. But if you play for more than a few hours your hand will hate you.I have to put this out there: This is so far, the best looking game I have played on the 3DS. I have Super Mario 3D Land, which is impressive, as well as Mario Kart 7 (also impressive). But Kid Icarus looks great. The 3D is really flashy and works well for the game play. Granted, sometimes you lose it because of the action, then you either have to get the 3DS back to the sweet spot or flip the 3D off really quickly! I found that I used less 3D on the flying portions since they can get a bit hectic.The story is fun and witty, though Pit's voice actor can sometimes get a bit tiresome (he sounds like the guy from Suikoden Tierkreis). But by the time you get to the interactions of Pandora and Palutena you will be laughing, or at least grinning. The voice over continues throughout the episode, so it does tend to overshadow the music, but it's often helpful or necessary. It also keeps the story moving while playing. Pit comments on many things \"What are all those red lights?\" and such. I love when the old NES sprites pop up on the bottom screen when they talk about old baddies like Pandora and Hewdraw.It's not the same as the old Kid Icarus. But it's the differences that make it a worthy follow up. Rather than re-hashing and ruining the style of the original, the developers utilized the modern technology to put a new twist on an old genre. I think it is a worthy game to the 3DS library, and a serious game of the year (2012) contender.Pros:+ Amazing graphics+ Engaging characters and story+ Massive replay value+ Lots of items, weapons, and unlockables to collect+ Great multiplayer+ Lots of funCons:- Old school shooter style a turn off for some- Steep learning curve- Hand fatigueSummary?

Also, like the Tony Hawk games,The Simsis a very addictive game.Players micromanage the lives of a family of virtual people and influence the outcome of their lives, be it success or something akin to a nervous breakdown. The bestselling PC version of the game has, in recent years, been upgraded with elements like parties, pets, and vacations, but this iteration is closer to the basic formula.You start the game living with Mom in a one-story suburban house. You are immediately presented with certain life tasks, such as fixing the TV and making lunch, which are aligned with the skills you'll need for the game's main challenge--keeping your sims in balance on eight conflicting categories. For example, eating will have an impact on your sim's hunger rating, but it will also impact his bladder rating. You'll have to make sure that he keeps himself and the house clean, that he sleeps to restore his energy, and that he also has time to keep himself entertained. The free will option lets your sims coast a bit, and you can also save time by stacking tasks together. Time passes at the rate of about one minute per second in the game, but you can fast-forward sim time when you need to, such as when they're sleeping.The controls are justifiably complex, but adjusting to them is not difficult. You see your sims from an overhead perspective that you can both rotate and zoom. You direct their actions by moving a line cursor to where you want them to go or to what object or person with which you want them to interact.The game is surprisingly funny. Neglect your sims and they'll shout and wave their arms to get your attention. Allow one's energy to get too low and he or she will likely collapse and sleep right where they were standing. When that happens, Mom is likely to serve them dinner on the floor.Gamers may find that it takes a while to get the hang ofThe Sims' style and control scheme.

Games like Re:Coded, which don't really add as much to the series as one expects. But then you have a game like Birth By Sleep that's a fantastic game. Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance (or 3D, if you must) is more in touch with Birth By Sleep. And, in fact, those who played Birth By Sleep will get so much more out of it. Dream Drop Distance is by far one of the better Kingdom Hearts spinoffs out there, and one that Kingdom Hearts fans with a 3DS should play.The story centers on Sora, Riku and Mickey as they take the trials to become keyblade masters. They must go through a series of challenges to prove themselves. Unfortunately things get a little messed up in the process and it involves a much bigger adventure at play. The story can seem just a tad bit confusing, but this is because it relies on you having knowledge of prior games. It'll try its best to catch you up to speed but in the long run, it's best to actually play prior games (in particular: Birth By Sleep). You're going to meet a few new characters (Neku from The World Ends with You shows up here) and a few old. You'll also travel to various Disney worlds just as you've done before.  This is not a game for first time players of Kingdom Hearts.  The story is not as simple as it seems and Dream Drop Distance is going to be confusing to anyone who decides to start their Kingdom Hearts romp here.Kingdom Hearts 3D plays a lot like it's older brothers on the PS2, DS and PSP, but here things are more refined. A lot of the Kingdom Hearts spinoffs have done quite a few things to mess with the system at play. While the gameplay remains familiar in Dream Drop Distance, there area few things added. You'll begin by playing a combat tutorial that will definitely give you a run down. The games basic structure hasn't changed. It's still an action RPG through and through where you can lock on to targets and attack them. While also manipulating through various spells and techniques. After using each spell or technique it's going to recharge before you do it again. This keeps one from spamming everything and keeps Dream Drop Distance from being too touch. Likewise, you'll gain more ability slots and be able to set more as you go.There are a few additions to combat, though, such as the reality shift. When locked onto enemies the cursor will become pink and you can engage in a Reality Shift attack. These attacks change based on your location. In Traverse Town, for instance, it's a slingshot that will allow you to fling objects (or enemies) at other foes. You can also do flow motion attacks where you use the objects and environments around you to go ahead and pull off other attacks.The biggest addition is how the team mechanics are done. There's no Donald and Goofy to team up with this time around. Instead you'll have to contend with Dream Eaters. These Dream Eaters are the ones invading the worlds you must save. But there are also friendly Dream Eaters called spirits that you can create using materials you gain from fallen foes (called Nightmares). They're more or less your pets and they'll help out in battle. If you spend time with them and care for them you can build up their stats.You'll play as both Sora and Riku throughout the experience. But Dream Drop Distance utilizes a \"drop\" system. Both character's have a drop gauge and when it depletes entirely that character will \"drop\" and you'll pick up as the other character. This can even happen in the middle of combat or when you're simply running around. The system in and of itself can feel very strange at first (especially when you drop in the middle of a fight) and it's likely to rub some people the wrong way. The good news is that you can also drop manually if you feel like it. And if you're wise about how you do it you won't drop in the middle of a tough fight. That being said, when you resume it's not s though you'll find yourself right in the thick of a boss fight. The battle will reset.The game is telling two parallel stories so when you \"drop\" and the other character takes over it's not from where one left off. Sora and Riku will both be doing their own thing in the same area and starting off from their own point. The drops will not be a surprise as you'll always know when they're coming and you'll be able to prepare accordingly.Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance is a great game, but definitely not perfect. The only thing that may seem a bit odd is that there's a lot to learn about the combat of the game. Things get off to a slow and awkward start as the game constantly bombard's you with tutorials, explanations and flashbacks. It doesn't settle into a good groove for quite some time. Kingdom Hearts games usually have lengthy prologues or tutorials, but they're usually integrated in a way that doesn't break up the flow of the game itself. Dream Drop Distance is constantly stopping combat and story to do so. And while it is most certainly important to learn the game the rate at which these tutorials come is more than likely going to make the player feel overwhelmed.The second thing that's hard to overcome is that the mechanic of \"dropping\" just seems gimmicky in and of itself. The story and game itself offer up little reason for it to be implemented. The game could've easily told two parallel stories in a fashion similar to how Birth By Sleep did it's simultaneous story lines. Instead we have a drop mechanic. It's a good thing they let you also drop manually. The point is, the mechanic in and of itself still feels very gimmicky and of all the things that Dream Drop Distance does this may be the one that you'll care for the least.The 3DS has a wide range of good looking games. Kingdom Hearts 3D is by far one of the better looking on the system. While games like Resident Evil Revelations do a great job at what they do, Kingdom Hearts is colorful and vibrant. Sometimes even looking better and smoother than the PS2 older brothers. The environments are incredibly detailed and populated. The frame rate never dips or slows down and it's just easy on the eyes. The 3D isn't bad either, but like most 3DS games, isn't really integral to the visual experience of the game itself. The music is very good, though most tunes are familiar. They're either remixed from older Kingdom Hearts titles or ripped directly from them. From a production standpoint a 3DS game has rarely looked this good.In the end, for Kingdom Hearts fans, Dream Drop Distance is a great game that really adds to the story and mythos at hand. It's worth playing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2012"}

For all of those who busted their behinds to get a shot of Samus without her helmet, you'll finally get your wish, as this includes cinematics and screens without even the trademark armor. Full dialogue and interactive NPC's mean that there's an actual plot line apart from collect the same set of equipment. And while side of the internal monologues are a bit cheesy, they still manage to add appeal and depth to a character that's thus far been a virtual mute.Other M starts with a retconn immediately following Metroid Prime. Strangely lamenting the death of the baby Metroid, Samus answers a distress call from a Federation ship where she runs into several of her old squadmates, including her old CO.Controls have radically changed. You're back to a 2-d on 3-d platformer, with movement and combat on one hand and stand alone aiming on the other. This present an annoying challenge at times, as you can no longer move while trying to fire precision shots or missiles, though this is easily balanced by useful auto-aiming during your platformer views. The camera gets poorly placed a few times, but otherwise, combat manages to flow fairly well. A few of the weapons are overblown, and fill up half the screen unnecessarily. The Scanner Visor is gone, and this is a major disappointment for me, as I thoroughly enjoyed the AI analysis of background items and enemy units. But otherwise, there's only a handful of nits with combat, but thos're easily overlooked given smart level design that can really make you think.Voices are JRPG with some of the hookiness removed. They had to make a few bows to bizarre dialogue and pacing, but voices are good and conversations believable, though there are a few scenes that're simply weird. Graphics are a touch off, though mostly from overshadowing, but there is a good almost Resident Evil atmosphere of creepiness present, especially during certain scenes that'll make you hair stand up despite yourself.Overall, this is classic Metroid, reinvigorated with an actual voiced cast and an introspective Samus, who's been rather devoid of personal input thus far. While I'm annoyed at the a few of the changes, overall the core gameplay is there, backed up by a well put together story that manages to be genuinely creepy at times.Seeing as how no one seems to think this review worthwhile, could you please comment why if you do not care for it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2010"}

More often than not in cinematic games, the cutscenes seem unrelated and there's a delay between gameplay and story.  But not here - things work so smoothly it's delicious.Another great thing is the Wii Remote.

Monkey mayhem lives on in this exotic island adventure!","reviewerName":"Destitute","summary":"A sadly underrated entry in the Donkey Kong SNES trilogy","reviewText":"DKC3 was released in 1996, near the end of the SNES's life. It has been regarded as the worst of the three, but in my opinion, it's just as unique as DKC2.GRAPHICS:  This is probably the best-looking one, as the graphics look spectacular for an SNES game, with crystal clear, almost 3D like sprites and pretty backgrounds.MUSIC: The music is another high point, as in all DKC games. A lot of catchy tracks in this one.STORY: Not that original, but when was a DK story original? Basically, DK and Diddy get kidnapped, and it's up to Dixie and her little cousin, Kiddie, to rescue them, while uncovering the mystery of KAOS, a robot who is leading the Kremlings.GAMEPLAY: It is similar to the others, but there are also a lot of innovations. You get to the areas by boat, and when you beat the bosses you usually get parts for a better boat which allows you to explore the world further. In all the areas, including places around the world, you encounter bears in homes that can help you if you help them, usually. They mostly can be helped by giving them items you acquire. Also around the game. Also hidden in the areas and the world are caves, where you play a minigame where you have to repeat a pattern with your buttons. They get more complicated as they go along. The reward for winning the game is a banana bird, which stays at Wrinkly's. What do they do? You'll find out.Here's a further breakdown of the gameplay.LEVELS: The levels in the game are some of the most innovative in the game, with much variety. For example, one level  you are swimming in poisonous water that reverses your Dpad. In another level you have to kill all the mice running on wheels. This doesn't make the game superior, but you have to admit that it has original levels. And the bosses are original as well.ANIMAL BUDDIES: Besides riding them, you can also get into barrels that allow you to transform into one until you run into a no-animals sign. Many levels require you have to transform into them. They got rid of Rambi and Rattly and replaced them with three new ones. One is Elly, a small elephant who is similar to Rambi. Many people don't like him, but I think he's a good new addition. He can suck water up and shoot it out, as well as suck up barrels and throw them. The other is a different colored Squawks that cannot shoot eggs, but he can grab barrels with his talons and drop them on enemies. The last one is some kind of small bird who follows you from above. He cannot fight and he dies if he touches an enemy, but if you managed to get him to the no animals sign you get a good prize.BONUS COINS: Bonus rooms make a return, as well as the coins. Like the previous game, they are used to unlock levels in the Lost World.DK COINS: Now they are carried by an armored enemy called Coin. He doesn't attack, but he tries his best to protect his naked back. To kill him, you have to find a way to throw a steel barrel and hit him in the back. This time, DK coins actually have a use, as well.SWANKY'S:  In 2, Swanky hosted a quiz show, but this time he hosts a carnival game that involves throwing balls at targets. You compete against Cranky for bananas and silver coins, which are used at the general store.TAG TEAM: In 2, you could throw your partner up or at enemies, and you can do it here as well. But this time, it's slightly different, as while Kiddy can throw Dixie high, Dixie can barely throw Kiddie up in the air, but he can break cracked floors.Overall this is a great platformer for the SNES, and it kind of makes you sad to know that there will be no fantastic DK games like these anymore since Rare left for Microsoft. Pick it up or get it on an emulator or Virtual Console. The game is also a GBA port, but that version kind of sucks, IMO.On a side note, why is the cover for the original DKC shown for this game on Amazon?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2009"}

{"product_name":"B004S5TDL0","description":"","reviewerName":"BBmax50","summary":"AWESOME! with a few suggestions","reviewText":"I found this game to be the best way for someone who doesn't know how to play the guitar to learn.I personally know how to play (somewhat), but I am having a good time going thru the steps and also it is forcing me to not look at the fingerboard.I HIGHLY recommend this title for anyone who wants to learn how to play a guitar.My only problems:1. This one I feel is major.  Many people picking up this game will no doubt have an inexpensive guitar.  The tuning feature is great in theory, but it is too forgiving.  I found that even though the game thought that my guitar was in tune, something sounded off.  I hooked my guitar up to a tuner and tuned it more accuratley and it worked much better. That in itself is not my issue.  I am about 15 or so songs into the game and it had me change the tuning on the guitar.  I have decades of experience with many different guitars and I can tell you that if you change the tuning on a guitar, especially a cheap one, you will be tuning for a while to get it right.  It is simple physics.  When you change the low E string, you reduce so much tension on the neck that every other string is affected and the same goes for putting it back in regular tune.  This is all well and good and is something that a guitar player would eventually have to learn, but I think they threw it way too early in the mix and didn't explain the pitfalls to the newbies.2. There is a song where someone RAPS.  This game is called Rocksmith.  Take a lesson from Rockband.  They stuck to Rock.  They also put out a turntable version with rap stuff and it tanked.  By the way, a TURNTABLE IS NOT AN INSTRUMENT.  At first it didn't bother me too much because I know RAP is popular, but then I realized that this game is TEACHING YOU HOW TO PLAY A REAL INSTRUMENT which is something that the RAP community seems to think is not necessary anymore.  That is my biggest problem with that whole form of art (I DO NOT call it MUSIC).  They steal riffs from other songs and talk over them.  Keep that \"artform\" out of my Rock please.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2011"}
