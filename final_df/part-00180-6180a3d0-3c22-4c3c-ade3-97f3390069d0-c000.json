{"product_name":"B002EE1P2W","description":"Set several years after the events of the first game in the series,Dead Rising 2contains all the fun and over-the top carnage which gamers associate with a zombie apocalypse. As with all releases in theDead Risingseries, it is a survival horror game. Players take on the role of an all-new character, with equally new motivations to survive and resources to do so. These resources include new weapons, expanded weapon combination/creation possibilities, and even two-player coop functionality. The game also features a 4-player online multiplayer mode and a dramatic increase in the number of zombies that can be faced at once.","reviewerName":"The Matrix Fan \"Video Gamer since 1979.\"","summary":"We loves the zombies, but we loathes the load times...","reviewText":"+ PROS:+ Hundreds of weapons to use and several to create+ VAST amounts of zombies to kill - almost 10x more onscreen than the 1st game+ Lots of hidden items - clothing, weapons, combo cards+ 2 Multiplayer modes: Game campaign and Terror Is Reality+ 3 save slots- CONS:- Load times (up to 20 seconds in some cases)- No picture taking like the first Dead Rising- Co-op is a little clumsy- Errors in Terror Is Reality multiplayer- Extra save slots and improved survivor AI make the game too easy for veterans of Dead Rising 1PLOT:It's been 5 years since the Willamette disaster, and you are playing the role of Chuck Greene, a former motorcycle champion who ends up in Fortune City with his daughter Katey. A zombie outbreak occurs, and it's up to Chuck to keep his daughter safe, clear his name, and escape the city within 3 days.GAMEPLAY:From the beginning, Chuck starts off with the basics, his hands and feet. As you wander around the mall, it's clear that weapons will be needed. It doesn't matter if it's a bow & arrow, a golf club, a gumball machine, a lawnmower, a picture frame, or a bottle of ketchup....if Chuck can pick it up, chances are he can use it as a weapon. Zombies are pretty much EVERYWHERE, and when 7pm rolls around, it's not a good time to be without a Super B.F.G. because the zombies take an extra dose of the crazy.Killing zombies earns character Prestige Points, which in turn levels up inventory slots, strength, hit points, offensive and defensive capabilities. Frank West may have earned PP by taking pictures of zombies, but Chuck Greene earns his PP by creating the most insane weaponry and using them on zombies.Chuck has a series of case files to complete over the course of 3 days and during this time he can choose to try and save random survivors throughout the city, attempt to defeat psychopaths who have lost their minds due to the zombie outbreak, and try to find the life-giving Zombrex medicine that his daughter needs every day to survive. Or, he can choose to do nothing more than wander from store to store trying on clothes or gambling in the casinos.HOW MANY ZOMBIES?\"More zombies than you can shake a stick at\" seems to be putting it mildly. The first Dead Rising boasted 800 zombies on screen, but Dead Rising 2 boasts an upgrade to 7,000 zombies on screen. The crowds of zombies are definitely creepy, especially when you don't know which ones will be making a lunge for your face until they're on top of you. Sometimes there are frame rate dips if too much is happening on screen (such as...driving over a pack of zombies with an SUV?)MULTIPLAYER:A player can choose to complete the storyline with an online partner. This makes defeating psychopaths a lot easier than standard 1:1 fighting, and all case files must be completed in co-op to earn one of the game's trophies. A special shout-out to PSN player \"PandaCidal\", whose assistance was invaluable to me!The second online gameplay mode is called Terror Is Reality. 4 players compete in 4 random events (there are 9 total) which feel like a combination of American Gladiators and Mortal Kombat. The only goal is to kill as many zombies as humanly possible within the allotted time in each event, and by session's end, you take your prize earnings and cash out to one of your game saves. Your character needs $50,000 to complete a game mission? No problem! Just do an online session of TIR and cash that out to your game save and the money's all there.TROPHIES:There's a LOT of busy work in getting all the trophies for Dead Rising 2. There are easy ones such as getting 5,000 zombie kills or mixing a drink, but for the more dedicated players there are a lot of time consuming ones like spray painting all the Zombrex posters, trying on every type of clothing, gathering all gifts for Katey or using every possible melee weapon against a zombie.A good group of trophies, but not easy for casual gamers to complete. Some of these are missable during playthroughs unless you use a strategy guide.CONS:Firstly, the load times.....it has to be said, these load times are RIDICULOUS. Going through a door or moving from one part of the mall to another can take up to 20 seconds with each load. When you fight a psychopath, there's a cutscene...then a loading screen...then you fight...then there's a closing cutscene...and yet ANOTHER loading screen. If the gameplay designers were trying to achieve a frenetic pace with zombie killing, the load times killed this pacing deader than Latin.Fans of the first game really miss Frank West and his camera. I can understand why, because that's what made the first game fun...getting pictures of zombies in horror, drama, or erotic poses (to name a few). It's a bitter pill to swallow, because I miss Frank West too.I have trouble finding partners in co-op mode. Dead Rising 2 gives the option to join someone else but it only gives the option to join a friend, or join a random player at some random point in their gaming campaign. I don't have the option to \"Host\" an online session and get linked to a player like Resident Evil 5 (which I feel has a superior multiplayer menu).I have noticed a few errors with Terror Is Reality. Sometimes during the Ramsterball game, players start in the game zone instead of above it. Other times I have noticed the targeting doesn't work and it's impossible to know who is \"it\". Sometimes players can glitch and get trapped on the walls in the Zomboni game.Finally, the save slots. One of the things that made the first Dead Rising so hard and so challenging was having only one save slot. This left no margin of error and would require another run-through if something was missed. The survivors in Dead Rising 1 had a nasty habit of walking into packs of zombies, making trips back to the safehouse very difficult as the game progressed.In Dead Rising 2, the characters are much better at avoiding zombies and can even use weapons, if they accept them from you. With 3 save slots and the improved AI, Dead Rising 2 is more forgiving...but some folks do miss that challenge.FINAL VERDICT:Even with all the aforementioned items, I really enjoyed Dead Rising 2. This gets 4 stars from me because I'm masochistic like that. My main goals are hacking up zombies like I've got a hunting license, collecting difficult trophies and playing some short, goofy and blood-soaked online gaming sessions. If you like the same things, then I think you'll get a kick out of Dead Rising 2.Now if you get frustrated with weapons that break (and all of them eventually do), long load times and time-limit missions, you might want to give this game a pass. I'd recommend at least a rental...Once you combine a vacuum cleaner with saw blades and see the damage you can wreak, you might like it enough to buy it.If nothing else, you'll learn how important duct tape will be when the zombie apocalypse arrives.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"drollere","summary":"three key innovations in gaming","reviewText":"L.A. NOIRE starts with the technological and graphic achievements of red dead redemption and the GTA franchise, and aims to add three new elements -- rotoscoped actors, memory puzzles and seamless graphical flow. these elements are not equally successful, but in combination they create a genuinely distinctive game experience.in the past i've complained about the waxy, cadaverous presence of computer animated facial graphics and the silly way computer mouths flap along with recorded voices. in LAN we finally get realistic faces with realistic expressions and skin tones -- because these are rotoscoped actors blended into animated bodies. although this can produce a jarring \"tin man\" effect when the flexible face appears mounted on a computer animated body with boxy movements and cylindrical arms, the rotoscoping of the whole actor is always convincing and welcome. LAN often equals the visual standard of modern cinema, which for many years has combined live actors with digitally rendered environments.the reason for rotoscoping the actors' facial expressions is that LAN revolves around \"social intelligence\" puzzles. there are a few maze puzzles, where you have to remember where you are, and there is the maze of los angeles streets that the player must navigate to get from one location to another (first consulting the game map makes this much easier). but the core of the game is in the investigative interviews, which first require the player to read facial cues that indicate truthfulness or lying, then place these facial cues in an understanding of the physical clues and testimony that indicate context and facts. even liars occasionally tell the truth; but the choice between doubting an answer and challenging it as a lie is often subtle, and requires the player to remember which specific piece of evidence proves that a response is false. (gameplay rewards \"intuition points\", which you can use to find obscure clues or simplify choices in an interview.) across all investigations i only got about 60% of the responses correct -- however i didn't usually consult the investigative notebook, which includes a list and description of all clues, or the transcript, which provides a verbatim record of everything said by every character. (you can also replay all completed cases, to improve your score in the episode, recorded as a 1 to 5 star rating; or you can \"free roam\" the city looking for random crimes to put down.)the sense of involvement created by the \"social\" interactions is enhanced by the careful way that cut scenes are merged with controlled display action. this seems well managed in the early investigative episodes, less so in the later episodes. when it works, the player has the uncanny experience of actually participating in the action rather than suffering an interruption, and this was to me the most interesting and compelling detail of the game play. unfortunately, many cut scenes don't put your car where you parked it by including the car in the cut scene -- a silly and easily avoided mistake.all that said, LAN is visually uneven: some of the crime episodes rise to the level of art in their use of light and color and in the sophisticated way rotoscoped actors are merged with computer environments; other episodes are so crudely programmed and rendered that actors appear to be heads stuck onto robotic mannikins and the lighting and color is straight out of a laura croft episode. across long stretches, the game is visually compelling: the \"black dahlia\" homicide investigations culminate in a dark and rainy environment that beautifully captures the mood of the investigator and his grim task. but in all episodes, the way player controlled figures will \"moonwalk\" when they run into an obstacle, and cannot jump or step over small objects, is consistently annoying. where is the physics engine innovation in rockstar videogames?the usual thumb twitch challenges of combat action games are minimized in LAN: running your car at full speed causes traffic magically to make way at intersections (and earns you a \"leadfoot\" achievement), while driving slowly almost always puts you in a traffic jam; the auto aim always nails the villain, but manual aim is difficult; foot chases are not difficult at all, and most driving chases only require you to pursue from a distance until the culprit crashes his car. the aural environment combines superb sound effects with musical cues. all crime scenes are enveloped in a continuous theme music, which stops playing if you leave the area where all clues are located; when all clues are found the theme music stops with a distinctive rising melody; your responses at interview decisions are keyed as correct or incorrect by contrasting musical signatures; the music evolves from haunting and atmospheric music in early scenes of an episode to more energetic and rhythmic music as the episode reaches its climax. the game played without obvious glitches (the QA seems thorough and accurate), and the script (the human problem in modern media) is very well done. both the episodes and the unifying backstory are intriguing.moonwalking figures aside, the main feature in which LAN appears pathetically behind the times is that it places the credits for the live action actors -- the talent that creates the facial expressions and voice acting on which all the narrative cut scenes and gameplay investigative interviews depend -- below the credits for the texture mappers, QA drones, caterers and public relations flacks. this is merely stupid, and indicates that rockstar graphical innovation only occurs within a conservative media corporate culture.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00BMFIXT2","description":"","reviewerName":"Sally","summary":"I love it! Much better than AC3!","reviewText":"I'm a huge Assassins Creed fan. I have played every single AC game up to this one. My favorite was AC2 and the main reason for that was Ezio's character. He was a great assassin. His character was very strong and focused, yet also very charming to the ladies. Edward Kenway comes very close to Ezio in my opinion. Ezio is still my favorite, but Edward is awesome in his own way with his sarcasm and the way he outsmarts his opponents.As for the gameplay, there are a lot of naval missions in this one. I was worried at first because I hated the naval missions in AC3, but AC4 really added a lot more to them. You have the ability to explore islands between missions. I managed to find a small cave when I was just goofing around one day, sailing around all the islands, and found an optional objective by doing so. You will also fight with other ships and steal their cargo. In another mission you have to hop on your ship and follow another ship without being detected. I could go on and on about the naval missions, but I think you get the idea. It's much better than AC3's naval missions. Let's just say that much.Besides the naval missions there are also the land missions (or whatever you want to call them ... the missions where you are NOT on a ship, but are on your feet instead). These are very fun as well. My favorite ones involve being stealthy as you approach your destination. For instance, you have to reach a certain area, but the area is surrounded by guards. You can either attack all the guards like a crazy person, or you can be sneaky and strike one guard at a time. You do this by hiding in the bushes or tall grass or behind a tree or wall of some sort. You can then whistle to get the guards attention. Just as the guard appraoches, you kill him. As Edward kills, he drags the body into his hiding area so as not to be noticed by the other guards.Overall, I absolutely love this game and I am happy I purchased it. If AC3 was a let down for you like it was for me, then get this game! You will not be disappointed. It is well worth the $60.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2013"}

Basically, you run around for 3 weeks trying to accomplish missions set by the 'Reapers' who then try to kill you, or stop you by sending creatures called 'Noise' after you. Basically, you complete the missions, fight the Reapers, and beat the game.That's the short version of it. However, there's more to it than just that. You level up in this game, but it only levels up your HP. To level up your attack, defense, bravery, etc, you eat food. However you can only eat 24 \"bytes\" a day, though the last 6 always stay open, so you can eat foods that only take 6 bytes as much as you want, until you beat the game and get a sticker that lets you eat all the food you want. You can decrease your HP by 50 (which is how much one level gives you) down to the HP you'd have at level 1, to increase your drop rate, which is unique.Another unique system are the pins that you use to fight with. That's right. Pins. Who needs keyblades or buster swords when you can just use these magical pins that either emit lightning, fire, pick up obstacles and throw them at enemies, and whatnot. Also, there's over 300 of these things to master, and 3 different ways to get PP for your pins (PP is the EXP for them). The game keeps track of how many pins you master, so it's a neat way to get you to beat the game to the fullest.After you beat the game, you can replay any day of the 3 weeks, which is neat so you can play the game like you're new at it (except you'll be overpowered most likely, lol). Even after fighting the final boss you still have to unlock anything you missed in your Noise log and whatnot, and it just supplies you with even more hours of gameplay, and for only $20!In the battles you control you and your partner, you with the stylus, and your partner with the directional pad (or the ABXY buttons if you're a lefty like I am). It sounds complicated, but trust me it's not. However you can choose to set your partner on autoplay so you don't have to worry about him or her.All in all, this is a very unique RPG. If you have the $20 and are looking for several hours of gameplay/simple challenge, buy TWEWY. You won't regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2011"}

You get three games in one, and they combined them to fit together with each other.  There is a noticeable difference in the levels that come from the first, second, and third games but nothing that hurts the game.It has lots of features, lots of unlockables, so it gives you tons of playing time.The things we don't like about it is you can only save at the end of a level, and it still has it's fair share of bugs.  Obviously they did very little actual testing of the game when they made it because some of the bugs are just stupid, like selecting a certain menu item at the wrong time, or lots of clipping issues.Still, the bugs are minor enough that the game is still fun, and if you like co-op platform games, get this one!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2013"}

I enjoy the Call of Duty franchise, and I was looking forward to this release. I was hoping for a good story after I believed that COD 4 was a little soft in this department. The story this time around was a lot better. There are a lot of exciting moments with gut wrenching twists. The campaign is a little short though taking about 5 and a half hours to complete. I was disappointed in the length. The online is about the same as COD 4 with some new weapons and upgrades, though it felt like I had done all this before. The spec ops is a type of co op that is used in the game. They are just sections of the campaign taken out and you can either do it by yourself or with a friend. Infinity Ward got really lazy here, why can't the whole campaign be co op?Presentation- There is not a lot to talk about. There are standard menus with some nicely done music. Again Infinity Ward why no cut scenes. We have consoles that can handle them, look at Uncharted or Metal Gear. Why must you continually ignore this facet of video games. 4.5/5Graphics- The graphics in this game are great for a 1st person shooter. They jump off the screen with nice quality. I'll go as far as to say there the best graphics in a game that isn't Uncharted 2. The blood especially has some amazing detail, overall a nice advancement over its predecessors. 5/5Game play- This game has the same controls of every COD game which is nice, but I would like to have a cover system. Also when you get shot blood shoots all over your screen and it blinds you sometimes which is annoying. The enemies sometimes surviving and running or crawling away is pretty cool. 4.5/5Story/Campaign- The campaign is very well done and quite enjoyable. The story of an invasion is a well done one. The switching between characters is smooth and very distinguishable unlike the other COD games. The twists and turns are well placed and are rather jaw dropping. The campaign is short though lasting just over five hours. There are a lot of places that extra levels could be added if only Infinity Ward had the time to work on the campaign instead of spending so much time on the online. The lack of cut scenes hurt the feel of the game a bit.  Overall a nice campaign but rather short, and Infinity Ward you can make it longer next time. 4.5/5Fun Factor- The campaign was a blast to blow thorough even though I beat it in one sitting, an overall nice voyage and a lot of fun to play. 5/5Lasting Appeal- This game does not have the multiplayer like COD 4 did. This version of online is dull and uninteresting. It defiantly won't have as much play time as either of its next gen counterparts. The campaign is good but short, the Spec Ops is a joke, and there is little chance I'll be popping it in anytime soon. 3/5The Verdict- This game is a nice adventure. If you are buying it for the online be warned it's just more of the same. The campaign is nice but short. If your buying it for the single player just rent it. The game is well done even though it's short. Short and sweet is not a motto that video game companies should follow, but Infinity Ward seems to be living by it.

{"product_name":"B005THAX5Q","description":"","reviewerName":"D. Allen","summary":"Fairly horrible experience but somethings are good","reviewText":"Before beginning to review this, I'd like to point out that I recall playing through a variety of versions of various Alien franchise games. From AvP on the Jaguar, all the way up to the horrible psx version of Alien Trilogy. All of them were fairly horrible with the exception of maybe the arcade beat-em-up edition of Aliens.With that said, I wasn't very excited about Aliens Colonial Marines. I knew it was going to be horrible, however, me being a huge Alien fan, I had to get it. All I can say is that I wasn't nearly as surprised as other folks. There are many things I liked about the game but I will say that what kept me from enjoying it would have been the fact that the game felt unpolished. Or a better description would be that it felt unfinished. I think with a bit of refinement this could have been really good. The game felt like it was done but all the developers had to do was put in a bit of refinement.The game is really hard to write in a good solid review. So with that said, I think I'll blurt out some random points about what I liked or didn't.Disliked:* The word \"Marines\" is excessively overused. Right from the get go, the word \"Marines\" is used literally in every sentence. And it isn't like a casual \"marines\" mentioning like a proud marine, but they emphasize it to go \"MA\", slight pause, \"RINES.\"* Clipping issues with the world. Some exciting parts of the game are ruined due to what I think are clipping issues. For example, one part I recall you're walking in and you're tracking these Aliens and suddenly, one goes underneath the ground and all you see running after you is a tail stuck out the ground. You can't kill it because it's underground, yet it can kill you.* Hitboxes appear \"off.\" Especially distance shots do not appear to work very well. Also, when someone is hiding, even if their heads are exposed, it doesn't appear to register the shot very well. There are times where you can unload an entire magazine of pulse rifle on something standing next to you and nothing will happen.* You level up to gain weapons. The game has a way to gain new weapons through leveling. It's very similar to perhaps Call of Duty. None of the upgrades are actually useful and all of the weapons appear rather horrible compared to the bread and butter M41A Pulse Rifle, Shotgun, and whatever handgun.* Explosion effects are not really that useful. Again this goes with the hitbox issue but it appears using the grenade is not very useful.* AI is horrible. The alien AI is horrible but also your teammate AI is horrible. Your teammate could literally be standing next to an enemy and nothing will happen. The aliens appear to only attack you and not your teammates. So your teammates could be rushing in or walking casually around the room and absolutely nothing will happen to him. You would think developers would have this right considering that all the Aliens did in the movie was continuously come after the main characters and you just blast them.* The graphics in the demo is vastly better than the graphics in this game. While it appears the gameworld is complete, the small effects like broken windows, smoke, etc do not appear in the final version. The demo however appeared to have much better effects. What I understand is that Gearbox hired many developers to finish the game and with that in mind, I think someplace the better version just didn't get complete and they just shipped it out with an older build of the game.* Story is horrendous. The game takes place after the events of the Alien trilogy so that means Ripley is dead, and the last of the alien species are dead. However, this game make no sense. At the start, we see the Sulaco is still at LV426. Hicks is somehow alive too. He sent a distress call and that's where the game takes place. At the start of the game, a main character indicate that the Sulaco was over Fury 161 yet the explanation of this is later revealed in the game and it's extremely poor. There are literally thousands of alien walking around yet no explanation on how they came about. LV426 blew up yet it remained in this game as well.* The quality of the cut scene is vastly different than in game graphics. What I mean is when I first seen a cutscene, it appears like characters had dirt and cuts on them. Then in game, everyone is clean and fine. The graphics appear to load rather late in that at first the world appears very muddy then suddenly somewhat good. Still very unpolished though.* Aliens don't explode or react like they do in the movie. The acid do no appear to do anything and when hit or struck, don't \"explode\" like they did in the movie.* The Tracker is absolutely horrible. The tracker is what I was most excited about in this game. As you recall, other aliens game had the tracker on the screen overlay but this one you get a separate tracking device that you can pull out like in the movies. However it fails miserably and I don't even know how they could get this wrong. It's more of an objective locator and finding hidden things like legendary weapons and name tags. Otherwise, what appears to happen is that while there are enemies, a tacker icon will appear on the screen. This means there are enemies and if you pull the tracker out you can get a location. Now with the tracker, there might be blips on the screen but again I think the main thing is that you have to trigger an event in order to see the enemy. For example, there are parts in the game where you pull the tracker out, see that there's a blip behind a door so you get ready, door opens, blip shows it right in front but the alien doesn't appear until you entered. Essentially the tracker is useless and it most certainly didn't felt like the movie where you got this tracker and you're trying to find out what's coming at you. It didn't felt scary at all. The tacker wasn't even graphically similar to that of the movie. In the movie, each blip was fuzzy ball. In this game, the blips appear as a sharp round object. It didn't felt like the movies at all.Likes:* The world is very well imitated to the Aliens film. I felt that the world was really well built but again it's about the small refinements that I don't think they ever got around to.* Guns and gun sounds are very well designed. Again they got it right down to the movie. I never tested out any other weapon as I stuck with the pulse rifle, shotgun, and pistol. I felt they were good enough just the way it is. However, being that you can customize it with things like a silencer, I felt it gotten a tad bit silly and again not well used.* You can find Legendary Weapons and Dog tags. The game really plays well into the nostalgic elements of the films. Dog tags are nametags that you can find that has the name of a person from the film and quotes. The quotes are sometimes good. Now the legendary weapons are really fun. You get various weapons that are used by characters in the film. From Vasquez pistol and smartgun to Hick's famous shotgun. Very fun to find. Sadly some of the weapons cannot be carried throughout the game like Vasquez smart gun or Drake's flame thrower. Other like Hick's rifle appear to use completely different ammunition from the normal weapons you find even though they might be the same type.* There is a Prometheus reference in the game. Well it's no big deal anyways, but near the end there's a neat reference for those who seen the movie and understand some times about the original Alien derelict ship.That's about all I can really think of. Again I felt that if they stamped out the bugs, and polished it up a bit, this game could have been really, really good. It had everything going for it: a good fan base, some exciting level designs, but it all fell short because they just didn't polish it up before releasing. Plus the demo version appeared to be REALLY good while the final build is horrible.Overall get this purely for nostalgic reasons. But otherwise don't expect a top of the line game that you can carry on for years and years.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00007KQC4","description":"Resident Evil 2 FOR GAMECUBE","reviewerName":"Scottypiper \"Scottypiper\"","summary":"Still a great game after all these years","reviewText":"For starters, I have played and still own every major Resident Evil game in the series including 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and Code Veronica, all of them being on the GameCube except RE5. One of the best video game series of all times. This game was originally released for the PS in 1998. The game was later re-released to include use of the dual-shock controller. That version was then ported to the GameCube in 2003. Though the game is in desperate need of a remake like Resident Evil received on the GameCube, it still holds up for those who remember the original release.Story: Set months after the events of RE, the T-virus has reached Raccoon City and residents are being transformed into Zombies. The city is shut down and escape routes have been blocked off. You play as Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie cop who arrives in Raccoon City shortly after the outbreak started or Claire Redfield, Chris's sister who is looking for him. Once you find out Chris has left Raccoon City, and headed for Umbrella's headquarters in Europe, you both look for a way out of the city. Chris is helped by a mysterious Ada Wong, who says her boyfriend was a researcher named John who worked in the mansion lab while Claire is helped by a small girl named Sherry, who turns out to be William Burkin's daughter.Gameplay: Survivor Horror, Single-player. The gameplay elements are not much different from Resident Evil. You fight mutant zombies and creatures, while solving puzzles to advance the plot and reach your goal. You have the same type of weapons from RE such as hand guns, shotguns, grenade launchers, knives, with the addition of percentage based ammo weapons like the Flame Thrower, Spark Shot and Machine Gun, and other new weapons like the Crossbow, and stronger versions of the Hand Guns and Magnums. The puzzles in the game are not very difficult if you have played any RE game but they still add some challenge to the game. Some of the enemies in the game include zombies, cerebrus (dogs), Lickers, plants, giant spiders, moths and a huge Alligator. While gameplay is fairly short (around 3 hours), you can play a 2nd walkthrough of the game with the other main character and get an alternate ending and gameplay will be affected by results of the first walkthrough. Some elements affected include all percentage based ammo weapons that you used won't be available and if you didn't kill the Alligator, you will have to on the 2nd walkthrough.Conclusion: While the controls, graphics, and sound are bit outdated, this is just a direct port of the original game. Voice acting is weak, but better than the original release of RE. If you are looking to complete your collection of the RE series, this game is a must. Hopefully it will get remade in the years to come along with RE3 but who knows. It is still worth owning if you still have a GameCube or it will play on the Wii with a GameCube controller and memory card. I still rate this game as 9 out of 10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J5FG","description":"","reviewerName":"Matt","summary":"Poorly designed Art","reviewText":"I played both of these games back when they first came out on the PS2 and remember kinda enjoying them. Given all the effulgent gushing and kiss-blowing from so many other reviewers on various websites, I felt like I probably enjoyed both games more than I had remembered, and ended up buying this \"remastered\" collection. Turns out, I guess I had it backward, as both ICO and SOC ended up being very frustrating game experiences for me, each in their own ways.ICOThere exists a small group of dedicated and vocal gamers who seem to really like the concept of videogames as art. While I don't have a problem with the fundamental idea (I loved Okami), I do have a major problem with development studios who hide poor game and programming design behind artsy camera angles and atmosphere, and try to pass it off as a videogame masterpiece. After having played through ICO (and also SOC) my opinion of Team ICO is that they are obviously very interested in creating art, but lack the technical knowlege required to craft a playable video game around it, and ultimately would be better off shooting an independent film or painting a series of pictures and then staring at them pensively.Did I like anything about ICO? Yeah, I like the environmental puzzles, where the goal is always to figure out how to open a door or reach a certain ledge, and most of the solutions are logical (as environmental puzzles should be). That's about it though, as just about everything else in the game frustrated me almost to the point of quitting early (I didn't though, as I wanted to unlock all the trophies).The things that crippled the game experience for me were the controls, the camera, the friendly AI, and the horribly boring and repetitive fights. The controls lack responsiveness and feel sluggish. Grabbing a hold of ladders or dangling chains is often far more difficult than it needs to be, and if a torch and switch are next to each other, it's not unusual to see your character grab the one you don't intend for him to grab. Repeatedly. The controls are also constantly locked in mortal combat with the semi-fixed camera angles. What this means is since your character moves in direct relation to the direction you're pushing, if you're holding right and running down the hallway and the camera decides to swing more to the right to face you, you'll end up running into the wall since the wall is now directly to your right and that's still the direction you're pushing. It's lazy programming, and most other third person game developers have figured out how to deal with this irritation. The camera also has the annoying habit of swivelling around to face your character as he's moving, so that you can't see what's coming up without using the right analog stick to move the entire camera frame to the right (the only real camera control the game allows the player), leaving your character out of the picture, and providing a terribly disorienting angle on the gameplay. It's just bad design, and no other game that I can think of has this set-up.The friendly AI is an abject failure of videogame programming. What more can be said? Yorda has serious issues with following commands, and it's all too common to see her struggle with climbing onto ladders or even continuing to climb up ladders without inexplicably reversing tack and climbing back down. She can't drop down a 4 foot ledge in one room, but she can drop down a different 4 food ledge in another room. And God forbid you get in a hurry, as Yorda has the nasty habit of strolling along when you need her to run quickly (like in battles). The whole thing is incredibly irritating and makes it feel like your main goal of the entire game is to babysit a slow child... which I guess it pretty much is.Battles are boring and one dimensional and involve wailing on wave after wave of shadow creature with your trusty 2x4 or sword. Some battles can be avoided, fortunately, but avoidance frequently leads you into an even greater battle as the controls and camera once again tagteam your escape efforts. Honestly, the battles should've just been removed. They add nothing to the game and only detract from it.Can't comment on the music since there really isn't any. If you get a hard-on listening to endless feet clacking on stone, or wind rustling, or the odd phrase \"bon swah\" repeated over and over and OVER AGAIN, then you're in luck.I can't help but feel like this game would be better served as a downloadable title for like $10 max.SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUSI spent more text than I thought I would describing ICO, so I'll keep the SOC part briefer. Overall, it's a better game than ICO, but it has its very own set of design flaws which seriously maimed a game experience that should otherwise be amazing. There is little doubt that Team ICO made this game, given their efforts with ICO.You have full camera control this time around, but it's not what I thought it'd be. Most third person games provide the player with limited camera control in which the game keeps the camera behind your character and moves accordingly as you move your character, but still allows you to move the camera yourself if necessary. In SOC, there is no automatic camera control by the game. What this means is that if you're doing more than moving in a straight line, you're going to have to have one thumb on the right analog stick moving it AT ALL TIMES. Take a break for a second, and you'll find your character moving to the side of the screen or facing you, providing you with absolutely no warning of what's coming up. Pull out your bow while running toward the screen (toward you) and your character aims/shoots at you instead of the colossus in the background (which is indescribably backward compared to other games in which your character usually immediately faces the enemy). Controlling the horse while using the camera is also bizarrely overcomplicated and has you doing thumb aerobics switching back and forth between the X button for \"speed up horse\" and the right thumb stick for camera control. The control/camera set-up is poorly thought out and should have been simplified.... especially for a game that prides itself on its relaxed atmosphere.The controls (like ICO) are sluggish and don't feel very responsive. Button presses while climbing/battling a colossus are treated by the game as less of a distinct command and as more of a polite request.... a request that is often blatantly ignored. While some of the time it's the game simply not responding to input by the player, oftentimes it's because your character is too busy flopping around on the colossus like a edematous skin tag to pay attention to anything you're asking him to do. \"Please jump from the colossus's arm to his back.\" \"Sorry can't do that, as he's breathing heavily right now, and for some reason I can't stop seizing like an epileptic when the colossus is doing anything other than standing completely still.\" Where this becomes really stupid is when a colossus gets stuck in an endless loop of shaking, essentially rendering you immobile (yet floppy) until your grip runs out, and you fall to the ground, only to begin the climbing process yet again. Considering that the vast bulk of the SOC game experience revolves around this kind of stuff, I quickly found myself getting frustrated, bored, and not having fun. And videogame are supposed to be fun, right? If you don't believe this, you're playing them for the wrong reason.I'll stop there, as this is getting too long already. What makes SOC game so annoying is not the individual design problems in isolation, it's how they conspire against you all at once, and throughout the entire game. Seriously, if the controls and camera were improved, intuitive, and responsive, then I would've rated this game much higher. Both games, in fact. But just a few design flaws can ruin a game if they're frustrating enough. Life's too busy to waste this kind of time on poor/lazy game design.**The music is incredible, by the way, and is some of the best I've experienced in the medium.

{"product_name":"B003ZCH7DI","description":"","reviewerName":"NeuroSplicer","summary":"EPIC CUTENESS!","reviewText":"This is one of those games that are usually bought for the kids but ends up being enjoyed more by their parents. Kirby is back and seems to have had a complete makeover. And this time around, he simply refuses to stay in the shadow of the other Nintendo characters.The game design is unique, fresh and beautiful, not to mention adorable. Kirby is enchanted out of his usual abilities and is trapped in a world made of fabrics. The design, however, is not just eye-candy, it plays an integral part in the gameplay which is equally imaginative and surprising.It is as if the gameworld is made up from cloth, loose threads and your grandmother's yarn basket. The colorful items that make up the characters and the backgrounds will bring back memories of preschool naivete but they also serve numerous in-game functions and transformations such as weapons, levers, surf-boards, wings...The game is a creativity bomb that went off in a seamstress' shop.The sounds add greatly to the overall experience. The background music is soothing like a familiar lullaby whereas the action sounds will bring back the echo of the laughs we had during our own Saturday morning cartoon marathons.KIRBY'S EPIC YARN is a side-scrolling platformer in the classic sense (move forward, collect items, reach the boss and beat him) but I promise you it will not feel like any game you have played so far. The levels have been designed with endless imagination and a lot of care.My only complain is that the game is a bit short. Adults may find it a bit easy as well (Kirby cannot die, taking a hit means he looses some of the collected beads); however, it is not that easy to complete having found and collected every item, making it a game one would want to replay again and again.As a bonus, with a second controller, two people can join in and play cooperatively, greatly increasing the fun but also the challenge to complete the game.Be warned: you bring Kirby home, get ready to wrestle your young ones for the controller.RECOMMENDED!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2011"}

Well, it does have some fairly organized non-combat gameplay mechanics including a built-in computerized buying and selling system that acts like EBAY for custom crafters. I also got a kick out of the ability to purchase harvesters which dig up incredible amounts of resources on all planets while your character levels up somewhere else.  I enjoyed tinkering around with some of SWG's non-combat options but that was really the only thing I found to do in the game.  At the time I played, there wasn't a single Jedi in the game but I hear that people are finally discovering (after almost a year of play!) how to become one.  I also hear that in the future, the game might add space combat and land vehicles which were a critical omission from the original game which leads me to my number one complaint, how can you create an MMORPG about Star Wars and leave out space?  That's like creating a Dungeons &amp; Dragons MMORPG and leaving out magic. I'd like to spend more time telling you some of the pros and cons of this game but it bored me to death after two weeks of play.  And this is coming from someone that spent months on previous MMORPG classics. It doesn't offer the MMORPG gamer anything they haven't seen before and it probably has one of the most boring hack and slash leveling systems of all the MMORPG titles.  SWG still has a strong fan base and I'd recommend that Star Wars fans, diehard MMORPG fans (you know who you are), and MMORPG newbies give it the old college try but everyone else should save their money.  This game might be fantastic after three or four expansions which you know are coming considering it has the same developer that worked on Everquest, but it doesn't bring anything new to the quickly diminishing MMORPG genre which is imploding from its own repetitiveness.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2004"}

They chose.... Bioshock 2!And so did I. I have played the first one and was a HUGE fan of it. I was afraid of Bioshock 2 (not just because of the little sisters *shudder*), but because it's a sequel and sequels are sometime bad. But, not this one. Bioshock 2 brings an entire new gameplay while still keeping the good old feel of Rapture.If you haven't played the first one, I would still highly suggest this game. It is a great FPS and is very unique.Playing as a Big Daddy is very fun. You might think you'll be over powered as a Big Daddy, but get ready for about twice as many splicers as the first Bioshock. You still have the challenge.The story is very well put together as well. It makes sense as you are the Big Daddy Prototype and therefor still have a conscience, as genetic brain alteration has not been developed yet.You can also now dual wield weapons and plasmids and fire both at the same time. The drill is extremely powerful at close range, but make sure you keep enough fuel on hand.The new multiplayer is well put together and even has a little story line to it (which is the first I've seen for multiplayer). Your not just running around killing people for no reason. Your \"testing\" the new \"home security devices\" for Sinclair.You play as a splicer and you can choose from a few different looks. You also can unlock new masks for doing things like: beating the game, ranking up, etc. And you also have the chance of becoming a Big Daddy if you can find a suit. You can not duel wield weapons and plasmids in multiplayer.The ranking system works very good and lets you new weapons and plasmids as you upgrade. Don't worry though, they're not really \"better\" they're just \"different\". So new people don't have to be afraid of being destroyed by the higher ranks.

When you start the game, you choose either to play the role of a boy or girl, and depending on your choices, the hero will grow up to be tall or short, good or evil. Players can get married and have children; female player characters will become pregnant, which will then be reflected by their physical appearance.Early in the game, players are presented with a stray dog for a best friend, who will need to be fed and loved, and will accompany the player throughout his or her life. Depending on the player, the dog will change appearance and assist him or her in various ways, such as alerting of impending dangers and attacking enemies.Players inhabit the world of Albion and are free to roam the land to as they please. Players can use different expressions to communicate with others, such as taunting and laughing, and even belching or farting.As the players grow, so does Albion, reflecting the choices that were made earlier in the game. Every house, hut, castle, and dungeon can be purchased if the player wishes. Players can buy up all the land in a town and can become mayor, king, and even emperor of the entire land.Fable 2 presents a dynamic and free-roaming world that doesn't demand a player to take any one set path. At the same time, players seeking a plot line will find an epic story and quest that they can follow if they wish, along with many side adventures.Fight Using Different Weapons and MagicFable 2 introduces a new combat system that allows for mastery of hand weapons, such as swords, long range weapons such as cross-bows and guns, and, of course, magic. Players improve at each discipline with time, and can combine different combat styles when they fight. Other advanced design features include tactical positional advantages that can bring new strategic elements into combat.Bring Other Players into Your WorldFable 2 has a multiplayer mode that allows you to bring other players into your own world. Consistent with the rest of the game, the actions of these other players can be permanent and affect your world.

And this is such a shame because I enjoyed the first Fable immensely, enough to rate it a perfect 5 stars.Without a doubt, the single biggest problem in this game is the lagging and framerate stuttering. I didn't think a game in this day and age on the 360 would ever have such terrible performance. This would be somewhat tolerable if it affected only a small portion of the game, but sadly it is EVERYWHERE. Whether I'm pausing/unpausing the game, starting/leaving a job, talking to a store owner, scrolling through a list of items, etc, there's hiccups and stutters galore. You'd think with all the processing power of the 360 at its disposal, the game would be able to load up a small, miniscule item in an inventory list without hiccups. Things really take a turn when I'm dyeing or changing my clothes; I'm talking delays of up to ten seconds whenever I scroll up or down even once on the list. This is all the more inexcusable considering that Fable 1 never had any lagging issues whatsoever.Another thing I can't wrap my head around is the floaty, loose, imprecise controls. It's actually a step BACKWARD compared to Fable 1: the controls felt tight and sharp, but here it's like trying to steer a freakin' boat. There's also a slight delay from the moment I push the left stick to the moment the hero actually moves. Is there some reason why the controls shouldn't be as tight and responsive as, say, Saints Row 2 or Fallout 3? The controls become incredibly annoying when I want to focus on a specific person or object in the environment and I have to wrestle with the controls several times before I can get the hero to face exactly the right way. Simply moving my hero around and looking at things should be mindless and obvious, so much so that, really, I shouldn't even have to devote brain cells thinking about it. It is one of the most basic mechanics of a game, and shouldn't become a constant chore in itself.Lionhead also made some curious design choices that make me scratch my head. For instance, why am I allowed only one save slot? Are they kidding me? Even back in the NES era, games like Zelda allowed more slots. Again, this is a step back from Fable 1, where I was allowed -- if I remember correctly -- three save files, and within each file were 5 slots, for a total of up to FIFTEEN saves. Why the cutback?Another head scratcher concerns how civilians react when I pull out a weapon in their midst. If I pull out a weapon in front of a crowd for no reason, I lose points with the civilians; that makes sense. What does NOT make sense is that when I pull out a weapon for a good cause, i.e. to kill bandits that appear in the distance, I STILL lose points. Don't these people realize I just HELPED them? What, Lionhead couldn't be bothered to program the civilian A.I. to be able to recognize the difference? This annoys me.Looking past these issues, what I've seen of the game so far is decent and serviceable: the main story is okay but not great, the graphics are good (although eye candy by itself is never enough to hold my interest), the music is well-done, and there's a good variety of stuff to do, not only in the form of side quests but also minor activities. I've really stuck with the game and tried to get to its heart, but I hate that all too often, playing this game ends up feeling not like entertainment but like work due to its technical issues and bad design choices. I've just about run out of patience. This is truly a shame, because I had such high hopes.[edit] And what's up with the map? Useless! It's so tiny that you can never figure out where everything is.  And it's not even interactive; it's just a static picture.  A far cry from the likes of Saints Row 2 and Oblivion.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2008"}

With advanced high-definition graphics, detailed character animations, and explosive on-screen action, Call of Duty 3 delivers the most immersive and cinematically intense war experience to date.","reviewerName":"F0X H0UND","summary":"The best COD yet","reviewText":"Call of Duty 3 pits you as 3 different characters whose names escape me at the moment, but you play as American, Canadian, British, and Polish forces during 1944's Normandy Breakout campaign. The idea behind the operation was to get the Germans out of Paris & France all together.If you have played Call of Duty 2, then you should know what to expect. You run around in first person view, firing a wide range of Allied & Axis weapons which include Trenchguns, MP44s & MP40s, M1 Garands, and so on. You can throw both frag & smoke grenades, so that is cool. Additionally, you can now drive vehicles such as motorcycles, jeeps, and tanks which was wicked cool. Another new addition is these little fist fights that you get into every once in awhile with the German soldiers where you have to tap right & left triggers to out muscle the German and then you two go at it. It adds some interaction into it, and keeps you on the edge of your seat to see what will happen during the fight. Oh, and one more thing (lol), now when you have to plant explosives or anything you have to actually assemble the C4 or actually DO the action (such as placing the pin and turning it or using a crowbar to tear down a boarded door). Very nifty.In my opinion, the multiplayer in this game easily outdoes COD and COD2. First off it runs much smoother with less glitches and lags. Secondly, the weapon balance is pretty even with the exception of the lame Trenchgun. Finally, you can now choose classes such as Medic or Sniper, each with their own special abilities (like reviving dead teammates, giving out ammo, or calling in airstrikes) and set kits of weapons. I love the multiplayer.The graphics are a decent step up. All the characters look real, and move fluidly as well. The enviroments look fantastic; they look truley wartorn. The weather engine makes everything just feel so unique and realistic. The only downfall is the fact that it feels recycled by about the 5th chapter - theres only so many times you can see blown up buildings or vast forests, you get me?So what makes this game fall from a 10? Well, for starters I would have liked to be able to interactivley fight the Germans more often. I found that aspect of the game pretty fun, but the fact that it comes up about 4 times in the whole game is a let down. Secondly, one thing about the multiplayer enrages me: sometiems you will be behind perfect cover, and somehow an enemies' bullet will still kill you. Finally, for some reason in single player the MP40, when it is in enemy hands, shoots so rapid that it can be easily mistaken for an MG42 - which means after about 5 hits your going to die. Very annoying....very...very annoying.All the aspects of sound in this game are perfect. The score of music, the sound effects, the guns, the voice acting... all beautifully realistic, believeable and just sound, well, good.The ending of this game was pretty interesting. It ends with the Americans (which I notice is a thing in all the Call of Duty games). Your first Sarge named McCullins hated this dude named Guzzo, and when McCullins dies tells Guzzo to go to hell. Dixxon, another member of your platoon, becomes your new Sarge. He is the one who leads your squad through the remains of the game all the way up to when he gets shot. Guzzo becomes the new Sarge and you guys finish up the Normandy Breakout. A few days later your character is on a truck with a bunch of other guys and Guzzo climbs aboard and says, \"Rule Number 1) Your no use to me dead.\", which is what McCullins said in the beginning of the game. Then a Private asks what kind of pep talk that was (which is what Guzzo said in the beginning), and Huxley (a member of your original squad) says, \"If you want a pep talk, read a poem.\" (which is what Dixxon said in response to Guzzo in the beginning.) Its all deja vu, but it was interesting nonetheless.Overall, Call of Duty 3 delivers the fast paced, heart pounding action that we have come to know and love in the series, as well as the touching stories surrounding each character. A lengthy campaign thats really fun & challenging, added with a near perfect FPS multiplayer, is more than enough of a reason to buy C.O.D 3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2007"}

I remember Wrestlemania for NES.  You could pick one of 6 WWF superstars and do punches, kicks, a back punch, an eye poke, a head butt, and a running drop kick (if you were really lucky you could do a top rope move, a cartwheel, or a bodyslam).  That was pretty much the whole game summed up.When I play this Smackdown game though, I feel like I'm watching TV.  That's how great the graphics and camera work are, especially for singles matches.  Some of the wrestlers look EXACTLY like their WWE superstar counterparts.  Beautiful, beautiful graphics.  Even better, the Hurricane walks like the Hurricane.  HHH wrestles like HHH.  Classic Undertaker wrestles like Classic Undertaker and Biker Undertaker wrestles like Biker Undertaker.  Booker T's knee drop and Flair's knee drop aren't the same.  Booker T's knee drop looks like a Booker T knee drop and Flair's knee drop looks like a Flair knee drop.  The detail of the moves is just as sharp and impressive as the detail of the graphics.  I can't imagine getting much closer to reality in a wrestling match than this.Still, even this amazing game isn't perfect.  There's a cell match which is awesome, and an elimination chamber match which is awesome, but the steel cage match is actually inferior to the Wrestlemania 2000 N64 steel cage match for some reason.  Also I like the N64 game reversal system a bit better.  In this game I can't reverse much more than a few grapples and german suplexes.  No turning DDT attempts into Northern Lights Suplexes, or hurricanranas into powerbombs, and if so I see it very rarely.  Also there are so many moves I forget which buttons do which moves sometimes.  Still, most of the moves are fairly simple, involving two simple steps, and although a bit more complicated than in the N64 games the grapple system is actually a pretty good system and allows for what might be four times as many moves per character.  Wow.The season mode is pretty fun.  Once you get the title you can lose all the non-title matches you want and still get to keep the belt.  Unfortunately, if you play the season more than once, it will repeat the same storylines quite a bit, especially if you choose the same options you chose in the previous season.Even on exhibition matches in easy mode, this game can be somewhat challenging.  When I was put in a handicap match against Kurt Angle and Kane there was no way I could win.There are a few clipping bugs that we all know and love in this game, but you don't see them much unless you're trying to do something really crazy with a table.  Speaking of which, I love how you can set the tables up in corners, and catapult your opponents through them.Whatever flaws the game has will be forgotten instantly when you easily land a beautiful 5-star frog splash.  My gosh, I love the progress wrestling video games have made.The crazy thing is that this game is actually an old one.  Smackdown vs. RAW 2006 must be beyond phenomenal.  While everyone's spending big bucks on that one, if you're short on cash, get this Smackdown game.  It's awesome, and a cheaper price makes it even sweeter.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2006"}

When he returns and questions what has gotten into a King, the King strips him of his duty and orders him to deliver a ring to the town of Mist.

His journey will lead him not only to do what's right, but to eventually save the world.The story is told through on screen text that's been redone to give the game a better feel as well as some dramatic cutscenes.  There are even moments of voice acting in some of the games more dramatic moments.  The voice acting and fantastic cutscenes help to flesh out the characters, who remain some of the most memorable in the series.Battling is one of the best parts of Final Fantasy IV.  It uses the ATB battle system, which means that the flow of battle is fast paced.  Every character has an ATB gauge that must fill up before they can take an action.  Every character also has unique standalone abilities to help you out.  Tellah can use his \"Recall\" to cast spells he's forgotten, Rosa can pray and heal allies, Rydia can summon beasts.  There are a ton of characters who join you, each with their own unique ability.  However, when characters depart (as several will come and go throughout the story) they'll leave behind Augments to teach characters their abilities.  Unfortunately you can only teach it once.  Once a character learns it, they can't forget it or teach it to another character.  Augments are more than just abilities departing characters used.  There are also augments for standalone abilities like Auto-Potion and Counter.  It's a good system that really forces the player to consider strategy.  And you'll need to keep your wits about you, as Final Fantasy IV is a very hard game.Final Fantasy IV has often been said to be one of the hardest RPGs ever made.  Apparently Square-Enix took pride in that, as Final Fantasy IV DS is even harder than the original game.  There's a strong need for strategy throughout Final Fantasy IV.  The bosses in particular are brutal.  Even those who mastered Final Fantasy IV time and time again will find this game to be very challenging.  If you began with later installments (in particular, the Playstation games), Final Fantasy IV is a rude awakening.When not battling, you'll be trumping through dungeons.  The bottom screen of the DS displays a map of the dungeon.  Uncover all of it and you'll get a reward.  Usually an item that can be used.  Final Fantasy IV also allows you to roam around using the stylus, but it feels like an after thought.There's a lot of new stuff in Final Fantasy IV.  The game has new secrets, new sidequests and new optional bosses for the gamer to tackle.  It also has a new unique summon for Rydia called Whyt.  Whyt, when summoned, basically takes Rydia's place in battle and uses the abilities learned by all the characters in your party.  You can't control Whyt, however.  You can raise Whyt's stats by participating in a series of mini-games, most of which are simple, but they're also not a whole lot of fun.  It's necessary to bring out the best in Whyt, however.  One neat thing about Whyt, however, is that if you power him up enough, you can go and battle friends online and see who has the stronger one.Visually, Final Fantasy IV is easily one of the best looking games on the DS.  The towns and environments all have the same layout as the original game, but they all look better than ever.  The monsters in battle are equally impressive as are the games many cinematic moments.  Some of the game looks a little pixelated in some spots, but it doesn't separate from the fact that its amazing looking.  Final Fantasy IV DS is a visual masterpiece.  If there was anything about the graphics to gripe about, it would be that the character models look a little too cute.  This is especially strange when one considers the dark story and mature themes that Final Fantasy IV tackles.  Regardless, it's still a beautiful game.In addition to that, much of the music is reworked and sounds better than ever.  Most of the voice acting is quite good.  The voices themselves really fit for the characters.  There are some instances where the voice work isn't as good as it could be, but it's still very memorable.Final Fantasy IV DS is how an old school Final Fantasy should be done.  It's old school charm comes out a lot (particularly in the difficulty), but at least Final Fantasy IV gets more than just a facelift.  With new quests, story sequences, an ability system and a refined script, Final Fantasy IV is worth picking up even if you played the original to death.  This is how Final Fantasy IV was meant to be played.  If you haven't played Final Fantasy IV, this is a good version to pick up.  If you have, it's worth reliving again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2008"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E7DI","description":"","reviewerName":"M.D.C. \"Tempting Reviews\"","summary":"Layton redeems himself.","reviewText":"I know a few others consider this to be a step down from previous games, in my mind it fixed a lot of things and broke a few others.Unwound Future picks up whereProfessor Layton and the Diabolical Boxleft off, mostly.  This time, you are witness to what appears to be the invention of a decade...a real life time machine.  A catastrophe occurs, and the mayor and the scientist disappear.  You receive a letter from \"Luke\", but stating that it's from the future, and that Layton's help is needed to put things right.  You are guided to a clock shop, and your adventure begins.I have to admit, the story didn't really grab me this time around, at least not initially.  Near the end it started to pick up and things really got interesting, but I will give the game credit for its presentation.  There are little details that went into the story that make it somewhat interesting, though as you get further in, you'll start to shake your head at how ludicrous certain events and activities are.  It's not a dealbreaker or anything, just felt as though certain things weren't really thought through.The puzzles this time were a lot more forgiving, and I rarely ran across poorly worded ones.  Where the puzzles broke is by way of the \"Super Hint\", which was supposed to be a way to basically give the answer away at the cost of 2 coins IN ADDITION TO the 3 coins for the basic hints.  The problem is that the Super Hint frequently was no more helpful than the basic hints.  The only time I really ever needed to use it and found it helpful was for a puzzle that admittedly could have been worded better that talked about finding some building, and you got no sort of useful information to help you.  Every other time I used it, I got something along the lines of \"come on, you can figure it out!!!!\"....ok, wasted 2 coins for a pep talk instead of what should be a giveaway.I noticed a lot of \"move bricks\" puzzles in Unwound Future.  Ironically those are the ones I hate the most.  There were ones where I just looked online for the resolution on YouTube -  I work full time, I'm in my 30's, I just don't have the patience for certain puzzles that have no give.I didn't really have major complaints about Unwound Future, it certainly wasn't worse than Diabolical Box, but I still found Curious Village to be the most compelling of them all.  Near the end is where it really got good.  Definitely recommend at least a playthrough.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2011"}

Most of them aren't very good at all. Therefore, I wasn't expecting much from GREEN LANTERN: RISE OF THE MANHUNTERS. I thought the game would be a silly replay of the movie with no additional story value, difficult gameplay, and terrible graphics. I was surprised to discover this is not the case.The game is a tie-in, but not a video game adaptation of the movie. The main storyline (campaign) takes place either right after the GREEN LANTERN movie. The body of Abin Sur is returned to Oa for a proper burial but just afterwards the planet is attacked by Manhunters, a race of androids created by the Guardians as their first police force. However, the Manhunters became more interested in punishing creatures instead of serving them, so their ranks were dissolved. Someone has now united the Manhunters in a master plan to destroy the Green Lantern Corp, the Guardians, and Oa. Disobeying orders from the Guardians, Hal Jordan sets out to find out exactly what is going on. He's joined on his quest by Kilowog and Sinestro.The game looks gorgeous and even comes with some 3D glasses that if you have a hi-def set up allows for some 3D effects. I also liked that Ryan Reynolds is the voice of Hal Jordan in the game. The game has just the right balance between simplicity and difficulty; it's not too difficult for beginning gamers to play and defeat, yet not so easy that an experienced gamer will hate it. There are moments when you think you know what you need to do to defeat a boss, but discover that though you had the right idea, you were slightly mistaken.What I liked most about GREEN LANTERN: RISE OF THE MANHUNTERS was the two-player drop in/out mode. Very few X-box 360 games are made so that a person can play through an entire campaign with or without another person. I enjoy campaigns, but sometimes it's more fun to defeat a game working with someone else. This game allows for that as well as giving one the option of having a partner drop out without adversely affecting what you've already accomplished. More games should include an option like this.Overall, I really enjoyed GREEN LANTERN: RISE OF THE MANHUNTERS. It was fun and challenging and allowed for my brother and I to defeat a game working together.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2011"}

It's part of my generation and now that I'm playing the last game in the second part of the series it feel great. Everything you expect from a Ratchet game is here and intact and nothing has really changed. That's both good and bad depending on how you look at it. Hardcore fans will love this and not feel a thing towards the repetition, but to me it feels Insomniac was running out of steam game play wise. The story is great, but it's the same run and gun controls, slippery platforming, and a few curve balls thrown in to keep the series interesting like past games.This game is serious story wise and tells the tale of Clank's origins, what his purpose is, and this is the best part of the game. It's what we've been waiting to hear about for ten years, but after playing Clank's mind bending puzzle sections Ratchet's feel monotonous after about half way through the game. Changing up the levels doesn't cut it anymore because the graphics are pretty dated. The art style is still charming, but the graphics look like a really good PS2 game compared to other games out there today.Clank's levels consist of time manipulation and you can record former selves to solve puzzles. It's hard to explain, but there are four sections in total through the game (not enough) and then there's a bizarre dual stick shooter mini-game thrown in towards the end of the game. Clank's levels look better than Ratchet's and have better effects, but this is where the most interesting part of the story plays out. Clank does have combat abilities, but it's nothing you haven't seen before.Ratchet's levels are the same since 2002, and while there's some new weapons I found a lot of them useless for once in a R&C; game. A lot of the enemies recycle and repeat, and only certain weapons are good against certain enemies. However, later in the game a lot of the weapons just don't do much and you resort to using more powerful weapons. You can find mods for your weapons that add different types of ammo, make it shoot different, or add power etc, but these are hard to find and require hardcore fans hours of dedication to find them all. Ratchet has a couple of new gadgets such as the OmniSoaker and Hover Boots, but I wanted to see some more since this is a finale.Ratchet can now freely explore space and visit mini-worlds for Zoni (to enhance your ship), mods, gold bolts, etc. This adds variety to the game, but after a while they get boring since there are only so many different types of worlds that are copied. Space battles add a nice mix to the fray of just on the ground run-and-gun affair so it is welcomed. Just like ground shooting once you get to the last sector you're just tired of the same space fights and planet exploring.The best part about the game is probably the boss fights since they are challenging and each one is different and unique. It really makes you utilize your arsenal, but again some weapons will be completely useless. There seems to be spots here and there of uniqueness and variation, but it's not dished out as fast or as often as past games. The enemy variety is really low so you will kill the same robot the one millionth time by the end of the game. It's a shame Time turned out to be such a repetitious game because it has a ton of potential. I would have loved to play more as Clank solving puzzles, but there's enough here to keep you going through the 15+ hour game.Despite a nice ending to the game you can start a new game+, but there's no real incentive to go back through since you'll want the game to end early on anyways. The voice acting is top-notch as usual, and the storytelling is Pixar quality, but this is probably the worst R&C; game play wise just because I expect a lot from Insomniac. The series needs a serious reboot or I'm not coming back to visit the furry one and his metal pal.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B007C72F2U","description":"","reviewerName":"Dagger One Bravo","summary":"Great Game With a Few Annoyances","reviewText":"Admittedly, this is the 1st Civilization game I've played so I can't say how it stacks up against the others but it's certainly not the 1st game of it's type that I've ever played. I got it a while back while looking for XCom. It came in a 3-pack bundle with Civ IV (haven't played that one yet) and XCom (uninstalled this tripe after about a week) for ~$20.Anywho, it's a great game, tons of fun and very easy to pick up and play which is something that can't be said for most games of this type.The graphics are excellent although when moving the camera around the map is SOMETIMES slow to render on my machine with high settings. IDK why because my machine is plenty powerful enough to run this game on high. I guess it's just one of those things. Not really a big deal but I have to look at large chunks of grey areas on the map for a few seconds before things start to show up properly.Some of the annoyances are:*AI opponents can act pretty irrationally. A good for instance would be when you're building your empire, minding your own business with your one small city when long about turn 10 or so Augustus Cesar appears on your screen denouncing you to the world for no apparent reason.*AI picks random religions that they never would have picked in the real world. For example, I have had Gandhi pick Christianity (an atrocious choice for Gandhi) and Catherine the Great pick Buddhism (Catherine the Great was Russian Orthodox). This happens even when they're the first players to get a choice.*Spies seems pretty much totally useless and as easy to detect as a spider in a birthday cake while the enemie's spies are devastatingly effective and seemingly totally immune to detection no matter how many measures you take to combat their presence.*The game chooses the unit it wants you to manage next and the camera automatically goes to that unit, interrupting whatever you were doing or wanted to do after you finished managing the previous unit. Even if you have multiple units in the same spot that have turns left, it will bounce wildy around the map, auto-choosing whatever random unit it wants you to manage. As best I can remember I found where to turn this off in the settings but also as best I can remember, it didn't work very well.*A lot of times after managing several units the A Unit Needs Orders button will still show, making you think there's something left to do before you end the turn but when you click on that button to see what it is it quickly changes to End Turn and ends the turn. This wouldn't be so bad if you weren't wanting to do something else before you ended the turn, say, change a city's settings or just look over and assess some things and sometimes it can be important that you do this before a turn ends.*Occasional crashes but only occasional. Nevertheless, save after every turn because sometimes a crash can really set you back.*For some reason, on my last game I was destined to take the time victory at 2050 but when advancing the game to my winning turn the game would lock up when clicking the End Turn button, making my victory inevitable but unattainable and no amount of going back and restarting from a previous save fixed it. I eventually gave up and started a new game, assuming that Ceasar and Gandhi had their spies rig the software so I couldn't win the game. Ceasar, especially, is a real crybaby!For the record, All of these (other than that last thing) are very minor. They don't detract from the game's immersion or playability to any degree and there's lot of mods that fix most of these issues. They're just there, that's all.Everything else about the game is great and I recommend it to anyone that likes this kind of stuff or even to those that don't if their reason for not liking them is their disproportionate complexity in comparison to other types of games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"Phenominal cosmic power ittty bittty witty gameplay","reviewText":"I'm a cross platformer, and I've been looking forward to the PSP for a good long time. I've been long awaiting a handheld with enormous next-generation graphics, and game play. Thus far the PSP has fallen flat on its face in terms of the latter. As far as the former goes, anyone whose played Metroid Hunters can attest that the DS is still a capable piece of hardware, and while the system may not be quite as powerful it is capable of high quality products, and the difference between the DS and the PSP is marginal.But ultimately it comes down to the games. Now mind you, I am not biased. I do love Nintendo (although I fully admit the N64 was a stinker), and I do have hard feelings toward the PS2 because I feel the over all system is a huge let down, but I also love my Xbox, and I have ALL of the major consoles, and I do plan to continue that tradition. But this leaves me with no reason or need for bias. I have all the systems, so I can make up my own mind about what I like and have no need to go on a jealous \"I bought x system so y systems stinks\" rant. I let game play be the judge. And so far the PSP will gratify sport fans immensely... and no one else. Ape escape is a let down, Metal Gear Acid is a severe let down, and Dark Stalkers is a let down... The PSP literally launched with nothing for casual, hardcore, or budget gamers. Only sport fans. Seriously, look at the line up this far.Now the DS library has been building up slowly, I admit that. But there's now 5 games I consider must haves for it, and that's better than the PS2 did in its first year on my shelf. The PSP seems to be repeating the launch pattern of the PS2, all sports, and nothing else of value, and as you can tell, I am not a sports fan.Also consider that Square-Enix's handheld support will be dominantly Nintendo, starting with the never before domestically released Final Fantasy III, and an update to the Egg Monster and Crystal Chronicles series, as well as a new Mana game. PSP so far has ONE Square-Enix game planned, a follow up to FFVII, exciting, sure, but not as exciting as the longer list of DS planned titles.I think if we should have learned anything this last generation and the generation before it is that graphics do not matter, it's the game play. The N64 was much more powerful than the PS1 (although the cartridge format restricted FMV capabilities) but the Playstationites were quite content with their pixilated, aliased, low-resolution, and low-polygon count games. The PS1 was where most of last generation's great games were... this round Xbox and Gamecube have clobbered the PS2 in game play, and especially graphics (RE4 and Halo 2 anyone?) but the PS2 is still out selling both systems. Graphics and system power are invalid arguments.Also consider that the PSP is a whopping $250.00. That's an awful lot for a handheld, especially with Microsoft's successor to the Xbox looming on the horizon. Remember that the N-Gage was quite a capable piece of hardware by comparison to the GBA as well... because of its price it bombed, and now, even though Nokia is practically giving it away now most stores are no longer carrying it, and have no plans to carry the next one. I'm not saying PSP will suffer the same fate, in fact I hope the PSP does well, it has enormous potential... but really I would recommend waiting for two things before you buy it. 1) A price drop by about $50. Give the system 6 months, it will happen, and 2) unless you're a huge sports fan you'll find yourself pretty board with PSP pretty quickly. So wait for the AAA must have titles to appear. The system will be a paperweight for 6 months plus if you don't. I'm already shelving mine until something noteworthy comes out (most likely the aforementioned Square-Enix game.) Where as with my DS, even if the DS line up isn't the most intuitive, or brilliant of all time it's building, and has some incredible just-around-the-corner games that are must haves. Mario Kart DS (Fully online capable) Animal Crossing DS (again fully online capable) Castlevania DS (AKA Aria of Sorrow 2, tentatively) and numerous other groundbreaking titles that will definitely make DS owners happy. I'm looking at the release list for the PSP... more sport games... Where's the innovation? Where's the variety? Well, truth be told my PS2 took a year and a half well after the Xbox and Gamecube were added to my shelf, to get some really noteworthy games. Sadly I anticipate the same fate will befall the PSP. I just hope I'm wrong, but not being a sport fan, so far it doesn't look good for PSP. Sure it's more powerful, but by no means is it more fun than my DS, and therefore it is not better. Technologically perhaps, but certainly not by means of innovation or great games.As far as UMD movies? Sorry, I have a portable DVD player, and I support the DVD format fully. I have no intention of buying the same movie on two different formats just so I can watch a movie on my PSP. Music, however, may cause me to take my PSP out of the closet it's already been cast into... except I also have a portable CD player... MP3s are more convenient sure, but I don't have the money to blow on a memory stick sizable enough to make it worthwhile. I just bought the PSP after all... Oh well.In conclusion, wait and see with PSP. Sure it's got marginally prettier graphics than the DS, but unless you're a sports fan or a die-hard Sony fan boy right now there's absolutely nothing to justify the purchase of this handheld. We'll see what the future brings, though. On technology merits alone I give it 3 stars. As an industry insider I advise people to brace for Game Boy Evolution, the handheld that in approximately two years (or less) will blow all your expectations away.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2005"}

The Free-Draw mode will definitely save you money on paper, pencil, coloring pencils, paint, marker, your general art supplies you'd need if you were going to doodle or paint in reality. The art lessons are pretty meager and don't give you much but the mini-lessons do offer challenges as Vince doesn't guide you through them much. Your on your own to sketch/paint out the mini-lesson images. One thing I do agree with is the fact that there's no other way to upload or save your art for sharing other than on your DS itself. Would of been nice if there was a website where you can connect using WiFi or something to upload your art to an email or straight to a photobucket account. DS Lite owners will find that this game is pretty limited where as the DSi owners are able to snap pictures of anything and try to sketch it out in the Art Academy *Making me wanna upgrade to a DSi*.

And here's why.Well, every stage until the last one is too easy. Then the last one is near freaking impossible, even if you literally dedicated your entire life to playing video games, because to beat it, you must conquer every single planet in the galaxy (the milky way, to be specific), without other civilizations taking one of your planets for themselves. That means if you're on one side of the galaxy and your planet on the other side is being attacked, well you're screwed. The Grox are simply too hard and it's frustrating enough to skip the level, which I do every time. I play until I beat the civilization stage and I restart on a different planet.It's a nice game for mind-numbing entertainment since it's cute and easy (even on level hard). This game has a good number of mildly irritating glitches, however, which pop up in a random fashion, but they never prevent you from progressing to the next stage.This game reminds me of Sims a lot (for obvious reasons, like the same developer, Maxis); it has a ton to do with design and creativity, and progressing through the stages of life. But Sims is the better game.If you like to be creative, eh, give it a shot. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2012"}

Otherwise, I felt that this game was not stacking up to the fist.  The graphics got a major overhaul and look better than Halo1, but Halo2 lacks all of the huge and epic major battles that we saw in Halo1.  This game would have done fine if it was just another shooter, but it surely does not offer something comparable to the original. You play as a covenant and can wield the cool sword.  The game is fun, but the dissapointment of not meeting the expectations for me from the first game left me no choice than to view this game as just another shooter.  Ive played the first game with a friend cooperatively on each difficutly setting all the way through and every time I am blown away by how action packed, exciting, and hair raisingly edge of your seat challenging the very end of the game was when you have to make your final escape.  Halo2 had a very easy, cliche, and unmotivated boss battle with an ape with a hammer.  I guess everything is explained in the special edition DVD in which the developers explain that they either had to cut tons of content for time or money purposes.

With amazing graphics, gameplay, sound, many weapons, vehicles and the best online play to ever hit the Xbox so far, halo 2 is is the most playable game ever created.Halo 2 has a basic story, its just that Master Chief has returned and is once again trying to stop the covenant from taking over earth and all of the other planets. Master Chief is also trying to deny a weapon of massive power and one that would have a great effect on the world!Even though this game has a simple story, the gameplay is unthinkable. I will break up my review into different categories listed below...Graphics: One of the best parts of Halo 2 is definetely the graphics. The background detail is superb, the texture is smooth and clear. The water is also very well done compared to halo 1, but still not as good as some games have done. The cutscenes are worth bragging about, for example, when i was watching a halo 2 cutscene and my cousin came into the room he told me to \"change the channel,\" as he obviousely thought i was watching television which i thought was kind of funny. The animations of your character reloading, moving and shooting are truely amazing as well, (you switch off from being the covenant and master chief throughout campaign) as it seems like a real movie like a previousely mentioned. Master Chief looks much cooler then he did in Halo 1, as he has a redesigned suit and many more guns with much better graphics. Although it seems like i am saying that the graphics are amazing, i do think that they could have done just a tiny bit of a better job on them just so that it could be one of the best games in terms of graphics to every hit the Xbox Console, that would be great! But all in all, the graphics are wonderful, and definetely not an aspect of the game to complain about, unless you are picky, wait, lemme refrase that, too picky!Gameplay: There is one word, and only one word to describe the gameplay in this game. Fun! Thats it, this is arguably the best game on the xbox console, and there are many reasons to support that.First of all, you are able to sprint at twice the speed that you could in Halo 1. For those of you who play Halo 2 you probobly do not see a difference really in the sprinting aspect. I didn't either when i first played the game, but after i played a lot of halo 2, and then played halo 1, you could definetely see the difference between the two in terms of the speed that you can sprint, which is much better then the first.You are also able to highjack vehicles which gives the game a little \"grand theft auto\" them to it which is very fun to do. When your playing on Xbox Live, you get a medal each time you highjack a vehicle. (You get medals for each bonus thing you do such as highjacking, sniping, assasinating, etc.) Of course you could not do this in the previous halo 1 game so thats another difference between the two.Another better thing in this game then there was before in the previous one is that the A.I is much smarter. For example, they can sometimes form a \"short time alliance\" with another enemy and they can swarm at you, or the grunts can hide behind corners and wait for you to come. The elites are also much better at dodging your shots which makes it much harder to hit them. Also, if you want your allies to drive a vehicle they can which you couldn't do in the first halo game. The only problem is that sometimes they don't show that they're smart by slamming into walls and you have to switch seats repetitively before they'll get there \"nack\" back.But as a result of my gameplay review, it has changed a lot over the long and painful time that it took for the sequel to come out.New Weapons: There are many new weapons in halo to and i will list them underneath. They include...(Keep in mind that the ratings are intirely my opinion)BR55 Battle Rifle: 2x scope, burst shots, all in all its an ok weapon, not the best. Long range: 6/10, Medium range: 6/10, Close range: 6/10Covenant Carbine: Basically the Covenant form of the Battle Rifle except that its not burst, its just a one shot fire. Pretty good though, as it can fire much faster then the battle rifle. Long range: 7/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 8/10Particle Beam Rifle: Covenant form of Sniper rifle, except that if you shoot two shots in a row it has to charge back up which takes a couple seconds, but i think its better then the sniper rifle seeing that if you have a good aim, you can finish your enemy off quickly! (Or ally, ha ha!) Long range: 10/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 6/10. The reason why the ratings decrease is because the closer you are to your enemy, the harder it becomes to shoot considering that your aimer is unbearably small, so its hard to aim, even from a far distance, but it doesn't take that much skill to be able to snipe people from afar.Brute Shot: In my opinion i hate this weapon. Only the brutes use it (in single player) and they can never kill me with it because it sucks. Its almost impossible to aim at anything moving from afar or even medium range. The only good thing is that the shots can bounce of walls, wooooopy! Long range: 1/10, Medium range: 3/10, Close range: 5/10Covenant Energy Sword: Probobly the best weapon for close range is the sword. Even from medium range you can lock on to your target and unleash a super upercut attack which is a one hit kill unless your openent uses a cheap overshield, which i personally think they should take out of the game, seeing that whoever has the overshield cannot be stopped by one person unless the openent has a sword or a rocket launcher. Long range: 0/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 10/10Fuel Rod Gun: Ahhhh, i wish this gun was in multiplayer but i guess it would be way to cheap, considering the amount of ammo it has and that it is a one hit kill. But for single player it works mighty fine! Long range: 10/10, Medium range: 10/10, Close range: 10/10Two other things i have to add is that you can dual weild certain weapons, but the only problem with this is that you cannot chuck grenades when you are dual weilding which kind of makes sense when you think about it. Also, the rocket launchers can lock on to vehicles which makes it much easier to destroy those cheap @$$ vehicle lovers!Vehicles: I will now mention the new vehicles in Halo 2. They are...M12G1 Warthog LAAV- Basically the same as the previous Warthog, except it uses a Gauss Cannon which is a one hit kill instead of the machine gun. (The previous Warthog is in Halo 2 as well.)9/10Specter: Sort of like the Wraith, (Wraiths can be used in multiplayer now) except its faster and can hold three people, one for the plasma cannot turret at the back, one in the side seat, and one obviousely driving the vehicle. 9/10Shadow: The vehicle that the covenant use, can hold up to 8 combatents depending on the species of convenant, an ok vehicle when your using it. It uses a plasma cannon like the rest of the other covenant vehicles. 7/10Two more things i have to add about the vehicles are that the Banshee can now be used in multiplayer as well as the Wraith which makes multipayer much more fun.Sound: A great game needs great audio right? Well halo 2 listened. From the classic halo chant, to the rather heavy halo 2 beat, comes wonderful sound and definetely good enough quality that you can just sit their drinking tea/coffee and listening to it. Well, i guess if your that obsessed with the audio, you can just by the soundrack right?Online: Now comes the best part. The online multiplayer play. I have to say, i though crimson skies had the best online multiplayer play, but as soon as this hit came out i quickly regreted myself saying that. Basically, there are ranked games and unranked games, (unranked games are known as training games.) As you win ranked games you gain levels, you start out at level 1 and the last level is level 50, but i believe that the highest level right now is 27, so as you can see its extremely hard to work your way up once you get past level 20.The different ranked games are as follows...Rumble Pit: Up to 8 players all dualing it out against each other. Thit matchmake playlist can include normal slayer, all rockets, all swords, all shotguns, odball, or king of the hill. This is probobly my favorite kind of playlist to play.Team Skirmish: Up to 8 players, 4 on 4, on a team obviousely. This playlist usually includes the different types of Capture the Flag, team odball, 3 plots or assault. Pretty fun playlist to play!Team Slayer: 8 players, 4 on 4 against each other can include normal team slayer, team rockets, team swords, Fiesta Team slayer, team shotguns or team phantoms. Probobly runner up for my favorite playist to play halo 2 on.Head to Head: Simple straight up slayer games 1 v 1 can inlcude normal slayer, all swords or all rifles. Very fun, and addicting especially when your winning.Big team battle: Huge game, up to 16 players, 8 v 8 can include team slayer, different types of CTF, Assault, or land grab where you have to take over different areas of land. Very fun playlist as it sounds like, but can get very hard and boring considering that your dying a whole tun, especially when your playing on a smaller map.Clan Battles: Basically, you can join a clan which in different words is like a club and you get your clan together and battle with them in different match types. Pretty fun, good for bragging rights. When your clan starts winning, it will level up.In conclusion to my online review and whole halo 2 review, the online aspect is probobly the best part of this entire game. Its so much fun trash talking to your opponents and so addicting to play ranked games. You can also just play custom games where you can invite all your friends to play whatever type/map you want. You can also customize ever thinkable option which makes this game truely worth your time and money.Halo 2 delivers excellent gameplayer/graphics/sound/online play which definetely makes the game a worthy $50. Halo 2 is definetely not one of those games that you are going to end up returning straight away after you get it, you'll be twice as addicted to it as you were to Halo 1! (Unless you don't have Xbox, and if you don't like halo, no offence, but theres something wrong with you.)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2005"}

Gleason","summary":"Wow...this game really sucks","reviewText":"I am typically not one to write a review, but I just had to. I played this game for the past couple days and it really just...sucks. The combat is too glitchy and the AI, as stupid as they are, somehow do not hold themselves to the same rules as you, which in a sense can make it unfair. I played DAO and Mass Effect and to say that this game is an RPG is false. Its more like a hybrid, much like ME2 but without the refinement. The assault portion of this game has already made me want to stop playing it (its been 2 days). The story however seems pretty cool, so I may run it through once and make it a coaster after that. I am glad I only got the game for $[...] bucks.UPDATE (8/12)I believe I will give this game 3 stars instead of 2. After a quick (and I mean quick) play through, I really did enjoy the story. I started a new career that is a bit more challenging and found the story to change completely. Still though, the cover system and stealth system (especially the latter) are still very unrefined in comparison to ME2. BUT...since the story can change dramatically based on your responses, I will give this game one more star as a result. I am still glad they decided NOT to create another game as it really did feel rushed, even though it wasn't!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0000TSR4C","description":"Whether chasing down a criminal on foot or flying through alleyways in a high-speed car chase you'll need brains and brawn to survive Driv3r! Features an incredible storyline to immerse you in stylized action. Gameplay involves hair-raising missions both on foot and in vehicles with a plethora of weaponry to remedy tight situations. Driv3r's detailed cities boast over 30-square miles of drivable roads!","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"This is a full review of Driv3r (I have completed the game).","reviewText":"To be honest some people may jump to horrible comparisons when they start to play Driv3r because... IT DOES NOT PLAY LIKE GTA or they experience some minor bugs! Yes there are those of you out there who will have to learn that the triangle button does not get you in and out off cars, that Tanner jumps a bit odd, that there are some game crashes, glitches and moments when things don't happen quite like they should... yet with A.I this sophisticated, with so many possibilities because of the highly detailed and semi-destructible environments and certainly destructible vehicles - that to tune this game to perfection would probably mean waiting for the PS3 to come out. There is no doubt - no other game has pushed the limits of a gaming experience like Driv3r. The Getaway had similar problems on release with its glitches but Driv3r is nothing like that horrible experience and is more akin to that cherry you got popped when you stuck the Vice City disk into the machine (as if VC did not have some glitches too). Also please remember that if it was not for Driver 1 + 2 we would not have had the 3D GTA series. GTA 3D was spawned by the Driver series. Div3r has now taken the lead. It deserves it too.There are 3 full scale cities (Miami, Nice and Istanbul - all WOW! WOW! BIG WOW!). Tanner has a choice of several weapons including a rocket launcher that virtually blows up everything except some buildings. There are, however, no sniper riffles! I can maybe understand why games this realistic do not have sniper riffles but my only real crib with this game is that is has no zooms. A pair of binoculars with a zoom feature would not have gone amiss! Tanner can swim! So no more drowning deaths! The vehicle destruction systems and world physics in this game are as good as they will get on the PS2. When this thing hits the PC it will probably be awesome. The driving is as realistic as Grand Turismo and is not too far away from matching the graphics found in Need for Speed: Underground. There is a cool slow motion \"fun\" feature in the controller (L1+R1) that allows you to see crashes in slow-mo while still driving. There is very little blood in the game but that does not make it any less violent. The shootouts with the cops after a chase are first rate action sequences. Unlike Vice City everything comes out of the blue and you will not second guess a thing. The A.I is that good.The replay and director mode are sublime. With Driver 1 + 2 you have spent hours creating endless little movies. If you liked that experience Driv3r will have you doing a recreation of the Steve McQueen Bullet car chase sequence in no time. Every conceivable camera angle and tracking shots are covered (with controllable cinematic motion blur!... Hell yeah!)The story is great and requires you to think about it a little. It basically revolves around a car heist gang and you work with foreign cops undercover to expose the ring. The cut sequences are almost film quality CGI and voiced by major Hollywood actors. The missions themselves are each compelling, entertaining and present a level of realistic quality not seen before. This is as close as it gets to playing a movie. The free ride mode of course will allow you everlasting driving and mayhem across the 3 cities for the price of $50. You can also play various type chase/getaway/cross country/point to point/ scenarios.It has NO multiplayer which is a shame. I have wondered why they did not do this but then again this may be a problem with the PS2 engine. It is my understanding that Vice City programmers could not do it either. I doubt we will ever see a 2 player game this rich in detail and game physics without better technology (In Grand Turismo you went around circuits and things did not blow up! and there where no cop chases and shootouts). Now and again the PS2 does stall at times even in the only single player mode. There is also no stats page like in GTA.There are tons of missions and you will spend a few days at them.... relentlessly. I can not quarrel about any of the little glitches that crop up now and again. To be honest the more I learned to control the game the less the glitches appeared (come on folks, they only happen now and again when you start learning the game). In fact I have not found a glitch in quite a long time (playing now 70 hours + for sure). The bottom line is that this is an evolution in gaming experience and possibly the human condition. Nothing will be the same after playing Driv3r.Pros:- The BEST game ever for the PS2. Better than Vice City.- Graphics are the best in any game for the PS2 so far. 3 gloriously rendered cities to do battle with.- The driving IS Grand Turismo.- The slo-mo fun feature is whacked out!- The shootouts and destruction on this scale and realism have not been seen before.- You can do virtually anything you want in the game.- The A.I is outstanding.- The car crash physics are like something NASA came up with.Cons:- Some glitches (jumping and control problems, going through walls sometimes, odd game crash).- Requires a greater deal of practice than you think before you fully come to grips with the Driv3r experience.- The shooting system may not be to everyone's style.- Character movement may appear sluggish at times (yet during playback it looks extremely realistic).- The height of realism impacts the cartoonish quality that GTA has.- You will die quicker in this game because you can be injured while driving.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2004"}

I'll spare everyone the storyline and who the main character is, assuming that you all already know. There is also a nice summary on the page. Let's get down to the basics of my review.Assassin's Creed II blew me away with its stunning graphics, talented voice acting, and awesome storyline. Ubisoft succeeded in making this game packed with extras and enhancing fighting techniques. When I saw Ezio use two blades on two guards for the first time my jaw dropped. When it comes to fighting, the techniques are awesome, as they were in the first game.I do want to say that I really loved the first AC game. I have nothing bad to say about it except for the viewpoints. Needless to say I like the repetitive missions in the first game. But the missions in the second game were a bit more enjoyable. And, again, my only problem in the second game was the view points. It got so annoying to me that I eventually stopped finding them. It's time consuming every time you want to play the game again. So, with that said, I guess AC2 is an \"improvement\" but I don't really think there was anything to improve from the first game. In game trilogies, the game evolves with the series. So the developers are constantly thinking of new things and keep in mind that with the coming of time there are new techniques and environments to consider.What I really loved was that Ubisoft didn't take too much away from the first game. They kept it on a realistic scale and there was a lot of symbolism that reverted back to AC1. I just know that sometimes a game series can get worse because they change things too much. Not in AC2. The series just got way better and I am already eager for the final installment. AC2 will HOOK you in. You don't want to stop playing it. I beat it in about 16 hours, over the course of two days. I wish I could have dragged it out a bit but I was so eager to see how it ended. And let me tell you, the ending is not what I expected, but it was good.As for the games flaws, there weren't many. Sometimes when I would start a mission the marker wouldn't appear, and at the end of the game two of the markers didn't appear so I got confused and ended up leaving the area and then dying. When it took me back to the area the two markers had appeared that time. So yeah, some glitches when it comes to markers on missions sometimes but other than that it's flawless. A lot of people complain about trying to jump to one place but landing somewhere else. I have also experienced this, but I also experienced it in AC1 and the Prince of Persia games. The thing is, there are so many places you can jump or climb to that it's probably hard for the game to figure which one you're really directed at. I find that when I'm climbing or jumping to fast (such as in the assassin's tombs) I tend to fall. But when I take it slow and time my jumps I succeed.Awesome game, great storyline, and now my new favorite game trilogy!! Thank-you Ubisoft for making such an awesome game! It was worth the $60.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2009"}

I thought the stealth mode was not implemented very well, as most of the time you have to fight the same people you could hide from anyway. The graphics are mediocre at best. The music is pretty average.Despite my criticisms, the game is somewhat fun. There are surprise attacks that you have to dodge, as spiderman would. There is a decent amount of robustness to the level of interactivity with the environment. For example, you can pick up, throw, or kick objects. The objects have different physics such as rolling for tires and explosions for certain containers. You can climb on walls and ceilings, and shoot a web to pull yourself to a wall or ceiling, although you may not shoot diagonally.Additionally, the controls are explained well and are fairly intuitive.

Also, there was no slowdown at all, even in very intense graphic use with a lot of npc's moving/attacking, etc. I love the free-running, but it is a little finicky, and while running through an alley, I often find myself inadvertantly running up a ladder. That is very frustrating, and while I can understand it in the beginning as my inexperience, I am at the point where I amcomfortable in knowing that it is just part of the software, and not my inability to properly control the character. Switching weapons is a little tedious, and tough to do in the middle of a last minute fight, but you'll get used to it. Yes, there are some downsides, but if you are patient, this is a great game! It is violent. I wouldn't let my kids play or even watch, but that is obvious from the name and the rating. The maps are great, but you it is totally flat and doesn't show a three dimensional space, so that if you are tailing someone, you don't know if they are behind a building or inside or in front of. After a while you get a kind of sense, but when you are freerunning, it is very tricky. Leap of faith is also awesome, and just when you think you are in trouble, you find a haystack. Hiding is hit or miss, but its still a nice thought. You can mark quests and side quests and use the map to guide you to the spot, however, when it is a moving character or object, they can disappear from the map if they get too far away and and when that happens you have to go back and restart it. A little frustrating. This a not as fast moving as Skyrim with regard to character development, but it is just as big with almost as many side quests. The volume is louder than normal, which is great for me. Shadows are never so dark that you need to set the contrast to vivid, another nice touch. The controls are fairly intuitive inspite of being slightly complicated. For the price, it is a no brainer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2013"}

You replay the same five or six levels which each of the three campaigns, but they play quite different with each character.  The marine is average FPS,  while the alien and the predator control alot like the 2 \"condemned\" games, very Melee heavy, with projectiles there for the predator as well.  The game overall feels very bare bones and bland.  If you can pick it up cheap, the predator levels are very fun, and worth the value of a downloadable game, but the multiplayer was super boring, and i barely gave it a chance.  I did beat the 3 campaigns, and around 400 gamerscore is about 5- 8 hours worth of campaign.  Hope this was helpful.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2011"}

Lucas has been taught the art of combat in the ancient and deadly style of the Legion. Lucas is a skilled swordsman, and a master of two combat stances. He can fight with a sword and shield, which allows him to attack quickly, deal heavy damage, and interrupt and stun single targets. When outnumbered, he wields a massive two-handed sword.

{"product_name":"B004EW7LSY","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Bean","summary":"A well-paced, surprisingly smart action-game!","reviewText":"One of my biggest problems with current-gen action games is pacing: Most games in this genre are either too redundant, making you cover-shoot your way to the next cutscene or too overwhelming as you simply fight wave after wave of enemy hordes. 'Binary Domain' is a title these developers should take notice of. No, it's not the best written nor is it breaking any new ground; but the gameplay is dynamic, the combat satisfying (and intelligent), the levels are (usually) exciting and the story (while full of cliche's and stereotypes) isn't afraid to ask some heavy questions.'Binary Domain' takes place 70 years in the future where robots are the main labor force and someone is building them to look (and act) human. Since this breaks the \"New Geneva\" laws a corporate sponsored swat-team or \"Rust Crew\" led by Sergent Dan Marshall is sent to Japan to arrest the suspect. Dan and his international crew need to learn to work together while fighting off enemy robots and uncovering a conspiracy involving corporate rivals, renegade A.I.'s and genocide. It's not a very complicated story and you'll probably guess a few twists before the end is up, but it's never boring and asks age-old questions about humans and robots (some robots actually think they're human) which can lead to some pretty intense moments.While the story's a bit more interesting than your average shooter, it's the gameplay that makes 'Binary Domain' truly shine! Much like 'Dead Space' you have to focus on dismantling enemies, not just shooting them down (if it's still moving it's still a threat, no matter how many limbs it lost!)  Boss battles are just as challenging requiring you to destroy their limbs before delivering the killing blows. Team-work becomes key in boss battles as your teammates are needed to distract bosses and discover their weaknesses (there are no glowing \"weak-spots\") and you really have to pay attention to what your team is saying while trying to stay alive!Speaking of teamwork, every one of your squadmates has a trust/loyalty meter that changes depending on how well you do in combat and your responses to them during conversatations. At first there doesn't seem to be much benefit from this (you really have to screw up to get your squad NOT to obey your orders) but this can change moments in the story, particularly whether or not a character dies in the narrative.When you're not shooting robots 'Binary Domain' mixes in vehicles, swimming, sliding and turret chases through some amazing set-pieces.(the tram and highway chase towards the end are two of the best action-levels I've ever played in a video game!). Not all of these moments are golden but they change up the gameplay and are constantly involving; I was never bored and the graphics and animated backgrounds really make these scenes come alive!As much as I loved playing through 'Binary Domain' it does make a few fumbles. Again, I like the story in this game but the dialogue (despite being well-voiced by assured professionals like Travis Willingham, Laura Bailey and Troy Baker) can be pretty terrible and the characters themselves never break free of stereotypes: The Americans are alpha-male meat-heads, the English are smug-faced adrenaline junkies and the Chinese character is cold and reserved. This by no means ruins the experience, in fact I even found myself caring about these characters by the end, but in an industry that's embracing movie-quality dialogue and characterization as the norm it can be jarring for the next-gen gamer.'Binary Domain' may not live up to some current-gen standards when it comes to writing and innovation (and with a ten-hour campaign is admittedly hard to recommend as a full-priced $60 purchase). However, 'Binary Domain' DOES set a standard that I think every third-person action game needs to rise to when it comes to gameplay, pacing and level-design. It's an exciting experience right to the end and one that every action-fan should try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2012"}
{"product_name":"B004EW7LSY","description":"","reviewerName":"Morgan Cahall \"so many books so little time\"","summary":"Binary Domain: A well done Sci-fi Action Adventure that didn't get much attention.","reviewText":"Welcome to the future. Global warming has submerged the low lying regions of the world and made the vast majority of the population, at least those who could afford it, move into high tech cities above the ever hungry sea.  To build these refuges humanity turned to technology. Semi-intelligent robots were created to do the dangerous work that would have killed thousands.Once the flood walls were built and the cities raised above the ever hungry waters the question soon became what else robots could be used for.  It didn't take long for the obvious uses to become apparent and robots were soon being used for everything from fighting wars to carrying out criminal activities.  Of course there were others who saw a more... interesting answer to the question.What if a robot could be made truly intelligent and indistinguishable from a human? The answer to this question would eventually become known as a &#8220;hollow child&#8221; and the research into how to create them would be forbidden under the the new Geneva Convention that had been drafted to address the various new problems that robots had brought to the age old horrors of war.  To address violations of the treaty a new fighting force that specialized in dealing with rouge technology was created. Various countries had different names for their own forces, but these groups were generally referred to as RUST crews.Twenty years have passed since the convention was signed and it appeared that the ban on researching &#8220;Hollow Children&#8221; was being honored.  That is until a man attacks the headquarters of Bergen, the second largest robotics manufacture in the world, he is killed but not before it is discovered that he is a robot. It is also determined that the man had no idea that he was a robot. Evidence is found that points to Amada Corp, the largest robotics company in the world, as being responsible for the creation of the hollow child.  Soon afterwords a  RUST crew is dispatched to Japan to see what role Amada Corp had in the creation of the hollow child.You play as Dan, part of the American crew sent to Japan.  Your mission is to make it to the Amada corporation headquarters and discover if there is any evidence supporting that Amada is engaging in forbidden research and if so take those responsible into custody.  Of course getting there in one piece is a whole different story....-*-I liked this game and I'm still not sure why it wasn't promoted very heavily.  I just get the feeling from playing it that it was someone's pet project that maybe SEGA didn't  quite know what to do with it, so they dumped it out right after the holiday season just to see what would happen.  Which is a shame because this is definitely one of the more interesting games I have played lately. It's fun shooting up robots and the more damage you do the more points you get.  These robots do not quit either. As long as they have one functional arm to shoot with they will still come after you!  The story also poses some interesting questions toward the end of the game once the &#8220;twist&#8221; is revealed.  I recommend this to anyone interested in Scifi games in general and those who are maybe looking for something a little different than a one man army saves the world from the evil robots.  After all not many games ask the question of why we fear something only when we learn that it had a different origin than we thought it did. m.a.c-*-Graphics: Shiny, Pretty. Robots blow up in satisfying detail.Controls: Grr. Quick time events. When the game is doing what it was designed to do, blowing up robots, it works good. When the game tries to be a quick time game it can be very annoying as there was a slight delay between hitting the button and the action happening. It wasn't a problem once I got used to it, but in some quick time events it is very annoying when you have hit the button in a  defined area before it disappears.Gameplay: For the most part it works. There are some puzzles and quicktime events that can get annoying.  There is a &#8220;trust&#8221; system that indicates how much your squad mates will listen to you, but I never noticed much difference whether they liked me or not. There are also light RPG elements as you can collect nano segments that let you upgrade certain stats and you can also upgrade your squads weapons.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2013"}

This game took all the aspects that made the PS2 titles great and revamped them even more. The story in this game is pretty well developed. I don't think it was quite as good as GOW 1, but it certainly surpassed GOW 2's lackluster one. The story does pull you in quite nicely and keeps you hooked for the next eight hours, it just had some moments where the story could have been fleshed out a little more. The controls in this game are basically the same as the other God of War titles. There is a nice addition to the quick time events though. The button to push always appears in the same part of the screen. X is always on the bottom, O is on the right and so on. This really helps to alleviate some of the missteps during the boss battles. The climbing system is much better in this game and feels a lot like the climbing in Uncharted, which is a very good game to be compared to. There are some cool weapons to unlock and new moves to master. Pretty typical God of War stuff, but that doesn't mean that they are anything like you've seen in the other titles. There are four weapons to unlock and four special items to use. All of these can be upgraded using your XP system.There is actually an auto save feature in this title. They finally found a way to put it in. There are still golden columns you can save in, but the game will automatically save for you as well. The flying sequences are awesome. They are thrilling and a lot of fun. Basically you fly up or down a channel and try not to get hit by falling debris. It is a lot of fun and adds some variety to the campaign.The graphics in this game are some of the best of the generation. There are some parts that look better than others, but overall the game looks great. I think that if the graphics were a little more even that it would have a chance to take on Uncharted's graphical prowess, but due to the unevenness it falls a little short.The campaign itself is fast paced and epic. There are your traditional puzzles, but I would say there are fewer than in the two predecessors. The ones that do make the cut are engaging and challenging. The maze especially took me a lot of trial and error. It lasts just about eight hours. For me this is just right, because anymore and I think it would get boring like God of War 2 did.There are some annoying parts in this game. The flashback stage is rather annoying. It is just too long and too much wandering for my taste. One thing that was added to the gameplay that I didn't like was the bird flying. You grapple to a bird and he flies you over a chasm. This is probably the most challenging part of the game as Kratos sometimes does not jump to the next bird, he simply dives into the abyss. Thankfully these areas are rare.This game should be considered in the Game of the Year category. It was the best campaign that I have played yet this year. The pace never stops and you can't put the controller down until you find out if Kratos finally has his revenge. Longtime fans of the series should have no reason not to buy this game. It bests the previous installments in just about every way possible. Even those who have never played before can enjoy the blood and action that is contained in this title. I do recommend that if you have never played any God of War game that you pick up the PS3 collection pack of the first two. It will greatly enhance this game because the story is important to understand this one. I highly recommend this game to anyone with a PS3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2010"}

But Tolkien seemed at least to take detours into whimsical songs and odd characterizations.Here, well, you're a serious dude out to stop the cockroaches.The combat is pretty damn awful. Yes, this game won accolates for it, but it takes like 2 minutes to kill each monster and then you see the guy running really slowly to the next enemy who might run back and shoot an arrow at you -- it's just clunky. It might be realistic, but it's still clunky.It's like a bad mix of real-time and turn-based. Like, it doesn't quite have the tactical finesse you get with turn-based games, but it doesn't have the visceral action of real-time. It's somewhere in-between and so is just bland.The art is especially bland. It's like the team took literal landscapes without bothering to make them fantastic in any way. So you see lots of bare branches like piles of stones. You never see anything that's unreal or awe-inspiring. Because that's not realistic.The character models are terrible. They look like something from like 2002 with the helmet hair. The elves in particular look like teenagers basically, and not like wild elves. I suppose that this was in service to \"realism\" but it just ended up being bland.The game overall is like they took the uninspiring parts of real life and the uninspiring parts of fantasy and put it all together to make a game that is uninspiring and a drag to play with a boring story to boot.There are some good parts. Morrigan is a very good character. One of the best bioware characters ever. You can thank Claudia Black for that. and..that's about it.Don't bother with this game.

It kinda feels like a theme park or las vegas where they took everything that was cool in the world and jammed it all next to each other.  And there's so many places to visit that the details to each village/town/castle seem to be a little lacking in characteristics that make it feel truly unique from one place to another.  Even the NPC's I met up with are mostly drab looking with little to no facial expressions to speak of when you're interacting with them.  Combat is also a little slower and easier than I'm used to even for an action RPG.My lasting impression of this game is that is was an average one at best, maybe because of the slower gameplay, the lack of fine attention to the finer graphical details, and the so-so main storyline.  The funniest thing was that when I beat the main storyline I didn't even realize it.  There is no grand ending or anything that really shouted out \"Roll the credits! You've reached THE END!\"  I just looked at my quests and was like,...oh I don't have any more mainstory missions...wha? I'm done already?! great...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2012"}

I wasn't even going to buy it.  I just crossed it off my list all together.  After hearing a glowing review from a friend though I went out and picked it up that night, and am now completely hooked!!! The graphics are very sharp, and rich, and full of crisp colors and reflections.  The engine noise of each car all sound different to me and very rich in tone (bet it kicks ... on the surround sound!), and have heard that a certain Prancing Horse marque sounds dead on like the real thing!!  My hat is off to EA cuz this game has the BEST soundtrack that I have ever heard in a game!!! The challenges are tuff, but do not feel impossible, and you can unlock cars just by scoring enough points, which was also a nice touch.  So if you are looking to get back into NFS for your PS2, and you aren't sure. Rent it if you are skeptical, but if you like to gamble.  Then take my advice, and am pretty sure that you will not be disappointed!  Happy Speeding!!!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2002"}

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists. The only hope of the colonists seems to be a vault discovered in the side of a mountainside, rumored to contain alien technology and secrets about Pandora. Will this discovery be the colonist's salvation or their end?

In terms of gameplay, I was expecting a fusion of FPS and \"RPG\" level grinding and that's pretty much what I got.  Unfortunately, it felt like pure level grinding with no purpose aside from increasing the numbers in your character stats screens.My main gripes are that the game gives you very little sense of purpose and no sense of accomplishment, unless you enjoy obsessively finishing quests and gaining more experience/money/stats/numbers/loot.I played for about five hours and only ran into two soulless human NPCs who gave me quests, and they felt exactly like the electronic jobs posting board that also gave me quests.  A quick Google search reveals that the game only has about 20 or so NPCs, including boss characters who say a few lines of dialog before you kill them.  Also, all of the \"merchants\" are actually just vending machines that regularly update with newer weapons and shield units.  Without any remotely compelling dialog or characters, I felt no sense of purpose aside from checking off another quest from my quest list.The game promises a ton of guns and you definitely get lots and lots of guns, but since you're constantly getting slightly better loot, there's really no feeling of accomplishment.  After you beat a boss, you'll get a new gun, but within a few minutes, you'll find a slightly better one on your next quest.  The game rewards you so frequently with loot that it very quickly becomes meaningless.Constantly upgrading your guns is important though because the enemies in the wastelands endlessly respawn.  Crates and chests also constantly refill with more stuff.  No matter how many times you clear out an area, the enemies will always respawn and crates will always refill, again giving you no sense of accomplishment.If you really, really enjoy games that offer tons of level grinding, then you might love Borderlands.  If you're expecting anything even slightly deeper than endless grinding, then you'll probably find Borderlands to be incredibly boring.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2010"}

The game has co-op play of the campaign, which is great if you have a friend to play through with. Dog Days has some of the most interesting and fun multi-player which is highly addictive.The game has a unique art style with camera wobble and hi-8 film grain, which makes the game feel more like a raw documentary. The weapons respond well and the controls are good and tight. If you're looking for a good game at a cheap price, I highly recommend buying Kane and Lynch 2 Dog Days, it's much better than the first game (Dead Men). Heck, buy two copies... one for you and one for a friend so you can play the campaign co-op... at this price it's hard to pass up. I'm giving it 5 stars because of the value.

{"product_name":"B0088I7L76","description":"","reviewerName":"D","summary":"Nothing like MK vs DC which is a good thing","reviewText":"I admit I was a little skeptical over this game. While MK vs DC wasn't a bad game it just wasn't really awesome like it should have been. However Neitherrealm studios broke away from midway and rebooted Mortal Kombat very successfully the  gave the dc characters a 2nd shot at there own game and the results are great. This game is very similar to MK 2011 but with a focus on superheros such as batman, superman, wonderwomen and super villains as well such as the joker. While this game is still rated T it does show signs that Neitherrealm wanted this to be a M rated game at times or push the T rating to the limit. and while it might not be as bloody as MK there is still some blood in the game. Don't Expect to be ripping supermans head off with batman as there is no fatality's in the game however there are plenty of super moves. The Super moves are what you would expect from a fighting game very flashy but it will bring a smile to your face just like the fatality's in mortal kombat. What this game does different from mortal kombat and fighting games in general however is the interactive backgrounds you can bash batmans head into a car with nightwing or use some stuff to leap out of the corner which is very useful. Injustice is also very challenging so far on the harder modes don't expect to able to spam fireballs all day as you will be ate alive even by the computer. Theres also a story mode and I haven't beaten it yet but it seems very nice which is good for a fighting game, and I will not give out spoilers so you will have to play that for your self. Also Injustice has a health bar system very simular to Killer Instinct in which instead of rounds theres 2 bars of health which makes me want KI3. Anyway This game is a great follow up to MK 2011 and while it may not be quite as good it is a worthy game if you like fighting games and/or super heros.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2013"}

The gameplay and story are both vastly inferior to the original Deus Ex.Story - Probably the best thing about the original, Invisible War's story is by contrast extremely weak.  The way the story transitioned from the original is probably the most suspect link in the story.  The ending of the original gave the player three distinct choices to make, and as you go through the story in Invisible War, it seems like Eidos tried to meld all three options together (otherwise there would be no story I suppose).  The story also throws in some very out of place references to various modern day conspiracy theories just to make the story \"cool\".  Perhaps Dan Brown wrote the story for Invisible War.Gameplay - The most bizarre part of the game is how Eidos decided to \"dumb down\" the gameplay from its predecessor.  Instead of a system of experience points in tandem with biomods, the only character development system in the game is the biomod system, which is very similar to the biomod system of the previous game.  Also strange is the \"universal ammo clip\" system.  Apparently, in the future, stun prods use the same ammo as rocket launchers and flame throwers.  They even dumbed down the lockpick/multitools system.  Now there's only multitools, which gained the ability to pick the locks on doors.Despite its inferiority to the original, Invisible War is still a somewhat enjoyable game.  It's just a bit dissappointing because the original was *that* good.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2004"}

It's the same 360 with a new format and layout (in the dashboard and live segments). The only thing that sucks about this is that there's no hard drive with it!, I would've rather had a wired controller and a 360 w/hard drive (at least the old 20gig one) but hey, what can you do about it. It's a big step up from the original base models, that only came with the wired controller, this one is a giver. For 199 you get a free wireless 360 pad, a 256mb memory card, (which can only hold memory for like 2 games)and a free month of XBOX Live Gold. What a steal! I did'nt really bother to play the included games too much, because I think personally that Wii Sports' version of tennis is a lot more mature, Sega superstars tennis is for 4 year olds and no one above that age. Period. The arcade games suck too, but it was a nice gesture from a greedy corporation, I mean monopoly, like microsoft. Buy it if you are poor like me and cant afford the one with the hard drive, but if you can get the one with the hard drive.

The plague is a problem but modern technology is there, which is a cool spin to see it done.  You start out as the body guard who gets blamed for a murder/kidnapping (hence the name Dishonored).  From there your character, Corvo, is out to catch those responsible for the murder and strike vengeance on all the evil doers!It's nice to have a game whose outcomes are choice based.  If you kill more enemies, the guards will be on higher alert and the ending will be darker.  If you take the stealth route, you'll discover more loot, get away with more sneaky stuff and have a more fun time.Note to people like me aka love killing...save often.  Same as in Fallout for me, I tried out running some guards, went into a building, which enabled auto save, and then died in the building.  When I respawned, my health was low and the guards were there to kill me.  I have to go back 1 hour in gameplay in other saves to avoid it.  So annoying but that's Bethesda.

{"product_name":"B005YR308S","description":"","reviewerName":"Southpaw","summary":"One of the Best, Saddest Games I've Ever Played!","reviewText":"In 2011, I bought a PS3 solely to play Heavy Rain, and it was worth the purchase! I've never played a game that has imbued me with such palpable sadness. It tugged at my heartstrings. The soundtrack is nothing short of memorable and melancholic and coheres with the tear-jerking story. From the opening chapter, I was instantly invested in the characters. By the time the opening credits rolled, I have already drawn my first tear. Ethan Mars, the main character, is a broken man, and you can't help but feel his misery and grief.The graphics are brilliant and the storyline is very captivating. It's like you're watching a movie and as far as movies go, this is one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen! There are lots of twists and turns and the ending came as a surprise. I'm surprised Hollywood hasn't turned it into a movie.This is a standout, interactive game that is unique in its gameplay.  The story is slow-paced at the beginning, but then it picks up speed, so don't be put off by its slowness. You rotate between playing four different characters and each decision you make; whether you fail your mission or don't, affects the outcome of the story.  Unlike other games, you don't die or re-spawn, and that's what makes this game unique.  Characters CAN die, but the story goes on and there's nothing you can do to change the events. I found myself second-guessing the decisions I made throughout the game. It's a game that requires contemplation and it's quite intense.You receive a tutorial at the very beginning, while doing mundane tasks such as taking a shower, changing your clothes, etc, in order to familiarize yourself with the controls. This game relies heavily on Quick Time Event. You either love the QTE or hate it. I honestly didn't like it, because I have a tendency to confuse the buttons when I'm flustered. Nevertheless, it didn't subtract my overall enjoyment.If you're action-oriented, then this game might not appeal to you because the game is very story-centered. But I recommend that you give this game a chance because it's absolutely brilliant! This is one of the BEST games I've ever played! It was a truly memorable experience and I wish there was a sequel!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2013"}

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Microphone itself is great but there are some issues","reviewText":"Logitech's new microphone feels very close to a professional wireless mike. It's of the proper shape, weight and well balanced and it should be the better replacement for the lesser microphones you would normally use with games such as Rock Band. Anyone with a gaming console such as PS2, PS3, Xbox or Wii and a 'music' game may find this to be a useful addition to their gaming gear.The good things about this microphone are:+ It's wireless with range of about 30 ft.+ Excellent voice reproduction quality.+ Professional look, weight and balance+ Batteries included+ Goes into sleep mode if not used for about 15 minutes+ Comes with 2 (TWO) wrist straps+ Easy pairs with baseHowever, there's some room for improvement- Limited scope as it's not recognized by the PS3 outside of specific software packages.- As far as the 'singing games' are concerned, it is not clear which games are supported on which platform. There is a statement in small print indicating that SingStar games are not supported but I would be more comfortable if the list of supported games was available so one would know before making the purchase.- The USB wire connects to the base which would make it difficult to have it, let's say on a table. A better solution would have been some 'dongle' plugging into the USB and maybe an independent stand that's just a stand, untethered so that it could be placed anywhere.MY EXPERIENCEI only tested the microphone on a PS3 with Rock Band and it performed well. A wireless microphone does enhance the singing experience. I found the quality of the sound to be excellent. The microphone felt good when held and one feels truly free performing without having to worry about tripping on a wire.EVALUATION AND RATINGWhile this is truly a quality microphone when used with a compatible 'singing game' Most prospective buyers may not feel comfortable not knowing in advance whether it was going to work with a specific game on a specific platform. Another problem is the 'stand' design. Having it tethered to the game console limits its utility as a stand where the microphone can rest.I will round up the 3.5 stars to a 4 because of the fun we had while using it on a game that supported mike and we had not bothered with the badly-designed stand.Note: I only tested this on a PS3 because it was the console on which I had a supported game. I did test on a computer because I couldn't think of any realistic circumstance where I would want to attach this microphone to any of my computers - of which the vast majority (laptops) have microphones and cameras built in already.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00503E9FY","description":"","reviewerName":"Angela Streiff","summary":"MW3 Online Multiplayer Review","reviewText":"Online Multiplayer Review:There are some similarities to MW2 in MW3, but for those who liked MW2 this is a good thing.The online game mode is finally FAST. If your a hard core online multiplayer and ever feel like sometimes things are moving too slow (grenade throws, running across the screen, drawing your weapons, etc) that's no longer an issue. The timer ticks down and it's go at full speed right from the start.The graphics are phenomenal. I always liked the graphics of MW2, but the gameplay of Black Ops better. They took the best of both and made MW3. Sharp images that don't look blocky. Dark and realistic colors that don't all blend together to make it impossible to play.Controller layout defaults into everything being just like as in MW2 and Black Ops. No need to relearn any button commands.~ Game Modes ~Standard Playlist:Team Deathmatch - Kill Confirmed - Mercenary - Free for All - Domination - Ground War - Team Defender - Demolition - Sabotage - Headquarter Pro - Search and Destroy - Capture the FlagAdvanced Playlist:Team Tactical - Mosh Pit - Hardcore Team Deathmatch - Hardcore Kill Confirmed - Hardcore Search and Destroy - Hardcore Domination - Hardcore Team Tactical - BarebonesThe new game modes, Kill Confirmed and Team Defender are stellar. Finally we have some new objectives! Kill Confirmed is great for those who hate snipers. It's a game of Team Deathmatch, only after you take an opponent down, you go gather their dog tags. Don't grab the tags and let someone from the other team get their team mates tags back and you lose the kill. So snipers can't just hide and pick people off since their kills won't count, unless a team mate goes and grabs their tags for them. Team defender is a little like Capture the Flag, but the points are also gained by holding the enemy flag and killing members of their team at the same time.New maps are really well done. Mangled cities, subways, waterfalls, rolling hills, etc.The current maps out are:Seatown: Sea townDome: Desert military outpostArkaden: German mallBakaara: African city crash siteResistance: Parisian map of small townDownturn: Large map of city streetsBootleg: Asian marketplace (daytime version of Kowloon)Carbon: RefineryHardhat: Construction site (reminds me of Silo in Black Ops or Rust in MW2)Lockdown: European cityVillage: Large African villageFallen: Abandoned Russian townOutpost: Very big map of a Siberian airbaseInterchange: A destroyed freewayUnderground: Subway stationMission: African settlementI like that the grenade and flashbang throwing is faster, kind of like in Black Ops when throwing a stun grenade. Not as slow as it was in the past. You're not in this 2 second lag time between throwing it and getting your gun back up where you typically get shot.Weapons:There is a TON of new stuff. The secondary weapons now have machine pistols as an option to go with the handguns and the launchers. Throwing knives have been moved to the \"lethal\" category with the frag grenades and the new \"Bouncing Betty\".The primary weapon category includes the assault riffles (10 guns), sub machine guns (6 guns), light machine guns (5 guns), sniper riffles (6 guns), shotguns (6 guns) and the riot shield option. Gun camo is available for weapons.Random knifing is a lot harder now. When you go to stab, your person doesn't jump 10 feet across the screen. Knives no longer beat guns in the quick draw. Don't plan on running around stabbing, you will be shot before you get to anyone.Strike Packages:This is an awesome new setup. Rather than just pick your kill streak, you start by choosing from Assault (kills streaks with advantages that attack/hinder the other team), Support (streaks that help out the members of your team, or Specialist (get an additional perk selection (things like stalker, steady aim, scavenger, etc)The Assault and Specialist kill streak option rest the count each time you die (as it always has), the Support kill streak option continues to count all kills even after you have been killed. You don't rest back to zero if you die.I like that in MW3 shooting down a chopper or UAV now counts as a kill in your kill streaks. Often times falling back to take one down is a suicide mission for who ever decides to do it. Glad they have finally given a bonus for those who do.There is also now a Death Streak option.After you die...-4 times-Juiced: move fasterFinal Stand: get back upMartyrdom: drop grenade upon death-5 times-Revenge: see enemy that killed youHollow Points: Increased bullet damage after a single kill-6 times-Dead Mans Hand: Pull out C4 before deathAs usual Callsigns are back. Pick your title, emblem and clantag. The option to make your own emblem that was available in Black Ops is not included in MW3.There is a Prestige Shop that gives you the option to trade in Prestige tokens for things like double XP points for a few hours, an extra custom weapons class, and more.And of course if all this isn't enough, there's the new Call of Duty Elite. There is an option in the multi player menu to download the application. The app is free and when you sign up you get 2 hours of free double XP points.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2011"}

The characters are well done (even by final fantasy standards, and that's saying a lot) and the magic/abilities system is much improved from the ever confusing and impractical junctioning system from FFVIII.  This system relies on equipping weapons, armor and items, then earning ability points by fighting monsters to learn new skills or develop immunities.  Another noteworthy feature to this game is the music.  this is the only game apart from FFVII that i have ever considered buying the soundtrack to, the music is that good.

Light, nice shape, long battery life. Comfortable to hold. BUT!After getting used to the offset sticks of the Xbox 360, this gamepad doesn't feel right. The stick placements is fine, but the way you have to reach to use A/B/X/Y just feels like so much more of a stretch than using even a PS3 gamepad that it is kind of annoying. It isn't a problem with a game like Mario 3D world, because you only use two buttons, but playing Assassin's Creed, where you always use all four buttons, reaching for the left-most button (Y) feels like stretch. I believe it is worsened because on the Wii U gamepad (with the screen) the Y button isn't, I believe, nearly as much of a stretch.I'm very tempted to get one of the 3rd party gamepads with the offset sticks and selling this one, giving it away, or putting it in a box.

There is a strategy to getting hits done and staying alive.Graphics: Nice and retro. Reminds me of GTA and GTA II.Music: The soundtrack is just great, and you can listen to it on its own.Re-playable: There's enough randomness and unlocks that make this game really re-playable.Atmosphere: I don't want to say the storyline is good, because it isn't. However in the 1st few levels the game's atmosphere is really mysterious, creepy, and just awesome. Without giving spoilers, sadly it doesn't stay that way.Price: Even when it's not on sale, you can't really complain about the price. It also helps that this game is on sale a lot, though the discounts vary.Low Spec Requirements: This runs on old hardware pretty well. It has really low hardware requirements which is nice.[Bad]Storyline: The full storyline is just retarded. It doesn't feel right nor does it make any sense when you think about it. Yes I'm aware of the metaphors and I'm still not impressed. To me the plot should take precedence over any metaphor or symbolism (i.e. 4th wall etc...).Not controller friendly: Most people before playing it, think that they can use a controller with this game. When I got this game, controller support wasn't even functional. Even if it was, I'm not sure it's a good thing since timing and accuracy are crucial to this game. This game is hard enough. Using a controller would make it even harder.[Misc]Steam: This is a Steam game. If you have a crappy Internet connection, you probably won't like Steam. Steam just doesn't work well if you're on dial-up or some other abysmal connection like ISDN or satellite.

I play w/ a group of co-workers who bragged constantly about how cool this game was, but I was put off by the &quot;bigness&quot; of it.  The instruction booklet is massive, and ironically, my biggest complaint about the game is that it's not nearly big enough to even give you a good working understanding of the game!Now, if you aren't afraid of an extraordinarily complex game, this is, in my opinion, the best RTS out there today.  Over 10 different nationalities progress and fight thier way through different ages (starting w/ the Ancient Age, and progressing to the Information Age).  Each age allows newer and better production, warwaging units, and capabilities.  It's hilarious watching inferior players defending their cities w/ catapults while a highly skilled player rolls over them w/ tanks -- or Archers being gunned down by an opposing player who's discoved Gunpowder.  Yum, gaming goodness!!!Many new concepts have been introduced in this game.  My favorite is &quot;National Borders&quot;.  At a point in the game, each territory has borders that eminate from their civilizations center of power.  What a blast it is to see the colored borders creep out and eventually meet other territories (doing damage to enemy buildings and units it envelops).Difficult to learn, yes, but the payoff is (in my opinion) very well worth the investment.Hope my input is helpful.Enjoy...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2004"}

As time passes, his lonely town of one becomes a town of two, three...until it grows into a town to behold. The town is not the only thing to behold. Among the newcomers are beautiful ladies who have moved to the town to start a new life. Which one will be our hero&rsquo;s lucky lady? However, our hero is soon faced with a problem. Creatures of the frontier, many of them hostile towards humans, pose a great threat to the safety of his townsfolk. To find a way to live in peaceful coexistence or perhaps destroy them along with the danger they bring &ndash; the decision is up to our hero.GameplayAs with previous related games,Rune Factory: Frontierfeatures a myriad of Life Sim activities like farming, raising livestock, building relationships with NPCs, etc., as well as role-playing elements like dungeon crawling and item collection and leveling, but in structuring gameplay it goes to great lengths to incorporate an open-ended structure that allows players to choose the type of game they wish to experience at all points in the game. This means that although at the beginning of the game players will find themselves presented with the familiar opportunity of starting a farm, selling their crops at market and by doing so improving the overall prosperity and size of their town, they are not necessarily tied to the land. Although farming is an excellent way to finance adventuring, the rich RPG elements of the game can be pursued at any time. These elements present themselves mostly in the form of battling monsters and bosses that have found their way into the land, but seem to be coming from the mysterious 'Whale Island,' which floats in the sky above your town. Players can either battle the monsters or make friends with them, raising them as a kind of livestock. As with everything inRune Factory: Frontier, the choice is yours. Whether it's growing crops, expanding the town, fighting (or befriending) monsters or even falling in love, the experience is unique to each player.Key Game Features:Lifelike Interactions- NPCs will come and go based on the player&rsquo;s actions. Want to get along with your neighbor? Want to give fellow townsfolk something they might hate? Go ahead, but they may get upset and leave the town. Be nice to attract more newcomers.Natural Ecosystem- Breathe life into the barren wilderness by cultivating it and planting crops. Small creatures (spirits) will gather first, triggering a food chain to later attract larger and rarer creatures. You are responsible for bringing more fertility to the land.Floating Island to Explore- There is an island that floats in the skies. When you see it, you must quickly find a way to get on it as new discoveries await.Intuitive Wii Controls- Use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to do everything. Plow the land, shake hands with townsfolk to strengthen relationships, or even wave it around when you&rsquo;re on a date with a girl. (Also compatible with the Classic Controller.)Open-ended Play Structure- Whether you prefer Life Sim gaming, Action RPG action or a mix of both,Rune Factory: Frontierlets you game as you want, when you want.Console Debut-Frontieris the console debut of the popularRune Factoryseries.","reviewerName":"Tanya McHenry","summary":"A Unique Hybrid Series","reviewText":"Rune Factory is a unique hybrid series that is default to describe to others because the limitations seem glaring.If you are familiar with Harvest Moon, most of the versions, then you already know the appeal of a farming simulation game. If you don't, it is difficult to explain. If you enjoy something like Farmville, you might have a bit of an understanding already except minus the social aspect. Growing crops, watering them, raising animals, expanding your house, it's all there.Now the RPG element is also there, the literally fighting monsters, working your way through dungeons, taking out bosses, using equipment, crafting your equipment is al there too.The limitation is that Harvest Moon gives you a little more to work with the farming side, and the RPG part is a weak RPG but the two together works very well. Yes, there are times in the game will you will lose battle, where you will have to work your way up to getting past that one point in one dungeon or another to move on with the story but it's much more forgiving than a typical RPG game. You're not loading and saving and hitting the \"game over\" type screen because failure isn't severely punished. The music, the graphics, the overall game has a much more relaxed feel to it overall. This is not a bad thing for most people.There are some parts of this game I was disappointed with.There is a Runey system that I found more bothersome than interesting. It's an interesting take and you'll find people that hate it or love and spend a lot of time on boards trying to chastise the opposite view. I could have done without the Runey's myself EXCEPT the Runey's make the game even more beautiful when you have them floating around. Visually, having them around is worthwhile.Some of the Harvest Moon games allow you to play a girl or a boy, and I was disappointed that you don't get that option in this game. The game is fairly clear about who the \"hero\" is, but it would have been nice to have the choice just the same.Lastly, there isn't a lot direction the game. Some reviewers have mentioned this before, and I would have to agree. If you haven't played a Harvest Moon game or a JRPG, you could easily get lost in this game and that is probably the worst shortcoming to the series. We need new players to keep it going. This isn't one of those games with millions of fans or dollars pumped into it, and the fan base is relatively small but loyal for a reason.This game is now priced at a bargain bin type price tag. It's well worth giving it a go. For me, it's this series along with Nintendo's own brand and a handful of others that make me so excited to have my Wii.Beautiful artwork, stunning music , charming characters, a mini date game, a farm simulation combined with the more energetic RPG system plus a huge variety of things you can do makes this game a lot of fun to play, and I hope we keep getting more like it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2010"}

It sheds any remaining humility from Saints Row 3 and stuffs it with super powers, giant soda cans, and as many pop cultures references as possible.The game starts out in a hectic manner before slowing down and introducing players to new mechanics. It quickly blows through new locations before tossing players back to the familiar city of Steelport (same location as Saints Row 3). Steelport is as bland as it was before, with typical uninspiring streets, stale cars, brick buildings, and civilians that walk the sidewalks acting as canon fodder. Thanks to the main baddie of the game the city is caught in a perpetual overcast causing a dark gloom to fall over the city. The new areas of the game come and go and they feel fresh when they come, but when you leave and find yourself back in the city you may ask why you had to leave.The story is all over the place. The player is tossed from one scenario to another so fast you begin to question whats real and what isn't. Even then the story is so filled with pop culture references you might not even care. Its feels like a bad episode of Family Guy at times. If you're looking for a rich story line you won't find it here.Despite the bland set pieces and forgetful storyline the gameplay can really make up for it. You get super powers early on that let you just high, run fast, shoot lightning, and a myriad of other powers that makes any DC hero look weak in comparison. Some of the powers work well, like running and jumping, but the other require hot-keying to use and unlike the guns time doesn't stop while to select the correct power and can lead to frantic switching of powers trying to find the right one while you are under fire. Gunplay is as easy as ever to grasp, and each weapon can be customized, and upgraded to your hearts content. Driving on the other hand becomes pointless since the characters can sprint faster than the cars, with is disappointing since the car customization is fairly deep and the game no longer suffers from empty streets. The minigames are a blast as well, from hacking stores, to my favorite since the series beginning, insurance fraud there will be plenty to do before jumping back into a quest.The game alone can eat a few hours of your time at a time, but jumping into online with a friend can suddenly make a saturday night turn into a morning. Its a blast to battle it out with you super power buddies.Overall the game is alot of fun. The story stinks and the city is bland, but the gameplay and Co-op help redeem it.I recommend Buying the game....when it goes on sale. I didn't find $50 worth of gameplay, but would have settled at $25.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2013"}
{"product_name":"B001C4C4KW","reviewerName":"GintaxAlvissforever","summary":"The Beginning of Something Different","reviewText":"I should have written this review first but what the heck. This is the second Disgaea game I have bought in the series (The order I bought the series in is 1, 3, 4 and 2).When I played this game, I was amazed at the increase of quality. The gameplay is what got me though. Everything you knew about Disgaea 1 an 2 gameplay has been replaced with something different. No longer are their apprentices and tests to get abilities. No longer is there a weapon mastery. Instead they replaced it with a simpler system that requires more mana. No longer can you just grind a mage for them to learn the ultimate spell and then teach it to someone who has a high INT stat to learn it. Now you have to buy the special abilities at the mana store. The game gives a character a set amount of weapons they are good at and to stick with and as you level up, you can buy more abilities for them. Plus, now you can boost the ability which will do more damage with more SP besides just using the same move over and over to gain more range and power.The downside is the reincarnation system has changed so every reincarnation costs more so if you want your best character you'll going to be spending more mana. Example is 100 -> 200 -> 400 -> 800 etc.Now the story I found average at best. You get like 4/5 good characters and the rest are either forgettable or intolerable. Luckily the main cast is tolerable enough to get through the game. Mao is a hilarious mad scientist with daddy issues that seems to make fun of the typical video game angry nerd. Almaz is the loser human at the butt of all jokes. Sapphire is the insane princess that has the kill or be killed attitude and Rasberyl would technically be the libby of the school only reversed given she would be the person you would like to have as a friend contrast to honor student Mao. Everyone else is easily forgettable and are pretty useless in game. My example I use are Rasberyl's friends Rasberyl and Asuka. Not only do they not contribute to the plot and are easily forgettable but they are easily out clashed by their own race (the kunoichi and female samurai) once you start reincarnating them and they're at 5th/6th tier. The only thing that makes them different is their abilities and the fact they come with special moves only they can use.Another downer of Disgaea 3 that I criticize is the Heart Bank arc. Yes I see that the Heart Bank as adding something new to the game and to establish that it's possible to go inside someone's heart and feel their emotions, pains and dilemma and acts similar to the cell structure like in Ozmosis Jones, but it felt rushed and you jump into the Heart Bank so many times that you forget the problems outside in the academy. I feel like the majority of the plot could have been prevented if the cast didn't spend half the game in Mao's heart (as important of a character development it is for Mao).Finally, another thing I nitpick at is how in post game, most of the unlockable characters are just upgraded versions of their class (the transfer student comes to mind). Post game, you don't get that many characters from previous games to unlock. Like you get the usual Disgaea 1 trio (Laharl, Etna and Flonne), Axel (Disgaea 2) and Asgai and we'll add Marona from Phantom Brave but everyone else that is unlockable is crap in comparison. Most of the other characters end up being DLC from the entire Disgaea 2 class to Revya and Gig from Soul Nomad. I also felt that Ashe not being a DLC character kind of defeats the purpose of Marona being there (to be fair Ashe is in Disgaea 2 Dark Hero Days probably looking for Marona and Disgaea 4 has them come in a DLC packet together.)Overall, this is a step up from Disgaea 2, but does not meet the goodness of the original and the only thing that sets it apart from the first two is the changed battle system. Also, Disgaea 3 is the shortest of all 4 of the games with only 8 chapters.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2013"}

Thank you so much Sucker Punch.  A new company took over the series &#34;Sanzaru Inc.  I was really glad that you guys remasted the first 3 Sly games onto High Definition because I absolutely did LOVE playing them.  Then you guys developed Sly: Thievies in Time and let me tell you that I had a blast playing that.  The most 2 things that I loved were the clue bottles were back and the customes.  No disrespect but the thing that I did not enjoy was when I was in the medieval ages, I had to buy that bottle of explosive which in order to get, you had to shoot targets.  TONS of respect for you guys and for Sucker Punch but I didn't like it because it was tricky without the auto aiming.  I still cannot get through that part.  But...

Here's my breakdown:Combat:Sadly this is about 95% of the game's content. This fact would sit better with me had combat actually been enjoyable. HS utilizes a light/heavy attack system and allows you to juggle between 3 attack stances: power, speed, and range. All 3 have their uses and it's imperative to strategize effectively. But combat is such a chore since enemies block your attacks so frequently. Even when you land a successful hit, it just doesn't feel satisfying enough to make you want to continue your onslaught.Score: 1/5Quests:Pretty linear stuff. The only thing to do aside from fight your way through the main game is to re-fight through completed levels. Why would you? HS rewards combat prowess with Glyph Points. Each time you reach score thresholds, you earn medals which unlock more combos. But a huge obstacle to replaying is long loading times. Trust me-these long load times add up to excruciatingly long waits over a whole gaming session.Score: 2/5Kai Sections:In certain levels, you play as Kai-a lunatic-young girl whose sole means of offense is a crossbow. A nice change of pace...except that the aiming mechanics feel very dated. You'll struggle when surrounded. The one upside is the sections that require you to eliminate targets from afar by slowing time and guiding your projectiles. These parts were the most fun I had in this game.Score: 2/5Story:An interesting premise marred by an intolerable protagonist. You play as an undesired daughter who decides to use a forbidden sword to fight for her people, but doing so curses her, sealing her doom. As I said, she's so unlikeable; she's only warm towards her sister and otherwise passes as a constantly ruthless warrior-and not in a badass way.Score: 2/5Graphics/Setting:The graphics are pretty decent for such an old title. The setting is a nice eastern region, which feels very appropriate for this game.Score: 4/5Overall:A mind-numbingly simplistic game that offers little more than combat in the way of content, but the game even fails to deliver in this department. Replay of levels is encouraged, but you'll wade through long load times. All the while you'll hate the very character you play as.Game Score: 2/5","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2013"}

I have been very impressed with this product so far, and it has more than paid for itself in batteries the few months I've used it.  That said, I did experience some trouble about a month after I started using it.  One of the Wii remotes stopped charging.  When placed on the charger, the light would change to green (fully charged) in seconds but the remote would not work.  After searching the problem online I found out what was causing this and how to fix it.  It turns out that the battery pack sometimes does not get a solid connection with the springs inside the battery compartment.  After looking at my Wiimote I saw that this was the problem with that battery pack.  The solution is simple.  All one has to do is pull the metal tab that touches the spring out of the top plastic holder, slightly bend it so that it forms a point (which you have to do anyway to get it back in) and reinsert it.  After this the battery pack worked fine and I haven't had any other problems.  One other small complaint I have is that it is almost impossible to use a Wii remote cover with this product.  I even tried cutting holes in the rubber of the cover to allow the battery to touch the charge station, but it was unreliable at best.Bottom Line:If you can stand to do some minor makeshift repairs and can live without a cover for your Wiimotes, this product is an excellent way to save tons of money on batteries and ensure that you never have to worry about having a fully charged remote.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2007"}

According to Steam, I played it for 194 hours on one play through.  I'm sure I could have played through again if I wanted.I got it because I tried Fallout 3 and really enjoyed it.  Sure there were some drawbacks and negatives, but overall it was a good experience.  This game plays a lot like Fallout 3, as in pretty much exactly the same.  All the old familiar stuff is there, the Pipboy, the interface, etc.  There's a companion wheel this time around which makes things slightly more convenient.My complaints about Fallout 3, that being a limited number of types of foes and the fact that most of your foes seem to have a limited number of faces so they kind of mostly look the same.  What I really liked was a nice big map, lots of quests, lots to do.  Sure you can run through and do the main quest, but I took my time getting to that and instead ran around outside New Vegas hitting a lot of the side quests.Another cool thing is they have all these different factions.  Powder Gangers, Boomers, Fiends, Great Khans, Kings, NCR, Brotherhood of Steel, Caesar's Legion just to name a few.  They range on a scale of pretty darn evil to good with flaws.  There's no real black and white with any of the groups though, its just good people who do bad things or bad people who do things for what they think are good reasons, etc.  You can try and juggle all of them, you can alienate all of them, or you can form alliances, break alliances and do whatever you want.  They have a reputation feature which is a new thing and it affects how a given group perceives and behaves toward you.  Whether they love you, tolerate you or open fire the moment they see you.  A nice way around that (sometimes) is that you can dress up as a member of the other faction and possibly fool them in case they aren't very happy with you.One thing I had to get used to was the fact that on any single run through, you can NOT do all the quests because choosing one path may cancel out an entire tree of quests while exposing you to a different one.  This is especially true for the end in which you have to make choices about how you want for things to go down.  This is nice not only because it really adds weight to the choices you make as you play, but if you are so inclined to play through a different way next time, you may find yourself being exposed to a few quests that you didnt see the other time.Its a nice big open world that you can explore however you want which I love.  The graphics are not terrible, not exactly cutting edge either, they worked for me.  I would highly recommend this game though.  I think I paid less than $20 and for the amount of gameplay it gave me just on the 1 run through, it was more than worth it.There's a few little bugs here and there that I encountered, but nothing major.  Overall the game is a big winner and I highly recommend it, especially if you like open world games or are a fan of previous Fallout games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"mdizzog","summary":"Marvelous","reviewText":"Simply put, this game fixes every problem that the other Resident Evils had.Basically, this is more of an action game than a horror game. I haven't gotten scared yet, and this is partly because ammo isn't that scarce anymore. I have so much ammo because I have so much inventory space. Instead of having eight slots to hold items, you have around 50. A shotgun will take up some 10 slots, while a rifle will take up around 5. You can also purchase more inventory slots from the merchant. Not only will the Merchant sell you slots... You can buy a ton of weapons from him. There are some fun guns like the riot shotgun and mine thrower, then there's the rocket launcher. You only get one rocket, but that's enough.The camera is different as well. Instead of having a fixed camera , you have a camera that follows over your right shoulder. This works extremely well. When firing guns, the camera fixes itself over your right shoulder and you can aim anywhere you want.There are almost no puzzles in the game. I'm at the end and I honestly have seen around 5. Basically all the puzzles have you matching symbols to other symbols. There is also a puzzle where you have to make 4 pictures show 6 people hanging. There are no frustrating ones though.Besides what's mentioned above, this game has some ideas that haven't been done before. Well, they haven't been done real well. You can now shoot zombies in key hitzones. I havent blown any arms or legs off, but I have blown plenty of heads off. One zombie I shot in the shin. He fell over and then I decapitated him from behind. Another zombie was swinging a torch at me. I shot it and he burned himself. A really fun thing to do is shoot dynamite out of zombies hands. You can even buy a sniper rifle which is really cool, and then you can knock off zombies from afar.Leon is truly an interesting character, and there are some other interesting ones as well. One character from Resident Evil 2 makes an appearance that I didn't see coming.Maybe the last thing you might want to hear about are the bosses. All the boss fights feel epic in a way. Especially the one with the giant cave troll thing. There aren't really special tricks to defeating each of the bosses. You just shoot them, and maybe their plants.I thought this game was wonderful. My playing time right now is about 12 hours according to my save. I didn't even try any of the sub-missions or treasure hunting. I didn't even do the shooting range alot, but there seem to be a lot of rewards for that. This game was well worth the wait; however, waiting for Resident Evil 5 will be torture.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2005"}

The price makes it worth it.  It provides both of the extra campaigns for the gta 4 game.The first one to come out was the Lost and the Damned. In this one you are a biker in a biker gang.  The story is great and the extras are great.  Who wants an automatic shotgun? I know I do.  It is still set in Liberty City but it provides a different experience from Niko's.  The new activities made for this game are a blast as well.  I could do the harley races with bats all day.  A very entertaining GTA experience.The Ballad of Gay Tony, the other campaign, didn't really offer that same kind of entertainment for me, however.  The story wasn't all that interesting and a lot of the missions werent all that fun for me and a lot of the characters just ended up annoying me.  I do have to give props to rockstar for how they handled the game, though.  I was afraid that they were going to just beat the whole gay subject over my head until I went crazy.  I thought they were going to push the whole gay rights thing through the game but thankfully they didn't touch that subject and just focused on other matters.  Kudos.The side missions in the game were just boring and the fun ones just got repetitive due to the same situations repeating themselves multiple times.  Skydiving does make an appearance, however, and it is enjoyable to do.  Also, the added armory is pretty awesome too.  This campaign isn't terrible by a long shot but compared to GTA 4 and LATD it wasn't as enjoyable.  The only real fun I got from the game was from seeing how this story was integrated into Niko's from GTA 4.All in all I give Lost and the Damned a 9/10 and Gay Tony a 7/10.  So pick this up.  Who knows, you might enjoy The Ballad of Gay Tony more than I did.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000BXKA38","reviewerName":"Patrick_91 \"Patrick\"","summary":"In Its Own League","reviewText":"I usually don't count Metal Gear Solid 3 when making my comparisons to other Metal Gears because it doesn't involve Solid Snake in anyway. In its most basic form MGS 3 is more of a 'spin off'. But an important one at that*. With that said lets begin the review.In MGS3 you start off playing as a rookie Fox operative named 'Naked Snake',your mission starts off pretty simple:Rescue a hostage. But get much more complicated than that when you find out the leader of your best friends unit,the cobras,has gone over to the Soviet Union,Thats right this game takes place during the cold war!With that said there is really no 'high-tech' things in MGS3,The most advanced thing you have is your satellite radio haha.MGS3 takes place in a number of environments,but the main one is in the jungle,And in a first for the Metal Gear Solid series,you have a camouflage gauge,you have to blend in with your surroundings or you will get seen by the enemy very easily. You have a number of different costumes to use as well as face paint.(This was later adopted into MGS4 only in a more modern way ;) )And in another first for the metal gear solid series,you have to heal your own wounds,from gunshots,to cuts,to burns. You have to heal it all yourself with first aid materials. (This was not brought into MGS4)One more first for MGS is the inclusion of a stamina gauge,if it gets too low your stomach will growl,aim will be off and you won't be able to hide yourself as good.Graphics for MGS3 are some of the best on the PS2. The MGS games have been known to raise the bar with graphics but this is just amazing,the screen shots don't do it justice. I guarantee you,there is no better looking game for the PS2 that I know of. (I still can't believe how good they made it look on 7 year old hardware!)All in all this is the best game to bear the Metal Gear Solid name,but like I said,Its not really part of Solid Snakes story,so I can't really judge it on that.So for people who didn't know the order of the games should be like this:MGS3Metal GearMetal Gear 2MGSMGS2MGS4You really have to play all of them to get a FULL understanding of the whole MGS story.*SPOILER ALERT,This is Big Bosses very first mission and it also explains why he became \"Evil\" MGS4 also dedicated a 30min cutscene to elaborate more on this as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2009"}

Well.. One of my friends- who is a big CoD fan, bought this game, and I ussually come over to play with him. Before BO, I had bought Mw2, which I soon hated(yes- its true.). I found that Black Ops is quite fun. One of the first reasons why I really enjoyed this game Is the split-screen multiplayer. No other CoD had that, or as I remember. I was able to play alongside my friend in Black Ops when I would come over. Treyarch- who worked with Activision on this game, and many other great games (Ex: Spider-Man 2), had seemed to work hard on this game. I understand that the graphics aren't even close to what you would expect, but I didn't care. What makes Black Ops so fun and unique from other CoD games is first of all- the customization. The customization of the guns and equipment is deep and Activision used a \"money\" system for unlocking- which is another reason why I love this game. I am not very good at shooters, and I am prone to die a lot in Multiplayer, which was why I sold Mw2. The money system ensured that I could always progress, and buy the things that I wanted by completing game modes and such. The maps in Multiplayer are average, however the gameplay is very balanced- in my own opinion. I thought that the idea of contracts gave more of a challenge, in order to unlock more money. Overall, this Call of Duty in the sense of multiplayer is the best. the only thing I didn't like in the mp was some of the killstreak combinations, which would allow players, if they were good enough, to completley destroy the enemy team and hog all the kills via the Chopper Gunner and Attack Dogs.One more thing that made black ops stand out was the addition of Bots (A.I.). I really liked this because I could practice for multiplayer on \"Combat Training\", which have you levels like Mp. The bots are not that fun to play with, but a nice addition if one wants to shy away from Mp or cannot handle it, like me sometimes lol.SingleplayerThe campaign also got a lot of negative criticism from the online community, which i was slightly suprised about. The story takes place in the cold war, where your character- Alex Mason(voiced by Sam Worthington) is in an interrogation chair and has to retell his events about these \"numbers\". The campaign gameplay seems to be fun and unique, with different environments and objectives. I believe one of the reasons why the story was so harshly criticized is because the story gets very confusing, especially towards the end(no spoilers). Anyway, the campaign was solid and I've replayed it several times.Zombies and other stuffThis was the first Call of Duty that I had played which featured zombies (I never played CoD :WaW), and I never really got into it. The objectives are simple enough, where you survive and kill zombies, while trying to unlock secrets embedded in the Zombies story. I've only played zombies with friends, as I don't get far at all playing solo. I didn't like how the zombies mode was linear, and not very open- worldish. All I have to say about zombies in general is to play with friends, unless if you are really good at it.So- basically, I genuinely believe that this game is very underrated, and recieved a lot of hate. So far, this is my favorite Call of Duty, next to Modern Warfare (1). Treyarch appeared to create something different, and succeeded. I am looking forward to Black Ops 2.Pros:-Multiplayer is quite fun, especially via Split-screen.-Solid Campaign-deep customization + great money system- theatre mode is fun to look at (sorry I forgot to mention that)Cons:-Multiplayer can become very frustrating while playing with very skilled players (killstreaks)-no 4 player split-screen for Zombies-confusing story at times-crappy graphicsIt has flaws, bad graphics, and it's another CoD, so it has reasons to be a bad game, however Treyarch added dozens of new features and actually TRIED. (my opinion). I'd say give it a chance- not as good as Modern Warfare (1), but so much better than the other CoDs.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2012"}

If you want flamboyant colors and the ability to jump, you'll hate this game.  If you don't mind an intrquing story, amazing visuals, and gameplay that will keep you entertained for months, Gears will fit that bill.The mechanics of the game are almost flawless.  The intensity of the battles makes you feel like you're a part of the action.  Ducking behind anything you can find just feels right.  You also have the ability to \"Blind Fire\", (which was first introduced in the game \"Kill.Switch\")where you can fire your weapon over or around the objects you're hiding behind, without exposing yourself.The campaign leaves a little to be desired, mostly because it's only about 6-8 hours long (depending on the difficulty setting).  But other than this flaw, it's amazing.  You become totally immersed within this virtual world.  The action is fast paced, and non-stop.I'm giving the game a 5/5.  It's the ultimate gaming expierence.  If you like shooters, and have a 360, you need to go ahead and play Gears.  I promise you won't regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2007"}

The story was unbelievable, the graphics were superb, and the new fighting engine was revelutionary.  It was a game that people would remember for years to come.  The Wind Waker, while still a good game, does not live up to its predecessors.  The story takes place hundreds of years after the events in Occarina of Time and Majora's Mask, after a terrible flood sunk all of Hyrule save a few mountain tops which are now islands.  The flood is a result of, when the Link of the previous few games went to Termina, and he lost his Triforce shard, and Ganondorf was able to free himself and had no opposition.  Now, you control a descendant of Link, who's sister was kidnapped by one of Ganondorf's minions.  At first, your mission is to save your sis, but things escalate, and you must reform the Triforce, save Zelda's descendant, and defeat Ganondorf... again.  Most of the game is extremely well done, but the search for the Triforce shards gets old very fast.  Also, I was somewhat disappointed by the graphics.  I mean, change can be a good thing, but what is better: progress or regression?  Finally, the last two boss fights are bizzare: the false Ganon is impossibly hard, and Ganondorf himself couldn't be easier.  I hope that the next Zelda game will go back to the amazing graphics, and will feature adult Link again.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00DC7G0GG","description":"","reviewerName":"Beccaree","summary":"Classic Mario","reviewText":"Super Mario 3D World is a fantastic game. It feels like classic Mario game play with new levels and game play elements. The 3D World is fun. I have to admit that I am old school and prefer side scrolling, 2D. Still, this game is awesome. This game should appeal to gamers of all experience levels and ages.The new cat suit is so much fun. It gives Mario the ability to climb walls. He can only climb to  a short distance, but it adds to the fun and challenge. You can complete each level just by making it to the end and jumping the on the flag pole. Or, you can defeat the level and collect the three green stars and a stamp that are in each level. This adds to the challenge level. Younger gamers might be satisfied by just beating the level. Gamers with more experience will enjoy the challenge of trying to collect the sometimes well hidden green stars and the stamps. The stamps can be used to post messages to people on the Miiverse board if you choose to opt in to this feature. From the start of this game you can choose to play as Mario, Luigi, Toad or Princess Peach. Yes, you can finally play as Peach. Each character has their own unique ability. Peach can float/fly for a short distance. Toad is fast. Luigi can jump high. Mario is an equally balanced character. There is a slot mini game in each level that allows you an opportunity to gain more lives. If your game ends the slot machine will reappear in each level. This is definitely a must own game for all Nintendo fans.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00149PCAO","description":"In a city where information is heavily monitored, agile couriers called Runners transport sensitive data away from prying eyes.  In this seemingly utopian paradise, a crime has been committed and now you are being hunted. You are a Runner called Faith - and this innovative first-person action-adventure is your story.    Mirror&#x2019;s Edge delivers you straight into the shoes of this unique heroine as she traverses the vertigo-inducing cityscape, engaging in intense combat and fast paced chases. With a never before seen sense of movement and perspective, you will be drawn into Faith&#x2019;s world. A world that is visceral, immediate, and very dangerous. Live or die? Soar or plummet? One thing is certain, in this city, you will learn how to run.","reviewerName":"A. Nonimowse. \"bomber214\"","summary":"Pretty, novel, unflowing, frustrating, short, short, blood pressure raising","reviewText":"Mirror's Edge is a first person based mostly platformer with some melee and a splash of guns (in your hands, anyway) set in a oddly contrasted \"clean\" dystopian future.Faith, your character, is a runner -- a person who literally runs across roof tops and through the streets in order to deliver sensitive packages of, well, we never really know.  Apparently whatever is in these packages is important enough for entire legions of law enforcement to spend their time sending copious amounts of lead in your general direction.  Faith spends most of her time, well, to be frank: falling.  And dying.  Repeatedly.  When she isn't plummeting to her death (or even worse, a screen redding fall farther passed your last check point) she is busy shimmying up and down pipes and ladders, springboarding off of boxes and chairs, running on walls, and hanging on ledges.  She is quite busy with these tasks.Faith will traverse areas as mundane as high rise roof tops, complete with zip lines and plank bridges.  She will make her way through sewer drains, malls, office buildings, empty hallways, a cargo ship, empty hallways, more empty hallways, a construction site, some building lobbies, air ducts/vents, and most of all:  she'll spend quite a bit of time in elevators.Faith will also battle a wide variety of enemies.  Most of which can whip her pretty good, especially if there is more than one -- and there is almost always more than one.  So the best tactic Faith has is to run, except when she is forced to fight.  Which is more than she'd like.  Faith will also be forced to fight on several occasions because it, apparently, takes her a while to turn wheels and push elevator buttons -- and lord knows that is dicey behavior while under fire.Mirror's Edge is an unique game in that it tries to implement a platform game in the first person.  This doesn't quite work as well as one might think.  The impression one gets is that Mirror's Edge is about flow.  This is incorrect.  You can flow, briefly, on occasion -- or if you've played a part enough times to memorize it, and, uh, in many occasions, you will -- but mostly the game is a series of restarts littered with plenty of \"okay, where do I go now, let me walk over here, no I guess I go the other way, oh wait, maybe I go over here...  maybe over here...\" and so on.  I did get some decent flow going once I'd been forced to play the same part about twenty times.Which brings me to my next gripe:  Some parts, whether you like it or not, you will play over and over again.  Sometimes this will be because you can't pull off some delicate timing, sometimes it will be because you can't figure out what to do (or where to go -- the \"hint\" feature is deceptively useless sometimes) or sometimes it will be because you get unlucky and get peeled like an banana.  The check points, thankfully, aren't too bad -- although there are some where you have to do quite a few moves in a row successfully to reach which can be a trial if you flub the last move.  Over and over again.The graphics are stunning at times, if you set aside the eSurance style cut scenes.  I didn't mind the cut scenes, I just found it a strange choice.  If you have the time, at the moment in the game, to take in your surrounds you will realize that the art is really well done.  It is rather sparse at times but the contrasting of colors makes it very striking.  Other times you'll be running through monochrome hallways to monochrome elevators where you will twiddle your thumbs in tribute to Mass Effect and its load times.The game is very short.  I spent a good portion of time, like some lab animal trying to eat a piece of electrified food, repeating certain specific parts.  Even then, the game consumed less than six hours of play.  I did play it on the normal difficulty -- which mostly affects combat issues -- and it got plenty dicey towards the end.  There is a version of the game you can play, \"Speedrun\" which is exactly what it sounds like.  There is also time trial and leaderboard stuff, if that appeals to you.  Perhaps people partial to that will be much more replayability out of it.The controls are, mostly, pretty fluid except you do run into odd clunkiness with your character's motions when the game doesn't quite connect your moves together right for some reason.  Your left hand will definitely be far more tense than your right as pretty much everything is done with the left bumper and left trigger.Faith, apparently, has some sort of neck injury which does not allow her to look down while hanging on a ledge, will climbing a ladder, or while shimmying on a pole.  Odd for someone evidently made of rubber.  She also can't seem to look much passed her shoulder when hanging from a ledge -- this requires her to drop an arm and slowly turn away from the wall.  These are minor irritations through out the game, though.All in all, the game was mildly entertaining with sporadic moments of coolness poisoned by a river of frustrating game play.  I feel better off having played the game, but my over all impression is a very mixed bag.  I'm not sure it really justifies a straight up purchase -- and if you are on a limited budget, or are choosey/particular about your games, I would highly advise renting it.  Or talking someone else into buying it just so you can watch their blood pressure rise and their wireless controller soar through the room.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2008"}

In fact, at any given moment you'll be looking at a tile of small blocks of two different colors or patterns and a neat background. And that's it. But that is part of the charm - it's a very sharp looking game as the colors and patterns are nice and vibrant as well as interesting without being overly distracting.The music is one of the real strong points of Lumines. In fact, the soundtrack is one of the most appealing aspects of the game. As you play the game, the music is generated a bit differently based on how well you're doing.  This keeps things from being too repetitive and makes for an enjoyable gaming experience even for extended periods.What about the game play? Well this is where Lumines really shines. It's a wonderful game even for those who don't usually enjoy puzzle games. The game consists of two main modes. One of them, called Puzzle mode has you tasked with building assigned shapes. This provides a nice challenge and change of pace from the main mode. In this mode you're tasked with racking up lots of points by forming blocks of 4 out of the same color. The kicker is those blocks aren't instantly cleared out they're cleared out by a bar which is set to the rhythm of the music so there is a deeper level of strategy involved.All in all, Lumines is an absolute must have game for any PSP owner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2006"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"Halo is Evolving","reviewText":"It's been two years since Bungie's final incarnation of Halo was released and a new developer - 343 Industries was given the task of advancing this series to the future. A few brand new weapons have been added, an entirely redesigned multiplayer system, a new type of co-op called Spartan Ops and the return of the Master Chief. This review is heavily weighted towards the three main sections: Multiplayer, Spartan Ops and CampaignShort ReviewCampaign (gameplay portion) 6 of 10 - a few new enemies and vehicles, unfortunately somewhat repetitive and closer to Halo 2 style of gameplay, has glitch issuesStory 8 of 10 - resuscitates a long dead storyline and breathes new life into it with new characters, the emergence of the Prometheans and the Didact, somewhat difficult followWeapons 7 of 10 - old weapons have been adjusted with less recoil, stronger assault rifle, new weapons like sticky detonator and railgun change it up, not many truly new ones thoughEnemies 6 of 10 - Prometheans and their hounds are new and difficult in tandem, however all Covenant are now far less intelligent, essentially five types of enemies overallGraphics 6 of 10 - graphics on the whole look pretty good with dynamic light and shading as well as very smooth animation/physics, but textures look chunky and grainyMultiplayer 9 of 10 - now able to actually gain abilities, always have sprint, loadouts available as well as weapon drops for killing sprees, very similar to CoD, lost old UNSC ranksSpartan Ops 8 of 10 - new episodes added every week, objective based co-op separate from campaign really changes it up from firefight, and everything carries over from multiplayer to hereCharacter Development 9 of 10 - all armor adjustments carry over from Reach, loadouts, decreased reloading times, infinite sprint, increased grenade damage, some grindingCampaign 6 of 10As a decade long Halo player I can safely say I've played through all the games produced by Bungie at least five times through. And this one is right about at Halo 2 levels of refinement in terms of overall gameplay and intrigue. The story sets it apart and really allows some issues to go overlooked. However, at its best you feel as though you've stepped back in time and are now playing a game that is nostalgic, as if to say \"wow, remember when?\" But, by the end of the game you feel the repetitiveness start to creep in. The routine seems to follow the blow up four of these generators, press three of these buttons system which is obvious on a second play through. On the whole, it plays more like a 10 hour cinematic than it does a quality game. I'd love to see the movie these guys could make though. It does feel much larger and epic than previous games. However, there is considerable dead time and the dynamic enemies are few and far between. You have essentially five main types of enemies: Elites, Grunts, Jackals, Prometheans (forerunners) and Promethean Hounds. That's essentially it. By the third level you've already reached every type of enemy. It gets old, quick.For those who will remember, this will appear as an amalgamation of all previous Halo games. It has the extras from Reach, as well as some of its weapons. It looks like Halo 2. It has the architecture and setup from Halo CE. And it basically plays like Halo 3. This makes sense because chronologically it is the next step. Going along with the issue of the monotony, you have basically no replay value here. The reason I say this is absolutely nothing carries over from the campaign. You don't get commendations, credits (without challenges), armor or loadouts for the campaign. What's my motivation to replay this game again 343? It's also somewhat less difficult than previous games. Heroic feels more like normal, Normal feels like easy and I haven't tried easy. This is not a problem for me but it's something to note. On the whole, I feel like the campaign kind of took a nose dive for extra multiplayer development and we were cheated out of a quality fifth Halo campaign.Story 8 of 10When I first found out they were going to make a Halo 4 I scoffed at the possibility that they could continue a decrepit storyline. But they somehow managed to pull me back in. You feel for the people and the Chief. I think it was the fact that they relied more on the Halo books here than in previous games. It's still lacking in info, but this is made for gamers. The game starts out with Master Chief in the old Hyper sleep chamber in the middle of deep space on a ship going down, sound familiar? Cortana is quickly determined to have begun something called rampancy where her AI has begun to degenerate. They're being sucked into a Forerunner world. Without giving away too much, they've found the original species that created the Halos and guess who has to fight them. My only real issue with the story is its somewhat hard to follow even watching all of the cut-scenes I still had questions. It's probably the best story I've yet seen in a Halo game however.Weapons 7 of 10Most of the weapons in the game were overhauled, for example the Assault Rifle actually does do damage now. The DMR has less recoil and the Needler is quicker and useful again. But for the most part few truly new weapons were added. There are a number of new weapons, but if you take a second look at them, they're replacements for previous weapons. All the Promethean weapons are just human weapons with a different type of ammo. Everything else is negligible. The only truly new weapons (that aren't copies) are the Storm Rifle, SAW Rifle, Promethean Energy Rocket (or something), Promethean Grenade, Sticky Detonator and Railgun. The Storm Rifle is a covenant assault rifle. The Promethean Energy Rocket is a slow version of the rocket launcher. The Promethean grenade is for all intents and purposes trash. Its area of effect is about eight feet and it does little but stagger all but the daftest of enemies. The SAW is just a full blown light machine gun, but surprisingly not that powerful. The sticky detonator is a weapon which you can fire at an enemy and then it sticks to that spot allowing you to detonate it at a later point. It's actually pretty helpful later on in the game. The Railgun is a weapon that has to be charged but is a one hit kill if you get close enough - essentially a supercharged shotgun. What was bothersome in this game is halfway through you were almost forced to use the Promethean weapons the majority of the time. And they just don't really impress me.Enemies 6 of 10It's pretty obvious 343 was \"dumbing\" down the covenant to make the Prometheans seem more fearsome and I just found the Prometheans to be annoying instead of challenging. I can see how they would be challenging however. They have a flying machine they house in their back which comes out and either acts as a turret or produces a shield for them. They can teleport pretty quickly to where you're at - especially the orange (higher level) Prometheans as well as return your grenades. And you can't melee them as far as I can tell. You do have to spend some time playing against them to understand their weaknesses. The Covenant on the other hand are nearly worthless by comparison. The grunts as usual are grunts. The jackals are about as difficult as before. The Elites seem very slow to react and can't seem to throw the grenades far enough. They also go down pretty easily.Graphics and Presentation 6 of 10Many have said that the textures look cheapened and have actually taken a step back compared to Halo: Reach. This is true in quite a few cases, mostly evident on the Master Chief's armor. It feels more realistic in its presentation however such as animation, sounds and shading. Most of weapons have been given new sounds as well as all the vehicles. And, for the first time you feel as though you ARE the Master Chief. And the FMV cut-scenes are magnificent. The beginning cut-scene could be a trailer for a movie it was so life like. It was the first time I truly confused one with a real face. Unfortunately, many of the textures later on in the game are quite lacking in refinement and overall appearance. They're far more reminiscent of Halo 2 than a game from 2012. I can't tell if this was because of budgetary constraints, the fact that they were starting from scratch or that they felt it wasn't necessary. In any case it's hard to overlook after playing the game more than once. I, myself don't feel terribly bothered by it, but from a blockbuster game you'd expect better visuals.Multiplayer (now War Games) 9 of 10This is where the game really shines and the Call of Duty influence is more than evident. But, instead of being detrimental to the overall evolution of Halo it benefits the more skilled players. For example, when you get on a killing spree you're able to do a weapons drop. You are able to also level your abilities benefiting people who are quality players. Yes, there are obvious grinding aspects, but really it doesn't take much time to gain the XP and level the playing field. This can be discouraging to past Halo players because now tactics have to be used if you plan to win. Gone are the days where everyone lines up like the Civil War and shoots until one person dies. Another really interesting aspect is the loadouts which are also able to be leveled up. I, myself, have a DMR, Plasma Pistol and Plasma grenade with unlimited sprint and quicker reloads. It prevents the people who \"abuse\" the vehicles from running a map, so to speak. I'm able to quickly disable any vehicle. In the past, I needed to look for a plasma pistol, plasma grenades and hang back to make sure I didn't lose these items quick. And if you think about for a second, shouldn't you be rewarded for being good at the game? Maps are all new aside from a carbon copy of Valhalla (which is now named Ragnarok) from Halo 3. This is my favorite map on any game.Spartan Ops 8 of 10This is a new system in place of firefight. Instead of a \"defend until done\" type of mission its far more objective based and various in nature. For example, one of the Spartan Ops consists of protecting generators. But, it seems as though most are just secondary missions. I believe they are all also pieces of levels taken from the game. But this was the case in Reach as well. This is an interesting take on the co-op firefight overhaul. In general it's somewhat less boring because they have a new set of missions each week. Now I don't know how long this will continue or if it's going to be something that's updated each week. But it does add some level of variability for non-multiplayer gamers. Another really nice thing is that you don't have to join a matchmade game. You can play by yourself or by up to four people on your box. This was the case before, but if you wanted credits in Reach you really had to join the four person firefight. Also, all credits, loadouts and armor carries between Spartan Ops and War Games.Character Development 9 of 10Armor is varied in type and you're able to switch quite a few things after maybe 6-8 multiplayer games. As before all armor can be aesthetically adjusted. You get better armor abilities, tactic packages and increased damage from certain weapons. Yes, it's VERY similar to Call of Duty. But, for some reason it just works better in a Halo multiplayer game. This is how the game should have been probably back in Halo 3. I don't know how many levels there are because they took away the actual ranks, replacing them with levels. It seems like there are probably 100 levels because I know many who are already SR60. In essence, if you are a seasoned Halo veteran you'll likely rise to the top pretty quickly. The additions may seem as though \"grinders\" are being given an unfair advantage. But, even if you're a highly ranked, if you don't know how to play or know the maps you'll still die plenty.ConclusionTaking the campaign away I'd rate this game 9 out of 10. It really satisfies all of the issues I had with multiplayer and switches things up with the Spartan Ops. But there are some problems you just can't avoid. The pilots for the banshees routinely run into things. Gunners for your warthog will likely get you killed. In the case of the Mammoth level I was driving the warthog and he was destroying ghost after ghost and then all of a sudden he just stopped shooting. I had to retreat and he never did start shooting again. I mean these are really basic issues too. The weapons are maybe 10% overall new weapons. Visuals are somewhat disappointing. And the campaign on the whole should never have been cut off from the XP. In multiplayer I've already seen cases of lag cheating (or he has the ability to teleport possibly?). I have a T3 connection so it wasn't me lagging. So there will have to be a few updates to the game.In conclusion, if you're a Halo player who really likes the old way of playing where one person gets all the power weapons at the beginning and decimates your whole team you may want to rent this one. It does have many elements of Call of Duty and has evolved as a whole. There is grinding, but you get most of the worthwhile add-ons early in the rankings. I've been playing Halo since 2002 and I can honestly say that as a classic style player I do like where multiplayer is going. If you're solely a campaign guy/girl then you may want to steer clear. Being their first try, 343 has done not a bad job overall because you've got to consider this a standalone game. I'd give the game as a whole a 7 out of 10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2012"}

With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents.

Catherine's core themes-those of free will, of the delicate nature of relationships and the choices we make within them, marry perfectly with the intense, terror-filled gameplay that serves to accurately reflect Vincent's growing sense of anxiety. It is an experience wholly unlike any to come before it, and is certain to leave gamers talking and thinking about Vincent's tribulations long after the credits have rolled.","reviewerName":"Terrence A. \"cinemaparker@twitter\"","summary":"Recommended for those that enjoy feeling uncomfortable or masochists in general.","reviewText":"I'll say this much upfront. This game is geared toward male gamers and it's obvious from the outset that this game was created by someone who was probably driven to the brink of insanity by a previous or maybe even several, earlier relationships and somehow pulled through. That's not to say that women wouldn't enjoy it as well because I'm pretty sure they would, it would just be for altogether different reasons.The dread and tension that envelops the overall experience of playing Catherine is quite remarkable in that it manages to evoke a genuine response from you if you can relate to the events that Vincent, the main character, endures. It's kind of difficult to explain but to put it simply, if you've ever been in a relationship where you've been forced to make difficult decisions or are faced with the looming prospects of the future, then you will appreciate all of the subtle nuances that have been put into it by the game's designers.It's very strange at points, largely due to the Japanese angle. They've done a good job of Americanizing the game but that trademark weirdness that only the Japanese can come up with pokes its head out more often than not. The story is great and you'll like the honesty with which Vincent is handled, who is a very flawed but human character with traits and inclinations that most guys will be able to relate to.Vincent suffers through dream sequences where you control him as he climbs a tower of blocks that you must pull and push into position and this is where the bulk of the weirdness can be found. If you don't get to the top in time, you'll die pretty horribly and usually at the hands of something that you really wouldn't want to get killed by. I mean it, some of the things you'll see in this game will not leave your mind at any point soon after you've gotten to witness them for yourself.This is also where the game either does it for you or doesn't. These block puzzles are punishingly difficult. Not at first mind you but by the end of the second puzzle, you're pretty much guaranteed to be wiping the sweat from your brow. This may not be for everyone and unless you can appreciate a good challenge, I'd suggest you really ask yourself if you're ready to feel some genuine frustration.This game is quite the experience to play, ESPECIALLY if you've got your significant other watching as you play. At certain points, your character will be at the bar with his friends and you'll receive text messages that you have to answer. You are given several options on how you want to answer the texts and believe me, as I was doing these segments I could literally feel the heat of my wife's stare on me as I fumbled with how to respond to these text messages.The standard edition of the game comes packaged with an art book and soundtrack CD. The music for the game is very good and notes on how the music was designed for the game can be found in the book. Graphically speaking, the game is very well done utilizing a cross between anime and traditional graphics. The sound is also great stuff, especially if you have surround sound speakers. There are points where you'll feel like you're in Vincent's mind as you hear voices coming from every angle, usually at the same time.There's a lot more I can comment on regarding Catherine but I think I'll close out by saying that this is one of the more unique games I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. It's not for everyone as the puzzles are really and I do mean difficult but if you can appreciate the work put into this title, then I think you too will walk away very satisfied with this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2012"}

Blazkowicz, is back inReturn to Castle Wolfenstein. Set  during World War II,Return to Castle Wolfensteinfinds the Nazis  dabbling in the black arts in an effort to create an army of supersoldiers.  Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis. But the story jumps all over the place, the enemy AI is  less than impressive, and most gamers will be able to finish the game in a mere  10 to 15 hours. The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons).

The genre of horror/apocalyptic like games is sometimes overused. But in this case it's kept fresh. I heard that this game was made somewhere else (Ukraine or something) and it really shows. The style is like nothing I've ever seen. If you like normal FPS games and the horror and darkly atmospheric genre, then you will love this game. Like Bioshock, which is my favorite game, this game has a real feeling atmosphere. A lot of the elements incorporated into the game are really creative, for example the currency is in bullets you find. The story is there, but a little hard to follow. Mostly your focus is on making it through the game alive and just experiencing some of the scenarios you will be put in. if you like dark games and FPS games you can't miss Metro 2033.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002V16T0Q","reviewerName":"T. Burns \"Slackjaw\"","summary":"An early partial review of Metro 2033","reviewText":"Greetings and thank you for reading this,I picked up Metro 2033 on midnight release and have logged only a short time in game but I thought this may help some on the fence about it. With little time in I will keep my comments short and related to my findings.The first thing that stuck out to me was the graphics. Now again I'm only early on in the game but when you watch the initial cutscene you can see that the graphics are a bit stale and dated. Not to say that its another \"Turning Point\" or \"Legendary\" title because there is a game underneath the graphics that is worth the time and they are a step above the above mentioned titles.The plot is engulfing and will likely pull you in if you were a fan of Fallout 3 like I was. The polish is not on par but there is definite meat on the bone of this title and the concept of a post apocalyptic russia battered by Nuclear warfare where the citizens have moved underground and formed their own independent communities separated by tracks and blockades is strong.You take on the character of Artyom who has been surviving now for over 20 years in his own station. There are mutants all over the tracks and the overworld- created by the environment itself either by radiation mutation or by other more complicated reasons. A plot device that is a bit different than other similar games is that you must wear a mask when outside the confines of the underground tracks due to toxicity of the air. There is a meter that shows you the amount of air left in you tank via a watch that you must keep an eye on. This reminded me a bit of Lost Planet.Still, I felt as if I was playing a game from about 2-3 years ago in terms of graphics. The engine is just fine though you will see definite problems with the movements of mutants and the staged events. you will also see some mapping issues and overlap.  Early on there was a button contextual moment similar to Heavy Rain and I would imagine that they are adapting the GOW formula of timed button sequences. It is a first person shooter first and foremost and I would pretty much ignore the RPG undertone of reviews. It's there but minor at best. I liked the way the plot had some set pieces that you must navigate similar to Half Life 2 but again, not that quality.Overall I will grade it as follows but I will adapt this upon further play.Graphics- 7-8gameplay- 7-8story- 10 (for those who like the wastelands) maybe an 8 otherwisesound - 9 (pretty good ambiance)Replayability - unsureOverall I give it an 8.5 early on.I don't wish to write more now. Just some early impressions that may help you make a decision. Being a fan of the concept itself I'll play this one for the story itself and forgive it for its imperfections- just know that they are there and against a title Like GOW3 (which I also purchased) it is night and day as you might expect. I think it depends on the flavor you like. If you were jazzed up to get this one you will likely enjoy it. If you are on the fence about it I'd suggest a rental to see if it fits your needs. Thanks for your time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2010"}

However, after seeing several comercials for this game - and just how stunning the graphics are - I decided to give it a go and see if the game could live up to the hype.After playing the game for several days I have some opinions on it.First the Pros:1 - Graphics are simply stunning. Very detailed, and there is nothing left out. Wow, just wow.2 - While there is a little bit of a learning curve, it is not steep enough to turn people off the game. Instead, the game allows you to progress at an even pace. You are not required to nail expert tricks right away to advance in the game.3 - Controls. While there are numerous controls, buttons, sticks, loading tricks, etc. It's not nearly as complicated as I Thought it would be. Sure, it takes a little bit to understand the controls but once you do, you'll be fine.4 - Customization. Customizing your ATV at the beginning of the game is fun. But, to really progress in the game later it's mandatory to customize your ATV. Thankfully, you don't really need to know a lot about machines to get the best from your ATV. Just watch the sliders and get out of it what you need. I also recommend creating two ATV's right away. One for racing (faster/handling) and one for Freestyle (tricks/jumps).A couple Cons for the game:1 - There are only three modes. For a game with all the customization and superior graphics, I was hoping for more than three modes (racing, Sprint, Freestyle). The first couple hours you play, this won't really matter, but when you get deeper you may become bored at the lack of options there.2 - Same as above, except insert tracks. Very few tracks to race on. After awhile the tracks begin to look the same and those stunning graphics blend together and don't shine. Don't get me wrong, the tracks that are there are nice, but you can only eat one dish so many times before it becomes bland. Maybe additional tracks will be availabl as downloadable content at a later date?3 - The lack of a Create a Racer mode was extremely disappointing. To me the pre-made characters are blah and none of them really interested me. But, you are forced to select one and go with it. Why not include a create racer mode? That seems to be a prerequisite in most games now-a-days.4 - The lack of any ability to do tricks on the ground. The only time you are allowed to do tricks are when you are in the air. So no wheelies or anything like that it's all up in the air.Overall, it's a fun game if a little repetitive later on I am pleasantly surprised that I enjoy it as much as I do being that I am not an extreme sports fan nor have a lot of knowledge about machanics. For fans of racing games, this may be right up your alley. Even the casual gamer may find something to enjoy about this game. I am really glad I decided to give it a shot.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2008"}

But I picked up Tomb Raider: Legend on a lark, and now I'm addicted. I have completed this game on all difficulties and earned all of the Xbox 360 achievements for this title.The game storyline dives into the Arthurian legend which reveals an interesting parallel to Lara's personal life as you uncover more about the story. It's an interesting spin and makes for a great epic adventure. To really connect you to the story, there's \"Super Actions,\" which are parts of the cut-scenes where, as you're watching a predicament unfold, you're suddenly required to hit a specific button on your controller (to move, duck, jump, grab, or fire your grappling hook) or Lara will meet an untimely death. These Super Actions will remind older player's of Dragon's Lair, a game where you were required to match your button presses with the on-screen directions. In short, it's a great way to remove the monotony of cut-scenes and makes you really focus on the story, because it could mean the difference between life or death.The rest of the game is a well-done adventure story. Navigating Lara through the adventure with a 360 controller is nearly flawless, a testament to the many years of experience behind the series. The only problem comes with inopportune camera redirects, such as the change between climbing on the ledge of a cliff and pulling yourself up above the edge. When you do so, the camera will spin around; changing the direction that pushing \"up\" on the controller will move you. This will cause you to occasionally direct Lara back to the edge of the cliff or, sometimes, to leap off entirely and plummet to her death. Aside from this flaw, most users will find that this is one of the best controller layouts for a third person game, which is something I'm always hyper critical of.If you've read the other reviews, you know this game is short. In fact, I would say this game only has 7.1 levels, since the last level is nothing more than a glorified \"boss fight\" (usually the ending of a level where you face a super powerful foe) which could have been tacked on to the previous level. However, Tomb Raider: Legend does offer a considerable amount of replay-ability with the massive amount of unlockables and secrets the game offers. Hidden on every level are bronze, silver and gold treasures, often in unusual and interesting places. Bronze are easily found while gold treasures will require all of Lara's skills and a bit of ingenuity to find them all. The most exciting find may be the gold treasure hidden in Croft Manor (an extra level unlocked as you play through the single-player campaign.) The Xbox 360 achievements are tied to finding most (but you do not have to find all) of these treasures, as well as earning points for finishing each level and the game (with separate achievements for completing it at the hardest and easy or medium difficulties) and the time trials. There's also an incredible number of additional features (outfits for Lara, cheat codes, developer's content and more) for completing each level and the time trials.So, if you love scouring levels for secrets and unlocking special features, this game is for you and will easily quadruple the amount of playtime you get from this title. If you're a fan of the Tomb Raider series, you'll be absolutely delighted with this well-executed and exciting episode that will, most certainly, leave you excited for the next installment of the story.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2006"}

The map with the different worlds is essentially the same. Ice World, Sand world, etc. These are all here and ready to be conquered. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, rehashing is ok as long as the thing you are rehashing is good in the first place. New Super Mario Bros on the Wii is fun and entertaining as this game is. The addition of the squirrel suit and baby yoshis adds a little extra that makes it worth buying. One of my few issues with the game is the fact you actually need two Wii motes to have multiplayer where two different characters are on the screen. You can do &#34;boost&#34; mode or whatever its called but its not always easy to coordinate with the other player. Often you will end up hurting than helping the player with miss placed platforms. They should have made it where one person could control Mario with the gamepad and another player with a Wii mote could control Luigi or one of the toads. I only have one Wii mote so it was kind of a downer when I found this out after buying the game. $60 is a bit high for any game no matter the quality, I would wait when it gets closer to the $40 or so range.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Not too impressed","reviewText":"I'll start off by saying that I'm not a \"fanboy\" really of any of the three next-gen systems or companies (if I would have to choose, I'd say that I am in fact closest to Sony considering the PS2 is the only current gen system I own). Next, I'll say that like any other console that comes out, when you first buy it at launch you are paying for potential. For the PS3, that price is steep, but the potential is huge here too. Advertised as the most powerful video game system ever, the PlayStation 3 is every bit that, featuring enough hardware and features to make any techno geek squeal with joy. Many of the games look and sound great, but the biggest thing to get over with the PS3 is the price tag. Is this really worth all that money? Well, right now, as of this typing, absolutely not. Now I know that launch titles hardly make a system a must own (just look at the 360 last year, and look at it now), but of all the games to come out at launch for the PS3, the only one that is anything special (or PS3 exclusive) is Resistance: Fall of Man. After that, the game list is scant. The games range from average (Untold Legends, Madden '07), below average (Genji, NBA '07), to terrible (Gundam). Not to mention that the best games for the PS3 you can find on other consoles (Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, F.E.A.R., Call of Duty 3, NHL 2K7, Tony Hawk's Project 8, and the forthcoming Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion to name a few), and Sony's cockiness is helping them lose many of their once exclusive titles, like Assassin's Creed, Resident Evil 5, and most notably the Grand Theft Auto series, which helped sell millions of PS2's. There are a few upcoming exclusive games which could really help make the PS3 a great system like Heavenly Sword, the new Killzone, and the next installment in the Gran Turismo series; but the future right now for the PS3 doesn't seem all that bright. Not to mention that when it comes to the online department, Sony doesn't have much of a shot at all at beating Microsoft's XBox Live juggernaut.

About the only thing they are good for is Drebin points, as you can pick up their weapons and sell them.2. endlessly respawning enemies and rebels/militia. Nothing breaks the realism like endless waves and waves of characters. In the Middle East stage, enemy soldiers respawn from an alley as soon as you turn your back!3. disappearing bodies and items. With the example set by Ninja Gaiden 2 of dead bodies staying around, this is definitely a technical do-able.4. WAY TOO MUCH TALKING. Good, concise dialog writing has never been a hallmark of the Metal Gear Series, but Kojima went all out with long winded monologues. Some of the speeches are cinematics and some are just slightly animated slideshows. Some cutscenes on for 5-10 minutes. I ended up skipping some of them because they were so boring.This is probably the biggest complaint of most people. The game is less of a game and more of an interactive movie broken up by gameplay elements.5. The game is actually pretty short. Only 5 Acts. It's a lot shorter than MGS2, and less varied in the number and style of the bosses.6. lifeless voice-acting. There are some good talents here, but many of the performances seem to be phone in. For example, Lee Merriweather of Catwoman fame from the campy Batman series is Big Mama, but she's just reading the lines passionlessly. Phil LaMarr is excellent as Vamp though.7. long install times the first time around, which DO NOT go away the second and subsequent time you play them! I'm on my second run through the game and it still says I need to install between each act.8. very crappy Metal Gear Online experience. cumbersome and needlessly complicated interface, and very hard to quickly switch weapons. COD4 is the standard. MGO has a lot to live up to. MGO is not a lot of fun right now for me, but maybe it'll get better.GOOD GOOD GOOD:1. amazing graphics. duh. MGS4 is by far the best looking game on any console. some cutscenes look almost real. in particular when Raiden's face in the ending.2. LOTS of guns. about 60. which, miraculously, you can carry all at once. Lots of fun to shoot.3. much replay value and lots of secrets and unlockables. you keep all the weapons from the first run of the game after you start over.This is a game every PS3 owner and action game fan must have. It really shows off the PS3's capabilities.and a note to all the fanboys voting this review as not helpful, are you even reading this review? I said this game is great.

I know some people loved the DS3 controllers and hated the 360's controllers, but I just never felt comfortable with the DS3 and even worse downright loathed the Sixaxis controllers that Sony first shipped with the early PlayStation 3 systems.  Those were too light and just hard to get comfortable with holding and using.  It felt like there was nothing in my hands and I worried that if I wasn't careful I'd wind up throwing the controller through my TV purely by accident if I moved my hands just a bit too quickly.The DS4 controllers don't bother me at all, rather I find them very comfortable to sit and use.  They have an adequate amount of heft, but yet aren't so heavy as to tire me when I'm gaming with them.  The controls are responsive, as I would expect them to be, and the buttons are well placed, though I do find that I'm not a big fan of the new &#34;Options&#34; and &#34;Share&#34; buttons which do require me to pause a bit and 'look for' to make sure that I'm hitting them.The triggers (shoulder buttons) are also comfortable to use and the new clickable touchpad works nicely for the applications I've used it with so far.Two big gamer thumbs up (otherwise known as 5 stars) for this item.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00020V4N0","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"Better than PC Version","reviewText":"NFL 2005 has come a long way for Madden, and certainly, the new entry deserves the kind of acclaim it is getting. It is well worth trying out for the graphics, but ultimately will only have a lengthy time span for those like American Football. I always like to play Madden, but owning Madden is a different matter because the sport itself is not exactly challenging as a game. For instance field goals are a way too easy to complete, even on Madden mode with the wind on full. The completion passes and long runs are what makes the game (including an intensive training course - the game takes time to learn, more than a day for new players to the game) but there are limits in football where games like Baseball and the more assertive and better paced Rugby win it over.As for graphics, they are certainly very cool to watch... ON THE PC!!!, the quick rumbles, fast passes and receivers taking off down the pitch for a touchdown. When it works, or even when you are sacked, great gaming. I played it on a 9800pro card and found that even on the best settings that I dropped FPS considerably, meaning to see the graphics you need a pro 256mb card. Anything less and you will not see what the game can push in terms of pixels, and it can push a lot. Obviously, it looks a little better on the XBOX than the PS2, with the PC ruling both... however, console owners should look at this as a console game minus the PC graphics... read on why...The animations are slick but there are obvious flaws with the non-player faces like couches, as there facial skin tones do not match the head (it is as if they are wearing a mask) but to be honest I am cribbing because these little mistakes are blown away by the animation of the game play.I would like to have called Madden a simulation but to be honest it is more arcade than a game. I found myself just using the curser to move my player who can do very little except throw the ball to five possible players, throw ball away, pass to player who can run, put out his arms or dive. Although there are other possible moves, Madden has a terrible configuration for the PC version that takes it down a star from four to three --- Your defence and attacks have about 5 modes with a max of nine key assignments, but once you set the keys in one mode they are automatically set for the other modes meaning that S for Sprint on attack may end up as S for Dive on Defense. It is a major problem that one key alone cannot be created for a single common move between the modes. This problem leaves you sitting there wondering what move to make and if it was the S key or the D key or whatever because the S key for sprint as a receiver is now the S dive key for the defence. Believe me, this is a very big deal and just makes you not want to play it that much. SO what is the moral?.......Madden NFL 2005 is better on the PS2 or Xbox even though the graphics are not as good.  At least the controls are better. PC version is just impossible to play except in basic key bashing on rookie or pro mode. Good luck with your patients if you choose Madden NFL 2005 PC. Looks great. Controls are rubbish on PC.Pros:- Lush Graphics.- Amazing Football Animations.- For the passing completions and running touchdowns.- Needs a PS2 or XBOX controller.Cons- Extremely limited controller configuration on PC version.- Not a keeper for everybody.- American Football is a little dull.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2005"}

The music score was soothing, adventurous, and enjoyable to go with the game. Graphics were colorful and well advanced for 1986! Like Kid Icarus, it does'nt fool around for one minute.  Wasting rockets, falling into the lava, having to use your smart bombs to elevate to the higher ground to proceed, and falling back while the enemies hit you from all angles are NO JOKE!!  You gotta know what you're doing or else \"game over.\" I only beat the first boss after so many tries so I really suck. The passwords are just as hard as playing the game itself (this was when passwords were a new thing in video games) so make sure you jot them down correctly or get yourself an emulator. Game Genie will give you a better boost, but you gotta use your best judgement on where to go because unless you have the first issue of Nintendo Power or the internet (not available in the 1980's), you are lost! I know game genie is cheating, but I don't care as long as I get the satisfaction of completing the game while I get a lasting enjoyment of shooting enemies with my infinite rockets.  I did'nt complete the game yet, but yes, Samus is a chick...cool!!!  Now thats equal opportunity gaming.  That also proves that it did'nt start with Princess in Super Mario 2 of which came out 2 years later.I gotta go and finish the game so I strongly recommend this game for the NES or spend some Wi points on it if you don't have the NES!

{"product_name":"B000QW9D14","reviewerName":"Skyclad","summary":"A lot better than I thought it would be.","reviewText":"While reading about this game over the last year or so before it came out, I was interested in it even though it seemed like a child's RPG. While it is geared towards younger players, it's certainly not a child's RPG and will appeal to older gamers as well who grew up playing RPG's in the 8 and 16 bit era.The only two complaints I've really heard people gripe about for this game is that the story is cliche and it doesn't offer anything new. I agree to a point, the storline is cliche, but it is still full of plot twists and has a rather flushed out story. True, the characters aren't really flushed out, but the story of the gameworld and its inhabitants is. While the game is totally turn based, a majority of the story oddly takes place via numerous in-game and cutscene action sequences. There always seems to be something flashy and exciting going on, so if that talkes the place of flushed out characters, it's almost an even tradeoff. The gameplay doesn't offer much new either, but it does do things other RPG's have done before better. Getting enemies to battle eachother really helps your party out in battles. Another cool thing is almost every rock, tree, table, cable, etc., anything casual lying around has items or gold in them. Sometimes you'll even find experience points lying in places, and I've never seen that before. The boss battles are awesome as well, and they can be a bit tough unless you know their weaknesses. Most bosses are tough to beat if you simply attack and attack, they usually have numerous weak points you should try and exploit.There are a few things I didn't like. One is that the in-game tutorial doesn't explain very well how to do some things. Like I thought you had to equip Lv. 2 Lv. 3, etc. skills in your basic skill slots to use lv. 2, lv. 3 spells, but I figured out later on you can just automatically use then as soon as you're alerted of the fact you acquired that skill. The other problem I had was the uneven difficulty of the enemeis. Some areas had mosnters so tough that every battle was a tough fight, then the next area would be full of enemies that I could plow through with no problem.In the end, I think most people say they don't like this game simply because they played the awful demo. The demo dropped you into the middle of things with no backstory, not much interaction and a sense of being lost. I really love this game, and I find it kind of odd that I was looking forward more to Eternal Sonata, but everywhere is giving Blue Dragon a higher score. I guess it's true better graphics don't mean a better game!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2007"}
{"product_name":"B003GSZAOY","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Deweese","summary":"I Think It's Good","reviewText":"I've seen a lot of reviews totally lambasting this title, but I have to say that I'm really enjoying the game.  I seem to remember the same thing happening with Fear 2, but I think I actually liked that game better than Fear 1.  I'm not sure what it is, but Fear 2 and Fear 3 just seem to resonate with me more than Fear 1 did.  The graphics and gunplay of Fear 3 are both very good, and the story works for me (However, I did have a lot of questions at the beginning.  Be patient.  Your questions will be answered as the game progresses).Just as in Fear 1, you play as the point man.  Armacham has imprisoned you in a far off country, presumably to isolate you and prevent any further disruption of their fiendish plot.  I won't give away any spoilers, but all three games' stories come together gradually.  Wes Craven and Steve Niles were both hired to assist with the writing and story progression.  Whether or not their involvement had any real impact on the story is anyone's guess, but like I said, I'm enjoying the story.  It's not really that scary.  In fact, the entire Fear series has never really been that scary (Half-life 2 and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter actually made me jump more than these games did).As in Fear 2 I find the gunplay to be excellent.  Hit detection and animations are very good.  I like the look and feel of the weapons (although there really isn't a huge selection).  Finding ammo is sometimes an issue during large fire fights.  The cover system works very well and is a welcome addition.  We get to run around in mechs again!  Overall, the gunplay is the meat and potatoes of the game, and it works.Graphics remind me quite a bit of Fear 2.  The color palette is once again varied.  Fear 1 looked really drab and monochromatic.  Fear 2 introduced a lot of brighter colors, and Fear 3 looks very similar.  The game is supposed to support DX11, but I don't think it looks quite that detailed.  I've got everything turned up to max settings (I have a GTX 580, getting 60 fps).  At any rate, it still looks pretty good.  Again, I think it's comparable to Fear 2.If you're a Fear 1 purist, you might not like Fear 3.  Many complain that the game is consolized, and they may be right.  Regardless, if you enjoyed Fear 2, then you will most likely enjoy Fear 3.  I can't really find too many shortcomings other than the graphics don't really seam to be DX11 and the story can get a little convoluted at times.  If you want a good shoot-em-up, you could do a lot worse.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2011"}

I personally have rarely had a problem with the d-pad. I don't know what everyone is complaining about, if u press it straight up, it will go up, down, it will go down, and same for left and right.

McPl0x","summary":"A thinking man's FPS...","reviewText":"I have to admit, I was ready to give up on this game after the first 5 minutes when I could not get though the first dream level.Slowly, however, the game starts to grow on you.  It is not your standard first person shooter.  Game play tends to be slow and methodical, and you have no health meter, but a heat meter instead.  I think I only froze to death once or twice, so it's not really a big factor.There are plenty of interesting enemies, but what make this game interesting is the puzzles and dream sequences were you have to either figure out a complex series of interactions, or change the past by changing the lives of the many dead people you find on the ship.A lot of people here have talked about the graphics, but its not the graphics themselves that are bad, it's the GRAPHICS ENGINE that is terrible.  My box will run Crysis, Far Cry, and Doom 3 at the full tilt graphic settings, but to improve the chunky game play on this game, you really need to dial down the resolution and the graphics options.Another thing is that many times during the game you will find yourself with no idea what you are supposed to do.  Some of the sequences seem impossible at first, but after 4 or 5 times you will slowly figure out what you need to accomplish.The 'boss' scene, if you can call it that, is on par with the ending of Castle Wolfenstein 3D.  When you start it you will be killed over and over.  But once you examine the environment and decide who the real enemies are, it is actually quite well done.There are many spots that will make you want to search for the walkthrough online, but give yourself 10-15 minutes first because you will most likely figure it out.Lastly, I really have no idea what the back story with the land people and the story you are living on the ship have to do with each other.  It was all very confusing but did not take away from the game play.My advice is to wait for this game to drop to $20 and then give it a whirl.PS - There is zero scare factor here.  I never jumped once.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2009"}

Supported by a sturdy aluminum frame, this kit is designed to stand up to drumming abuse and survive many rounds of gameplay. The poles supporting the drums and cymbals are also made of metal, and the hitting surfaces are made of a thick rubbery material. The foot pedal is sturdy, springy, and metal-plated for added durability and easier cleaning. Batteries are included, so everything you need is in the box. Unboxing and setup took about 15 minutes. The instructions are pictures with arrows and no words (for international marketing), though some text might've also been helpful.The USB dongle for connecting to the PS2/PS3 is very small (about the size of a thumb). Controls are responsive, with no lag, although you'll get best results by hitting each drum or cymbal in the middle. I tested playing a guitar withGuitar Hero World Tourat the same time and there was no issue at all with lag or interference from the dongles right next to each other.One potentially big issue is the noise from the drums. \"Silent\" and \"barely makes a sound\" are not accurate. The controller will make a lot of noise when you beat on them, making a dull thumping sound. They were easily audible from the room directly upstairs from where I was playing. You may wish to buy someDrum Silencersor avoid playing late at night to avoid disturbing family members or neighbors. Logitech claims a \"lively feel\" to the drum heads, but it does not feel springy like hitting a real drum, although the feel is better than Rock Band's drums when I played on my friend's XBOX 360.Another problem I discovered is with the twist tops of the cymbals. They are screw caps and aligning them into the groove is sometimes a challenge. I discovered that after playing a few songs, the beating caused the caps to get wedged very tightly, becoming impossible to untwist by hand. I had to use a pair of pliers to twist them loose again. To avoid this problem, I suggest twisting them only 85% of the way in.Lastly are the twist knobs that secure the cymbals and drums. They have to be loosened to pivot the drums up or down, then tightened again to lock them in place. This is a cumbersome design as each knob requires several full revolutions before being able to adjust angles. Folding and unfolding will take a minute or two from all the twisting, not seconds as Logitech claims. Then you can fold the legs in and slide the controller under your bed.All in all, a very good and solid peripheral, although the specialized nature of it (being compatible with only a few games) and the high price may scare away many gamers. If you have a lot of friends over often and will get a lot of use out of this controller, then this is a fun peripheral to add to your experience.UPDATE: 10/26/2009: After further use of this product, I am downgrading the rating. It is VERY LOUD and can be quite grating on the nerves. A friend was playing this as I tried to write another Amazon review. The thumping was quite distracting and I was worried about disturbing people in other parts of the house.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2009"}

While most people will buy it for nastalgic purposes, I highly recommend it to new school gamers, so they can see where modern RPGs have evolved from.I remember beating the first Final Fantasy back in 1990, and was surprised to find that I remember very little of it. It is a great game, and the 16-bit upgrade suits it well (I doubt it would fare so well in 128-bit). The story is linear and simple, and the characters are a bit wooden, but considering how old the game is, I didn't mind too much. Final Fantasy 2 is also a decent, garden variety RPG, but not as good as the first one. I imagine that this will be like the Final Fantasy Anthology, where people buy it for pary VI, than complain to no end about how part V is not as good. They are both good, quality games that can please both casual and hardcore games alike.The Playstation version comes with breif CGI movies at the beginning of the games, which are nice but do not make it worth the cost alone. The games are what make the package. What I particularly like about the Origins package is that it doesn't contain the excruciating load times that the Anthology and Chronicles packages had. That is a plus.Any re-release of an older game is hit and miss (like the Resident Evil series on Gamecube), but this package hits the bullseye. Younger gamers might be turned off by the graphics, but to anyone who can look beyond that, a great time is assured.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2003"}

Ever since Super Mario All-Stars brought Mario's extended history to the SNES, major game manufacturers have been attempting to capture their previous bolts of lightning in a new bottle. Tecmo released a fancier collection of its trademark Ninja Gaiden series, both on the SNES and the PC Engine / TurboGrafx-16. Capcom's original frontman, Mega Man, eventually saw his first three titles combined into one cartridge for release on the Sega Genesis. Even today, titles are reworked and re-released on new platforms, sometimes with frightening frequency. The legendary original Metal Gear Solid will soon find a new home on the Nintendo GameCube, while Sega's Shenmue II has already landed on Microsoft's Xbox with a whole bag full of new tricks. Obviously, some have been met with tremendous success, while others have failed pitifully.What it all seems to come down to is the publishers themselves, and their understanding of what endeared the players to their characters in the first place. It's in this aspect that Square-Enix really shines through with FF:Origins. They know what their fans enjoy, and aren't afraid to deliver it. They also know what their fans have disliked about their earlier efforts, and have made appropriate amends in each subsequent release.And, true to their names, these two titles are imbued with a great sense of nostalgia. They reek of \"origin\" tales, of the sense that something larger is only beginning to stir in the background. The gameplay remains fresh, even today, and merges flawlessly with the looks, feels and occasional functions of the 16-bit era, regarded by many to be the greatest age in the history of the digital RPG. While it's easy to note the lack of polygons, the somewhat primitive attacks and magic effects, and the limited capabilities of such a system, it all functions so well that you'll forget such minor nuances within moments of beginning these familiar quests.The two games in the collection play as differently as night and day. In FF1, you'll find yourself in a familiar position, whether you've played the original or not; you immediately select four characters from a short list of classes, customizing each with only a unique name to distinguish them from the others. Your characters may be any combination of Fighters, Thieves, Black Belts, White, Red or Black Mages, with each possessing various attributes unique to their class. From the selection screen, you're tossed almost immediately into the thick of things, arriving at the game's first castle, briefly retrieving your first quest, stocking up and heading out. Though significant efforts have gone into enhancing and bettering the story, everything still falls into place quite linearly and honestly needs very little explanation. Your characters are very black and white, each featuring strengths and weaknesses that are set firmly in stone. If you've recruited a party of four white mages, physical assaults will never be your strong suit. Likewise, if you've gone completely for brute strength, you'll want to stock up on healing potions.On the other hand, Final Fantasy II introduced players to a pre-set roster of characters, sacrificing the distinct \"job\" system of the previous title for a much more realistic and well rounded usage-based functionality. You're still given the opportunity to name your initial four characters, but the roles themselves are far less pronounced and truly depend upon your tendencies for each. If you habitually begin using the female lead in a healing role, she'll gradually become more and more proficient in magic, yet less and less so with physical attacks. The more damage a character takes in battle, the faster his hit points rise. Experience points are completely thrown out of the world of FF2, resulting in a system that was likely fifteen years before its time. If a next-gen game were released today utilizing this very same system, it would be hailed as a remarkable new direction for role playing games. At the time of Final Fantasy II's release, though, it was way too much to deal with.Continuing that trend, FF2 also forged new ground by featuring the first \"rotating character\" slot in the series' history. Much like in Final Fantasy IV, the first released for the Super NES, characters will join and leave your party when the storyline makes it appropriate. Three of your playable characters always remain constant, as any further departures would cause a serious clash with the character development system, but one slot is always reserved for a temporary ally. It adds a bit of suspense to the storyline, as the idea of a comrade falling in battle for good becomes much more possible and realistic.In the end, both titles are enthralling and addicting, with FF2 running about three times as long as its predecessor. They're animals of a different color, sharing in many aspects but standing extremely far apart in others. And, though these are two completely different games, they remain strangely tied to one another, alike despite their variations. Elements of both were used in the molding of Square-Enix's legacy, and each remains an obvious inspiration even today.These are faithful recreations, improving upon many of the old cartridges' infamous flaws, yet strangely ignoring others. The elements of excitement, anticipation and exploration, the foundations of the entire series, have been retained without hesitation while the graphics and sound benefit greatly from the fine tuning. Even the originals' lack of real sidequests and secrets have been accounted for, as both games are accompanied by hundreds of unlockable goodies. As I observed with my review of the very first game in the series, these titles carry with them an innocence that's rarely matched. There's a reason Chess and Checkers have been played for centuries without modification, and that same reasoning applies here. This is a steal at the introductory price, an inexpensive peek at the history of the industry through a pair of rose-colored glasses.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2003"}

Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

I believe there's a favorite for every generation. This one happened to fall into the N64 genre, when gaming was really starting to pick up. And honestly, you think over 700 5-star reviews were written all by children? We were children when we all played the game! And looking back as adults now we cherish it as a classic and one of the best in videogame history. Kids that didn't get to exprience the NES, SNES, and N64 missed out on a great gaming genre and though the generation of gaming today is awesome there's nothing on the classics.Ocarina of Time remains my favorite game of all time, even before some of my new favorites and there's nothing like turning on that N64 and playing over and over again.

After going through the almost year drought since Mario Kart Wii came out, Wii users finally get a title that is a bonafide hit.Platinum Games took the creative route and used the Wii's less-than-impressive guts to make the stylized black white, Sin Cityesq animations. MadWorld is beautifully polsihed and does give Wii owners some bragging rights, because there really is nothing else on any system that has MW slick and creative look. Combat is the other big hook, as you know, it's super brutal, super fun. MW took the Tom and Jerry approach but cranked it up to the extreme intesity mark and made a over the top massacure brawler. Meat grinders, air plane engines and street signs are all fair game to waste eniemes. The A.I. was not ment to be super smart. These brain-dead dummies are here just to be cannon fodder and to cascade gysers of blood. The more innovative you kill, the more points you get, cause in MW, terrorists have taken over the city and made it into a kill or be killed game where the cooler the kill equals your fan approval. The story is papre thin, but MW's main focus is visuals and gameplay.The soundtrack of the game is an origonal hip hop score that surprisingly meshes well with the game (cause it was made for the game), while Greg Proops and John Dimagio give great, non recycled improv. commentator lines.Among the many small problems I had with the game (goofy grabbing mechanic, the lock on system, empty rooms that should be full of baddies), I had to big problems with MadWorld. 1.Boss Fights. Yes the quicktime finishers are amazingly cool, but the game's main emphasis is using the enviroment to kill. No amount of tires, street signs or 'rose bushes' make a diffrence, you just go up to 'em and roc 'em soc 'em constantly. Second problem is the length. MW is only 4-5 hours long. As great as they where, $10 an hour is a hefty investment for the average consumer, especially in these economic times. It's hard to justify that length when other games cost $10 more, and give much more gameplay plus possible DLC.MW is a must have for any serious Wii owner. If you can stomach the blood, MW will give you a good time. Not a great time, a good time. Only question you should ask before buying is can you wait long enough for a price drop?","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00012BSJ4","description":"When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better. Buy it immediately.Rated:9.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Patrick L. Randall","summary":"Slight, but fun game return to the original","reviewText":"After having played and fallen in love with the GameBoy Advance's first Metroid game, \"Metroid Fusion\", it was a little bit of a letdown to play its follow-up, \"Metroid: Zero Mission\".  I found the game to be a bit slight and a little too quick to finish.  Alas, it appears that that was simply my own ignorance getting in the way.  I was a late convert to the `Church of Metroid' as I didn't get hooked on the series until \"Super Metroid\" for the Super NES.  \"Metroid II\" for the original GameBoy didn't impress me at all and I never played the original \"Metroid\".  Apparently, that is the source of my ignorance, because \"Metroid: Zero Mission\" IS the original Metroid, with some additional missions tacked on at the end of the game.  Now, that I realized that this was the original, I have a better appreciation of the game.  There's still no getting around the `slightness' factor, though.  The game is just too short once one has played the \"Super Metroid\", \"Metroid Fusion\", or the Holy Grail of video games, \"Metroid Prime\".  It is still an entertaining game and worthy addition to the gaming collections of all Metroid-philes.  It's certainly helps all us faithful pass the time until \"Metroid Prime 2\" comes out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2004"}

I actually had some trouble finding one which kind of floored me considering this system had been out for a while.

Game A comes out and someone says, \"Game A is like Game B.\" or \"Game A plays like Game B, but with hints of Game C\".  There is really nothing wrong with that, because this mash-up of popular titles makes for some still very enjoyable games that will keep you glued to the screen for hours.  However, every once in a rare while, a game comes out that has no real ties to any games prior.  It's unique, it's different.......and all too frequently, it's slaughtered before the creators have a chance to build on it.  Enter Stage Left: Heavy Rain.Is this \"game\" an action-packed powerhouse of edge of your seat moments?  No.  Is it an RPG with dazzling special effects?  No.  In fact the only thing you can really say with any certainty is, \"Heavy Rain is among the most unique experiences on any console to date.\"  Now that can read two ways depending on your mindset.  A) You are of the mind that because this doesn't have items, leveling, inventory, or even a set sotryline; that it is, therefore, boring.  If that is your mindset, fine.  Avoid this game.  B) You are a gamer that is always looking to experience something new and visceral.  You read reviews that have a hard time categorizing this in any particular genre and that alone intrigues you.  If that is your mindset, fine.  Buy this game immediately.Ultimately, the gameplay is simply a series of button presses and motions that mimics movements of the characters on screen.  That is it.  Depending on the choices you make and the effectiveness of your reactions, your story plays out.  There is no \"You are dead.  Reload from last save point?  Yes/No\".  Your character dies and the story continues to play on as if that was what was intended the whole time.  Game time itself is rather short, probably clocking in at about a day's worth of gaming.  However, to really see all the game has to offer, you really should playthrough many different times.  Honestly, for me, being able to playthrough a game more than once and get a different story.....a completely different story, each time; makes this not, as one reviewer called it \"A movie you pay sixty dollars to see\", but rather multiple movies you pay sixty dollars to see.The graphics are the pay dirt of this game.  The facial expressions, lip-syncing, everything is so amazingly vivid and crisp that it really makes you wonder sometimes if this is indeed a movie or a game.  Even more amazing is the fact that as amazing as the graphics are, there is no frame-rate drop to be seen.  Even in the most hectic of scenes.  Textures are full and vibrant with reactions and movements that are fully believable.The plot is fantastic.  Really that is all I can say since, apart from the very start of the game, your experience playing may yield a plot much different than mine.  However, I will say, whoever wrote the script for this game is a real talent.Ultimately, Heavy Rain is different, and as such will be a love or hate it game.  There is very little out there that I can compare to that would give you an accurate idea of what the game is.  \"Interactive Drama\" seems to sum it up nicely and far be it for me to try to outdo Quantic Dream in describing their own game.  If you are on the fence and not sure about whether you'll like it, then by all means rent it.  Personally, for me, I pre-ordered it and haven't regretted a single moment.  I will say though, I cannot fathom how ANYONE who actually played this game through to completion could give this anything less than 3 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2010"}

I remember seeing about 3 years ago a piece of this game and thought wow how odd, so i didn't really know what to expect as a full game. Starting off real innovative gameplay mechanics really work sometimes other times not so much. The controls when you first start are a bit difficult and you really find yourself unsure of the purchase you just made, but work through it and it becomes, well maybe not easy but you get the hang of it. The graphics are top notch, and the story is very engrossing, i'm really not going to go into detail only that the premise is \"how far will you go for someone you love\"? The actions of the so called oragomy killer are never really clear but all the different locations and storyline plots have many twist and turns to keep you guessing through out. The onscreen commands such as use the left analog stick to take out your enhaler, or to hit different buttons while confronting an enemy are a bit strange at first but really you have to be quick and respond if you want a certain out come. Now if you really don't care you can actually just let the game run alone and not even interfere, which is most cases you won't die, but then whats the point if you don't interact. Plus thats the whole point is making your decisions based on what you want the outcome to be. So while this sounds confusing it can be at some points, but never the less its very fun, just a different kind of game that is the Heavy Metal or games meaning its not for everyone, and won't be a huge off the shelfer, if you will. But i think its great for what it is, i finished the game in around 11 hours, so yes its like most reviewers had said, once you play it, going back to play again really doesn't seem so appealing. So thats really why i give it a 3 instead of a 5. Now mind you if this game had been a downloadable game such as Siren Blood Curse the graphics would not look nearly as good and the game files would be so enormous that you couldnt even fit it on your playstation. But i feel the game should have been 39.99 instead of 60(but hey its sony, thats not going to happen), although i didnt have to worry because i rented the game before it came out due to a friend at the video store giving me early access!! So yes rent the game i would not pay this much for the game even though for the most part it is amazing. They're are few things to left to be desired although they are few and far between. This is basically the score i give, not to add up the numbers for a final score just to tell a little bit about whats what. So if you enjoy interactive movie games than this is definitely the best out there, and there is really nothing else like it on the market.Graphics-10/10---Buries metal gear solid and killzone 2 into the ground.Gameplay-8/10---Thats a mixed bag sometimes its fun sometimes tedious, so its really a hard decision.Controls-7/10---Mostly this goes along with gameplay, so its quirky but as you go along you put up with it.Storyline-10/10---Engrossing, Sexy, Violent, Offensive, Fun, Intelligent, and the best in years.(says it all)Voice Overs-8/10---For the most part its spot on, a few areas it out of synce, some more than others.Atmosphere--9/10---Something i consider most important, and there is plenty of it here.Replay Value---4/10-Once your done i think to gamestop it will go, so its really just a rental unless you have little time to really get into the game, then by all means buy it. If you have the money, otherwise wait another 2 months when the game is 40 bucks or so, then it will be worth it.Overall-I would give the game an 7.5 even though my scores look higher. The whole reason is as a package game it really doesn't hit everything 100%, though it tries and does well its a great game for the people who will want it, what really  brings the game down a bit is little replay value if any for most. And the controls most people will find very unappealing, i myself thought it was pretty great but just can't justify the higher score i would if i could.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00BQI3UQG","description":"","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Donkey Kong Style","reviewText":"There has been no question about the Donkey Kong games over the years. Ever since the first one that broke the mold over 30 years ago, and launched Mario and Nintendo into the stratosphere, Donkey Kong had been one of those characters you have came to love time after time. While Donkey Kong Country had been a hit from the Super NES days, it failed to impress when it had came out for the Nintendo Wii. While the gameplay and design was stunning, the lagging control was definitely the loss of its shine that made Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong simply deliver. When Donkey Kong Country Returns came out for the Nintendo Wii, it had great graphics, brilliant storyline and a solid reintroduction to what made the Donkey Kong games so exciting, but what it lagged in was solid control. It was much harder to master for those who've been with the franchise for years from the Super NES era. Now, the franchise is bringing it back to the Nintendo 3DS, and it definitely works better.Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D for the Nintendo 3DS works better as a solid platform game for longtime fans, and for those who had a hard time playing the Wii version. The game goes back to the roots of the Donkey Kong Country games well, with expanding levels, and easier gameplay for die hard fans, as Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong try to save their land, and rescue their banana board from the clutches of the doom of the Tiki's. Graphically, the game picks up well from the Nintendo Wii, and the design very well onto the 3DS, while the control is much smoother than the Nintendo Wii failed to do. It had much tougher control, that outweighed the fun. The game also includes two new modes for the game. New mode, which can make it a bit easier for gamers that missed out on the original, and new never before seen levels that add to the fun. What does also lag, is that for those who have enjoyed the original game from the Wii, is that they might feel it is a bit easier and not as doesn't have the challenge. But nevertheless, there is a lot of fun in the game.Overall, what I did love about Donkey Kong Country returns for the Nintendo 3DS is that it had a lot of the fun that made the Wii version deliver, but make it worth its while for beginners and hard core fans as well. I got a game that was just exciting and challenging, as was before. It was definitely much more fun to play the second time around.  While it might be a drawback to those who have felt like they had a better time with the original, rest assured that you do get fun here for its money.Graphics: B+Sound: BControl: B 1/2+Fun & Enjoyment: B 1/2+Overall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2013"}

However the atmosphere itself is just plain down freaky.Each species (human alien and predator) have their own strenths and weaknesses, but I believe he human is the only really scary one which is what this game is about.

My kids don't have to sift through all the mature titles to get to the ones that suit them.  I was worried aboutXbox 360 4GB Console with Kinect, but my fears were unfounded.  Although there are some very mature games for Xbox, my kids are more interested in games compatible with Kinect.  Those games tend to be more family friendly.  Serious gamers want a controller.To further ease my fears, the Xbox features parental controls.  I can limit what types of games that are played, whether the children can connect to Xbox Live, what type of programming they can watch, etc.  There's even a timer I can set to limit their game play.  The privacy controls in Xbox Live are also very good.ROOM ESSENTIALSMy family room tends to be rather dark.  I thought there might not be enough light for Kinect to see, but that was not a problem.  I am amazed at how well it sees me and the photos it takes of us playing.Our family room is large, so space is not a problem.  That is something to take into consideration.  If you don't have some wide open space in front of the television, Kinect might not be a good idea.FINAL THOUGHTSI'm usingYour Shape Fitness Evolvedto work out and it's the best workout ever.  I simply can't cheat!  My kids haveKinect SportsandKinect Adventures!, and they're running and jumping like mad.  It's all very physical, a great way to get the heart pumping.What a wonderful system.  I am very happy with it.  I can't even think of anything that needs improvements.

The characters are completely uninteresting, look much too similar, and the comic book style text which breaks things up are as boring and dull as an episode of NYPD Blue.Max Payne should've (been cheaper) for the game itself is only about 10 or so hours long, has little to-no extras, and limited replayability.Shooting people in slow motion simply isn't enough to knock my socks off I guess.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2002"}

Nope.","reviewerName":"The Matrix Fan \"Video Gamer since 1979.\"","summary":"Does \"X\" marks the spot? **Spoiler Alert**","reviewText":"Code Veronica: X is, without a doubt, the hardest Resident Evil game in the franchise to date (and that includes the most recent addition, Resident Evil 4). This PlayStation 2 version is an improvement over the Sega Dreamcast version mainly because of longer cutscenes that help to explain the backstory of the Umbrella Corporation and Albert Wesker's involvement.There are a lot of monsters and bosses in this game - some are extremely hardy and take a lot of effort to defeat, others can simply be ignored to save your ammunition for later (trust me, you'll be needing all of it).It doesn't have the same scares as the first few versions; there are not many moments that will grab you and chill you to the bone as the first Resident Evil did on the orignial Playstation.So what makes a Resident Evil fan a true fan?Two words: Rocket Launcher.It's commonly known amongst Resident Evil fans that by finishing a Resident Evil game within a set time limit, you are rewarded with uberweaponry to use during your next play-through. The rewards (depending on the Resident Evil game you finish) can be anything from a laser to a Magnum with limitless rounds - but the common link between all of them is the ability to earn a rocket launcher.Capcom decided to make it extremely difficult to obtain the rocket launcher in Code Veronica: X. Here are the requirements (like them or loathe them) to get it:During the course of the game,(1) You cannot use any First Aid sprays(2) You cannot use the 'Retry?' option(3) You cannot save your game, except for one \"free\" save halfway through the game(4) You must save your partner character \"Steve\" quickly from one of the trap rooms(5) You must give a \"hemostat\" medicine bottle to a secondary character(6) And most importantly: you MUST finish the entire game in under 4 hours and 30 minutes. Watching movie cutscenes counts against your time.These are the most stringent demands to ever be put upon a Resident Evil player.In my humble opinion, Capcom almost made this TOO hard. A player has to be extremely sparing with ammunition, as every single bullet counts. It is clearly stated in the instruction manual to avoid as many zombies/monsters as possible to conserve your rounds for the bigger dangers that surely lay ahead, and having to save bullets when you don't know what's coming is a difficult task the first time around.Also, let's consider that time limit. Most gamers may not have a 2.5 hour block of uninterrupted time to finish a game, and I mean _completely_ uninterrupted. Pausing the game will not stop the clock from ticking - it only stops after the last credit has rolled.There are at least 3 moments in this game where the player will have to face a moment of \"live or die\". This means a player could be more than 3/4 of the way through the game, get killed in a trap, and would have to start over again from the halfway point. I can honestly say that this is the most infuriating part of Code Veronica: X - while quite a few gamers will finish, some will never attempt to replay to earn the rocket launcher.The camera angles are also an annoyance. Set backgrounds with a 3rd person character cause a lot of frustration because your character can be in a room that looks clear, take 2 steps, and be within arms reach of 4 zombies that you never saw because of the camera angle.If you're a true Survival Horror fan, this game is bound to keep you entertained and you'll have many hours of replay ahead of you trying to earn the rocket launcher.For the brand new survivalist, it would be best to try Resident Evil 1, 2, or 4 before gnashing your teeth into Code Veronica: X. it's best to learn to crawl before you walk.Happy Hunting!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2006"}

From the cardboard cutout quest handing NPCs, the quick travel, the \"safe\" zones, the re popping enemies, to loot grabbing, the fetch missions, to being built around coop, to allowing someone to jump into your game at any time, to the skill tree (1 skill point per level, three trees to put it in), the weapons all leveling up from rusty to devastating and beyond, dying causes a quick repop with some money missing, the enemies all leveling as you do, to the quest selection screen(you can pick up multiple quests at once)...well you get the idea. This game is everything borderlands is, plus it adds the occasional escort quest and has random junk like fallout 3, which you can use for weapon mods or selling for cash.So for anyone who is a fan of Borderlands and the MMORPG style level and item grind, this is a great game right? Well, I haven't mentioned the four things that prevent this game from living up to its' potential.1) No Local Coop: Some may disagree that this matters, but that's only because you happen to not live in a family of gamers. You can system link the game, or play on xbox live, but there is NO splitscreen, which is made more upsetting by the fact that the back of the case suggests splitscreen. The inability to play with my wife is frustrating beyond imagination, especially since \"all the bits and pieces\" are there to do it. If you base a game around coop, as dead island is (to the point several missions refer to you as several people), then they should actually have included coop, borderlands could handle it, so don't tell me it was a limitation of the hardware/software.2) Rapid Weapon Degradation: Having any weapon degradation in a game where you are killing hundreds of zombies was stupid enough, but they ramped it up in this game. Quite literally, you will be able to kill maybe 5 or 6 zombies per weapon. Some weapons are \"disposable\" and you will simply drop them. Others will simply stop doing damage, and you need to be careful else you end up surrounded my zombies with a weapon that does no damage.3) Rapid Zombie Repops: Very forgivable, as you'd expect a game like this to have repops. But where borderlands enemies only repopped when you left the area or quit and reloaded, dead island pops enemies at random, even in the same area you are in. The pops are sporadic, sometimes you can clear an area of zombies and come back 45 minutes later to find it still cleared, other times zombies will literally repop while your still in the same area. I remember killing a thug in a building, walking to my nearby car and walking back to find the thug repopped. If they cut the repopping down a bit, it would have made a big difference, especially with the rapid weapon degradation.4) Gameplay: Gameplay is a loaded word, so I will simply say this game is clumsier than other games of it's caliber, maybe this was to add suspense and fear, I don't know. Hits don't always register, which is frustrating for a game based on melee. Guns have very limited ammo, so using them is especially frustrating. Some zombies will latch on to you, forcing you to beat them off, from an indecipherable distance that seems to change from zombie to zombie. All in all, things just don't run as smoothly in this game.So, there is my opinion on dead island. This could have easily been a wonderful game, and certainly set itself up to be, but these four issues make the game fall flat on it's face. They took the general layout from borderlands, but made some choice decisions that prevented it from living up to potential. I didn't have any preconceived notions that this was a Fallout 3 with zombies or anything, so that doesn't effect my score. Still it just isn't as good as it could have been.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2011"}

It would have been nice to have character only quests and storyline.Weak zombie AI, you can just jump up on barrels and kick a horde of zombies to death without getting hurt.Wasn't too scary more FPS then a horror game.Less delivery boy quests.Bugs, I had to reset a few quests because I couldn't finish the quest due to problems with NPCs.  I get hit by zombies behind some walls.One quest, I needed to turn off three power switches at a gas station, because the water was electrify but I just ran up the ladder before I could get too badly hurt and completed the mission without  turning those switches off but when I went to turn in the quest.  The quest log told me to go back to turn them off. Why?Should be more fast travel locations.Pros:If you love melee combat then you loved this game. Kicking will be your best friend in this game. Firearms play a small role and you have very limited ammo.Large open world, but it does have its limitations. You will be warned if you leave the playing area.A lot of side quests to do, sadly most are delivery boy quests.Fun co-op if you can find some friends to play with.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2011"}

{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","reviewerName":"Shawn Bird","summary":"My 'The Last of Us' Review","reviewText":"You can honestly say a game pulls you into its world when you walk away emotionally drained. That is what The Last of Us does, it pulls you in and doesn&#8217;t let go until the credits roll. You will not want to put the controller down. It shows that sometimes the right thing to do won&#8217;t be what keeps you a live. It is about survival, hope, endurance and commitment. However, Last of Us is not without some glaring problems that can sometimes take your right out of the experience.The Last of Us is Naughty Dog&#8217;s spin on the apocalypse with zombie-esk infected people and even worse, humans willing to do anything and everything to get what they want and need in order to survive. The infection is fungal that grows on the brain. If you breathe in the spores, get bitten or scratched by a person infected, you become infected as well. The outbreak and cause is never really clear, but in The Last of Us it is not at all the concern. The game is not about exploring the reason that it happened, it is about the days after everything does bad. Humanity did what is basically expected to happen in an outbreak this day in age, which is come together in military cities were survivors deal in ration tickets. We are introduced to Joel, who at one time lead a pretty normal life with his daughter and brother until the outbreak happened. Then twenty years later Joel is a different man, he is a survivor. The whole apocalypse over the years has taken a toll on him. We also meet Tess, who is Joel&#8217;s feisty partner. It is unclear what they do for a living, but after seeking out someone that screwed them over leads to them being in charge of a young girl named Ellie. They take on the task of transporting Ellie to the Fireflies, a militia group that wants to establish order in the ways that the world use to be.Naught Dog has a legacy now of pushing the PlayStation 3&#8217;s hardware further than anyone else can. It has shown over the years with the Uncharted series. They have proven they can do more with a game than just about anyone else. They are able to do it once again here; being one of the main reasons it is hard to stop playing The Last of Us is the look and feel of the game. No matter how isolated, dark and dank the environment is, it always feeling alive and real. This also helps with trying to make every kill worth it and carry weight when it happens.The main obstacle in The Last of Us is survival. It is what matters most when going through the world that is laid out in front of you. Sure after awhile the body count on the game starts to get pretty high and starts to feel like a standard shooter, but the game is long and not easy. The Last of Us is not about killing everyone in the area; it is about getting out alive and preferably unnoticed. When you take a life, it is because there really is no other choice. That is how the game was developed. So that way Joel is not looked at as just a mass murderer and so that there is a line between Joel and the hunters out in the world that will kill you just because. It is a thin line to say the least, but it is there and like stated before, the body count does add up a lot by the end.Killing and staying unnoticed are not the only things about survival in the game. When combat is inevitable, this game is brutal and when you first start it can be hard. The more powerful infected have one hit kills that you can not counter until later in the game. There is also the whole pesky thing of being shot. Not only can one bullet take half your life, but sometime it will knock Joel back, even knock him to the ground at times which leaves him wide open for other shots to be taken or hits to come in from closer melee enemies. This can get annoying, but feels real enough that it is hard to argue it being a function in the game. Also your health does not regenerate at all. You have to heal yourself with med kits either found in the world or that you create using scraps of things you find in the world while searching around. Also every time you create a med kit or use one. It is done in real-time, the same goes for anything done with Joel routing around in his backpack. This adds tension to the already intense game, more so when it is in the middle of a fight. Everything that you use in the game can be made by crafting, but just like med kits it takes time and items found to do so. Although also like med kits you can sometimes find things as a whole lying around. You will be able to unlock things to make through out the game, such as Molotov cocktails, smoke bombs are more. You also pick up pieces here and there that can be used to upgrade weapons that you use in the game. However you can not upgrade weapons right out of the backpack, you need a work bench and those come few and far between.The Last of Us does give gamers a break though, somewhat when Joel needs to know what he is dealing with in an area. You can have him crouch down and he listens using the L2 button and everything turns to a grey and people or infected in the area will have a white outline to them. There is nothing special here or any kind of supernatural power that he has, it is just him using his twenty years of survival experience. It makes knowing where everyone is and the routes so much easier so you can plan your strategy and escape. If an enemy hasn&#8217;t made a sound that Joel has heard, then they will not show up in this listening feature. One of the things you can have in your inventory is a brick or a bottle, this is good in a situation when you know someone is near by, but can&#8217;t see them. Throw the brick/bottle to not only draw their attention, but to be able to see them and track what they do. The bricks and bottles you pick up can be used for offence as well. I had a situation of walking into a shed with a clicker and it started to get all riled up, so I threw my brick at his face, ran up and melee killed him. The gunplay can lead so similar scenarios too. I used a bow on a guy to take him out quietly, unfortunately someone was near him saw him go down. I quickly went into listen mode and noticed a baddie right next to me on the other side of the wall. As soon as I listened he came walking around so I instantly grabbed him and stabbed him with my shiv. The combat does a god job keeping you on your toes in situations that you have to fight.Be it sneaking around or in full on combat you always have plenty of cover to use. This tends to make it easy to predict the next gun fight in the game though, like so many other games have done. When you walk into a room and see things in place that you know you can hide behind, you can bet that you will be hiding or fighting in that area sooner or later. This is one of those situations that helps you remember you are playing a game. There isn&#8217;t really anything that can be done about it, just try not thinking about it when you see two cars lined up together. It is also in the combat situations that the AI of Ellie, Tess or whoever is with you horribly annoying and can really rip you out of the game. It is in these situations that the game is really glaring with problems that games for some reason still have not been able to over come. It is bad enough that when Ellie is following you, she is always right behind you. This makes it difficult to get around in small places, because you constantly run into her and can&#8217;t move. Then there is situation when in a fight you will be running to cover and she will go to that exact spot leaving Joel to stand (or if crouch if already crouched) in the open vulnerable to being shot. This is something that happens in games too often, worst was in Mass Effect 3 when both team mates would at times be standing behind you so you can&#8217;t move or get into a cover spot you were about to take. The thing about The Last of Us doing this that is really irritating and annoying is that your companions are ignored by the enemies constantly. Maybe Naught Dog did this so you didn&#8217;t have to worry about failing because of the stupid AI getting killed, I can respect that, but when Ellie literally runs into a bad guy and then around him to get behind cover on the other side of the room, it takes me right out of the game completely. On top of that it makes her needing cover useless which then makes her taking cover where I am about to take cover that much more infuriating. This is the one thing about the game I really hate and it wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if you didn&#8217;t find yourself in these situations so often. Again, you might not kill loads of people in an area, but the game is long and these situations add up after awhile.Ellie isn&#8217;t just another character in the game, she is a central point to the plot and when she isn&#8217;t stealing the cover or running right into baddies, she is joining the fight and can be very helpful in dire situations. Outside of constantly being right behind you, she is never annoying and a pretty fun character for her being a child. She is fourteen years old, loves comicbooks and knows nothing about the world before the infection. Her ignorance shows through to her innocents. It makes many of her reactions to things a bright spot in a dead world. Although the environment is full of brightness, so often the games graphics shows the world as still being bright and beautiful as planet life has consumed the majority of everything.The Last of Us comes across as more of a survival horror game than anything else. Yes it is mainly about survival, but when you enter a building, go into the listen mode and see four or five clickers and/or runner on the floor above you, you will get scared and wish you could go back out the way you came in. It is easy to find yourself hording everything that you find and make, although later in the game things get easier to make so you can say, use your shivs more often. Also by the time you get close to the end you have a good amount of weapons at your disposal, even if you might have a few bullets for each you will hardly have to worry about running out.The reason The Last of Us is so emotionally draining is because the characters are so emotional. Everything they go through, you feel it yourself. The acting in this game is beyond words, and it isn&#8217;t just the acting that makes scenes so great. It is also the motion capturing of the characters. Whatever it is they are thinking or saying you see it in the expressions on their face and in their eyes, making every reaction and conversation more realistic. This is once more something that pulls you into the game and makes you not want to put the controller down.Naughty Dog has been successful with making the Uncharted series a great series a long with having a decent multiplayer to go along with it. They pretty much do the same thing here as there is a multiplayer in The Last of Us. There isn&#8217;t much two it, you join either the hunters side or the Firefly side and you can play one of two different match options at a time. Now I have no played much of the multiplayer, so there is little I can say about it. The two types of game play is Supply Raid, which is more of a respawn game and not that much fun as everyone seems to just run around and not care. There is also Survivors, which is more of a tactical based game play were once you dies you wait and to win you have to takeout everyone on the other team or have more people alive on your team when the time runs out. This mode is the more fun for those that like teamwork and communication with their multiplayer shooters, like I do. I was having no problem with my team winning every time when I was playing with the one group because, we all stuck together and played as a team. There is a lot more depth to the multiplayer; unfortunately I have not had the time to really sink my teeth into it. For what I have tried it is not too bad for a multiplayer; however I will say it was unnecessary to have in the game.The Last of Us takes experiencing video games to a new level. Naughty Dog has out done themselves once again and also they raised the bar for gaming development like they have done in the past. The story, the characters, the environment and the action works together perfectly and mostly is all timed out just right. There is some very glaring problems with the game, but it is not at all enough to over look everything this game does right and very well. It is as if the Uncharted series was all just practice for this one title. The Last of Us is surely the best game this generation has to offer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2013"}

{"product_name":"B005EZ5GQY","description":"","reviewerName":"ShoppingGeek","summary":"Played it 5 times","reviewText":"After the first play-through, I didn't think I would want to play it again because it is so linear and no variety in the weapons and enemies, but it's turned out to be kinda fun. The main reason is that I had a lot of trouble with the missions the first time through, then on replays, realized that even though the game is linear, there is more than one way to approach a goal in a mission and almost every mission has a very easy way to play it once you know how. So finding the easy approach has been an interesting challenge.Plus I kept finding \"tricks\" to the game that I didn't find or understand at first.For example, when there is noise, some graphics appear in the upper-right corner of the screen. I didn't realize what that was for at first, but finally saw something about it disguising the noise you make. In most missions, the key to keep from getting swamped by enemies is to shoot foes when the noise graphic comes on. If he's isolated, nobody will know what's happened. Even if an enemy sees the guy go down, they can't tell where the shot came from and thus won't return fire.Another feature I didn't use much the first time is to use the binocular's right-trigger feature to mark as many opponents as possible with red arrows. Once the fighting starts, it's very helpful to know where the enemies are, especially if they try to outflank or charge you.This is really stupid, I know, but I didn't stumble across pressing up on the left analog stick to jump-zoom the rifle until after I played the game a couple of times, and that really made things easier, especially when shooting very distant and/or small targets like gas tank caps.Even though it is a fun game, I don't think that it is remotely close to being worth more than $30. While waiting for the price to drop, tryTimeshift, which I think is a much more interesting, fun game and it's currently under $20.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00029QQNY","description":"Shadow Hearts 2: Covenant is a deep, engaging strategy role-player that continues the story of the original Shadow hearts. In this sequel, World War I has started, and a cult has used the chaos to further their own ambitions. Yuri, the hero of the first game, will explore his new powers as he fights this new evil. An engaging strategy epic where you try to survive battles against secret cults and powerful, mysterious wizards.","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Grown Up RPG.","reviewText":"I loved Shadow Hearts, and was very excited when the sequel was announced. Finally I have played it, and I have to say I'm impressed. First of all, the graphics have been vastly improved, ditching the static backgrounds in favour of fully realised 3-D locations (albeit with fixed viewpoints, like Final Fantasy X), and improving on the character models too. In fact, the improvements put the first game to shame, and make it look positively primitive. Everything else has been retained, and in most cases, tweaked for the better. In many ways, Covenant follows the well-established RPG pattern, with a drawn out story involving much duplicity and world travel, many side-missions and secret locations (which, like in the first game, you may only stumble across by chance if you address the right character at the right time), a series of stand alone challenges or \"pit-fights\" for the completists, and so on. Where Covenant distances itself from the crowd is with the adult nature of a lot of the material, and the continuation of some rather twisted themes carried over from the first game. Re-appearing here are the \"graveyard\" that exists in the hero's unconscious mind, his ability to morph into various monsters, along with some very fruity dialogue, plus a really sarcastic approach to the usually ponderous aspects of some RPG's that actually made me laugh out loud once or twice (example - meeting the \"Ring Soul\"...you'll see what I mean). There are even quizzes and memory games on offer throught this adventure just to keep the variety up. And, once again, the musical soundtrack is very impressive, and this time there is a lot of well acted voice-over dialogue, which was sorely missing from the first game.Plus of course, there's the game's unique slant on battles, involving the Judgement Ring. Newcomers need to know that battle success depends on lightening reflex button pressing everytime this little beauty appears on the screen, and even though the general battle action is turn based, if you don't press in time with onscreen prompts for each turn, you won't get much out of the game. What's more, the game now introduces a new concept of combos, by which means you can choose the order of turns for your characters and have them carry out a chained attack, at the risk of leaving themselves more vunerable to enemy attacks (launching a combo requires that the characters all stand next to each other, which means the enemy can do a ranged area attack that hits everybody at once). The success of a combo requires even more lightning fast button jabbing than normal attacks, and if you mess up, you lose the linking and the turn usually passes straight to the enemy. But the effects can be well worth it, as a successful combo adds accumulated damage for each hit landed, plus a 4-person combo gives you the choice of a super-strong bonus attack as the last move. Suffice to say that in boss battles, you will definitely be combo-ing, and it can be really satisfying to see the massive damage you dish out for pulling off a perfect run.It's actually far easier to play in practise than it might appear described in writing, so don't get put off if all the above sounds a bit involved. As in the majority of RPGs, there are multiple playable characters, and they all have personal skills and strengths that you can have fun with during battles. As an aside, make sure you fully explore the in-game \"Help\" section, as it is an exhaustive guide to every option, function and upgrade available (of which there are many). The central cast of eight characters is very colourful to say the least, for example one of them is the Russian princess Anastasia Romanov!! This continues the Shadow Hearts tradition of taking real historical events and twisting them to fit it's own fanciful storyline (you'll also meet the famous Rasputin, but his contribution to the plot goes quite far beyond what appears in most history books!).As for any drawbacks I would probably have to mention that nearly every dungeon is a labyrinth which can cause unnecessary frustration after the fourth of fifth lap trying to find the way out each time. Plus again, the game is not really that difficult. If you do all or most of the side missions you will be almost invincible once you reach the final boss. However, the side missions are nicely themed so that each member of the party gets to take a \"starring role\" for once, which means that you will have played as all the characters at some point instead of just sticking to your favourites. And there aren't mulitiple endings this time, well, technically there are two, but you won't have any trouble recognising the point when you make the all important choice. Thats a plus in my book, as I hate being penalised with a bad game ending for missing something even though I worked hard!Newcomers to the series will have to wrestle with the minor trouble of several references to the first game, as Shadow Hearts Covenant is rare among RPG's in that it directly relates to the events of it's precursor. However, this isn't really much of a handicap, just more of a treat for those of us who played the first one. My ideal advice for newcomers is to grab both and work through the first one (it should be fairly cheap to buy now), as a starter before enjoying the second.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2005"}

Stathoulopoulos \"nick9155\"","summary":"Everything except Madden rapping...","reviewText":"Believe the hype, because Madden 04 is full of things to talk about.The Madden franchise has come a long way.  Madden 04 is probably just the beginning, too.  For one, all new EA Sports game are finally available with online play, the way it should have been when they released these systems with network capability long ago.  The game takes on a whole new aspect when you can play online and can upload NCAA 2004 rosters in the Franchise mode.That takes a level of dedication I don't have, but still, this game has plenty to keep you addicted.  The Franchise mode is big time.  You can control your team right down to the price of hot dogs and bobble head dolls at the stadium.  You get to think of everything: signing a coaching staff, moving teams, keeping prices competitive, trading players, drafting, developing talent, rebuilding teams and stadiums, keeping it all under the cap. And, oh yeah, you get to play the game, too.I could go on, but for better or worse, some highlights and gripes:- the graphics and game play are fantastic.  The animation is very detailed--you clearly see (and feel) people break off tackles with stiff arms, wrap-up tackles, jumping catches, the works.  You can make reads and adjustments on both sides of the ball in a hurry, exploit mismatches, you can even barrel over the guy holding the down markers when you run out of bounds (always a plus)- more Madden than even Madden can take.  The guy doesn't shut up throughout the game with his particular brand of inanity, and Al Michaels tries to keep it under control, even if he's obsessed with passes 'nearly picked off' or 'I don't know how he dropped that interception'- they seem to love a couple of things in this game: big plays, and turnovers.  The computer will step on the field and routinely deliver an 80 yard TD pass that will have you swearing at the TV.  It can get very frustrating when you make a defensive stand only to give up an 80 yard TD (complete with dive-and-miss-and-he's-gone tackling.  Also, some of the players are tuned up to the point where interceptions can be epidemic if you're not careful.  The good players are VERY good and will make you pay for mistakes- it's just a very big production in general.  They put a lot into this one, and the Franchise mode is full of details to keep you occupied till the wee hours.  They also dedicated a lot of time (and money, I'm thinking) to putting a ton of songs into the game, which can wear you down.  With every menu you get beaten over the head with a rap song (rapping about Madden and football) or a Blink 182 'power pop' tune or some Bubba Sparxxx. Naturally, before long you've heard them so many times you like them, which is the power of this age of synergy...But all in all, if you love Madden, this game really has something for everyone.  With every edition they make some change to the tendencies of the AI or of your teammates (some versions had a lot of sacks, some a lot of INTs, some pathetic AI, etc.)  But in general, the detail is amazing.  There's a lot to talk about it.  Or you can just go and buy the thing. Now.Warning: if you have a job, or are in school, your performance may take a dive as you become a full blown Madden addict.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2003"}

Admittedly this is the first time I've played a Splinter Cell game, but I was expecting much more from all the glowing, raving reviews I've read. The graphics look really great and the sound is spot on. The problem I have with it is the punishing difficulty level and the sometimes wonky controls. When I say difficult, I don't mean challenging difficult(I like that kind of difficulty) but frustrating difficulty. I won't go into great depth just to spare time, but I will point out one level as an example and a microcosm of what you can expect from the difficulty throughout the game. A lot of these levels are trial and error. One in particular gave me fits. The English Channel stealth level is ridiculous. Why? If you die you start back at the beginning, no matter where you are on the level. If you're detected you start over. In one area you're given two doorways to choose and if you choose wrong you get attacked by a dog and you start over. Trial and error. If you are spotted by light..... start over. Lasers? Check. Like I said, it's not just that level, but all throughout you experience the same level of difficulty whether it be stealth or straight forward action.To top it off, the controls don't always respond well. When I press X to hack into a satellite it sometimes won't work properly. I'll have to press the button multiple times for it to work. Also, for a stealthy guy Sam sure is clunky to control at times. I've made it about half way through the game, so far, and I don't really have an interest in going any further because of all the trial and error and somewhat problematic controls. Not only that but most of the levels I've played so far are not that original and are kind of boring. Yes, I know all the fan boys and nonbelievers will flog my review, but that's fine because this is just MY view and opinion of the game. If you like these types of games then go for it. Me, I'll pass and play something better. Ubisoft should have made a better save system and cleaned the controls up.EDIT: The only thing I'll say in response to Skynet's comment is this: Can you not read? Go back and read my review again. I said I LIKE challenging difficulty, not frustrating difficulty. This game is mainly trial and error and therefore is frustrating. It's not just me that's had beef with the games cheap difficulty. You can read all over the internet about it. If you like that ball of wax, then go for it, otherwise don't rag other people for it like a little punk. And if you think Splinter Cell is real, then you have much bigger problems you should be worrying about!BTW, check out Skynet's only review.... that pretty much explains it all.... parents really shouldn't let their kids have access to there amazon password, or play mature video games.

Now I have finally played the heck out of it, I thought I would summarize my thoughts on it.Watch Dogs is basically a open-world fusion of GTA and Assassin's Creed with Batman Arkham City thrown in. The story surrounds the protagonist Aiden Pearce who is a vengeful hacker against the new central ctOS system in Chicago after a hack job gone wrongand his family murdered. Aiden would use his hacking skill to exercise vigilante justice. This seems like a fresh idea but in reality hacking is simplistic and becomes repetitive over time.The open world environment and tons of side missions make it fun and addictive to play. You can drive, assassinate, shoot, blow things up or in whatever way you choose to get the job done. However, there are disappointed and terrible moments as well. Driving is not exactly enjoying because the control is not fun and it's hard to see what's in front especially in a fast car. Also, sometimes things get absurd like blowing up a fence but the fence remains standing, or you get a clean escape from cops in a boat because they are too hydrophobic.The single player mission would take you many hours to complete especially if you have to do all the side missions and quests. However, this could be repetitive and diminish your desire to finish it. Multiplayer is fun but lacking at times. There is virtually no co-op game mode. Instead, you get a variety of competitive game modes to play. Two modes I like the most are Intrusion and Decryption. They offer some unique gameplay which is different from the online military shooters that I've grown to love.Watch Dogs received so much hype and also got delayed because Ubisoft Montreal said to need more time to finish it. Now the finished product is a mixed bag. While it's fun and addictive, it also has terrible moments in which I almost threw my controller at the TV. There is plenty of room for improvement. It's like a lot GTA with innovative hacking scheme, but not as polished and grand as GTA. Anyhow, I would give this game 4 stars, for its innovative hacking gameplay.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2014"}

The new faction to the series is the Empire of the Rising Sun, derived from Imperial Japan, with an all-new cast of units and characters.The three factions have many differences, exemplified by their wildly different types of units. The Soviets, for example, have armored attack bears, Allies have the Dolphin ship which can high jump and use a sonic attack, and the Empire of the Rising Sun features such quirky units as a giant transforming mecha and ninjas.

This game has all of the old favorites like Taxi, Gorgar, Black Knight, Space Shuttle, Funhouse, and Pinbot with all the lights, bells and whistles.  The thing I really like about the games are the sounds.  They're just like the real thing.  Even the metal sound of hitting the ball seems real.Pinball Hall of Fame is also a great party game because you can play with up to four people and it isn't the type of game that requires deep concentration or a long period of time to play.  And even someone who hasn't played pinball before can have a good time.  It's fun, lively and the lights and sounds add to a party atmosphere.  I could see playing a game like this at a superbowl party while waiting for the game to start.  Or after a big Thanksgiving dinner when everyone would normally be crashed out.

The graphics are absolutely amazing, view distance, dynamic environments.  The look of this game is everything of Far Cry 2, with even more gasps of awesome.You play the part of Rico Rodriguez, a CIA agent who is about the most physics breaking mass of testosterone I have ever seen.  You are dropped into a large, open country to drop an evil dictator out of power by working with several different factions.  To do this you have mass amounts of vehicles at your disposal, a multitude of guns and explosives and most importantly, a grappling hook and parachute.This last part is the best part of the game.  Using the hook, you can climb objects, access flying vehicles from the ground, pull people out of air and even tie object together.  Tie someone to a barrel and blast the thing into space to see some real fun.Initially, the game did not impress me.  The story and mission parts of the game reminded me of Far Cry 2.  Lots of repetition and little development.  Then I hit a point where I slammed my car into another car and flew them both off a cliff.  Seeing myself falling I decided to use my grappling hook to escape, but only managed to snare another bystander.  In the end I opened a parachute and glided to safety all while watching one of the most insane wrecks ever.  The game is full of stuff like this.  Tie a motorcycle to a car and use it as a wrecking ball.  Rope a plane and ride it around just because you can.  So many times I found myself asking \"Man wouldn't it be cool if I could to this?\"  Moments later, I did.At this point I found that the point of the plot and game is actually secondary to the extreme sandbox fun in there.  At points of my new found enjoyment, my wife actually thought I lost my mind due to the non-stop laughter and childlike joy radiating out of me.  The fun factor of this game is higher than anything I can imagine playing lately.  Honestly, this game is pure sandbox first, and an actual game third.  Also, your destructive acts are rewarded with guns and vehicles.  How many games honestly reward your childlike explosive needs?As for the lack of XP support, well we saw this coming.  Not many people cried that Halo didn't work on windows 3.1, so we really just need to move on here.  DirectX 10 will simply not work on XP, and the look and feel of this game is something so amazing that you just need the best to make it happen.If you are on the fence about getting yet another FPS in a time where they are roaming the earth, get off on this side now.

Use this ONLY, the regular application icon will give you the freezing issues, in single player. Multiplayer works as well using this. The biggest thing is that this is not made for WINDOWS 8 it needs a patch. Using windows 7 the game does not crash, starts fine, runs flawless. Obviously DICE, EA did NOT have this in mind when they screwed everyone on it. I mean assuming everyone is using windows 7 is ludicrous, 8 has only been out a year, and many are/were given know choice when buying a gaming rig, or laptop. So for all you windows 7 users, you're lucky. Like myself I have a large gaming rig I've had for about 4 years that's never let me down. My Asus Gaming laptop on the other hand will not run it, mainly because of WINDOWS 8. Also games still have compatibility issues with laptop GPU's, something you thought would have been a thing of the past. The game is good thus far since i FINALLY have gotten to play it, graphics are a big better than BF3, most shadows, better textures, incredible lighting effects, great sound, the works. So the only thing I can really say is, if you can go back to windows 7. I never have liked windows 8 and never will. Just like with Vista, and at one time even 7, they KNOW there will be issues launching these games on a new operating system.My final thoughts, incredible game made by a bunch of morons who obviously don't know jack when it comes to what the general public will be USING.NEXT TIME THINK ABOUT COMPATIBILITY WITH WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BE USING EA!!!

Seemingly squished between the R and the face, this button is not used by all games, but is a pain to try to hit without straining your hands.The right \"C\" stick is another odd addition.  Featuring heavily in games like \"Luigi's Mansion\", this control pales in comparison to the analog sticks of the XBox or PS2, or even with the directional pad of days gone by.That being said, this is a first-party controller, and your movements on it are translated precisely to the game you are playing.

'i shot that guy in the face 15 times! and he didn't die!!!' was a common shout coming out the basement.but i perservered.  and i was rewarded.thankfully, leveling up doesn't take to terribly long.  it's pretty quick actually.  i was able to add attachments to my guns, get better body armor, etc, etc, and most importantly, figured out how to shoot the enemy in the face and actually kill them. i realized that given the number of players on the battlefield, if you only had to shoot the enemy once or twice to kill them, the map would be a huge pile of bodies, all the time. therefore, you have to hit them MANY times for them to go down.  sure, it's still frustrating sometimes, but it is what it is.the most rewarding aspect of MAG is the objective-based, teamwork mindset. and MAG definitely requires teamwork. objectives are clearly laid out and you get points for following orders and objectives. if you buy this game and don't have a headset, get one. without it the game is infinitely less rewarding. it's pretty exciting to head in to battle with your squad while your squad leader is telling you which way to go and from which side to flank. it's also great to bring buddies back to life with your magical blue mist aerosol medical kit [good move by the game developers to give more points for revives than for kills]. shouting a few 'hooras' to your teammates after winning a tough battle is great, as is hearing your platoon leader direct a string of expletives to a band of snipers hiding at the back of the map and not contributing.  speaking of poor teammates, yes, you can kick them off your squad by vote, even in the middle of the game. awesome.i've read a lot of posts on the official MAG boards and it seems the developer, zipper, is very dedicated to this game. hopefully we'll get more maps [sorely needed], more character upgrades, and a MAG 2.it's not a perfect game, but it's a fun and highly addictive game. and most importantly, it's an important, and needed, step in the great world of competitive, on-line gaming.  if you're not sure about it, rent it. buy it used, or borrow it from a friend. i'm pretty sure you'll end up buying it.VALOR!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2010"}

Gamers assume the role of Marcus Reid, a former criminal turned cop. True Crime: NYC is a vast improvement over its predecessor, True Crime: Streets of LA. This latest version is more in depth, giving gamers the chance to explore an expertly recreated Manhattan island while fighting crime in your own morally ambiguous way.True Crime: NYC takes you on a unique journey through the eyes of an NYPD cop with criminal ties and background. As Marcus players bust criminals, take down gangs, extort, interrogate, search and seize and dispense justice, either by the book or by indulging in the temptations of the job. However, your choices do affect the city, if crime goes unchecked, the crime rate will soar and the streets will fill with trash, potholes and unsavory characters.Gameplay this time around is much better; developers have improved most aspects of the game from hand-to-hand combat to gunplay and driving. Environmental interaction allows players to access almost everything in the game that can assist, from listing stovetops to locking suspects in freezers. And you get to do it all with an all-star cast that includes the voice talents of Laurence Fishburne (\"Cornbread!\") and the original Frank White, Christopher Walken. Plus, with more than 80 songs, the in game soundtrack is off the hook, featuring music from DMX, Redman and Jay-Z (to name a few). If you are familiar with the past version of True Crime you will be pleasantly pleased with the new and improved New York City.The game carries an \"M\" rating and more than likely should have a parental advisory sticker as well for language and content.

Kill monsters, find the keys, advance to the next floor, and collect treasure. Kind of repetitive, but fun. Another thing in the dungeon is the medals. Do certain things in the dungeon to earn medals where you can trade them with Mayor Need for items like a hot bikini for Monica! :) You fight as Max or Monica.Max battles with wrenches and hammers and even has a gun.

She can turn into monsters, too. But I don't like the monster system, to tell you the truth.One last thing. The weapons. You can level up your weapon and transform it once you meet the conditions like raising its flame or chill etc. Pretty neat.THE CAMERA: You can take pictures when you get the camera. Look in Max's room for a photo album. The pictures you take can be used as inventions such as items, clothes, and parts for Steve. Look out for scoops, pictures of neat things. Like when you first fight Linda the elephant, take a picture when she raises her legs.FISHING: You can catch fish, too. You can cook them, raise them in an aquarium once you invent one, and even mini-games like the Fishing Contest and Finny Frenzy.SPHEDA: A golf style game where you put a sphere in a time distortion and earn rare treasure.

The opening UI is incredibly complex, but unlike Homeworld 2, it's user-friendly and a brief run of the first tutorial and some experimenting will have you more or less under control soon enough.Being as it was developed by the same people who released Galactic Civilizations II, it has a similar feel to it, and similar look.  Thankfully, though, there is no turn system, and everything happens in real time, and best of all, you can micro-manage your battles instead of, as in GalCiv2, gambling 6,000 troops against 43 and somehow having the computer LOSE the battle for you in an insanely bad play of rock paper scissor or the like.Unlike Galactic Civilizations II, though, everything is geared towards war, more like a typical Real Time Strategy, with a focus on acquiring credits through tax and trade, metal and crystals through mining, and slowly upgrading your ships and your planet to be better at everything.This is all well and good except for the fact that the computer, your enemy, seems to borrow a bit from the \"excellent AI\" of GalCiv2 (at least a Normal enemy) and tends to blaze past all the quickest and easiest upgrades for expansion, and expands to fifty eight billion different solar systems while you're still trying to figure out whether to spend half of your entire treasury on giving a 3% boost to metal production or a 5% boost to laser damage.As I was totally overwhelmed early on, I tried changing the computer to an Easy one.  The only effect this has had on me was that instead of the computer blazing to become an Imperial Empire fifty thousand billion times bigger than the Roman Empire in seventeen minutes and then burying you under endless amounts of fleets when you can only just afford 5 basic fighter vessels, the computer would do the exact same thing, except they would almost never attack you, and once you attack back, no matter how many ships you have in comparison, their ships will flee the system.What also becomes incredibly frustrating is how tiny everything is in the system, and how incredibly stuffed with wireframepictures the left side of the screen becomes as you colonize more and more planets/asteroids and build more and more ships, that micromanagement no longer increases at a steady rate, but at an exponential rate, which can see someone like me, who can barely micromanage ONE planet while exploring systems with a small fleet, and the next phase involving having to micromanage SIX planets and TWO MASSIVE attack fleets, while my ally is being attacked in three different systems about five systems away from me, behind enemy lines, and screaming at me for not helping.Some other problems with the game I've had include the fact that all your enemies, regardless if you've never touched them or if you've exterminated their homeworld, will want to give you missions running the gamut from \"Give me money\" to \"Kill my enemies\", and failing these missions will make them hate you (though the \"Hate-O-Love-O-Meter\" can't go below 0).  You cannot give them missions.The HP to Damage system is badly unbalanced, in which even the most basic warship will have between 400-600 HP, and that same warship will do at best, 6 damage.  This means that spacebattles will be a strenuous, stressful affair with you pounding away with dozens of ships on an enemy, while they do the same to you, with no clear result happening unless they decide to run away or reinforcements arrive to speed the destruction along.  This also makes bombing planets/asteroids a tedious affair which can see you having your capital ships stay in one place for many minutes just bombarding one planet because they have 6000 HP and each slow-to-fire bomb does 20 damage.And through all this, no matter what the difficulty level, the computer is a master of micro-managing itself and expanding with all the speed of the Black Death.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000MUXLOK","description":"InBurnout Paradiseplayers are treated to a rarity in the video games universe: a complete reinvention of an established franchise that equals, if not betters any of the previous games in the series. Yes, this is a large claim, but one that can be explained in a single phrase: Next-Gen Freedom.Driver's heaven is a wide open worldIn Paradise City even cars can fly.View larger.Go for broke in 'Marked Man' Mode.View larger.Nothing is off limits, even head-on crashes.View larger.Start a race any time with 'Easy Drive.'View larger.Although theBurnoutseries&#146; over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console,Burnout Paradiseis the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"ChomskyKnows \"ChomskyKnows\"","summary":"open-world is welcome, but why remove CRASH mode?","reviewText":"My credentials: long-time gamer, played many a game, many a racer, have my Burnout license and nearing the Elite license. Burnout, in my opinion, has always been the most fun and easiest racer to pick up and play. It's not a SIM and of course isn't trying to be...So here's the pros and cons vs other racers, other arcade racers, other Burnout franchise releases and the 360 vs PS3 versions.PROS- Burnout is easy to pick up, easy to understand, easy to play...obviously there is some challenge.- open-world racing is the future and it is a much better presentation- ROAD RAGE takedowns are easier and more fun- realism of the textures, physics and the environment seem to have been improved. The attempt here is for a real city, not fake arcade racer routes with the gigantic \"for dummies\" lighted arrows telling you where to go- they've added some more things to do such as parking, jumps, crash through billboards and gates, etc...there are tons of these.- it wipes the mat with other \"fun\" racers like Flatout, which can be so difficult and frustrating (for some) the fun is simply turned down to zero...- racing games are probably the most frustrating of any gaming genre (RPG, FPS, whatever). Burnout is the least frustrating of any racer ever.- crashing into things doesn't (always) crash your car as per previous Burnout installments- achievements (360-only) are no longer impossible, as it was with Burnout Revenge...- popping in-and-out online is easy- you can put your own face on your license if you have a cam. Mine has my middle finger.- helpful \"turn indicators\" letting you know when you need to turn (because you are flying at a million miles an hour - you'll need `em)NEUTRAL- open-world racing isn't new. Criterion seems to think they have created some kind of next-gen revolution here. Test Drive Unlimited did this already and did so successfully (and technically so has Grand Theft Auto if you allow it to partially be in the genre). TDU clearly isn't as much fun as Burnout, but it isn't supposed to be. Criterion could learn some things from Eden games and vice versa.- no upgrades. TDU has a tinge of SIMs flavor where you collect money, properties and cars. Win more races, collect more cars, upgrade upgrade upgrade. Upgrades give you more to do. Sort of like an RPG. Burnout has none. You just get a new car, done, that's it.- TRAFFIC ATTACK has been removed, but in REVENGE, the dollars would pop-up blocking your view making that event difficult and annoying anyway- ELIMINATOR is gone, but I don't miss it that much- TAKEDOWN REVENGE is gone. Whatev.- PS3 vs 360 versions: barely a discernable difference and hat's off to Criterion for caring about both platforms. 360 gets achievements; PS3 gets sixaxis (which could be a blessing or a curse if they don't know what they are doing...see LAIR). Whatev.CONS- some idiot thought it was a good idea to remove one of the most fun things in the most fun racer of all time: CRASH MODE. They replaced it with this horrible Katamari-esk \"SHOWTIME\" thing where you just perpetually roll and bounce off of cars because that's definitely more realistic and fun... This is unforgivable. CRASH events were formerly an integral (AND FUN) part of Burnout in which you couldn't progress through the game without completing them. I could giggle for hours doing these events where you cause millions of dollars of damage by slamming into huge tanker trunks. Now, you don't need to even do them at all, and why would you, since they're no longer fun whatsoever. They had a great opportunity to create some epic accident scenes here where hilarity would ensue. This is like playing HALO and discovering they took out plasma grenades...EPIC FAIL!!!!!!!!- AFTERTOUCH is gone. Another one of the most innovative, cool and fun things to do...GONE. FAIL!- CRASHBREAKER is gone. Yet another EPIC FAIL! This was incredibly fun to both do and watch...- the little trophies for performing this or that trick are gone.- the BURNING ROUTE events which are supposed to give you better versions of your vehicle often give you equal or even worse versions...- stats for some vehicles don't seem to make sense. The 4x4 truck is supposed to be as tough, but faster than the van, but I've played with both for quite awhile and there's simply no way in h*ll the truck is faster than the van.- no instant retry/restart race. What? Why? You have to drive all the way back to restart...- no split-screen vs. Huh? What's that about? I can't have a buddy sitting right next to me play with me? WTF?- DJ Atomica is a massive tool. I have nothing against his sexual preference. Frankly, I think it's none of our business. I fully support gay rights 100%. But aside from all that, this guy is completely annoying.END RESULT: Criterion has given with one hand but taken with the other. Open-world is a nice and pleasing presentation and takedowns are as fun as ever, but the removal of MANY of the things that made game fun to play in the first place is puzzling...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0010EI6T2","reviewerName":"M. Donnelly","summary":"Fun in bursts, but rent before buying if you can","reviewText":"Rainbow Six Vegas 2 is overall a solid game.  However, it is not without its problems.  It's generally a guarantee that, with the right person, split-screen will be more fun than standard single player mode, although this is the case with almost any game of this sort.Story mode is entertaining.  It's a standard iteration of the Rainbow Six games for the most part.  You have your weapons loadout to start missions, where you can choose from a variety of assault rifles, submachine guns, sniper rifles, etc to help you on your mission.  As you finish missions and gain experience, you can increase your rank in the game, which comes with upgrades to appearance.In addition to leveling up your rank, you can also earn three specific lines of upgrades by accomplishing certain goals in one of three categories--get a headshot to score marksman points, kill an enemy in close range combat for \"CQB\" points, or blow an enemy away with something explosive for assault points, for example.  There are 20 ranks in each category, the rewards of which alternate level by level between giving you experience toward ranking your character up overall, and unlocking new weapons to use from your weapons loadout.Ultimately, the game has a few problems, mostly enemy related.  It can be frustrating seeing enemies who know where you are even if you've been just about dead silent, and remained out of sight.  It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it is nearly bad enough to merit yelling at the TV.  The other problem I have is enemy spawning. It's worst in \"Terrorist Hunt\" mode.  In R6V2, enemies spawn as you approach certain points in maps.  I suppose it's to save processing and graphical power, but still, it's problematic.  There have been occasions when I have opened a door, gotten ready to charge in with a smoke grenade and my thermal goggles, and before I could do all that, I had to take out an enemy that literally appeared in front of me.  His back was turned so I got the first shot, but even so, this sort of thing is sloppy and takes away from the gameplay.Still, the inclusion of split-screen makes me happy, as does certain abilities, like the ability to equip a silencer on most weapons, or switch between full auto, burst, and single shot mode.Ultimately, I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to play locally on one TV screen.  If, on the other hand, you'd prefer playing a shooter online, I would advise checking out Call of Duty 4 as an alternative.  They are 2 somewhat different games, as CoD4 is not based on squad actions, but in the end I think it is a higher quality game, unless the split screen/cooperative gameplay is a big deal to you.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2008"}
{"product_name":"B007SRM5U6","reviewerName":"Christopher Engel","summary":"Ridiculous cover aside, a very immersive Batman simulator","reviewText":"Despite the obvious fact that the cover art is one gigantic advertisement and looks like it's still in the outside plastic wrapping that often dresses media to entice people (it's actually the genuine cover, which is just mind-blowing), this is still pretty much everything you could hope for, if you want to put yourself in the Batsuit and act accordingly.It is, of course, another game that still has missing DLC despite looking as if it includes *all* DLC (the Mortal Kombat: Komplete Kollection also suffered this, since the Vita version added far more content, not even including the Vita-specific features, just the loads of costumes and a few other significant things not in the Komplete Kollection), and honestly, it looks so ridiculous that I would be embarrassed to have this in my collection, as opposed to the original cover art. Seriously, it's downright embarrassing to pull this out of your collection, since it destroys the \"Batman: Arkham City\" part in favor of \"10 OUT OF 10 BEST GAME EVER MADE TETRIS KILLER\" etc...But if you can get past that, it's still a good deal for anyone who does not yet own Arkham City.If you own Arkham City already, though, this just isn't enough to warrant a second purchase. Then again, this has been a trend with pretty much every single \"special/collector's/complete/ultra mega super arcade\" edition lately. Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade was a bad joke that actually made its predecessor, Super, look better in comparison. Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3? Same deal: New DLC that was probably out the day you got it. Heck, they haven't come out with a genuine \"complete collection\" to my knowledge for a long time besides perhaps those special Vita editions of classic games. Disgaea 3: Absence of Detention had more Vita-specific postgame content in *ADDITION* to *ALL* DLC that had already been released, even if you took out grinding completely, the postgame bonus campaigns made up for more content than the entire main game itself. Throw in all the classes, extra characters, skills, and the countless other additions to the original, and it was pretty much Disgaea 3.9, even including quite a bit of content from Disgaea 4.So, while you're not going to get that kind of level of content, this is a good collection...But it looks so incredibly awful that I honestly wouldn't get it just for that. I would feel dirty picking it up and would probably skip the so-so DLC and just get the original, which is perfectly fine on its own, with no critical DLC that radically changed the gameplay. Even the Harley Quinn stuff, I've heard, is just more of the same. So, whatever your preference, you may wish to just stick to the original, even if you don't already own the game.But, my God, who was in charge of designing this disgusting cover art? I'm really tempted to take a star off just for how absurdly stupid and cheap-looking it is.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2012"}

And I really love the main theme music.Yes, there are some glitches as others have pointed out, but it isn't anything that would keep you from completing the game or any particular mission. Sometimes it's a bit frustrating because one of your team members may get stuck somewhere (running into a wall, for example, and vehicles running into invisible barriers) and thus you might need to restart a mission. And at times your Bravo team members, which you control, don't seem to do exactly what you tell them to do. And so in some cases you might need to find a creative way of finishing a particular objective - in other words do it yourself rather than asking the Bravo team to do it. But most of the time, this wasn't an issue, and the other team members can really come in handy on some missions when you need the fire support.There are so many weapons and vehicles in this game that you can pick up and use, or drive, in the case of the vehicles. Dune buggys, Humvees, small boats, military transport vehicles - really the only thing missing I think was a tank or helicopter. That would have been cool. And the detail is so good on the vehicles and weapons, that you really feel like you are driving a Humvee or shooting a gun turret.This game is much better than Metal Gear 2 in my opinion - it's just much more fun and interactive.A tip for you: you should allow enough time to complete a mission before you begin. Missions on average took me 45 minutes to an hour to play. There are checkpoints, but the checkpoints aren't saved when you power off the PS. You always restart at your last completed mission.The game is broken down into 3 campaigns: Morocco (North Africa), South Asia (off the coast of India, I think), and Poland. Morocco has 6 missions, South Asia 3 missions, and Poland 5 missions. The entire game was fun, but I preferred the Morocco and Poland missions. Be prepared to use stealth on 2 of the Poland missions. I liked that this game ended strong - the Poland missions were just as fun as the Morocco missions - maybe even more. Sometimes games kind of peak in the beginning or middle and then the end is a let-down, but not here.Another thing I really appreciated about this game was the open feel to it. It's not too linear. Of course you must proceed from checkpoint to checkpoint but it's a much more open environment than many other games I've played on the PS2.Graphics/Environments 8.5 out of 10Music 8 out of 10Story 7.5 out of 10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2009"}
