It's one of the few games that I had, then sold, and now wish I hadn't sold. It's really quite fun. Fortunately I kept my game saves from this, so if I rent or buy it again, I can pick up where I left off. In many ways it's a typical JRPG, but has some WRPG elements too. It's a great story with likable characters, fun gameplay and a lot of charm. Recommended for RPG fans.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2011"}

So along with books and movies, gaming can also create a horror atmosphere but whether or not it succeeds really depends on how well they pull it off and whether or not you're into that kind of thing. F.E.A.R (First Encounter Assault Recon) is one of the more well-known games in the horror field so with the sequel coming up really soon, I thought I'd check it out and my general feeling is not one of disappointment or amazement but somewhere in the middle: the gunfights and horror elements work well but then they just didn't get to me either the other times.Story: You play as the \"Point Man\" a special operative in the F.E.A.R who's job it is to terminate one Paxton Fettel, who's taking control of enhanced soldiers via psychic abilities and taking control of a government building. You're sent in to deal with this threat but something's aren't what they seem: visions fade in and out, sounds are heard with nothing around and a strange apparition of a young red-dressed girl keeps showing herself to her. Her identity, as well as yours, is the basic for the game.The problem is...I didn't really care. I mean the whole story about Alma is interesting but the problem is that it's very easy to get lost in the narrative even though it's a pretty simple tale. Unlike the Half-Life 2 games where characters spoke in cutscene directly in front of you and even optional subtitles can be called in, Fear on the other hand has a really small window on the top left for who's talking where I literally had to lean in close and squint just to make out the names (even though your health and ammo counters are pretty fat numbers). It's a really immersive environment and the atmosphere is quite tangible like any good horror story but it's the actual narrative that is either uninvolving or just hard to figure out.Graphics: Originally released for the PC, Fear makes it way onto the Xbox 360 and its apparently inferior port onto the PS3 (like the Orange Box it seems) and graphically it's hit-or-miss. Facial animation is quite good and the lighting is very convincing in mood and seeing ripples and bullet trails in slow motion is awesome however the repetitive level design and same-y looking rooms and corridors kind of drag this down. Where the experience really goes into the cool zone is the weird visual tricks the game employs to mess with you which range from split-second frame inserts to vanishing people to temporary location moving (one time I went from a corridor/room to a long hallway with blood on the ceiling and back and again...don't know what the hell that was about but sweet!). It does get a bit old seeing another \"did I just see...?\" image but by that point, you've been playing for so long, you buy into it. Slowdown is apparently in some cases but it's usually for the big fights anyway.Sound/Music: Sound design is quite stellar from the gunfire blasts to the weird ambience of the locales to the bizarre encounters, everything is delivered well. Like most horror, well...GOOD horror anyway, they knew when to use sound effectively whereas most directors have to shock you by turning up the sound really, really loud for 2 seconds, Fear likes to play tricks on you: silence and something's coming right? Well not always. Sometimes cues come up for you to get ready only there's nothing, turn than BAM! Voice acting for the most part is good but again, the characters aren't really that engaging so it's a case where I didn't mind the voices themselves, just who the voice was attached to.Gameplay: For the most part, Fear plays like a typical shooter: guns with up to 3 available at a time, grenades which range from remote controlled to proximity to simple frag and melee attacks. The big selling point is the idea of using your superhuman reflexes and slowing down time to mow down enemies which strange as it sounds, is awesome yet weirdly out-of-place in a horror game. It's like John Woo's Hard Boiled by way of Ju-On or the Ring and while in firefights, it's incredibly useful (not to mention smirk inducing) its implementation into a horror game works well enough but then you wonder: shouldn't the game be more terrifying if I can't knock my enemies senseless? Oh and one issue: on the D-pad, left and right are used as a kind of tilt to basically see around edges without having to physically move however the flashlight is your down and in many cases I'd try to tilt only to have my flashlight turn on at the same time and the AI is so good, they'll point out your flashlight and you're going \"aw hell\" and forgo your plans for stealth and just Rambo the buggers.The game isn't necessarily difficult and the times I died were really my fault since I'd rush in or wouldn't plan things out but then on occasion, there'd be an absolute moronic move on part of the developers that got my blood boiling. Example: one mission I won by the skin of my teeth with barely any health left (if you go below 25, you regenerate to that point, the rest is up to you with scattered med kits and body armor) and was airlifted by helicopter. Only here's the stupid part: they didn't bring me back to full health. I mean, this is my squad, my brothers in arms and they can't even bring me to full 100%? So when I landed, we were ambushed, 2 guys came out and shot me to death and going into slow-mo didn't help because there was 3-4 others on the roof anyway. Like what the hell?F.E.A.R is the kind of horror game where it's a cool experience when the game tries to completely mess with you but then when it goes into shooter mode, it feels a bit...stock, a bit too \"I've seen this before\". At least Monolith's own Condemned games changed FPS playing a bit but this just feels like everything else I played, only without the creepy girl. It's well worth a go but I wouldn't call it flawless either.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2009"}

When I went into this game, I didn't completely know what to expect. I'd heard this was supposed to be a dungeon crawling RPG. I'd seen comparisons drawn between Demon's Souls and this; never in a million years would I have thought that it would have been so similar to Gears of War, but it was. This game is a far cry from an RPG. That's ok though, I loved Gears of war. A forewarning to those coming into this game expecting an RPG, get the thought out of your head. This is as much an RPG as God of War, Ninja Gaiden 2, or Gears of War is one; that is to say, it isn't. Some minor customization doesn't make a game an RPG.Basically, the game plays like a dark fantasy (as opposed to dark science-fiction) Gears of War, cross to some extent with Dante's Inferno for combat. It actually works, but there are issues.Story: 7/10The game is fairly weak here. There is very little character development or back-story to them. Aside from the banter exchanged, there is little to go on. They are obviously friends, and their motivation is money, but aside from that, there is nothing more to their actions. As for the actual main-story, there is an evil horde (comprised of Minotaurs, Wargar, spiders and dragons) that has subjugated the towns people and are using them for slave labor...your job: you are hired to liberate them (more or less). There are also side characters (witches, etc.), but it's not really much more complicated than this.Graphics: 7/10While the graphics aren't bad, they aren't great either. They are basically a little like the game: Darksiders , albeit less refined. That said, the designs are quite good and there are a decent variety of enemies to fight through. A few are recycled, but that's typical of this genre.The effects are quite average to be honest. The shading work could have been better, there are also quite a few artifacts (e.g. when you prompt the glowing light for guidance), and there are quite a few jagged lines, but a lot of it is forgivable.Audio: 7/10The soundtrack is average. There isn't anything epic here that will likely make you remember the game for its great music (much like Gears of War 2 - the music was average in contrast to the original game where Embry Square and the Locust theme were quite memorable). Similarly, the dialog is delivered largely monotone, and what dialog is presented (especially in game), is usually reused so much so that you will get sick of it by the end (e.g. \"Look! Another door!\")Game-play: 8/10Where the game is lacking in the other areas, it more than makes up for here. The combat is fun. I played this solo and for the most part had a great time. I played E'lara and sniped like crazy. There weren't a multitude of bows to choose from (slow and high powered, medium speed and medium powered and fast and low powered). Basically from these, you get various drops you can use (I chose medium because I wasn't quick enough on the triggers to take advantage of the fast paced ones) many of which have a limited enchantment on them making them much more powerful (e.g. In Chapter six I found one that was around 490 for standard power and enchanted to well over 1200 - that was a beast).The movement was also quite smooth, you could dash long distances and dive roll ala Gears of War. There was also a hack and block element to the game too that wasn't unlike Darksiders. Attacks were quite smooth, and evasion through dive rolls could generally be done mid-way to cancel (not always though).In regard to co-op there were quite a few attacks which worked well together, e.g. the levitate attack of your partner helped you to take out quite a few enemies in tandem. All in all, the game-play was quite cleverly done through elements like this.Despite the positive aspects of the game-play, there were negatives as shall be outlined below.Firstly: there were a few too many hordes of enemies for my liking. Basically, once you turned a corner, you got three waves of enemies. This aspect got a little repetitive. It would have been nice if there were less enemies so that you could play a little more strategically.Secondly: it would have been nice to have a scope for your bow so you can focus on headshots. Supposedly some of the bows do have this function, but I didn't encounter it during my play-through. I think it would have helped to make the game more strategic rather than the 'at times' purely button mashing extravaganza that it was.Note: I've since been told that every bow has a scope (I tested this and found otherwise)...that said, the hordes of enemies that come don't make the game any more strategic. I still think there is a little to much enemy flooding in this to make it strategic, and they seem to pop up from everywhere; it's never fun get get flanked when you 'know for a fact' that you have cleared out an area.Length/Last-ability: 7/10The game has: the standard Co-op, Crucible where you can make your own levels, as well as standard Campaign. The first play-through should take you around 12 hours possibly a bit longer depending on how much exploration you do. There isn't a great deal of exploration though, as many areas are simply 'cut-off' from access though they look like they should lead somewhere (a slight annoyance, but you get over it. The game itself is six chapters, and each chapter is divided up into sub-objectives (again, much like Gears of War). There are collectables like Death Stones, Dragon's Tears, and secret areas to find (I only found one of the areas in my play-through). It should keep the average person quite busy.Overall: 7/10The game is quite solid all in all. With a bit more work, this game easily could have been an 8 or a 9, but it's with the areas that this game is lacking in (voice work, graphics and some of the tweaked combat mechanics mentioned like a scope for the bow) that this game loses marks. Hopefully this game will be like LA Noire in that it will motivate other companies to try and innovate on what they have done here. I personally love Dark Fantasy games (ala Demon's Souls and anime like Berserk), so I would love to see a game of this style with a beefed up story, graphics and voice work. That said, this will leave many happy, but for those coming into this expecting an RPG...I think you will be sadly disappointed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001AWIP68","reviewerName":"Robin Solsj Hglund","summary":"Very Hard, Extremely Difficult, World At War","reviewText":"World at War is an epic retelling of two fronts near the end of the second World War. You take the role as an American soldier fighting in the horrid conditions of the Pacific Islands as well as a Russian right in the middle of the war in Europe. It's a stylized version based loosely in real battles; this is not for history buffs, but only those looking to do some combat to conquer the Third Reich. When you get through the campaign, the absolutely brilliant and addicting bonus mode Nazi Zombies is unlocked as well, a multiplayer challenge that's unwinnable but ingenious enough to be enjoyable every time. You can also fight your buddies or take the battle online, where the main draw might be some old-school sniper duelling or driving around in tanks while blowing people to bits.The game is all well and good, it's certainly the \"coolest\" and most epic take on WW2 you're likely to find, but it's also viciously brutal and bloody. However, there ought to be a warning label for something else on the cover box; it ought to read \"Warning: this game can prove to be absolutely absurdly difficult on higher difficulty levels. People prone to violent outbursts or with lacking patience need to stay clear!\". At the time of writing this, I'm at the second to last-mission in Veteran (the highest difficulty setting), where (spoilers ahead) storming the Reichstag-building in Berlin is just about the most challenging thing ever conceived of in video game history. Two hits will be the end of you, and the Germans send swarms of bullets that are nearly magnetic; stick your hat up in sight and you're sure to lose part of your head. That isn't the worst part though; your teammates have been gifted with an absolutely terrible A.I-system, and will rarely do any kind of damage on their own, even if enemies run right past them. But that's not even the worst part of it. The absolute worst part of it is that all the enemies have been gifted with about a thousand grenades each, and they throw them in constant neverending heaps; they're hurdled, lobbed, tossed, flicked, cast and sent right at your head with fatal accuracy. You'll have nowhere to run (literally) as you're standing in a circle of grenades about to explode. It's downright absurd how often you think you've hit a precious saving checkpoint, and you're just left with an \"objective reached\"-text, whereby you die and have to start the area all over again. Treyarch and Activision, you've successfully poured out a torrent of cursewords from my mouth, and more than once I've been close to hurtling my controller at my plasma TV. But I'm not giving up. Patience and luck will be my allies, and we'll soon see the end of Hitler's tyranny once and for all. Until then, this is (overall) the toughest game I have ever played. Hardcore gamers, you have been warned.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"Corey Turner \"The Musician\"","summary":"Halo Rewound, Multiplayer Fast Paced","reviewText":"Halo is a love or hate first person shooter series, new titles in the franchise have been spawning left and pawing into new genres. Halo has left me with mixed feelings, not being the biggest fan of the third title I still remained hopelessly interested, and thankfully ODST was right around the corner. With that said, Halo: ODST is the perfect mixture of all things good in the halo universe and more specifically the mechanics of the original title Halo: Combat Evolved. Halo: ODST has received some negative buzz due to it being an expansion that still dawns the next gen 60$ price tag. Other negativity stems from this as it is quite a short game to run through, though total completion could take a little longer.ODST is an acronym for orbital drop shock trooper, ODST are a few steps below the beloved Spartans (think mechanized war machine), and a bit above the standard marine in the series. ODST display their colors boldly all identifiable by their unique armor. I won't sit here and explained the story to you, as the load up screen makes sure to do this for those not up to date.  The basic premise is this, scattered in the underbelly of New Mombasa you (the rookie) must search for his squad after being separated from a near cataclysmic event in the beginning.  Those who've played Halo 2 can instantly recognize what the event is, the odst on the hand weren't so lucky. You'll be fighting your way through the enemy infested city, from night city recons to bridge bombing tower scaling madness.Game play at first would suggest a reskin of Halo 3's campaign mode, as you'll be continue to fight the aliens (known as the covenant) in a battle royal to flush them out. Don't be fooled, much of the weaponry has been altered. Better suiting an odst one will find a silenced smg, enhanced with a scope, instead of a burst firing battle rifle. Health packs have returned, you can still take cover for a quick charge for stamina, but you'll need health if you've been plucked one too many times.Odst also make use of the old and new. The old being the weapons we've already familiarized ourselves with in past games: assault rifle, spiker, mauler, plasma pistol, fuel rod gun/cannon, beam rifle, sniper rifle, covenant carbine, rocket launcher, and the holy grail Spartan laser so on so forth.  The new is much shorter in comparison but it will bring back many memories of the original title once more, and this would be the auto mag a pistol capable of one shot kills (if aimed at the head). Another weapon I thought I'd save to mention is the resurrection of the brute plasma rifle only seen briefly in the Halo 2 campaign. Similar to the original plasma rifle it has a maroon tone and is capable of a much higher rate of fire. Odst also like there explosives, all four grenade types from the third are available: frag, plasma, spike, and the elusive fire.The game can start a little slow as enemies seem a tad bit more ferocious then in previous titles. After figuring out the all new visor night vision mode that outlines darkened areas and figuring out how to mark objectives on ones map the game from that point on becomes a breeze (which the above isn't very difficult). You'll be trying to reach objects that have some relativity in the disappearance of your squad. By reaching them and accessing them a cinema will approach you and you'll find yourself in a radically different situation as another member of your team as the mystery slowly reveals. Missions can grant vehicles, other odst, and/or marines.  After each mission ends you'll be taken back to the rookie and back into the descent of darkness searching for the next clue.After the completion of the campaign if you haven't tried out cooperative campaign now's your chance. Worth of note, only two players per xbox 360 (this pertains to fire fight as well). With an internet connection and an account for xbox live (gold) you can take to the battles with up to four players. If achievements aren't your thing and don't wish to pursue the campaign after initial completion, fire fight awaits you.Fire fight is much like Gears of War's horde mode, in which it readies you quickly for intensified battles against wave after wave of enemies coming in all shapes and sizes. To do so one must really know the in and outs of the location as well as trust their friends in time of need. After enough waves of enemies have been annihilated, things go from going too good to testing your headshots as ammo will be scarce fast. What I mean by this is simple, `skulls' serve as means to raise the difficulty bar. Each skull has a title and once turned on they come into effect, from something meager like `enemies will always try to evade your attack' to something just plain dreadful `weapons now have less ammo'. This is a great way to involve all members playing as team work goes from assisting to covering. Firefight maps are based off each campaign level; different maps have different enemy arrangements and armories to access.  Grading is done by points; every enemy taken down adds to you and your teams overall score. Stylized eliminations will grant you more points (headshots, melee, grenade sticks, multi kills etc). Use whatever means are necessary to stay alive and boost your score, as lives may be added but never are they unlimited. You and your team share lives, use them wisely. Firefight is also available to those wanting to lone wolf it, but doing so alone just doesn't encompass what the mode was made for, and is none the less more frustrating upon higher rounds.Special weapons like the missile pod (which I previously forgot to mention) and human/alien turret can be dismounted from there stands and used in third person they are powerful, but will slow you down a bit. Missile pods are great for locking onto enemy vehicles, the dismounted can serve as a walking confetti maker. If you don't have these kinds of weapons and see a vehicle try taking out the turrets on them, deal enough damage they'll explode, or sometimes it's just best to hide.Odst excels in the music department, Martin o'Donnell has stepped up his game once more, Halo 3 (though again not the ultimate fan of the title) had outstanding music, o'Donnell felt it was time to use a real orchestra. With all his techniques set in place I thought I've seen the peak of his ability and the end of his ingenuity, oh how wrong I was. Opting away from the standard Halo themes we've come to know and have heard from synth to orchestration, he has readily set up a new sonic field in the Halo franchise. Bittersweet pianos, rainy jazz, hot burstbucker guitar solos, everything and more. He continues to make his ambient work flow, and his militant drum and rubbery bass as cohesive as ever. The game is musically a bit better then sat its graphics, but graphically it's pretty pleasurable. It's essentially an updated Halo 3 graphically and thankfully as it was beginning to age. What that means is you'll continue seeing Halo 3's phenomenal lighting and unique metallic finish, but at the same time a fuzz filter will be current helping to textures'.This probably sounds so long, so thankfully the last part should be the easiest to say. Odst includes a second disc with much more value then given credit for. The second disc is Halo 3's multiplayer (aside from campaign co-op which is a given) in its entirety, this means xbox live or not you have an archive of multiplayer maps, modes, and innovative features. You can film any match you've played, take pictures of whatever you'd like, and a map editor (not a map maker) is included as well. With a connection to xbox live is near limitless for gaming opportunity. Though I much preferred the maps of Halo 2, many new maps have renewed my interest in the online. Ranks in different modes can be acquired, ranked and player matches keep track of all your stats from every kill to every medal simply by creating an account on [...]. If I sound like a rabid fanboy, I apologize, this is probably my younger cousins most played game at my house so it's only natural I know a good amount about these games by this point in time. Time for some of this dislikes I suppose.Odst is a great game, problem is even with the value of multiplayer weighted it still isn't worth the 60$. Especially to the many who've already purchased/downloaded all the map packs, it can be a kick in the teeth. A monopoly is at foot here too, three of the maps are exclusive at the moment, without the second disc of odst some of Halo's online modes just aren't possible (thanks to the requirement of those three maps). So what it boils down to is a short but sweet campaign, that honestly isn't all too appealing to play afterwards (even with a friend a few runs go by and boredom begins to set in just looking at the screen). Firefight though fun surely can't be the only thing left can it? Well it is and shouldn't take the fall for it all, but with that remaining it's probably all you're going to be using your first disc for. Some of the dialogue is a bit cheesy; a romance intertwined to a war story could have worked out if emotions weren't so stale. Trailing the city as the rookie is pretty fun at first, but later on may be a breaker for those just wanting to complete the campaign. Red, red, red, tons of red, it's not that I'm unappreciative of the color, just when everything from doors to your characters HUD (head up display) glows red it is a bit of an annoyance. Especially since (as noted by many others) you'll be taking damage a lot, which is when the ugly shade makes itself most apparent. Fan of retcons? Me neither, the addition to story elements otherwise never existent in the other games makes for a sloppy translation.If you are a fan of Halo you will no doubt buy this and enjoy it, fan of Halo 1-3 doesn't matter has enough things from each for everybody. This is a really great game, I recommend to buy it used or for a price less then 40$. Odst tried out a new cast of characters, a new tale in the run, and offered up the great firefight mode, can't be all bad.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2010"}

Lucas has been taught the art of combat in the ancient and deadly style of the Legion. Lucas is a skilled swordsman, and a master of two combat stances. He can fight with a sword and shield, which allows him to attack quickly, deal heavy damage, and interrupt and stun single targets. When outnumbered, he wields a massive two-handed sword.

In human form, she fights with a staff or a spear, allowing her to fend off multiple attackers while leaping in and out of the fray.

I don't want to know how long it's been.Anyway...here we are in 2011 and we have Dungeon Siege 3.  I never played the previous DS games...I went through a phase of non-video gaming before jumping feet-first into the X-Box 360, PS3, and Wii generation.I started out as the swordsman, Lucas.  I was teamed up with an avatar of fire (an archon) named Anjari.  I played...and played some more...and played some more and suddenly realized I'd been playing for several hours.

SquareEnix...STOP PUTTING GUNS AND FUTURISTIC CRAP INTO FANTASY GAMES!  Swords, spears, armor, bows and arrows...MAYBE a crossbow or two....STOP WITH THE FREAKING GUNS!  If you want guns in a game...make a d*** first person shooter!  LEAVE THE GUNS OUT YOU DIP****S!  I hope you choke on a bag of salty weiners for what you've done to fantasy games...STOP IT!Obsidian...they've actually...FINALLY...made a game that I have not had ONE SINGLE problem with.  No crashes...no slowing down...no glitches.  The only minor complaint is that if I'm pushing forward on my control stick to run and I open a menu...I have to let go of the joystick and repress it in order to begin moving again once I've closed the menu.  This is the most minor of complaints and I am absolutely thrilled with how stable the game is.  There wasn't an immediate update to the game when I inserted it and there hasn't been one yet and it has been rock-solid.  I hope this means Obsidian has changed their evil ways...I will be optimistic.Combat is actually rather intuitive.  I've gotten my butt kicked when I didn't properly utilize the block function.  Block, heal, defensive abilities...beat on the enemy to build up combat points...execute awesome attack number 3!  I really enjoy the combat HOWEVER...the badguys with AOE attacks are cheap as heck and I hereby call bullcrap on their victories over me.The characters are a tad bland...the character customization is simple and straightforward (which I prefer...the more involved I am in character customization the more I seem to screw it up.  Just level up my freaking characters...don't give me something stupid like the sphere system or 120 different skills and augments).  Some interesting romance options would have been nifty...a little more morale/alignment choices.  Some more obvious consequences to earlier decisions.  It could have been more interesting.There is actually a ton of loot...but I'm disappointed by it.  I can't explain the loot...it just feels...empty.  Something is missing.  Something drops and it's meant for a character I'm not using...oh, boy...I get to sell it...hooray...  Shops don't really hold a lot of loot and when they do it's all crap with lower stats than what I've found.  No real treasures to be had.  The loot has disappointed me (though it's not a deal-breaker).The music is a solid 10.  It's beautiful.  It doesn't get in the way...it isn't repetitive and kind of fades into the background once you've heard it.  When you need the mood to be somber with a little creepy thrown in the music enhances it perfectly.  Need some action with a hint of urgency?  Done.  Bravo on the musical score...I think that is what elevates this game to good instead of just alright.  I'm a bit of a junkie for the \"package deal\" in video games...and music has a HUGE impact on that.  I have my soundtrack to Final Fantasy 3 (VI in Japan) around here somewhere.  Three CDs worth!So...that's all I have to say about Dungeon Seige 3.  Though I think it could stand to be about $10 cheaper, Amazon gave me a preorder credit of $10 so I can't really complain about that.Give this game a try...you'll more than likely enjoy the single player.Edit:  I called Obsidian \"Oblivion\".

Rose","summary":"A series fan's attempt at an ongoing, objective review.","reviewText":"I intend to update this review with additional commentary and possibly star rating tweaks as time goes on.>>>UPDATE 5/21/2012: I'm upping this to 4 stars now that I've almost completed a full play-through. I'll update specifics in the sections below, but a couple key points are a) a lot of my negative first impressions turned positive as I adjusted to the changes in gameplay / mechanics b) the skills and items REALLY open up and gain depth as you gain levels... much more so than in D1 or D2, and in ways you don't really anticipate at the lower levels. c) the storyline in D3 goes from being awesome to being sort of silly, but, as it turns out, it doesn't matter, since D3 is really designed around the endgame / replayability experience, not the story itself.--- --- --->>>OVERALL: Diablo III, in my experience so far, is a polished and addictive game that makes major tweaks to the tried-and-true formula of D2 that will spark divided opinions among returning players. The DRM, online-only license and the 'WoW-esque' graphics and gameplay (no running, potions minimized, skills with cooldowns, weapons are rated in DPS, etc.) don't really come as a surprise so much as they do a mild disappointment - but, some of the 'WoW' style changes are actually less tedious in D3 than in WoW, and many actually contribute to the overall experience. It's still fun to prowl the dungeon with your friends, mowing down monsters and incrementally supping up your character with better loot. I was very lukewarm about this game on its release week, especially with the server/install issues, but have now gotten more comfortable with the changes and am finding it really enjoyable.>>>COMBAT / GAMEPLAY: extremely simple, but fun, at lower levels. I was quick to assume gameplay would remain fairly static, but have actually learned that things get much more involved and diverse as you go up in levels. Instead of potions, hotkeys are skills with cooldowns. The role of the potion has been dramatically downplayed. I lamented it for a couple days, then adjusted. The new health/potion system is good. It works. Combat is simple and intuitive, and though I still miss the no-cooldown skills of Diablo II, the skills in D3 seem well balanced to promote strategic gameplay. The health globes are convenient, but they definitely give the game a more childish, side-scroller type of feel, which is in stark contrast to its darker backstory and Mature rating. Still, once you're used to them, you don't really notice them so much as reflexively pick them up when they appear, so it doesn't hurt immersion much. The difficulty curve is more forgiving than in D1 / D2. Boss fights are 'choreographed' to an extent, which makes them more engaging than they were in the previous titles (where the boss basically charges straight at you and you pound on one another until someone dies). The relative lack of 'danger', at least in Normal difficulty, in addition to the cartoonish voice acting, make this less of an immersive 'dungeon crawler' and more of an MMO adventure/grindfest, which seems to be the commercially superior model these days. Still, a combination of old / new elements make this game pretty addicting.>>>ITEMS / GEAR / CRAFTING: there is a lot of gear in D3. Too much, you might say. Within an hour of beginning, you'll have changed your gloves, pants, belt, shirt, boots, shield, weapon, and helmet multiple times. Cloth pants, 5 defense. Cloth pants, 6 defense. Cloth pants, 7 defense. Is this really necessary? Yes, Diablo 1 and 2 had a veritable glut of equipment overall. But somehow, getting a new piece of equipment made a tangible DIFFERENCE. There is so much gear in D3, and of such incremental benefit, that gear loses the special appeal it used to have. Even World of Warcraft's gear felt more meaningful than that of D3. I'm hoping this changes as I get higher up and rely more on unique items, but then I have to worry that I'll be crippled if I don't shell out real money on the auction house. The crafting aspect is cool, and I like the addition of this mechanic to the Diablo formula, but it smacks of subscription-based MMORPG crafting... albeit simplified. I'm in the fourth act of the game now and most of my gear is Rare items -- still waiting to see if Set or Unique items exist (or Epic / Legendary, like in WoW). At higher levels, you have to do special quests or get special items to continue crafting better gear. I know this is implemented to add depth to the endgame, but I bet it'll get a bit tedious.>>>SKILLS / CUSTOMIZATION: There's only one skill to enhance for each of the earlier levels, and later, there are only a few runestones to shift, so it's easy to assume the skill system is oversimplified. Well, at level 30, I have to say the skill system gets much more interesting as you start getting into the higher levels. I've changed my position on the ease of 're-spec'ing characters, and think it's actually a value-added change. It's nice being able to swap skills, and having the system set up like this actually encourages strategic adjustments for different bosses / areas. Having this sort of setup means you're not going to be unique in your build -- and that means you're going to be more generic, and so will everyone else. Still, with so many various build possibilities, it's pretty unlikely you'll end up in parties with people exactly like you. As you get higher up in levels, it's nice to see different classes' strengths and weaknesses emerge as well.>>>MUSIC / SOUND / VOICE: I was turned off by the music at first, but like it now. Each installment in the Diablo series goes with a subtly different soundtrack theme. Diablo III seems to be going for the more 'epic' feel, vs. Diablo 1's spooky minimalism and Diablo II's mood-setting tracks. Different, but actually pretty good. Sound effects are okay, nothing special. Voice acting is absurd. Skeleton King and NPCs in Act I a case in point. Good lord. Compare the Skeleton King's lines in D3 to Diablo or Mephisto's lines from D2. See the difference? Diablo 3's voice acting is excessive and vaudevillian to Diablo 2's atmospheric minimalism. Sure, the lines could be silly in D2 as well, but at least you didn't have extended cartoony dialogue from the bosses like in D3.>>>SOCIAL / DRM / ONLINE: Blizzard did a pretty good job making it easy to find and add your friends, and to invite them to your party/game. A big disappointment, though, is the failure to include voice chat. What the heck? Even 5 years ago, a console game could take voice chat for granted. Blizzard should have seen the value of voice chat when hundreds of thousands (millions?) of their WoW subscribers turned to Ventrilo or Skype or other similar applications to support voice chat between party members. I'm disappointed with this being left out of Diablo 3, especially since it's online-only. If it's online-only, we're supposed to be playing with friends. If we're playing with friends, let us talk! Chat isn't as important in single player, but then if we're going to play solo, why make us have an internet connection? Pretty weak. I've been using Google Plus 'Hangouts' to chat with my teammates, and that works well.>>>TECHNICAL ISSUES: the server bugs seem to have been resolved in the week since launch, but many of my friends still have connectivity or graphics/system issues... getting booted from games, losing connection, computer freezing, etc. Much of this seems to center around the multiplayer experience. There are various things you can do to minimize the occurrence of each of these issues, but I'm really hoping Blizzard pumps out a patch soon to resolve the most common of these (like the entire game hanging up and booting you out when you join multiplayer games that overtax your video GPU).>>>GRAPHICS / ART DESIGN: I said earlier that the visuals are WoW-esque, and I still stand by that (the skill icon design, architecture, UI layout, etc.) but I don't really mean it in a negative way. I worried about the 'brighter' color palette when I saw the dungeons and layouts in Act I, which were more 'spooky' than 'demonic', but... have really gotten to love the visual direction in this game. Environments are vivid but they do indeed get 'darker' and more intense as the game progresses. The developers talked about this before the game launched, and it's good to know they fulfilled their promise to really strike a balance between 'darker' visuals and overall graphical excellence. By the time you get to Act III, the settings are outright EPIC. Running around the fortress in Act III while giant fireballs blaze across the screen and tiny soldiers fight a distant battle in the background, so far below you on the fortress's ramparts... that's just amazing. I was iffy at first but love the visuals now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2012"}

I had heard a lot of bad things about it and was a little worried after I bought that it might be poor. Its basically a survival horror game with a fairly heavy gunplay feature thrown it with it. The game will frustrate you a lot, there are a lot of parts where you seem to be set up to fail multiple times before you figure out a specific pattern to use. With that said this is no COD4, Halo 3, or Bioshock, but it still brings much to the table that we have not seen in a while. This game is now $40, which is resonable if you have that much money on you.Graphics 9.0 ( Top notch graphics )Audio 6.5 ( You only hear enemies most of the time )Achievements 8.5 ( easy 750-1000 )Controls 7.0 ( Wasnt that bad to me )Camera 6.5 ( Can be irritating at times )Overall 8.5-9.0","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000TI836G","description":"","reviewerName":"Mkapa","summary":"Not as good as i thought","reviewText":"Although in no ways is it a MW2 killer. This is a good decent military shooter and a lot of fun.The multiplayer has only 8 maps at launch. But the action is pretty intense. If you are familiar with battlefield bad company, then this is pretty much similar. Ribbons and awards are given for accomplishing nice little daring feats. Up to 25 players can play in multiplayer match so it does feel like an actual battle indeed. Different modes include everything from the classic team deathmatch. To capturing sectors and blowing up certain objectives. The great thing about multiplayer is it's realism. You don't have to empty a clip on a enemy just to kill them like in Halo Reach or Modern Warfare 2. The maps although their are only eight of them, aren't to massive or to small. But their are certain choke points that you will find yourself in, especially during the objective based modes.Single player is not as good. The campaign is short. You will probably complete it in only 5-6 hours of play time. The AI is pretty easy. I only died once time in the first mission. Unless you charge in front of a machine gun or get to close to a bunch of enemies, you won't die often. If you want a challenge, play this game on the hardness difficulty. Your team mates are not that much better when it comes to AI. They have a bad habit of getting in front of you while your shooting, causing you to hit your buddy and not the enemy.The sound and graphics are perfect. This is a game to play with the surround sound cranked up. Gunfire sounds and explosions sound very realistic along with shouts and curses from both enemies and friendly. The game does a great job in emerging you into combat. Graphics are also pretty good with showing off nice texture of mountains, dirty villages and cold weather. Although in some areas it looks a little grainy, especially in the large areas.EDIT- Having played this game even more i can say that the multiplayer is broken. Sniper rifles are god in multiplayer and one shot ANYWHERE kills the enemy. Spawn camping is the worst i seen in any FPS game, it's really bad in the objective based games where you spawn on a particular team mate rather then in an area like in COD. The graphics in both single and multi are bland and lack attention to detail and even some texture, maybe the PC version looks better. I would wait to get COD black ops before trying this game","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000B69E9G","description":"In Resident Evil 4 you'll know a new type of horror, as the classic survival-horror action returns with all-new characters, controls and storylines. We last saw Leon S. Kennedy in Resident Evil 2 - a rookie cop in Raccoon City, fighting to stay alive. That was six years ago. Since then, government forces have managed to control the zombie threat and Leon has become a Federal agent. When the President's daughter is kidnapped, Leon tracks her to a remote, hidden fortress in Europe - where he'll relive the horror he faced six years before.   Players will face never-before-seen enemies that make Nemesis seem like a kitten. You'll be wishing for the usual Resident Evil zombies!","reviewerName":"Review Lover \"ReviewLover\"","summary":"Spellbinding, strong contender for BEST EVER PS2 game","reviewText":"Resident Evil 4, to keep the synopsis short and sweet, follows the exploits of Leon S. Kennedy, the rookie cop from the still-brilliant sequel Resident Evil 2, as he touches down in rural Spain, to rescue the President's daughter from an as-yet unknown group of kidnappers.And really, since the game pitches you headlong into some of the best and most rewarding plot-driven action moments I've ever been lucky enough to experience in a video game, there's very little need for me to elaborate. That, and the fact that I hate spoilers! Trust a man who's been a confirmed games player for sixteen years: this is a great *expletive* game.GRAPHICS: So what if the Cube original version of this game has better graphics? I challenge all but the most superficial kind of player (you know, the kind that's happy with endless driving and fighting game sequels) to be anything but delighted when they see what magical Capcom has managed to do with the six-year old techology behind the PS2. The overall visual theme (washed-out colours, smooth animations, excellent lighting) is very reminiscent of that king-of-atmospheric-games, Silent Hill 2, and the character and enemy animations are first-rate. Enemy design, from the lowliest (villagers, crows) to the more impressive boss battles (the first and second bosses are actually jaw-dropping) is worthy of awards, and the whole visual feel of Resi 4 is one of supreme mastery and undeniable creepiness.SOUND: Voice acting's pretty damn great - in a nice change for a Resi game - and the music is excellent. Finally, here's a Capcom survival horror with real aural punch and muscle. The characters seem more real and their situation seem all the more immediate and tense because of the obvious lengths the sound designers have gone to to bring a deeper sense of the game's experience to us.PLAYABILITY: Here's the real jewel in the crown: Resident Evil 4 is one of the most intuitive and playable games I've ever had. The controls are smooth and familiar to any fan of Survival Horror, and introduce some almost Metal Gear Solid-esque elements to the playing field. Dodging, shooting, and moving about are a joy to experience because of the lack of sluggishness that seems to plague even the most highly-regarded of the survival horror genre - remember how frustrating the speed of characters was in the Fatal Frame and earlier  Resi games was? All gone!The learning curve is a little steeper than normal, perhaps, but in a game of this nature, where the storyline is all about being flung into unreasonable situations with a sense of no-way-out, this actually helps things along.LASTIBILITY: This is, as with all survival horror games, not a terribly long trip. Don't misunderstand, it's 15+ hours on the first play through, but because it's such an amazing experience, you want more. Capcom (I love you!) has tried to alleviate this with some all-new PS2 extra bells and whistles, plus an all-new side-quest starring... ...someone :-), so it's not too disappointing when the credits roll for the first time.But trust me, this is a game you'll come back to for both the storyline and the blissful playing experience again and again.OVERALL: A mighty game; if this is where the Survival Horror genre is going then sign me up for life. That all Software Houses would put such a creative effort into their releases! Resident Evil 4 is deserving of all the praise it gets, and we should feel very thankful that Capcom is around to draw that praise out of us.It's not so much scary as it is jumpy, like an action game with some beautifully-directed moments of tension and fear, and it is so, so much fun to play.Recommended for immediate purchase!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2005"}

As I played Deadpool, another game kept popping into my consciousness&#8230;Lollipop Chainsaw, which was one of my favorite games of 2013 despite getting less than stellar reviews from some critics who are totally lacking in anything resembling a sense of humor.  Like Lollipop Chainsaw, Deadpool is loaded over-the-top violence and rife with crude bathroom humor that would likely make a trucker blush.  No, this is not a game for kids&#8230;big immature adult kids maybe but not, you know, YOUR kids.The insane assassin gifted with a healing factor similar to Wolverine&#8217;s but with a psychosis that makes the Joker seem normal by comparison, is the star of the game and knows it.  Part of the Deadpool shtick in the comics is that he frequently breaks down the &#8220;fourth wall&#8221; to interact with readers.  The game does the same thing as Deadpool frequently halts the action to talk to you, the player which gives the game a sensation of silliness without taking away too much from the story which you should not be taking too seriously to begin with anyway.  Deadpool will yell at you, tell you what buttons to push, make sexist comments to you&#8230;much like your regular annoying friends.The game is pure action/beat &#8216;em up as Deadpool utilizes his standard comic book arsenal of swords and guns, along with various types of grenades and other items like sledgehammers. These combine with his acrobatic abilities and his power of short-range teleportation to slide and dice (literally) the waves of enemies he will face. Similar to the recent Batman games, Deadpool can string together attacks to pull off some pretty cool juggles and combos and the teleportation ability is a great help to get you out of trouble when surrounded by a horde of enemies.But gameplay frankly isn&#8217;t the game&#8217;s strong suit.  The controls are accurate and it&#8217;s easy to pull off the basic attacks and many of the combos.  The one annoyance is with the targeting weapons for your firearms.  Sometimes it just doesn&#8217;t lock on where you want or where it should forcing you to expend the precious seconds to target an enemy manually.  Pausing the game can take you to the menu where you can see the combos you&#8217;ve gained so far as well as the button combinations you need to do them.  The game also includes RPG elements that allows you to expend experience points to upgrade Deadpool.  You can upgrade your healing factor, attack abilities, weapon abilities, and purchase new weapons.  There isn&#8217;t a whole lot of uniqueness to the upgrade system.  More bullets&#8230;faster shooting&#8230;more damage and so on&#8230;Insert image deadpool2.jpgThe plot centers around Deadpool trying to get his own videogame created and then the story goes on to follow the game&#8217;s script&#8230;well at least the parts he didn&#8217;t rip out.  Along the way he will meet up with several of the X-Men as well as Cable and face off against the game&#8217;s main protagonist Mr.  Sinister and several minor league baddies like Vertigo, Blockbuster, and Arclight.  Most of the levels are fairly standard and don&#8217;t show much inspiration but there are exceptions&#8230;Genosha is fun and Deadpool will also find himself trapped in an 8 bit, Legend of Zelda type of dungeon that makes for a fun diversion.  The campaign will take about 10 hours to run through and you can run through it as there&#8217;s not much in the way of hidden items to find.Nolan North voices Deadpool (and also Nathan Drake from the Uncharted series) and he is the star of the game.  Not all of the jokes work but they come so fast that you&#8217;ll hardly miss the bad ones.  Despite its many flaws Deadpool still manages to be entertaining, if only for a short time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2014"}

Unlike the flawed Unreal Tournament 2003, this game brings in new and interesting features. They have brought back the original sniper rifle as well, which is probably one of the best decisions the company has made.The new modes are interesting. There is a spaceship mode kinda like x-wing alliance. There are also some other modes worth mentioning. The invasion one is alright. Invaion involves a group of bots and you fighting of swarms of monsters. It can get boring though as most of the levels aren't that interesting. Mutant is okay. It is kinda like an ironman thing. The mutant earns kill points, while others want to kill the mutant to get that ability. There is also this new mode where you capture points on a large map. You can get a bunch of vehicles to help you. They work like Halo's vehicles except there are different types. Plane, hovercraft, little car, medium car, tank, super tank, and turrents. They all work pretty well, and they are all different. The little car even has 2 blades which can stick out the sides and kill opponents.The tournament is interesting. There is a money system in which you earn money from battles. All your stats are tracked. Double kills, multi kills, kills and deaths in general, wins, losses, and some others. This makes for a bigger initiative to do better. There are some flaws. Play with the bots in adept mode and you will see some of the cheapest stuff you've ever seen. The bots dodge tons of stuff and will always hit you unless you sidestep, but it takes a bit to learn because they can read you perfectly. They also do a cheap thing where if you get close to them you die instantly from their flak gun. It is almost instant as they will be shooting one gun and in a millisecond you will die. It isn't like your gun switching system where you can't be shooting and have to wait a second for the gun to pop up. This is kind of frustrating because anything lower than adept is too easy.The new guns, models, maps(some are from 2003), and gametypes are all done masterfully and make this game much better than 2003.

Indeed the game is tons of fun when you first fire it up: offering up some great action and creepy environments, but sadly, the fun doesn't last all that long.  Back from the Crusades, Dante descends into the Nine Circles of Hell to rescue the soul of his love Beatrice, and standing between them are hordes of demonic enemies.  Gameplay wise, Dante's Inferno plays a lot like the God of War games, and while the combat offers up some bloody good fun, it sure isn't nearly as satisfying as the God of War games that it imitates.  Most of the environments are well designed, as are the enemies you encounter, but the puzzle elements you encounter are another story all together, and are just more tedious than anything else, not to mention the fact that the game itself is pretty short to boot.  Still, despite its shortcomings, the technical aspects of Dante's Inferno are worth noting: the game looks good, there's terrific voice acting and music, and an engaging story as well.  All in all, you'll certainly play worse games than Dante's Inferno, but you'll certainly play better ones as well.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2010"}

The multiplayer is like most fps shooters but what my buddies and I liked most was the coop feature but now I believe halo is a bland franchise that uses its name to win the hearts of gamers. If you played the first halo, you have played them all.  I own every halo game but the latest halo 4. I don't own them because I wanted to own them,I bought because my buddies wanted me to. When halo 2 came out most of us were disappointed. Lame story, smaller maps and half the time you didn't play as the master chief. Then third came out. My friends begged me to to get it and play it. So I did. It was a little better but still halo 1 had a better campaign. The halo odst came out. Again my buddies begged me so I told my gf I'm off to game stop. And halo odst was just terrible. I yelled at my friends how they owe me 60 bucks and I vowed to never buy a halo game ever again ( except for the halo combat evolved remake). Then this game halo reach came out. Like clock work my buddies begged me to get it. They say \" dude!!! You'll like it this time this one is awesome diuuuuddde!\" I said you'd better be right. I turned to my wife and said I'm off to game stop. Played it,turned it off 2 hrs later, scalded myself and told my boyz I'll never play a new halo ever. Halo 4 has since come out.y friends begged me saying the same thing\" this ones different I swear! The graphics are awesome!\" I held my ground and haven't regretted it at all.Why this big back story? Because the halo franchise is a mediocre franchise. Much like the madden franchise. People clearly play it for just multiplayer dm. The story is a generic flop for every game since. Your a spartan. You hunt aliens, you find aliens, you blow up aliens, a bunch of crappy AI marines die, you drive a car, you drive a banshee, you blow up aliens. This happens the same way in almost every halo game. I am baffled that halo recieves 9 and 10s from big magazines.Now I know I'm hard on halo reach. It's not a bad game, but people need to open there minds and realize its not good either. Yeah I had fun driving a warthog around while my buddy shoots the rocket launcher but, I can do that in the first game. Halo needs to expand to keep hardcore gamers like me interested. More focus on campaigns and coop. They need to expand the universe from a linear fps to to a more involved third person rpg/action shooter....they could call it mass effect lol I'm just kidding. But I'd welcome a rival to mass effect.All I'm saying is literally if you've played any halo game you've played them all. I won't ever buy halo 4 but if bungie makes a halo space drama/third person /turn based/ action platformer strategy game. I will look into it.Halo reach is halo 1 but with more guns and a multiple Spartans. They're not likeable characters and they each have generic personas. Generic is the only word for halo.If you love halo you already own this game. If you've never played halo Try it out with a friend. If your looking to get back into halo and you've missed out on they last few games. Don't bother.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2013"}

Nicholson","summary":"\"The Walking Dead\"... a point and click, interactive game... 2 1/2 Stars","reviewText":"\"The Walking Dead\" is a video game by Telltale Games based on the AMC weekly series of the same name. This game is played through 'Steam' and was priced at $24.99 at the time of writing this review.Although only 2 episodes are available at present, the game will have a total of 5 segments when finished.This is an cartoon-like animated 3rd person adventure, You take the part of a federal prisoner, Lee, who escapes custody from a crashed patrol car. The story begins as he finds various people, some friends; some foes (all with various personalities) to align with in order to try to survive the land overrun with zombies.Some thoughts on \"The Walking Dead\"...The Pros:1.) although a little different than the TV series, some of the characters and their names are the same as in the series. Some of the scenarios are similar with some slight variation.2.a) this is an interactive game... decisions that you make have a direct bearing on how the rest of your game unfolds. For example, you'll find you have to decide who to save from between two people, who to give food to, even to kill uninfected humans in certain situations etc. Also, other characters remember your decisions and how it affected them.2.b) life and death decisions must be made within a few seconds... adding to the adrenalin pumping intensity. (See Cons: 2b below)2.c) making decisions gives the game a legitimate replay value... you could make different choices in another run through to see how it would change the game.3.) graphic and very violent at times. Hard not to become involved with the action scenes.4.) well done shading and facial expressions of the cell characters. (See Cons: 4 below)5.) each episode is fairly short with a playing time of maybe 2 - 3 hours.Probably the perfect length for completing an episode in one sitting.The Cons:1.a) slow... very,very slow when your inbetween the 'action' segments as there were a lot of very quiet walking/talking scenes. These were used to develop the story and also to provide some character traits and personalities. But to me, it just seemed these scenes were dragged out...  a little too much drama vs. action... maybe an 80:20 ratio.1.b) unfortunately, there was no way of bypassing or speeding-up some of these scenes if you died and had to repeat them.2.) game play...a.) poor instructionsb.) point and click game play can be VERY frustrating at times. You have to find and click on a specific spot and then perform a specific sequence of keystrokes on the keyboard or mouse buttons to save yourself from an urgent situation. Sounds simple but in the heat of the moment very confusing and often frustrating as the correct spot is poorly highlighted. It took me about 1/2 the first game to begin to figure out these controls... and by this time I made a couple choices (or no choices) that I had no intention of making.The end segment of Episode 3 at the train station was particularly annoying... until you know how to get by it.3.) control of your character was clumsy with the WSAD keys and movement was limited to a very small area.4.) the drawing/animations of several of the characters often made the white of their eyes appear to be 'popping out'.Conclusion:A point and click game,  requiring some sequenced keystoke... takes some getting use to. With the result, you'll probably either love or hate it.A lot of non-action scenes/dialogue and no way of circumventing them or speeding them up.Intense animated action... just wished there was a little more.A game that I grew to enjoy more and more as I got deeper into it.2 1/2 StarsRay Nicholson","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2012"}

It's probably my favorite series of games period.  So with that information, you could make a good argument to take my review with a grain of salt.  Though I will try to be objective, I just love the series so much that I sometimes put on rose-colored glasses when it comes to flaws in the series.  Heck, I found a way to enjoy Blood Omen 2, and it was far from spectacular.I also want to thank Crystal Dynamics for not \"dumbing down\" this latest installment.  I can admit that the LoK series has always been a bit of a nitch series.  It's not an easy series to just jump into without having some knowledge of previous games.  Sure, they do give you some of the background in the instruction manual, but that hardly keeps you up to date with what is going on.  And with that, CD and Eidos could have just made this an action/adventure game in the LoK world, with familiar characters and locations.  Thankfully, they did not.  They kept the driving force behind the LoK series going, and that my friends is the storyline.  The best voice acting I have ever witnessed in games, combined with an incredible sweeping storyline that spans 5 games is what makes us fans of the series go nuts when a new one is on the way.And that's why I find it upsetting to see when people either complain that the story is either too difficult to understand, or they give you the totally wrong idea of what the storyline is.  I am not one to give away storyline in a review, because 1: you'll find it out in the game once you play it, and 2: you are reading a review to find out a game's strengths and weaknesses, not what it's story is.  But I am so tired of people saying in reviews about Kain and Raziel being at odds.  Did these people even play Soul Reaver 2?  Didn't they notice that Kain was different?  Didn't they get the idea that he had a purpose behind what seems like cruelty? (Sorry, pent up frustration.)  I will admit though, the storyline would be difficult to understand if this is your first endeavor into the LoK universe.  You would be scratching your head wondering what is going on.  But don't let anyone tell you that it's too difficult to understand, it's just that you really need to play the pervious 2 Soul Reaver games to have a good grasp of it, and the original Blood Omen would help too.  At the very least Soul Reaver 2, cause that game has a lot of the storyline on the disc itself in written form.Okay, now with non-storyline aspects of the game.  As other reviewers and mags have stated, Defiance looks fantastic.  One of the prettiest games I've played in a while.  Very nice gothic look and feel.  The combat is also very nice as compared to previous installments.  It felt to me that they took about the best aspects of the previous games and combined them into Defiance, which I must say works great.  I won't go into the combat being like DMC, cause you probably have seen that 50 times by now.  It is a lot more fluid and fun now and there are some very nice moves that both Raziel and Kain can do.  And while the camera can be a bother at times, for the most part I found it quite enjoyable.  I also like when you can flip into a first person view to look around, gives you an opportunity to appreciate the surroundings and also figure stuff out.So in finishing with my ramblings, I would say this is the best LoK installment yet.  Would I recommend this game however to people who have never played a LoK game?  That I'm not so sure about.  While I think if you enjoy action/adventure games you will find this game very enjoyable.  I think you would be missing out on what makes this series so great, the story.  I know I've harped on the story a lot in this review, but I just want to convey that this series is more story driven than any I have played in the past.  Best way I could describe it would be like a 5-part movie.  Is it possible to just watch movie 5 and still enjoy it?  Yes, definitely, but wouldn't you be missing out on some of the story since you missed the previous 4 movies?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2003"}

In Chrono Trigger prepare yourself to journey into the forgotten past, distant future, and even to the very End of Time.The Worlds of Past, Present and FutureIn Chrono Trigger you'll journey back to Prehistory (65,000,000 B.C.) where humans and reptiles battle to wipe each other from existence. Antiquity (12,000 B.C.) is an age where the world is divided between people whose continent is buried in snow, and the magical kingdom of Zeal, a highly advanced civilization. The Middle Ages (600 A.D.) is an era of swords and sorcery, a dark time when the armies of Fiendlord rule over the land.The Present (1000 A.D.) is the time period in which Crono, Lucca and Marle live. It is a bright and peaceful age. However, in the Future (2300 A.D.), an era of despair has taken hold with rogue machines ruling the world. After the day of the apocalypse in 1999 A.D., the prosperous civilization of humanity crumbled and the remaining people struggle to stay alive. And, finally, there remains the End of Time -- a place with no era to call its own. This confluence of time's streams transcends spatiotemporal boundaries. It is here at the gravitational center for all temporal flotsam that Spekkio -- the Master of War -- serves as your guide on time's treacherous roads.Battle Systems and gameplayThis game utilizes a revised version of the groundbreaking Active Time Battle (ATB) System. Chrono Trigger features exhilarating combat in which the clock is constantly ticking. Characters must first wait as the ATB gauges charge, and then perform an action. This makes strategic timing a crucial element in your battle plan. In addition to standard attacks, each character has an array of special Tech skills and powerful combos known as Dual and Triple Techs. Cooperate with other characters to unleash over 50 unique and devastating moves!Chrono Trigger utilizes great story-telling, interesting characters, action-packed gameplay, and the unique controls of the Nintendo DS to deliver a fun and well-rounded role-playing game on a portable platform.","reviewerName":"Steve","summary":"An Old School Adventure!","reviewText":"Chrono Trigger DS is not a remake along the lines of Dragon Quest IV DS; it's mostly just a port of the original SNES game.  It's one of the best RPGs of the 16-bit era, and has held up reasonable well.  Chrono Trigger tells a sprawling story across many different regions of space and time.  You play as a boy who meets, goes back in time and meets a frog, goes forward in time and meets a robot, and then eventually battles an ultimate evil.  It's a simple but solid story with many different possible endings depending on the choices you make throughout the game.Chrono Trigger plays exactly how you would expect a SNES RPG to play.  There aren't many surprises here.  There are a few improvements designed to add on present day RPG staples (a bestiary, various galleries, an item encyclopedia, etc) and some additions to make Chrono Trigger fans happy (a few bonus dungeons and an alternate ending).  Other than these features, you're basically playing the same game that was on the SNES.The DS doesn't really add a whole ton to Chrono Trigger.  The extra screen real estate spreads out the information display, which is definitely helpful, and allows a map of the current area to be displayed on screen at all time.  There is an option to use the stylus as input instead of the conventional controls, but I found this setup clunky and quickly went back to the standard controls.There's not a whole lot left for me to say here.  There are two different demographics that I think will enjoy Chrono Trigger DS:  RPG players interested in learning something about the \"sort of old days\", and Chrono Trigger fans looking for an excuse to replay one of their favorite games.  If you fall into one of those two categories, then I don't think you will be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2010"}
{"product_name":"B004NRN5DU","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"Why?","reviewText":"Simply stated: this is the *worst* video game I have *ever* played.I'm going to qualify that by saying that there's a lot of good stuff in this game. The visuals are nice, the loot is engaging, and most of the enemy models are decent. And once you get the hang of combat, that part of the game becomes enjoyable. And then you turn a corner and there's some ridiculously powerful enemy that is entirely out of place with what you've been facing and it will kill you before you can ask, \"What the !@*# is that thing?\"You die a lot in the game. That actually seems to be a large part of the design: finding increasingly annoying ways to kill the player character. It's incredibly frustrating because you lose all souls (the game's only currency) and any humanity you may have. This is somewhat mitigated by the fact that you have a chance (read: exactly ONE chance) to regain whatever you lost. If you die again before you make it back to your lost power, you lose it for good and you can only regain whatever you lost this time. Since whatever killed you is likely far too powerful at the moment, this pretty much means that you're pretty much screwed.It also doesn't help that the souls you lose are incredibly invaluable. They're the games *only* currency. You use them to purchase stuff and you use them to level up. That's right: at any given moment you have exactly one choice with what you can do with the souls you have. You can either use them to level up, or you can use them to buy equipment or upgrade materials. Since you lose your souls A LOT, this makes progress very slow.And you're completely screwed if you die in a boss fight. Boss fights are typically engaged in some closed off room you can't escape, which means you can't just run in and grab your lost power and run out to fight another day. In order to be able to use what you get back, you have to survive the fight. You can counter-cheat the game by turning off your console the moment you die, before the game has a chance to autosave the fact that it just screwed you over. The next time you play, you get reset back to just before the boss fight. You still die, but your lost power is now outside the boss zone and you can get it back. I don't know why this isn't the default, because it makes the boss fights that much more frustrating.Bosses are all idiotically large, with massive weapons that can hit from forever away, and they all hit stupid hard. There are some bosses that even randomly explode with area damage just to screw you over even more. There's one boss that wields two massive cleavers that are each as wide as the room he's in, and he can use a two-weapon attack that's unblockable and usually results in instant death. There's another demon boss that's in a basement room which he also fills up, and he uses a massive force wave attack that can't be blocked and kills the player character in two hits or less, and if you manage to get behind him he'll slam his weapon into the ground to cause an explosion that hits the PC *through the boss*. There's a giant wolf boss that carries an even more giant sword in its mouth, moves several times faster than the useless PC, has 4-5x the attack reach, and can even execute a spin move that will hit you twice with enough damage to kill you every time. These are unbelievably frustrating battles that seem to be designed by sadists that hate the entirety of the gaming community.It's made even worse by the jackassery of the controls. The controller is incredibly unresponsive. Sometimes it can take a full second for the button you just pushed to actually register. A full second is enough time for you to die.Even you manage to get your attack button pressed early enough, the animations are ridiculous. Want to swing that massive claymore? It'll take a while because you have to recover from swinging it or thrusting or whatever. But what about this light and nimble and supposedly faster scimitar? Nope, still takes a while because... erm... well... OH YEAH! You have to cock your arm first, and THEN you can swing at the enemy!! Most enemies will use the moment between you start an attack and when it should actually connect to start their own attack, which will usually connect first somehow. Even if your attack connects first, it won't interrupt most enemies unless it outright kills them, and their attack will still connect. And then you die. Again.OK, how about just running away? That'll take a while too, seeing as how the PC has to lumber up to speed, even when unencumbered. And there's no \"sprint\". The jerk just kind of half-ass jogs along. Almost every enemy in the game can move faster, even if you've unequipped everything to lower your weight. Try to run away and they'll just catch up to you and back-attack you with their super-fast attacks that can hit you even when you're fleeing. And then you die. Again.And if you try to dodge? Woah! It doesn't seem to matter what direction you hold the stick in, sometimes the PC will randomly dodge TOWARD the thing you're trying to get away from. And then you die. Again.And the camera seems to somehow be a corporeal thing that tethers your character to the world. It will get stuck on various pieces of the environment and will whip around, completely changing the direction your character is facing, even if you've locked onto a target in combat or are trying to walk carefully across some narrow plank in an aerial environment. And then you die. Again.Sometimes the uber-massive bosses can get between the camera and PC, resulting in the character not being able to move because the *camera* is stuck. This will happen even when you're in a big open space with no physical obstacles, and will prevent you from being able to get away from the boss' massive-damage-dealing attack. And then you die. Again.I have NO idea how this game made it to market after playtesting. The developers must have taken what little positive feedback the playtesters could have given the game and removed those elements, as if to say that yes, they can in fact make the game worse. Either that, or the playtesters were all a bunch of brain-dead masochists who somehow think this is game actually represents a \"challenge\" instead of a straight-up \"screw you\" to the player.This game will make you want to throw your controller, the console, and probably even your entire gaming setup including the chair out a very high window. The crash you'd hear is probably the only satisfying thing you can get out of this garbage. There was potential there, at some point, but the game's creators squandered all of that by utterly failing to understand the concept of \"reasonable challenge.\"I'm a completionist. I've played truly difficult games on their hardest settings just to get the achievements, because that's what I like to do. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but even so difficulty is not a thing for me. But this game isn't difficult. It's just asinine. But I'll probably still complete it through whatever twisted achievement-gobbling OCD I have. But to borrow a line from a movie, \"this will not be over quickly; I will not enjoy this.\"Save your money. Buy something else.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2014"}

Pick up and play is what this game is all about.Star 3: Sound and voice acting are done spot on there is no cheesy dialog at all that I found.Star 4: Storyline and game progression is great.

Bottomline this game is fun to play.this game doesn't really dissappoint but there are a few little gripes that I have about it and that is to do some of the cool magic spells that War does have takes time to refill. Also wished that they let you refill the health or magic crystals that you find so that you don't feel like you are wasting health just to fill a sliver of life that you lost fighting.

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"Feelah the tigress","summary":"Well, I Gave It A Fair Chance...","reviewText":"Wow, did I miss the boat on this one!  I really did mean to buy this when it first came out, but then I was dissuaded by all the negative comments about it (too linear, bad storyline, etc.) that I ended up putting it off for so long that the sequel is already coming out!  Yeah, it's been that long.  Despite all the bad stuff I've heard, I've tried very strongly to stay unbiased in my feelings about this game before I'd played it.  I'm going to give it a fair shot, and form my own opinions based on my experience.  So, does this game measure up to the Final Fantasy standard, or fall flat like a Chocobo with a broken leg?  Well, let's find out!Graphics (score 9/10): The technical aspects of the graphics are gorgeous; everything is vibrant and the level of detail is astonishing.  However, sometimes it feels like there's too much detail.  Many locations are SO detailed and filled with so much indistinguishable, unidentifiable techno-crap that you can barely stand to look at anything.  I also felt there wasn't enough variety in the locations.  Sure, that crystal tunnel is pretty when you first see it, but after 3 hours of it, I just prayed for something different.  Other than my complaints about the detail, everything else is nice.  The art style is sort of like a mix between what Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy XII looked like.  It's not bad, I just wished they'd turned down some of the eye-fatiguing parts.Music (score 7/10): What to say about the music?  Well, it's okay.  It sounds fine to me and nothing grates on my ears.  I've noticed a far wider variety of tracks here than previous FF games (rock-inspired, pretty violin tracks, even harmonica at one point), yet none of them really stand out in one's mind or make me want to buy the soundtrack.  The exception to this is the chocobo theme, which I really liked.  There's also the voice acting.  I'm totally fine with most of the voices.  Vanille's voice occasionally annoys me, but that's about all my complaints on that.  I think that overall the voice acting is quite good.Characters (score 7/10): I daresay that only Sasz is likable in the beginning.  Lightning starts out as a frosty B-word, Snow is a bit annoying in his constant promises to save people (despite his inability to do so), Vanille is irritatingly bouncy and chipper constantly, and Hope is a whiny little coward who I quickly grew to dislike.  Really, out of all of them, Sasz is the only one who strikes me as having a relatable and likable personality right off the bat.  Lightning and Snow argue constantly (which gets extremely irritating to listen to), Vanille acts stupidly upbeat to the point where you just want to slap her, and Hope constantly whines about wanting to speak to Snow (I'm not going to say why, it's a spoiler) but then chickens out whenever he has a chance to do so (which also makes me want to slap him - either step up or shut up!).  It makes me feel such pity for Sasz; stuck with these irritants.  So, as you can tell, I'm not feeling much love for these people.  They do get better with time (specifically about half-way through the game), as they experience character development and get to be more likable.  However, that's a long time to suffer with irritating characters, especially since I've played plenty of other games that had good relatable characters right off the bat (in fact, I even liked Neku from TWEWY better, and he was a terribly unsociable person!).Story (score 8/10): Well, the story starts off immediately with a bang!  Much like the opening to Final Fantasy 7, the game just throws you right into some action, no sleepy villages here!  I personally liked the story and found it interesting enough.  In many ways it's a familiar tale of two groups that fear and despise each other and of a group of random people who get caught up in the struggle and must come together to try to heal those differences.  It's a pretty standard tale, but I did enjoy the setting and atmosphere.  I did not actually finish the story though (stopped around chapter 10); the reason why will become apparent later...Battle System (score 6/10): This new \"faster paced\" battle system sure is a departure for the Final Fantasy series.  It feels a lot like Legend of Legaia (if you've ever played that game) where you have a gauge with slots and you fill the slots with attacks, except with a really fast active time battle system going.  It does feel at times with the auto-battle that you're not really in control of things, and if you try to input it manually, battle moves far too fast to make this practical.  I might sound over-nostalgic here, but I miss the old style FF battles that felt less rushed.  Technically active time battles have been around for ages, but it feels far more frenzied in this entry, to the point where it starts to really strain the eyes.  I honestly started to feel mentally burned out after so many of these constant battles.  The weird thing is that the battles move really fast, yet they feel somehow more tedious than battles in the older entries did.  This is especially bad during boss fights.  For a game that purports to have quick battles, bosses have WAY too much HP.  Like in the over 100-thousand range.  It's takes ages to kill a boss (even with the crazy quick battle system) and is really tedious.  Now, don't go thinking that I just don't \"understand\" how to utilize the battle system effectively, because I do know how to chain attacks and stagger opponents and exploit weaknesses.  The fact remains though that bosses get way too hard around the halfway point of the game, especially when they start casting doom on your main character (which kills you instantly when a timer reaches zero - no way to remove it).  Speaking of main character, the character marked as \"leader\" is the only one you get to control, and the others are A.I. teammates.  The A.I. in this game is the best I've ever experienced, so kudos for that.  You can set parameters for behavior from the menu and switch between them in battle, and that's how you control the party.  The battle system as a whole is competent enough, but I'm still not too fond of this system; they changed so much that it doesn't really feel like Final Fantasy anymore, and I just personally prefer a slower, more relaxed pace.Gameplay (score 5/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  I bet you're all thinking that I'm going to complain about linearity now.  Well, you'd be wrong!  I've been playing RPGs for a long time, and linearity is not something that bugs me.  No, there's something else here that killed the game for me: pacing.  I don't normally complain about pacing unless the game is really slow and boring.  That is not the issue here.  The pacing in this game is abusively frenetic.  There's so much non-stop action that it's desensitizing and instead of being exciting, it's boring.  I'd played about 5 hours in the beginning, and not once was there a quiet moment with the party where they could just chill and relax a bit.  In fact, the soonest time you come across such a point is 8 hours in!  And that's only a town in a flashback (and only lasts about a minute)!  Well, there is another quiet moment (in a house) about 17 hours in, or at least you think there'll be a quiet moment, but it's ended immediately by a battle literally bursting in through the ceiling.  Apparently their idea of pacing is to have a 30 second long calm moment about every eight hours!  Well, there is another breather when you get to Nautilus, but these moments are still brief, and few and far between.  I'm a huge believer in the idea that an RPG should have balance.  The exciting moments need to be balanced out with calmer moments so that the player does not experience mental fatigue.  Normally, such a time would come in a town, but as you may already know, there are no towns in this game!  The never-ending dungeons combined with the harried (and irritating) pace of battles made me feel constantly stressed and yet, oddly enough, simultaneously jaded and bored with it all.  The whole experience just feels unsatisfying...  In fact, I had previously resolved to finish this whole game because I am (or was) a Final Fantasy fan, but one Saturday night after finally beating the Barthandelus boss battle (which was really irritating) and watching the pretty cutscene, it dawned on me:  I'm in another bland tunnel filled with monsters.  I continued on, only to be greeted by yet another boss who's crazy hard and casts the doom spell.  It was at that point that the depressing reality of this game sank in: after working all week, I would be wasting my entire weekend on this crap instead of playing something fun.  Just the thought of pressing on only to be met with more endless monotonous tunnels of monsters and nothing much to look forward to made me feel sick inside. I've come to the conclusion that my time is precious (I'm going to die some day!), and I'm much better off doing something more enjoyable with my time instead of wasting it on a game that isn't fun for me.  That's when I decided to quit.  Yep, I have a lovely library of games on DS that need playing.  I think I'll pick out a nice slow-paced point and click adventure game...Overall (score 5/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  You might be wondering why my overall score is so much lower than the individual categories.  Well, this is a case where this whole game is truly LESS than the sum of its parts.  I remember the days when the name \"Final Fantasy\" was synonymous with quality - I used to buy these games on the name alone, and was always amazed at how great they were!  It pains me to say this, but that time is over.  This series has been going downhill ever since FFX-2, and as much as I was sorely hoping that this would be the entry to change my mind, it has only further cemented the idea that this series just isn't what it used to be.  I'm sure there are some people out there (perhaps even people who never really liked Final Fantasy before) who enjoy this new direction since the game is technically competent, and not that terrible, but this game just doesn't do it for me.  I hate to sound all nostalgia-ridden (and therefore, apparently, instantly non-credible), but even if this game didn't have the name \"Final Fantasy\" on it, I still wouldn't have enjoyed it!  To me, the series feels like a pathetic shadow of it's former self; a sickly thing that's just barely hanging on, staggering around uselessly until it finally meets it's demise (or until everyone is so sick of it that they won't buy it anymore).  Maybe it's time to drag it out back like a crippled Chocobo and put it out of it's misery...","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2012"}
{"product_name":"B003ZHMMEM","description":"","reviewerName":"Charles \"Altered Confusion\"","summary":"Donkey Kong Country Returns Review","reviewText":"Once again it is time to play as DK (Donkey Kong) as his horde of Bananas has yet again been stolen right under his nose. This time its a hypnotizing mask that gets all the animals on the island to do its dirty work. You get to choose slight variations in your path to defeat bosses that will try to stop you from ascending the Volcano for the final showdown.Graphically this looks like Donkey Kong Country with updated graphics. There's also the wider range of level types that you'll be taking on as well, which all look great. I think by sticking with the 3D in the 2D side scrolling world, this game could not be any better.The music, as you would expect, has that Donkey Kong Country flavor, and by sticking to its roots captures the gamers of yesteryear and won't let them go, but also the music still fits with this generation of console.The controls have a bit more to them. You can run and jump as usual, but this time around you can also do a little extra to try to take out some of the enemies that stand in your path, or reveal secret areas. If there is a second player they will notice that Diddy Kong has a couple new moves as well to help out.Going off of basically the same plot every time would seem like it would doom the game, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised to find that not only did it really not matter, but it allowed me to compartmentalize that portion of the game and get into the rest of the game. Let me tell you, the rest of the game did not disappoint either. There's plenty of climbing, rolling, jumping, riding in carts, etc to keep you occupied and trapped on that island. The boss battles can be difficult, but once you've found the pattern of the attacks you'll find that truly nothing will stand in your path, as long as you smartly game. You'll find Cranky Kong living in a hut willing to sell you items to give you an extra heart, help find hidden puzzle pieces, give you some extra lives, or even give you a key to unlock a different path that can be taken. My one qualm with Cranky's items for sale, and I'll save you some heartbreak here, is that they are all one time use items. So don't think that by equipping the extra heart item for the next level that you'll ever get to use that exact item again. Once you're done with the level you'll have to buy another one from Cranky to do it again. Personally once I figured that out I never equipped an item for a level. I can see where the Parrot that sniffs out the puzzle pieces would come in handy, if I was trying to get every little thing out of the game, but other than that, there's really no reason to do that.If you liked any of the Donkey Kong Countries, you're probably going to find yourself liking this one. There's definitely a fair share of throwbacks for people looking for some nostalgia, but at the same time there's some new wrinkles to keep you going through the game. It always good to see a strong title on the Wii, one with some history, and this one doesn't disappoint, this one gets an 8.9 out of 10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

Another thing I notice is that the game can be very difficult ,you will die a lot, and the frustrating part is that if you didn't make it to the check point you will have to start all over again.

Second the spells are unnecessarily confusing. They each  have their own symbol with no quick description so you actually have to memorize exactly what each does. And seriously WTF are there 2 different blades? I would think that would be the first thing the game tells you but no. Third there is no real way to figure out what you are doing because the first enemies in the game kill you in 2 hits or so. Sure they die fast as well, but that doesn't really help you learn anything about the controls.Out of hundreds of games I have played and beaten this is the only game I have ever just given up on even trying to play. I'm sure I'll come back to it in several months and have fun?Edit: Ok... got around to actually figuring out the controls and aside from non-descriptive spells found tons of other problems. To remap keys I have to exit the game and do it from the launcher. There is just no reason for this... The mouse gets really laggy for no apparent reason making the control you need very difficult. Dodge is also completely worthless because when it does work (usually have to hit the button 3 times or so) it is unresponsive and slow acting from the time you hit the button to actual dodge.So far the gameplay seems to be more about positioning yourself to avoid damage with strategic blows than hack and slash type combat. This is a huge problem with the unresponsive controls.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S.

I never played the original Perfect Dark. So, unlike many of you reading this review today, I'm coming to the series virgin, in a sense. I don't know how it stacks up to the original, but I suspect those of you who played the original obsessively enough to care probably already know how the two compare. This review, then, is more suited for folks like me (besides, I'm sure any 360 owners we have on staff who are familiar with both games will be more than happy to chime in on their blogs.So here's the skinny: Perfect Dark Zero is, as the title suggests, the prequel to the Perfect Dark loved and honored by N64 owners. Initially scheduled for release on the original Xbox PD Zero instead finds itself as the showcase first-party release for the launch of Xbox 360, If that sounds like a daunting position in which to be, it is: flash back four years, and that was where Bungie's Halo found itself.The difference between then and now is that Halo was expected to shoulder Microsoft's hopes and dreams for the platform ultimately for several months - and some would say years, as Halo remained a top seller up until the day Halo 2 hit store shelves. :Perfect Dark Zero doesn't necessarily suffer from that curse, thanks to a couple of third party titles: Call of Duty 2 and Condemned: Criminal Oirigns.On the other hand, though, while Perfect Dark may not shoulder the exact same burden for Microsoft that Halo did, its release is certainly a hold-your-breath moment for Rare, which didn't exactly wow gamers with Grabbed By The Ghoulies. Essentially, PD Zero and Kameo are relevancy tests for Rare: was Microsoft's money well spent in acquiring the studio, or did Nintendo maximize a declinng investment?Let's put it this way; Rare didn't knock one completely out of the park here, as one might have hoped and expected given the development time put into the game, but Zero doesn't have any truly glaring weaknesses, either. The worst that can be said about any facet of the game is that they play it safe as frequently as they take a chance on something new.I won't spend much time on the story. Partly, this is because I don't want to spoil anything, but it's partly also because the story really isn't the strength of the game.Despite the futuristic setting and vague technopunk feel to the game, this really isn't Deus Ex; which is to say, you aren't playing the game to find out what happens next. That's just an ancillary benefit.Rather, if you're interested in Perfect Dark Zero, you're probably mostly focused on the online multiplayer. The single-player/co-op campaign has some bearing on this, because the controls are basically identical, but beyond \"how easy is it to control Joanna,\" that's probably the extent of relevancy for the offline campaign.For the most part, the answer to that is \"pretty easy.\" I had some difficulty with some of the gadgets, as the on-screen prompts aren't always the clearest. Many times, when you're using the spycam or the electronic hacking device, you're going to be doing so from memory. When you first play the game, there will be some trial and error involved until you get it right. After that, it's all old hat.One thing PDZ does that even Halo 2 only imperfectly captured is the ability to lug around an impressive arsenal. While Halo 2 allowed you to carry and use two weapons simultaneously, PDZ takes that a step further. Weapons are divided into classes, with certain weapons being easier to carry than others. You can, for example, carry four pistols - the idea being you can dual-wield two of them, or use one at a time, and switch between the two types of pistols as necessity demands.If heavier firepower is your forte, that's okay; Jo can still carry the big stuff, but you aren't going to see her toting a machine gun in each hand, or a rocket launcher, say. Such weapons will basically take up two slots. In addition to weapons, you also have access to various gadgets, such as a weapon-equipped flying spycam that you can use to disable guards or non-sentient obstacles along the way. These have their own compartments in inventory, so while you are limited in the number you can carry, your weapons loadout doesn't affect your gadgets, nor do your gadgets affect your weapons loadout.As you'd expect, any of the weapons can be used to bludgeon some poor sap in melee combat if you get close enough to warrant it, but ideally, if you're toting a gun around, the enemy getting that close means that you're probably a crappy shot.Anyway. Back to brass tacks. For the most part, Jo's movement when packing iron feels natural and is reasonably easy to use. The exception is the shift from first- to third-person when using an inanimate object for cover. It's more difficult to line up your shot if you're trying to take somebody out from cover, which simply gives your opponents more time to try to put a bullet through your eye. This won't be as big a deal in single-player (unless you're on the higher difficulties), but when you face off against people online who have insane FPS skills, it can be a hindrance.By pulling back into third-person, it's possible that an obstacle will block what would otherwise be an unobstructed view had the camera remained in the first-person perspective. You can sometimes correct this by using the scope on a properly equipped weapon...but that offers a profile for a vigilant enemy to take out.Maybe the most interesting thing Rare has done here is their damage representation. As with Halo, if you're taking damage, but can find cover for a few seconds, you'll recover your full life bar, similar to the shields in Halo. The difference is, not all damage is created equal. Some is superficial, and you can recover fully from it, but there are some types of damage - notably melee - that wil decrease the length of your bar. So while you're recovering the bar you've got, it's conceivable that you could have a progressively shorter life bar if you're taking too much damage.The online gameplay modes are an odd hybrid of classic FPS multiplayer modes and nods to Counter-Strike. The \"Deathmatch\" play types are basically what you'd expect - deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and so forth. The twist here is that you can play with bots in the game, and you can set the difficulty level anywhere from \"doddering old man\" on up to \"They will not stop, ever, until you are dead!\"There's also a \"Dark-Ops\" mode, which uses the CS-inspired money system to equip your avatar prior to each firefight. It's worth noting, though, that the system isn't always available. In \"Infected\" mode, for example, only the human players at the start of a round can buy new armor and weapons. The infected players, displayed as skeletons, have to make do with what they can scrounge or steal. Additionally, the team Dark-Ops modes seem to award the cash based on team performance, allowing a newer player the ability to properly equip him or herself without falling perennially behind the 8-ball by playing more skilled opponents. Whether this was also true of CS, I don't know, but it's new to me.Visually, Perfect Dark Zero is impressive. I don't know if I'd call it the best-looking game on Xbox 360 of the launch titles; Call of Duty 2 looks damned good, and Project Gotham Racing 3 is a stunner as well. Still, with the exception of minor slowdown in particularly furious firefights, Rare delivered a game that easilylives up to its billing for the 360 launch. A standard caveat that I'm going to get out of the way now, so I'm not repeating myself ad nauseum in future reviews: the game looks great in standard definition, but if you have an HDTV-capable set, it's going to look that much better.Minor flaws: when playing online, it can be difficult to tell friend from foe, except by using the reticle of one's weapon. Some of the death animations stretch the limits of believability somewhat, but then, so does the idea that you're in a combat simulator which uses your DNA to create foes for other combatants-in-training.The voice acting gets cheesy at times, but it's mostly pretty good. Even for the parts that aren't, the excellence of the soundtrack makes up for it, and the sounds of combat are top-notch as well.On the whole, I'd summarize Perfect Dark Zero like this: it's a solid, entertaining FPS that holds its own offline, and manages to do things differently enough online that you can still have a blast even if you're getting routinely beaten down. If you've got actual skill at such games, it's going to be that much better.Perfect Dark Zero isn't the best Xbox 360 game. It's not even the best Xbox 360 shooter. That said, you really can't go wrong with it, either. (...).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2006"}

The graphics are gorgeous, the main character (female!) has personality, and it's a good combo of shooting, stealth and puzzle solving.We've been of course testing all of the release titles, but we keep coming back to Perfect Dark Zero just for sheer fun of gameplay.First, the basic mission tree. You are Joanna Dark, daughter of a bounty hunter who follows in her father's footsteps. You're athletic, nimble, smart, and maybe a bit fool-hardy. The game is set in the future (Joanna was born in the year 2000) and you get an interesting mix of locales to explore as you take on your assignments.The graphics in this game are simply GORGEOUS, as you might expect from the XBox 360. I highly recommend you play this on a HD TV - I've done screenshots comparing HD to low-def and the difference is rather impressive. The water ripples, the light plays off the rippling water, the rippling water reflects on the textured brick wall, you name it. You get red and blue lights shining down from the ceiling and the lights color their surroundings and even combine where they cross.There are of course some amusing issues - this still isn't photo-realism of course. There are times that a red laser beam has slight \"ripples\" in it, for example. Still, the quality is far better than anything else on the market.I suppose you could complain that Joanna goes running around in high-heeled boots and low-cut pants, but heck, I was impressed that her chest size was reasonably normal. Compared to most other video games out there, with their mostly-naked women with inflato-boobs, Joanna is quite demure!The sound is aiming for a James Bond feel here. I think that is pretty clear from the intro credits. You get a boppy rock soundtrack through much of the game. The dialogue is reasonably well done, and you can't really say much about how gunshots sound. They sound like gunshots.Gameplay is a mix between Splinter Cell and a FPS. There are times that being stealthy and quiet really pay off. There are other times that just running fast and blasting away will work. There are cool lockpick puzzles, too. I do get frustrated that you can't \"jump\" though. I'll see a nice, inviting open window at less than waist high, and I have to walk right by.I have mixed feelings about co-op mode. On one hand it's fun to have two females working side by side and taking out the enemy. On the other hand, if one person decides to quit, it shuts down the whole mission. I really like it on other games where a person can pop in and out as necessary. This especially is helpful if a less experienced gamer is stuck and needs help just for a short while.There's also deathmatch style gaming available, both on local gameplay and XBox Live. This lets you sneak around and head-shot your enemies with great glee.We've played this for many hours and haven't noticed any problems with lag or crashing. There are certain moves that don't happen instantly - for example, when you shoot from cover, you have to wait for Joanna to \"rise from a crouch\" before she fires. This is quite realistic. The game also has cinematic sequences when things go into a Matrix-like slo-mo which seems to be in many current movies.If you play this game on easy mode, you can probably zip through all the missions in a single very long gaming session (say 14-16 hours). The harder levels of difficulty are of course more challenging. Really, though, all single-player gameplay is is just a training mode to help you prepare for live gameplay. Once you've gotten your skills sharpened on the computer players, prepare to take on the real challenge, with real live opponents!Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2005"}

PSP obviously has beautiful graphics, a nice big, bright screen, great controls, comfortable to hold, it seems to have it all as far as gaming devices go.Where PSP falls short is it's gaming library. It just can't compete with the DS, as least from a female perspective. It just doesn't have many titles that make me want to shell out $40 to buy them. PSP is by far and away geared mainly at male gamers. I am not trying to be stereotypical here. I am a gamer and I love most types of games, but the genre I love most (RPG) is an area that PSP sorely lacks. There are a few good titles, sure, but nothing compared to the plethora of RPG's available on the DS. Plus, the DS has tons of \"just for fun\" games like Nintendogs, Cooking Mama, Clubhouse Games, etc. PSP, not so much.PSP also proclaims itself as an all-in-one device. You can play games, watch movies, browse photos, surf the web, all in this one little device! Let me tell you, the one and only thing that the PSP really does well, is play games. The web browser on PSP is a complete joke. It's miserably slow, even when connected to cable, the controls are really awkward and not intuitive at all, and there is no flash support. It has plenty of other issues, but those are the main ones. I was SO excited to be able to browse on my PSP from the couch, and within a few days I was tired of torturing myself and stopped using it altogether.As a means to storing and display photos, I suppose it does a decent job. But let's be honest, if you have a digital camera with a view screen, browsing photos on your PSP isn't really any different than viewing them straight from your camera. It's fine if you want to have a custom wallpaper for your PSP or just store some photos of family and friends to keep with you all the time, but don't expect more than that.As a video player, it does a fine job except that you have to re-purchase all your movies on UMD. What a colossal waste of money! If you have even the slightest knowledge about these things, you can quickly figure out how to rip the DVD's you own into a file that you can then play on your PSP. Then you don't have to buy all those silly UMD's that will be obsolete in a few years anyway! And you don't have to carry them around with you either. Win win, right? The only downside to that is the lack of storage on the PSP. It simply wasn't meant to store much of anything on it's limited memory. If you want to bring movies with you, you're going to have to invest in some memory cards, which run about $50 for 16gigs, which will hold MAYBE 4 movies. After buying your PSP and two 16gb memory cards, you've spent $300. For that, you could have picked up an Archos 5 (or possibly COWON Q5) with 60gb of storage, larger screen, better sound quality, better picture quality, and great web browser WITH e-mail support!All in all, the point I'm trying to make is, if you want a multi-media device for pictures, videos and web surfing, PSP is NOT the answer. By the time you've bought all those memory cards to store all your photos/videos/music, you could have purchased a device that is dedicated to those purposes and does them all much better than the PSP ever could. The PSP is a gaming device, nothing more. It can dabble in these other areas, but don't buy a PSP thinking it's going to meet all your multimedia needs. It will not.When considering the choice between the PSP and the DS, I would just suggest that you look at the game libraries for each system and pick the one that has the most titles that appeal to you. They are both great gaming systems. If you can afford to have both, go for it! As gaming devices, you won't be let down by either one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2008"}

The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

I actually enjoyed this game very much even though it was a console port.  The premise is interesting, similar to Blade Runner (androids as humans) which was what got me hooked, the story.  The game was stable on my PC with few crashes.  Other than that, it is a generic shooter, a poor man's Mass Effect game.  The shooting is pretty good, played with a 360 controller and had no issues.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2012"}

It is the best shooter bar none.  Everything is improved about this game (from the single player aspect) graphics, weapons, sound, et al.  The story is great and I would recomend reading the Halo books before playing this game.  The special addition dvd has many interesting tidbits and is worth the extra 5 dollars.  I got it 2 days after the release date with paying normal shipping charges.  I rate this a 4.5 because of the total length (a little short) of the game and because I didn't like the ending.

 well, young fighter, every set of colored squares has a corresponding triangle/small pyramid thing that, if destroyed, will take out whatever colored square they are on, well, all of that color.  but in order to destroy an invulnerable pyramid, you must pick it up and throw it on a space which does not have any color.  i think there is another way, but i can't remember.  or just pick the enemy up and throw them off.  this is also a good tactic, if your party can't reach a certain enemy, have one character (someone who can run really far) get to them, then throw them back to the rest of your gang for a good ol' beating.  this tactic is also helpful for bridging gaps in the map.  since the item world maps are randomly genereted, they can sometimes be impossible to traverse.  most of the time, you can toss you characters over the small gaps onto the other \"islands\" and beat your enemy silly.  while other times, some of these islands appear like 20 spaces away from where you are and you have no possible way of getting to them.  even the most agile of characters can only toss people like 7 or 8 spaces.  but that's not really too big a problem, unless your trying to kill off all the enemies on each floor for better spoils at the end of each ten floor section.  at these points you have the option of leaving the item world or further venturing into harder levels.  it's almost always wise to leave for more items and saving, but i can only warn you to do so.  some people will just have to learn from their mistakes.well, this is dragging on enough, so i'll just say that this game is amazing and any fan of strategy rpgs should not be without this.  there is so much more to this game, but i'm beginning to develop a cramp in my fingers.  so i can't tell you about the secret unlockable character classes or different ways to make new items and super charge regular ones.  but i'm sure with time you can find all this out on your own.  so take my advice and go pick of this game, it's one hell of a time killer.  or is that social life killer?  i'm leaning toward the latter.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2004"}

The graphics are the best yet, and I think EA finally improved the graphics engine to be par with current generation consoles. The AI is still garbage, still to easy to exploit the terrible AI, just play online and if you don't know how you will learn fast. Well at least the QB keeper doesn't guarantee yards this year. The truck rating is overemphasized, and any back with 90 truck or better is going to break 5 man tackles with ease, pfff thats not \"in the game\" EA. QBs can still run in circles and pass for 100 yds 1988 Techmo Bowl style. So meh game needs lots of work, learn from bungie and Halo about decent AI EA. Also this year EA is trying to get a few more bucks by asking for more money for downloadable content, BOOO, shame on you poor EA, guess someone has to pay for corporate jets and Executive bonuses huh. Another positive is EA fixed there network and I haven't seen any random disconnects or game lockups while playing online which is great. The hitstick doesn't guarantee fumbles anymore which is also a plus. The matching system is still a joke, I don't want to play anymore 20 year old gansta wannabes that have time to have a 130-30 record, no thanks.

Beware!","reviewerName":"GintaxAlvissforever","summary":"Wonderful Game to Add To This Series","reviewText":"I'll say it right now. Gameplay wise, Disgaea 4 is the best of the best in the series and for good reasons. The gameplay picks up after Disgaea 3 and improving it meaning weapon change is still possible and instead of giving so many characters to make and giving them too many weapons they can master, most character are limited to two to three weapons they can master. They made how many more characters bearable. You don't have to work to get a bigger classroom with mana. Instead you unlock a panel on the character map for every chapter you complete, so by the end of the game, you'll have plenty of panels. If you run out out room, the characters are placed in another room which is very beneficial for the player.Weapon change works much better in this game compared to the third so the monsters turn into weapons that benefits them. Seriously, who thought it would be a good idea for a magic based unit like an Alraune to be a spear in Disgaea 3. Here the Alaraune turns into a staff that makes him/her more beneficial in battle when given to a mage.Story wise, Disgaea 4 finally matches the first Disgaea in terms of a lovable cast and a great story. The story heavily revolves around politics, so unless you understand how politics work it will be hard to draw parallel to the real world references the game is referencing. Valvatorez is a great protagonist. Mature space cadet with a great moral standard and wonderful stats that is obsessed with sardines. His character works because he manages to be funny upon introduction. I won't spoil the story because it's easy to put together once you get into it...if you're not too busy with the item world. Which is another thing. The character world isn't available until you reincarnate one character at LV 100 (or reincarnation adds up to LV 100) meaning you won't get the character world until post game unlike Disgaea 3 which is my only negative of this game when reincarnation is essential for the post game.Overall, it's a great game that you should pick up if you're into games like this....Also Axel is back. :D","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2013"}

in the game play, from the \"timer\" mechanism used to extract wealth from hidden treasure chests and in the mechanism of the assassin's firearm. more, AS2 borrows the conceit of a village that the hero nurtures through property investment, the \"rents\" the hero receives as a result, the RB selector wheel that the hero uses to choose one or another weapon, the creepy setting of a swampy, half submerged landscape (in AS2, the area outside forl&igrave;), and dank catacombs that contain game tokens and complex puzzles. omitted (thankfully) are the expressions or japes that the hero must perform in fable 2 in order to win friends and unlock secrets.* OBLIVION -- finally, AS2 adapts the landscape sandbox from the oblivion games to give the romanga and tuscan cities a rural setting. although there isn't much to do out there but run around on side missions or treasure hunts. but free running over these fields provides a welcome contrast to the cramped environment of the early renaissance city.the urban settings -- florence, forl&igrave;, san gimignano, the walled auditore family villa in monteriggioni, and venice -- are beautifully realized, each with a separate palette of stone, light and architectural metaphors. though some landmarks (the piazza di san marco in particular) are delightfully realistic, the city layouts are only metaphors for the actual buildings of the era: the rialto fish market is here, but the gorgeous ca' d'oro just across from it is missing; the towers of san gimignano are not so closely spaced. even as 15th century settings, these cities will seem inaccurate to people who have actually been there. and while the history is highly fabricated and the conspiracy theory elaborately far fetched, it is nevertheless fun to have leonardo and machiavelli as side kicks and to assault the borgia pope. it's no exaggeration of history to say that he deserves it!aside from all these theatrical improvements over the original AS, a major pleasure in this game is the wider range of physical (climbing and jumping) capabilities at ezio's disposal, and the much more complex combat moves and battle opponents. the fights are also more arduous and realistic (ezio's gnads take a lot of punishment), and the various ways in which enemies can be dispatched are unexpected. my favorite move was the \"disarm\" maneuver when fighting an enemy with bare hands: it's the most effective way to put down a \"brute\" or heavily armed solider, though difficult to pull off when other soldiers are also attacking.puzzles play a large part in the storyline; searching for glyphs and the intellectual or combinatorial puzzles they create are necessary to unlock the video \"truth\" segments (which end up showing that adam and eve were actually creations of alien beings, with the illusion creating teutonic weapon of AS as the edenic apple); physical climbing and leaping puzzles, some of them under time pressure, are necessary to unlock the armor of altair -- very handy, as it provides full health and never needs repairs. these are not really taxing for an advanced gamer, though they may require several attempts to figure out.in fact, one of the things that AS2 does right is judge the skill level of an accomplished gamer. there were a few places in GTA4 or in dead space where i bascially gave up on the game for a month because i had reached a task or side mission that i found impossible to complete. this does not happen in AS2. i \"died\" only about 30 times, which happened primarily from physical falls during climbing puzzles (and the game spawns you immediately in place again). puzzles have numerous saved checkpoints, so you do not (as in GTA4) have to rebuild the task from the beginning. though i was severely tested several times (the last assassin sarcophagus is a difficult physical puzzle), i got through most tasks on the first try, and the most difficult after two dozen or so attempts. the point is that, by carefully adjusting the task difficulty, the game acquires a cinematic flow and narrative power: when ezio dies you are not embroiled in doing an impossible chore, but in living a virtual life. to reinforce this flow the \"animus interruptus\" is drastically reduced: the abstergo plot is limited to brief opening and closing episodes and to just two interruptions of the fantasy narrative. this flow is perhaps the greatest attraction in the game.there are many charms and innovations in this game that i haven't mentioned. but i will say that AS2 clearly reveals the biggest flaw in current videogame technology: the impersonator facial simulation. as advanced and impressive as that is as a motion capture and animation technology, there is something hideous and creepy in the glossy, cadaverous hues in which most faces are painted, the weirdly illuminated glints of teeth in the mouth, and the bizarre effect of looking up under a beard that seems to be a curved piece of cardboard. i did miss the honeyed light and floating flecks in the air that made AS an atmospheric experience, but it's the waxy animation of human speech and the plastic rendering of human skin that grates each time, every time, it swims onto the screen.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2009"}

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"Being an Assassin should surely be more fun...","reviewText":"I was sorely disappointed by Assassin's Creed 1.  After all the hype, after all the publicity, and after the pimple-faced kid at Gamestop told me it was a \"Must Buy...\"  It turned out to be one of the most boring and uninspired games I've ever played.  I've been entertained longer by Diner Dash.So when Assassin's Creed 2 started showing up on my TV screen, I thought, \"Oh boy, here we go again.\"  I did lots of research, I read several reviews.  Finally I picked up a copy for a discounted used price - knowing that my membership at Gamestop would give me some extra money should I decide to trade this one in as I did AC1.The opening of the game was as I expected - the stunning graphics are evident immediately.  The voice acting - as I have read - is superb.  Finally I was at the controls of Ezio.  Time to go killin'!!!  Oh, no, wait...  First I have to race someone to a rooftop.  Okay, slice-and-dice time!  No, hang on, gotta deliver some documents.  Okay, now I have to... ...deliver more documents.  Oooh, okay - go rough up some guy who's cheating on my sister.  About this time I started to feel concern.  This felt eerily like Grand Theft Auto IV.  I was just waiting to have to take someone out on a \"man-date.\"Then there's a minor plot twist.  Suddenly there's a sword in my hand.  Here we go......well, sorta.  First there's training (even though we've done this before) and a few more stupid races to do...  And then next thing you know, you're out and about, murdering at whim.I CAN say that at this point - half-way through the main story - I don't feel like I've done the same thing over and over and over.  It's not as repetitive as the first game, even though it's still just traipsing around killing people for reasons you never quite feel like you understand...  This game feels like an 80's cartoon - the good guys verses the bad guys and though you never quite learn how the fight started or the actual intents of either faction, you're told to root for the good guys, so there ya have it.But the game still just isn't INTERESTING.  It isn't FUN.  There's no real motivation to head off for the next mission except for maybe unlocking the next weapon.  The variety of side-missions - though certainly more abundant then AC1 - still aren't interesting.  Running deliveries, racing people (who you never actually see racing - you just compete against an arbitrary clock) give you more to do, just no reason to do it.  The assassination contracts are fun because, well, in case you weren't aware - you're an ASSASSIN.  They're the only side missions that actually relate to the overall objective of the game.  They also aren't dolled out to you by some lazy guy whining about his leg hurting so \"please go do my job for me - oh and hurry 'cause I'm hungry...\"  There's also the tomb challenges which are OK - basically the developers have chosen to show off how well their game engine can work as a platformer.  Of course, if I wanted to PLAY Mario, I'd have BOUGHT Mario...The challenge of the game isn't working your way through the story - it's finding ways to do what you have to do CREATIVELY.  Sure, you can whip out the $11,000 sword you bought and time a couple button presses (the counter-attack is still the only method that really works in a fight) to clean out the guards, kill your target and be done.  Or you can try to get creative - leap across some roofs, stick some throwing knives into a few unsuspecting archers, flip on the \"blue-tinted-night-vision-titled-'Eagle-Eye'\" and stalk your target until the opportunity arrives for a signature flying assassination - easily the game's most pleasing visual.  But most times this won't work.  Your throwing knives cannot be aimed - you have to select a guard which only works 25% of the time.  A guard will see you too soon - or more annoyingly - from behind their own heads.  Or you'll jump off a roof as the camera spins around and suddenly you completely lose your bearings and assassinate some innocent woman carrying a box...  It just doesn't WORK like you expect it to, like the demo's show it working, and you ultimately just end up feeling disappointed.A true Assassin collects intel, they stalk their target and infiltrate the enemy's life.  They spend indeterminable periods of time waiting for the right opportunity and strike when it's least expected.  Assassin's Creed just doesn't present this strategy.  It puts your targets inside a building and you have to attack that building.  You have to generate a strategy on the fly and hope that the game lets you pull it off.  Ultimately, the game itself limits you from doing what you feel needs to be done.  Why can't I drop down from a ceiling to make a kill?  Why can't I dress up as a guard and infiltrate the enemy compound?  Why the hell can't I crouch behind short walls or boxes??  Why can't a guy who leaps from buildings and scales vertical walls somersault over a guard and put a knife through his back?  And why do they keep scripting the story so that the target knows I'm there anyways?  Doesn't that defeat the purpose??A lot of people have recommended Modern Warfare in lieu of buying Assassin's Creed.  I think that's ridiculous - they're entirely different genres of games.  But if you really want a GREAT sleuthing game, with deep strategy and variety, incredible combat, and that really lets you pick your own way through unsuspecting guards in a way that makes you anxious to play it again and again and again because there might be a strategy you haven't learned yet, then you NEED to pick up Batman: Arkham Asylum.  It is EVERYTHING that Assassin's Creed needs to be.  And if you've already played through that game twice as I have, well, then just hope that IT has a more successful sequel than Assassin's Creed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00007E1OA","description":"Devil May Cry 2, the sequel to the gothic horror classic, features more and bigger environments, including a Gotham-like city and an old European town. There are now two playable characters--allowing you to play as Dante or a brand-new heroine. And Dante is even more stylish and tough than before, having gained plenty of experience fighting demons. The level of animation and visual detail rivals a Hollywood action flick.Devil May Cry 2will also track a player's skill level and adjust the enemies' difficulty according to how well players perform. And Dante now has more moves and attacks, plus an enhanced Devil Trigger: Once Dante's devil meter is full, he will be able to transform into a demon. This demon form features new visual effects and allows Dante to destroy enemies with one smashing blow.","reviewerName":"ooocarl06","summary":"just not the same","reviewText":"When the first devil may cry was released, the public was blown away. Dante was cool in everyway, he had bad ass moves, even more bad ass weapons, and just new how to give the baddies a hard time. Devil May Cry 2 was looking to be the breakaway hit that surpassed the first in everyway. However, it almost falls short in evry single aspect form the forst game.There only two points that have improved in Devil May Cry 2. the  first being the controls of the game, they still say much the same, very fluid and easy to adapt to. I also found it a nice change to have a second playable character. The problem with this character is that her moves are almost exactly the same as Dante's she just moves a bit faster.As for the storyline,...well there really is no storyline. The first Devil May Cry was great because not only did you get to obliterate hoards and hoards of baddies, but it was all packed to gether with an excellent storyline. Once you finish this game, you feel like you actually know less about who Dante actually is, because the storyline is EXTREMELY confusing.Another adition, which could have come off as either a good or bad thing, is that the level size is MUCH bigger. Unfortunately in this game, it is a very bad thing, since you spend most of your time brainless tapping the button that fires your guns. As a matter of fact, when you get to the flying bat on the roof top, the only way to hit it is to continously mash the fire button, and since the game has auto aim, there is no strategy! The whole point of having both a sword AND guns is so that you can use them both, and in this game you will find yourself using your guns MUCH more than your sword. This also makes leveling up your sword with red souls pointless, since most of the time your not using it!I'm not saying this game is completely empty of any entertainment, there are shining moments when you find yourself creating huge combos, and yes you still feel like a bad ass, SOMETIMES. If your looking at this game because the first blew you away, you may just want to rent it, because the game is EXTREMELY easy, and you will probably beat it within five hours of picking it up. If you haven't played the first one and your thinking of buying the second. DON'T! Buy the first one, rent the second, believe me its not worth your money to buy!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2004"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Disappointing","reviewText":"There was a time when an Aliens VS Predator video game meant for a good, horrifying time. This new take on the franchise once again finds three different campaigns to choose from: the Alien, the Predator, and the Marine. While each campaign starts out spectacularly, eventually boredom will rear its ugly head. This is due to the poor level design and disappointing controls, which often come off as quite stiff. Not to mention that what begins as being a quite scary experience in each of the three campaigns, de-evolves into boring tedium. What saves Aliens VS Predator from being a complete clunker however is that the game is filled with some wonderfully violent moments, as well as some nicely designed character models and some great multiplayer modes. Other than all that though, there really isn't enough here to warrant Aliens VS Predator as being as worthwhile as it could have been, which is a crying shame considering the potential here for something special was quite high. It's still worth checking out though, just don't go in expecting any of the past glories that came with the franchise in the past.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2010"}

Lucas has been taught the art of combat in the ancient and deadly style of the Legion. Lucas is a skilled swordsman, and a master of two combat stances. He can fight with a sword and shield, which allows him to attack quickly, deal heavy damage, and interrupt and stun single targets. When outnumbered, he wields a massive two-handed sword.

Blazkowicz, fighting Nazis in World War 2. Also like previous games, the Nazis have access to supernatural technology and super-science. \"Wolfenstein\" takes place in the fictional town of Isenstadt, where Germans are digging through ruins to locate magical crystals. These crystals hold the secrets of creating powerful new weapons and summoning monsters - the usual shtick in these sorts of games.\"Wolfenstein\" is a mix of actual \"levels\" and a very limited form of hub-world. There are three \"factions\" in the world, though ultimately they're all working against the Germans: the resistance, the black market, and the researchers. There are very light RPG elements in the form of weapon upgrades, but they're relatively simple overall. The biggest change gameplay-wise is the medallion B.J. acquires, which allows him to use several different magical powers against his foes. These powers are \"seeing into the Veil\" (which reveals secret doors and magical enemies), slowing down time, creating force fields, and making one's attacks more damaging. In essence, there's nothing really \"special\" or \"unique\", but it's at least an attempt to break from standard shooter conventions (albeit not a particularly good one).The actual shooter controls are pretty iffy. They're not really terrible per se, but they're far from good. While there's some interesting sci-fi guns later on, most of the early parts are lackluster WW2 weapons that just don't leave a particularly good impression.

There are still creepy moments and jump scares but overall you're never placed in a position of utter helplessness. In fact, you're the most dangerous thing in this game, second only to Alma herself. Even the game's main antagonist (a mysterious and nightmarish creature) becomes more of a nuisance than an actual threat.Gameplay wise this is one of the best first person shooter I've ever played. The guns are varied and satisfying and the main protagonist's ability to slow time is an absolute blast. Activating this ability and systematically headshoting 3 or more enemies in one graceful sweep is an immensely satisfying experience. Upon completion you are giving the chance to replay the game as the protagonist's brother (Fettel) who is able to shoot energy from his hand and posses his enemies.Unfortunately I found the story unsatisfying, particularly the ending. I won't spoil it but I felt that Alma, the most important character in the game, wasn't explored further as she ought to have been. I also didn't get why the main protagonist hated his brother and mother because all things considered, they were all victims of an evil organization. Their actions as a result of this treatment, while extreme, was perfectly understandable in my opinion.Overall the game is an absolute blast that won't scare/bore you too much with dark lonely hallways and bumpity bumps in the dark.

Not only do you have great games (with the option of playing them in 3D), they range in various prices (usually $1.99 - $39.99) and if you keep your eye on the Nintendo eShop, you will find games on sale at times for even lower prices.You can play multiplayer games as well, so no need to worry about being confined to single player games. Interaction goes beyond multiplayer though, and these extras are not just worthless features, they extend the replay value in your games and give you a very valid reason to use other features (i.e. Pass by another 3DS owner with StreetPass enabled, and their Mii will end up on your 3DS ready to join you in your Mii Plaza to assist you in Mii games, and swap puzzles).Beyond games, you have the option of enjoying Netflix & Hulu Plus (via a subscription and an internet connection).

(Especially if you have a friend to tag along with you)","reviewText":"This game is basically Saints Row 3 on overdrive! I absolutely loved the story line and it was an incredible game. Sadly it was still in the same city as previous game, however I will not spoil the entire setting for anyone. The game introduces super powers and brings back all that wacky customization that we all loved back in SR3 (Well at least I know I did!)Adding a second player into the mix makes it a whole lot better in the long run. Not only can you play online/system link with another person, the things you can do are just fantastic! I have enjoyed the second play-through with my friend and it just felt a whole lot better cause I was playing with another person, but that is just me.If you like the Supernatural side of things and unrealistic fantasy, then this game is for you!However, if realism is what you are looking for, this game will definitely not cut it. I would recommend grabbing GTA V if you are looking for realism.Clearly I love both realism and fantasy, so I ended up getting both games and enjoyed them both. I do not know why, but I was more attached to the SRIV story line probably due to the connection with the characters from previous games. Of course, you do not have to play SR1.SR2 or SR3 before you play this, but I do recommend at least playing SR3 just so you get some back story. That is my honest opinion and this truly was an awesome game to have played!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00004SWM0","description":"Though it lacks the dramatic intensity of theFinal  Fantasyseries--the crown prince of console role-playing  games--SquareSoft'sLegend of Manastill satisfies with its beautiful  hand-drawn sets and its innovative nonlinear gameplay.Billed as the sequel to the Super Nintendo'sSecrets of Mana,Legend of Mana's story contains more than 60 self-contained  miniquests, but generally the goal is to restore the world's Mana, or  life energy. Gamers won't need to be obsessive about winning all the  quests, but there are some challenges that must be completed if you  wish to reach the final showdown. The game begins as players choose  either a male or female lead character while a map displays the new  lands within the world of Fa'Diel. In each of these lands, players will  find items and clues they can use in other lands. The fragmented nature  of the game can be disorienting for gamers looking for quick  gratification. A diary can be used to keep track of current miniquests,  while an encyclopedia neatly organizes the vast amount of story players  uncover. Due to the vast nature of this game's plot, you'll likely need  these features to stay focused on your quests.Animefans will be wowed by the character design and beautifully  illustrated storybook backgrounds. The game includes aPok&eacute;mon-style monster-raising element, which is  surprising for a teen-rated RPG, but it works well.--Porter  HallPros:Pok&eacute;mon-style monster raising adds nice nurturing element to  RPG tasksNonlinear quest system makes story engrossingStunning hand-drawn backgroundsCons:Music is at times absurdly overdramaticSecond player controls character only during battle","reviewerName":"\"bosley83\"","summary":"Legends are always remembered for their innovativeness","reviewText":"Innovative.  That is the single thing I can say but I won't.  LOM is one of SquareSoft's more original games, which are usually bad, that si somewhat good.  You are a hero that goes around completing events while trying to awaken the Mana Tree.  The game the most non-linear game I have ever seen on the Playstation.  That gives it it's strong points.  Some people, like my brother, don't have the time to sit and play though a RPG like Final Fantasy (pick one).  He simply has no time.  He plays a little and then can't pick up the controller for several months.  Soon he ends up forgeting the storyline.  Not with this game.  It's design allows the player to start and event and finish it and then choose another and finish that.  Usually you do them one at a time.  Very rarely does more than one event occur at the same time unless the player causes that to happen.  The battles are real-time, much like Parasite Eve 2.  The charge bar has been removed allowing you to whack the enemies to your hearts content without worrying about doing only 2 damage.  The music is very nice as well though it could have been better.  The graphics are beautiul and will make you feel like you are playing a painting.  The only problem I had started when I had no clue how to start up another event and I couldn't win yet.  Like some RPGs, the second you get the Sword of Mana artifact you can win the game, because you will be strong enough.  Others force you to do other things to get to the point where you can get to the final place and win.  My advice, if you like an original game go ahead and get it.  If you don't but want to try, rent it.  This game is a good idea and executing very well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2001"}
{"product_name":"B00005QDPZ","description":"Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron IIfeatures some of the  best graphics ever seen on a home console, and it is a proper, old-fashioned,Star Warsgame. If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube. The only flaw is that the missions are  needlessly short, but there's plenty of replayability, and by gosh there's those  graphics.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Jack M.

{"product_name":"B0009PETYO","reviewerName":"Ian","summary":"Is Neo the One?","reviewText":"Finally, after SIX FRIGGIN YEARS, we finally get to play as the big guy himself from the Matrix trilogy!  That's right, put your hands together, because you play as...Mouse!Just kidding!  Unlike the last matrix game, this time you finally get to play as the savior of mankind, Neo.  Was it worth the wait?  From my point of view, yes.Before we go any further, I'd like to give everyone a warning about the game.  WHEN YOU SEE A WHITE SCREEN AND TWO CHAIRS COMING TOWARDS YOU, SKIP THIS CUTSCENE!  IF YOU DON'T, THE GAME WILL RUIN THE ENDING FOR YOU!There we go.  I apologize if I gave you the impression that I was shouting, but I wish that someone had told me this before I played the game.  More on this later.At first glance, Path of Neo simply seems to be a reworked Enter the Matrix, except that you play as Neo, and with better graphics.  In a way that's true, because Path of Neo (PON) is a third person game where you run around shooting lots of guns, getting into lots of hand to hand combat, and doing cool matrix moves.What all is different here from Enter the Matrix?  Better graphics for one.  While lots of people don't seem to think the graphics are bad, they really aren't.  They are better then Enter the Matrix and have a higher level of quality.  There are lots of moments where I went \"Wow\" when seeing some spectacular scenery.  But, as many have pointed out, when you get up close and personal, the graphics can get pretty blocky and unimpressive.  Overall, I'd say the graphics are pretty good, but not earth-shattering.But gameplay always takes superiority over graphics.  And while it stumbles along the way, PON for the most part succeds.  If you haven't guessed already from the title, you play PON from Neo's point of view.  You start out as wimpy Mr. Anderson, running from cops and armed only with a push move.  As the game moves on, you slowly begin to unlock powerful moves one by one, further transforming yourself from a wimply desk worker to an ass-kicking trenchcoat fighter (who knows kung-fu!).The meat and potatoes of PON is it's fighting engine.  While the last game was a half and half mix between firing weapons and doing button mashing, PON places a bigger emphasis on hand to hand combat.  While you can get into big gunfights if you want to, more often then not you'll be getting up close and personal with your feet and with your fists.  Herin lies PON's greatest strength.  The hand to hand combat system is a lot better and a lot more satisfying then Enter the Matrix was.  While you could breeze through the last game simply by mashing buttons, you have to actually work and memorize combos to get through PON.But you don't have to worry about seeing the combination for a move only once, then try to memorize it.  PON has a nifty feature to help you out.  When you get into hand to hand combat with an enemy, the game oftentimes suggests what buttons to press by showing the button in the left corner of the screen.  For example, start punching an enemy with the triangle button, and the game will show the square button, suggesting that you should press that button to disarm the enemy.  This feature is extremly useful, and helps you learn the various moves quickly.And oh boy...you get some incredibly powerful moves througout the game.  By the end of your journey as Neo, you'll be smashing jaws, punching people twenty times in five seconds, and smashing your foe's skulls into the ground while you stand on them.  Shiny has put virtually all of Neo's moves from the movies into the game, and it's great fun to do them yourself, including his \"run up guy's chest and kick him in head\" move to \"Slam both fists into an enemy, sending them flying across the room\".  Pulling off these moves eventually becomes a breeze, and when you get really good at it, you will really feel like you are Neo, because you can take down any foe you come across.  Late in the game, agents won't be able to get even close to you without flying across the room from a well placed kick.If you don't feel like doing hand to hand combat, you can take up gunfighting.  Neo will come across a large array of weapons during his path as the One (though the variety of weapons is nowhere near as big as the last game).  You get pistols, shotguns, submachine guns, bombs, even grenade launchers (very useful against helicopters).  All of these weapons get the job done, but trust me, you'll have much more fun punching your foes!  Though I have to admit, flying through the air in slow motion while firing in every possible direction is quite cool!Because you are the one, and because you are aware that the matrix is an illusion, you have the abillity to focus yourself and use the illusion to your advantage.  Focus returns from the last game, but it's slightly tweeked.  Focus is essentially the ability to move faster, punch harder (much harder) and use exclusive moves that are physically impossible to pull off.  With the touch of a button, you can stop bullets, dodge bullets, leap high into the air, take out up to four foes at once, and so much more.  You'll even be able to activate code vision, which allows you to see those famous green lines that make up the matrix.While the game does contain virtually every action sequence from all three movies (sorry guys, you can't have sex with trinity in Zion), it expands many of these scenes.  For example, at the end of the first movie, Neo stopped bullets, destroyed Smith, and glared at the other agents.  In the game, you stop the bullets, but then run through the rooms in the hallway, laying the smackdown on the agents.  Likewise, after Neo beats up the Merovingians thugs (Sadly, you can't kill that french a**hole.  Why?!), he has to journey through the guy's dungeons to reach Morpheus and Trnity.  It's a blast to fight Smith, participate in the Burly brawl, and take to the skies in the explosive final battle from Revolutions.There are several scenes put in exclusivly for the game that are not in the movie.  Most of these scenes take place in the timeframe between movies 1 and 2, telling you some of the things that Neo did between the movies.  In one truly brilliant level that should have been in the second movie, you run around T.V. filled hallways while Agent Smith ominously taunts you from the screens.Sound and audio work well too.  Laurence Fishburn (Morpheus) returns to do new audio for his charachter and does a great Job.  For everyone else we have imitators who do a really good job (but Agent Smith sounds nothing like he was in the movie).  The music is...well, music.  Almost nothing from the movie's soundtrack made it in, but the new stuff is simply average.There are also a good amount of jokes in the game, poking fun at movie critics (\"Oh I get it, the black suited guy is the savior of humanity!\"), video game critics (\"Video games are teaching our children violence!\"), and video games themselves (\"I got the high score on Time Crisis\").  My favorite joke comes from Agent Smith.  When you get cut off from him, he keeps talking to you \"I know you're in there Mr. Anderson!  I can...smell you!\"But alas, PON does make a few foulups along the way, mostly with control, repetitivness, and the final battle.The control is probably the biggest problem that you'll face in PON.  It's a very strange setup which takes the better part of an hour or two to get the hang of.  Gunplay in paticular is terrible.  You press R2 to pull out your gun (which is selcted with the left and right buttons), use the right analog stick to select your target, then press square to fire.  During all of your gun battles, you'll also be moving with the left analog stick, jumping through the air and using focus as well, meaning that you'll be pressing more buttons as well.  So you'll be running around, focusing, jumping, targeting, and shooting all at the same time.  It's frustrating to get the hang of, but thankfully, it eventually becomes second nature.The repetivitvness is another problem.  All but two of the game's missions eventually boil down to \"Run around and beat everyone up\".  This is fun, but the game suffers from a lack of variety in the missions.  The only exceptions are the opening stealth level and a turret shooting level.The storytelling in the game is a joke.  The game does feature clips and scenes from all the matrix movies (and the animatrix as well), but the editing is in a fast cut/music video style, which just doesn't work.  I was able to figure out what was going on, but the storytelling in the game is very sloppy and doesn't work.  Seeing all the movies is necessary before you play the game.Some sections of the game are also quite short.  The burly brawl sequence lasts less then five minutes, not even enough time to beat up the Smith's you want to.The biggest issue I have with the game is with the final battle, and the ending.  Before you worry, i'm not going to reveal what they are.The final battle from Revoltuions is the game's final level, where you fight Smith on the street, in the air, in the building, and in the crater.  But after that battle is over, the game has you do one final fight that's not from the movie.  It starts out with a cutscene of the Wachowski brothers coming onscreen and explaining why they changed the ending of the game from the movie.  In the process, they tell you what the final battle is before you play it, giving away any suprise that you might have had.  This is an enormously stupid mistake that ruined the battle for me.  It's like the director of the sixth sense showing up on screen five minutes before the end of the movie and saying, \"Well, I had this in mind for the ending, but I decided to make it so that Bruce Willis was a ghost the entire time.  Enjoy the suprise ending!\".  I can't see how the wachowski brothers did this.  If you want the final confrentation to be a suprise, you don't give it away before people play it!So when you see a white screen with two chairs coming towards you, skip the scene.  Trust me, you won't miss anything.  I wish someone had told me about this.And the battle itself? Well...uhm...uh...it's really one of those things that you really hate, or that you find fairly amusing.  It feels like it could be in the movie, yet it wouldn't work.  In stort, I expected to find the battle in a superman comic book, rather then in a scene from the matrix saga.The claim, \"An all new ending\" is a lie.  The ending is just two clips from the ending of revolutions put together, lasting about fourty seconds.  Then the credits play.  And the ending that is givin to you is enormously unsatisfying.  Here, I do need to give a small spoiler, so if you want to stay completely spoiler free for the ending, look away!  ******The game doesn't tell you, show you, or even hint at what happens to Neo after the game ends.  It should be no suprise that he surivives the final battle with Smith in the game, yet the game doesn't show you what happens to him.  It's INCREDIBLY dissapointing********So in the end, your reward for all your hard work is a fizzled, half-baked ending that is a big letdown.But I don't want to paint a poor picture of PON.  When it's fun, it's really fun.  It's heads and tails about Enter the Matrix, and is every matrix fan's dream come true.  If you want to play as Neo, and if you are a big fan of the movies like I am, then you'll have a lot of fun with this game.I should also say that PON is one of those games that you should rent before you buy.  And even then, don't buy it for full price.  Wait until it sells for about twenty dollars, and you'll get a much better deal.If you really like the matrix triogy, then you'll most likely like this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2005"}

I will go back and play through 2 at some point. Graphically, this game isn't quite as good as Battlefield 3, which was the only real thing lacking in this game. The game play is awesome, the campaign is a bit longer than Battlefield 3's, the game mechanics and controls are overall pretty tight, and the sound is decently good. This review does not include a rating for online multiplayer, because I never played online. I am more of a casual, solo gamer overall, unless a couple buddies are over to play or I play Nintendo stuff with my wife. I really don't much play online. I like campaign/story modes, and usually once I beat a game I move onto the next one. However, if you're a shooter fan and enjoy campaign modes, this one is pretty legit.

{"product_name":"B00113T0VA","reviewerName":"JoeAZ92","summary":"TFU has its fair share of flaws, but it hits home where it really matters for a Star Wars game","reviewText":"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (TFU) was a long time in the making. We waited quite a while for this thing to finally land on store shelves, and now we have seen just how powerful the Force can be. The title speaks for itself; you truly haven't seen anything quite like this in Star Wars before. TFU has some flaws, but those can't stop players from enjoying the fantastic story and ultra fun gameplay that lies beneath.(Spoilers in this paragraph!) TFU has one of the greatest stories ever told in a Star Wars game. You take on the role of Darth Vader's secret apprentice, Starkiller. The beginning of the game has you following Vader's commands and accomplishing such tasks as killing Jedi and proving your abilities to your master, but after a drastic turning point in the story, you go on to form the Rebel Alliance and eventually fight against Vader and the Emperor. The story is full of deception, has a few crazy plot twists, and is also very well written. It's easily up to the standard of a Star Wars film; in fact, they should definitely get started with a movie.The story fits perfectly into the Star Wars storyline, actually it's so short (ending at 6-7 hours) that it would almost have been better off being a movie in the first place. The level design is almost reminiscent of a motion picture as well. Each level involves running through both familiar and previously unknown Star Wars planets, destroying all enemies in sight to reach the end of a level, and concluding with an epic battle against a Jedi or oversized enemy. The levels are long but few; again one of the game's flaws is just how short it is. The level design also gets repetitious as you visit several places more than once and even within each visit it feels like areas are reused, leaving you to ask yourself, \"Didn't I just see this room 5 minutes ago?\" There are also heaps of glitches and limitations; invisible walls restrain you from going to many areas that look like they're wide open for exploration. In reality, though, you have to stick to the path the level lays out for you, with very little freedom to wander around. Also taking into account that you can't revisit a planet whenever you like and you have a game following a very linear pattern, similar to a movie. It's the exact same thing every time you go back through it.The gameplay, however, is fun enough to make up for the limitations the level design creates. TFU is essentially an action game, and in this sense there are few limitations. When you approach an enemy, you have tons of options as to how to kill it. You could always just run up and slash it to bits with your lightsaber, but what's the fun in that? Why not pick him up and slam him to the ground, throw him at something, choke him, throw him off a cliff, throw other objects at him, push him away, or let go and pound some lightning through him? There's an astounding variety of fighting techniques and abilities at your disposal, and it's a blast to use as many as you can recall. The upgrade system is great too, and makes you able to create even more destruction and dispose of enemies with even less effort.The lack of effort, though, also makes the game very easy. The first time you play through you may die a few times, but when you die you go right back to the last checkpoint with all damage you've done to enemies still in place. Actually, it's impossible to lose, so anyone looking for some kind of challenge won't find it here: TFU is a really easy game. The gameplay is fun enough to keep you entertained, though, despite the lack of difficulty.TFU for Wii has fun but slightly flawed controls to keep you immersed in the action. Yes, it is indeed a waggle-fest with the remote as Starkiller's lightsaber, but it's hard to realize what you yourself are doing when the action on screen is just so cool. The only problem with lighsaber combat is blocking; it took me until halfway through my second playthrough to figure out how it works (the game doesn't explain the motion very well). The Force abilities are pretty under control aside from a couple nunchuk issues: Force choke (which is done by picking up an enemy and holding the nunchuk upside-down) doesn't really work unless you have a few seconds to spare to get the position right, and hurling an enemy to the ground also requires a pretty significant movement of the controller. Other than that, though, the controls enhance the game's enjoyment factor considerably by putting you closer to the action than if you were just pressing buttons.The combat is really what makes TFU so much fun to play, and there's only a couple other gameplay mechanics besides. There are plenty of lightsaber duels and epic battles against foes much bigger than you, and those can be quite impressive. Some situations (such as lightsaber clashes) throw you into a short minigame of matching the angle of the remote or nunchuk to what is shown on screen, then flinging the controller forward. It works pretty nicely and it's kind of fun to do; it's actually a cool way to do a little damage to the enemy. These boss battles are pretty epic, and the finishing moves are really awesome as well. Unfortunately you have to concentrate so much on which controller to wave that it's hard to pay attention to the action during those epic sequences.Even seen TFU on an Xbox or PS3? It looks pretty stunning, doesn't it? Do you think there was any effort put into the Wii version's graphics at all, then? If you said yes... well, let's just say you're wrong. TFU on Wii has pretty mediocre graphics. Nothing looks very sharp (except Force Lightning), there are plenty of level design glitches that have become Nintendo trademarks (in my mind at least), and it just doesn't look too lively. Objects you can't throw or push stay put and don't even sway in the wind, a feature that would be very welcome especially on the overgrown planet of Felucia. The lack of visual quality also hurts the action and cutscenes as it makes everything look more fake than it should. All in all TFU should (and could) have better graphics; they just look like a lazy effort.What TFU lacks in graphics it makes up for in sound quality. Like just about all of the other Star Wars games out there, every sound effect from swinging a lightsaber to using the Force is pretty sharp and clear. The sound really helps the game as a whole, with explosions and such having a lot of power to them and creating a better atmosphere than the graphics alone could make. Also adding to the Star Wars atmosphere is the fantastic music. I mean, would we expect any less from John Williams' Star Wars score? The only flaw in the sound I would say is in the voice acting. It's definitely not cheesy or anything, but very frequently you encounter lines that are well written but could have been much better said.There is also a multiplayer mode in TFU, but it's very glitchy and confusing. Half the time things are happening and neither you or your opponent know what's going on, and all the game mechanics that work well in the single player mode don't seem to function correctly. For example, those minigames of lining up the nunchuk and swinging it I mentioned earlier don't work at all, and when you win those duels you have no idea why. One good thing about it is that there are tons of characters to choose from, and all of them are unlocked by the end of the story. The multiplayer mode was definitely a glitchy afterthought, although it can be somewhat enjoyable to play with your extraordinary Force powers against a human opponent.Yes, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed has its fair share of flaws. The graphics aren't so sharp, it's a short and easy game, and there are lots of sad limitations, but do those things totally take away from the fantastic, well-written story, booming sound and music, and ultra fun gameplay? Absolutely not. TFU is certainly not perfect, but it hits home where it matters for a Star Wars game, and that's what makes it great.Positive:+ fantastic story+ very well written dialogue+ destroying everything in sight is a blast+ tons of abilities to unlock and enhance+ controls are fun despite a few flaws+ sharp sound effects and awesome musicNegative:- very short and easy- lots of limitations on exploration- graphics could be much better- voice acting isn't quite on par with the writing- controls have a couple issues","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2009"}

The series spawned several sequels and whatnot. Now, after it debut on the PS1, Symphony of the Night, CastleVania finally comes to PS2. Some people might say it looks like a Devil May Cry clone. Now, I'm a huge fan of the Devil May Cry series and CastleVania. The graphics are pretty darn good, the soundtrack's great, and the controls are tight. In fact I find very little problems but these: one is that the voice acting is very much like Resident Evil, cheesy, but funny at the same time. The dialoge leaves much to be desired. Also, the real-time menu is not too bad(it's only annoying during boss fights and anytime you're low on health.) Several things make this better than DMC in several aspects. One is the blocking, something that DMC lacks. If you time it just right, not only will your enemies fall back, you regain lost magic and protects you from most damge. Second, the healing factor. On DMC, you had to either sacrifice your S rank for a Vital Star or kill enemies to gain Green Orbs. While on CastleVania, you can only get health from Potions, meats and saving points. Actually that's a little worse than DMC, but not by much. Last, this game has a ton of monsters and several bosses plus hidden ones to satisfy your slaying. one more annoyance: Leon. While there have been several other bad characters(Raiden from MGS2 fame springs to mind), why did the developers decide to make him look like a teenage girl?! All these game developers are churning out these stupid pretty-boy designs. This travesty has to be stopped or the pretty boys will enslave the earth. Uh... sorry for that rambling people. Anyway the differance between Devil may Cry and Castlevania is that Dante is a half-human (...)and Leon is... well... maybe this should explain. (Turns on cd player) DUDE LOOKS LIKE A LADY!

The makers of the series did a smart thing with COD 4 Modern Warfare,the game brought new technology, scenarios and situations to the genre, and it was excellent fun, a good rest from the back to back world war II shooters that had been beaten to death.Now with world at war, they again resort to the same old formula, and one that only took them a year to launch after COD 4 was released, probably meaning so much of it is a rehash of what they've done a million times before, that it didn't even take them much of an effort to make.Aside from the gameplay, story and situations being just extremely boring and old, there ain't much to look at graphics wise, they basically used the same engine from COD 4, which is not a bad engine, but it's over a year old and doesn't bring anything amazing to the table.My advice?, if you played one or two of these call of duty games before, you'll be getting nothing new with this one, certainly not worth the 60 dollar price. For that kind of dough some sort of innovation is needed, not revamps of 10 year old games.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2009"}

As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive.

It has great graphics, fun combat, and great boss battles. So I'm going to skip right to the point. Batman Arkham City is a great game! It is just not enough of a sequel to merit 5 stars. Batman Arkham City is basically Arkham Asylum in a sand box setting. It is a great idea but it did not maintain the impact that Arkham Asylum had. The objectives just didn't connect well together for a complete goal. I felt I was wondering from one objective to the next without a real sense of purpose. Everything I did felt like a gimmick to connect me to the next supervillain fight. Also, you start with most of your gadgets from the beginning of the game. Normally this would be a good feature but you do not get many new gadgets throughout the game. There isn't a slow build up of feeling increasingly more powerful. The length is also an issue. I was expecting a lengthy campaign since it was touted in pretty much every review I read but I finished all of the side missions I could find (minus the riddler trophies) and the main story in around the same time as I finished Arkham Asylum. YOU CAN RENT THIS GAME AND COMPLETE ALMOST EVERYTHING IT HAS TO OFFER unless you want to count the New Game+ feature. I was expecting a more lengthy campaign overall or a massive amount of more side missions to keep the game going.

While it is pretty dated, it is a value at less than ten dollars. You can play as the Russians in the battle for Stalingrad, the British from the battle for El Alamein through North Africa and a little around Caen, and the Americans on D-Day at Pointe du Hoc and the Hurtgen Forest. The Pointe du Hoc scenes were especially interesting to me because I actually visited the site on a trip to Normandy. I can say that while the location is not exactly the same as the real battlefield, it was a good representation allowing some flexibility to make the game more entertaining. If you ever find yourself in the area, I would recommend checking out the Ranger Museum in Grancamp-Maisy as well as the actual battlefield site.COD2 has pretty much same controls as the originalCall of Duty(COD1).  The graphics and sound effects were better than any of the other WWII games. You can pick up any weapon in the game. There are lots of options with  weapons from each side. In single player as the British, you can control a tank. In another mission with the British, you get to man the main gun of an armored personnel carrier.  This game is highly scripted, though less than COD1. There is usually only one avenue to complete missions. Alternate approaches are blocked off with debris or road blocks. There are some missions that have multiple objectives at the same time, and you can choose to assault them in the order you like. I enjoyed the campaign despite the restrictions on movement. Difficulty is variable. I found it challenging, but fun at \"hardened\" difficulty. The length of the single player campaign was reasonably long, not as short as COD1.Multiplayer is still alive and well with lots of community content. The setup is pretty neat. If you select a server that has modified maps or content, it can be set to be automatically downloaded. However, multiplayer is limited to infantry action. If you like combined arms (infantry, armor, naval, and air combat), I would recommend the Battlefield series instead. COD2 has superior graphics to the Battlefield series though.Couple of changes in COD2 versus the original:-There are smoke grenades which makes assaulting positions fun. Now if only your AI teammates would combine in your assault and not just wait until you move up to a certain point on the map.-sniper holding their breath to improve accuracy on long shots-Health is handled differently than most other games. No health bar. Basically when you are hit you start seeing red and start losing control of your soldier. If you can get away your health returns automatically. The weakness when you get hit gives an authentic feel to the game; however, the automatic healing while it keeps the game moving detracts from immersion.Technical Note: The game played great on Windows 7 (Intel  i 7, 12 GB RAM, 2GB Nvidia Video Card) for me. When I was installing the game I got a message saying the game had known compatibility issues with Windows 7; however, I just ran the setup from the disk and applied the 1.03 patch. No issues running the game at highest settings.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2013"}

Playing along with the original songs and not covers is worth the price of admission alone, and AT LAST we get a freestyle session/music studio.  You can jump right in after the tutorials with the music studio, but the GHMIX and its capablities look to take a bit more practice, both provide serious ability to improvise and try to make your own covers/originals and the open mic freestyle ability allows for vocals but w/out recording capabilities,(unless you output to your own recording device.)  Being able to record keyboard melodies for in game play makes up for this.  The NEW Beginner mode is great for kids as it offers a rhythm only track  (with no notes to hit), I played it through a few songs and it is actually kind of fun, and my son loves it and all the different keyboard sounds in the studio as well.  The guitar can wobble(not side to side like GHIIIS but up and down) however the old folded piece of paper trick works great and stabilizes it completely.  Also the 3 to 6 song career playlists offer no break unless you fail or pause and quit, so you tend to play through the whole set, which can lead to repetitive motion injury (like I am feeling now, after about 20+ hours with this game.)  I can find little to fault as everything works as promised, even the touch pad which takes a bit of practice starts feeling like second nature over time.

I'm playing on a HD television and I swear it's hard to distinguish who's who. My last favorite CoD was Black Ops 1. MW3, Black Ops 2 and now this one is a disappointment.

It last about 20 mins per day/ 4 days per week. It is very good workout... includes warm up, stretches and cool down (I never do these in a gym). It has shown some new exercises which I would have never learned on my own in a gym. It works almost every muscle in my body with different exercises. Over all workout program is amazing.Watching you heart rate is also awesome. Keeping track of how hard you are working is awesome.Tracking my movements seems flawless to me.A few negatives... not big ones... putting on sensors can be a little annoying. I mean if I am looking for a quick workout... it is much easier to grab move controller and play Fight/or dance game then putting on 3 different sensors.Program at medium difficulty doesn't seems to push me too much. I will try hard setting soon but for now after finishing the daily workout with this game, I play fight/or dance game for another 20 or 30 minutes.My recommendation is to get this game, Fight: Lights Out (This will work your shoulders like hell) and Everybody Dance. Between these 3 games not only you will have so many different way to workout but you will really enjoy and have fun. I am always looking forward to go home and workout/ play video games now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2012"}

Even though Alucard uses a sword instead of the traditional whip, the game seems 100% worthy of the Castlevania title (Don't worry though, if you prefer the whip style of play, you can play through the entire game with Richter once you have completed certain tasks). The gameplay is tight and refined, the graphics are wonderful, there's tons of items and rooms to find, and the music fits each section of the game perfectly.  The 2 castles to explore are massive, but a teleportation system keeps you from having to back track the whole way by foot to get to a desired area. Every feature in this game was obviously paid close attention to by Konami. Fans of the Castlevania series will not be let down.  This is a true classic that every Playstation owner should have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2001"}

Final Fantasy Chronicles features two games: Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger.  When it was released on the SNES, Final Fantasy IV was known as Final Fantasy II (it was the 4th game over all, but only the second released in the United States).  In America, FFIV was the first of the series to have distinguishable characters with personality as well as having a real storyline to follow.  Chrono Trigger is arguably the best RPG ever, and is without question one of the best on the SNES.  In my mind, Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI are pretty much tied for my favorite RPG of all time.  This is the first time either game has been available on the Playstation.Final Fantasy IV:This has long been a favorite of mine.  It had a story that is still one of my favorites with characters that I feel are more memorable that most of the Playstation era Final Fantasies.  This is the Final Fantasy that I grew up with.  Spells are learned as you increase in levels, characters move in and out of your party as the story progresses.  The game has one of the great villains in Golbez.  Kain and Rydia are still two of my favorite characters.  While the game is easy, it is has been made more difficult in this PSX port.  You play as Cecil, a Dark Knight as he rebels against the King of Baron in a quest to save the Crystals of the world from Golbez.  This has a large cast of characters who will fight with you (and against you) and is simply a fun game to play.  Yes, the graphics are early SNES era, but this is an old game.  It remains a fun game.Chrono Trigger:As I said above, I view this as one of the all time great games.  The story, involving time travel and its effects, is one of the best and is fairly complex with each action changing the history of the world but then opening up new questions and conflict.  Chrono Trigger featured 16 different endings (more than 10 for sure) depending on when you decide to beat the game.  After completing the game once you can restart with \"New Game +) and begin the game with all the experience levels and stats that you had when you completed the game.  You also begin with most of the weapons and armor (the only things you lose are those weapons that are important to the story, like the Masamune).  Chrono Trigger has a distinct and memorable cast of characters and this is a game begging to be played.  As with all of the PSX ports, the game is more enjoyable if played on the original system so that you don't have to deal with loading times, but the game is also much more expensive to buy for the SNES.  This is definitely worth your money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2003"}

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"JakFrost \"thegreatui\"","summary":"One of the best RPG's every made","reviewText":"At first Kingdom Hearts didn't have me interested but after hearing everyone talk about how great it was I decided to give it a shot.

I remember playing it for the first time about 12 or 13 years ago (yeah that IS a very long time), and I thought it was just the greatest thing ever. The graphics were supurb and even to this day they look beautiful. Though they don't stand up to ps2 graphics...it really doesn't matter with these old-skool games. I'm not a graphics kind of guy and never was, so it doesn't affect me, but if you are really into high tech graphics and haven't played this, i doubt you will like it. Don't get me wrong, some games with more high tech graphics are good, but this game (along with many others on SNES) proove that graphics don't make any game. But then again I don't play or own a playstation 2, so that's just how I see it. My views on videogames are rather conservative. If you are still under 16 and haven't played this game I doubt you will like it though, as it doesn't appeal to younger payers any more due to it's old school design that kids tend not to appreciate these days. But that doesn't mean kids won't like it. I just think people who have played it in the early 90s are mainly the ones who will enjoy it nowdays, unless you're a Zelda fanatic but haven't played this one yet, or if you like older games but haven't gotten around to getting this one yet. The music on this game is also very good, although the dungeon music can get very tedius and annoying, it's not that bad. The world music is classic, though and after you play it enough it will be ringing in your ears. Gameplay also doesn't get much better, you get a whole arsenal of items. Much more than any other Zelda yet. This game is basically the game that set the standards for all other adventure games, sometimes even RPGs. Another thing you might like about this game is that it is not way too time consuming, if you have a life to attend to you can do so while keeping up with the game as well. Even though I like really long games, this game is short in a good way. But the first time you play it , it will probably take more than 10 hours to beat, at least. If you get all the heart containers it will take even more. There isn't a lot of text in this game either, there's talking sequences but they usually end pretty quick...All in all this game is classic, and if you haven't played it-that's your mistake. Playing this game and hearing it's music after years really brings back those great childhood memories. Even to this day this game looks better to me than most new games. It just has that aura. I highly recommend this to any one into adventure games or RPGs that has a taste for the classics, or anyone who likes SNES or NES games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2003"}

It's the first PSP that will not look like that you have a tumor in your pants. Not quite as small as most smart phones today.- All digital baby, no more need to lug around UMDs. 16 GIG built in memory is more than enough to store more than 10 games at a time. 14/16 GIGS is actually usable on the thing.- New USB HIGH SPEED connection, copying files has never been this fast on the older, now bulkier PSP models.- Smaller 3.8 inch screen but still same 480 by 272 resolution means far more sharper, more vivid images.- I actually like the new control scheme, the buttons have the same feel as the ones found on the GBA SP (another great shrink machine).- As a huge supporter of digital distribution, Sony continues to release all new PSP games in digital form as well as re-release PSP classics in digital form.- No more UMD means the end of long ass load times that were a huge hindrance on PSPs 1000-3000. Face it, even UMD caching on the slim models we're useless.- New Bluetooth support which enables the use of the PS3 SIXAXIS or DUAL SHOCK 3 controller on actual PSP gameplay.- The built in non-removable battery has currently has made the PSP Go at this point, un-hackable.

You people steal games, don't give me that crap that custom firmware allows you to use more app functions on the PSP. You all do it TO STEAL GAMES AND DOWNLOAD THEM ILLEGALLY!What's not hot:- There's probably gonna be that one or two or three or more games that will probably never get a digital re-release. Making them forever unplayable on the PSP Go.- If you can get a discount, the price point is expensive. I got mines at sonystyle and I got a 30 dollar discount on this baby.- While some found them a flaw, the new proprietary slot makes the PSP Go incompatible with older PSP accessories such as the component A/V cables.- The removable of the Memory Stick Duo in favor of the M2 Memory Stick is quite questionable. No worries, I can buy a cheap 8GIG extra expansion for less than 30 bucks here at amazon.Overall, I love digital distribution and so should you. Buying games used does not benefit the people who worked so hard to make them and I never buy used games unless the game is no longer in print or is a rare BEMANI import from Japan. With digital distribution, games such as hard copy Final Fantasy VII or the CRAP PS2 port of Marvel VS. Capcom 2 can no longer cost an arm and a leg. It makes games an easy grasp. The PSP Go is just that, it's library of games will always be within your play time. Although the older PSPs can do all digital just fine, it's size is handsome enough to make it worth the upgrade. I will keep my PSP 2000, but the Go is simply much cooler. I hate UMDs.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYEYK","description":"","reviewerName":"Core","summary":"Shouldn't things be better by now?","reviewText":"First of all, I want to say that this is just \"MY\" perspective. Don't read this and get your feelings hurt.I have been a fan of this series since Halo. It's what prompted me to buy my first Xbox. So without further adieu let's get this started in bullet point format.Con:*Weapons are weak, Armor is weak, etcElaboration: 343 Like Bungie studios seem to have an erection for \"balance\". But, like the hypocrites they are, that balance goes out the window on Legendary Solo campaign where the enimes can repeatedly \"Show you who's boss\" with their \"OP'ed\" weapons.If easy and normal, and heroic are going to be a breeze, no matter what, Legendary, should be the starting ground for the weapon builds. Not the other way around.Rather than focus on making an awesome game truly based on skill, IE aiming ability, it's all more a test of patience you have as a gamer. *duck behind a wall and pray your slow tech shields charge back up fast enough. Pop out, shoot with your weapons that do nothing, die, curse, start again, die.. pop out and shoot.. finally manage to kill one of the eight enemies, who are all elites with super shields. Yay! rinses wash and repeatedly get owned by the AI with god aim and abilities.For a game where they can build a mile long space ship out in the coldest reaches of space, yet they can't improve basic firearms, or your armor? shouldn't all that metal actually do something!?*You know that \"Cake is a lie\" thing? your constantly shown the spartans are awesome in videos, but in actual gameplay  you play a  big ol weak character.-Shields go down at the drop of a pin-Your killed cheaply and repeatedly-auto aim you cannot disable.. (this has been a complaint since its existed) so an enemy goes running in front of you while your trying to shoot another enemy, it freaking pulls your aim off! Every dang time!*The studio thought it would be a good idea that on the station if you throw a grenade and it accidentally kills a scientist, that it kills you automatically..  even though, well you know what happens if you've played the game.*The Armor abilities are lacking-Jet pack for instance...  its like a broken pair of wings your handed, it was bad in Halo Reach, but they made it worse in this game.*Weapons are forced onto you, like a weapon in game, want to use it constantly? Well 343 says screw you! you don't get to keep the gun you like, your gonna use the guns we want you to whether you like it or not. This should have changed by now. Its a garbage set up.*343 Keeps referring to their game as a sandbox, I think that's limiting in scope. Not something really negative gameplay wise or story.. it's just a bad mentality to have for your game.*Enemy is just ungodly. I  Already touched on this, but its crazy in legendary.*You have to complete dorky challenges/level requirements to get new looking armor in Halo4. They had it right in Halo Reach. You fight, you earn credits, you buy your armor. The thing about it was! That the amount of credits you had to earn for the armors, was ridiculously high!They had it right with more armors for customization. The thing that 343 ultimately forgot about.. is multiplayer is about multiplaying.. not freaking buying armors. So another words.. if you play a decent amount of time.. you should be able to earn all the armors. Then from their, you can get your online look that you want.. and focus on gaming and having fun. I made it up to a pretty high rank from just playing a lot.. but I still could never manage to get all the armors. The amount of credits you earned, or the cost, either way you want to look at it, was ridiculously low/high in Reach. Anyways, the armors in freaking Halo 4 are even harder to get. (don't comment to me if your some god of Halo4. I don't care if you managed to get all the armors, I really don't.. ) Its very frustrating.*In multiplayer, your forced to wear red or blue.. That's so freaking ridiculous! IT should be all about way points over the characters heads so you got your own look. But your forced into that.Now the pro's!+Pelican flight was done extremely well, I never felt like I was fighting to get the gameplay I wanted.So they did an awesome awesome job here!+Great great! sounding game. From the guns, to the warthog, and everything in between, the audio was top notch.(I played with a headset on)+Beautiful game, graphically.. everything is just so shiny and pretty. A lot of love is their.+Customizable armors, if you can get them, they have a ton and its wonderful. You can really get a personalized spartan image.+Gameplay is very well done in multiplayer. I feel that the weapons, even though weak, hit more when their supposed to, a lot more consistency. SO maybe they've improved their \"net code\" or whatever.The game really hasn't grown with story material or characters.. you don't learn much about Master chief or anything. I was really left with the same feeling when I beat this game, as I was when I played Halo 2 and finished it. That shallow feeling, like they were holding a lot back, and saving it for the next game.Anyways, if your a fan of the series, go ahead and buy it. It's dropped in price.I would suggest just get the regular version though. I regretted buying the LE edition.I probably will not be buying the next Halo 5 game. Mainly because the improvements in the game, that should be, are not their. The matureness that should be, is not their. Plus, the story.. it just doesn't make any sense, dealing with a certain plot point.Mass Effect 3, is a different kind of game, but the story.. is freaking well done, right up until the 3rd game.. They just screw it all to heck at that point. But the Halo series, doesn't even have that kind of story.. it needs so much work, or more from the books needs to be put into the games.. to get that correct \"feel\"..Overall the series has been a good ride, but their were problems with the first game, issues that needed to be improved. And well, its been a hit and mix bag over all..  and they still continue on into Halo4.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2013"}

{"product_name":"B003Q53VZC","description":"","reviewerName":"Alexander Ayers","summary":"A great idea that needed more time...","reviewText":"There was a tremendous amount of hype leading up to the release of Homefront (THQ, Kaos Studios).  Since it first was mentioned, many were wondering, possibly even hoping that it could be a Call of Duty killer.  Not since 1984, with the film Red Dawn had there been so much yearning to kick some foreign butts on our home soil.  Surely not by coincidence, John Milius, writer and director of Red Dawn, also worked quite closely on Homefront.If you totally missed the media blitz surrounding Homefront, it takes place in the not too distant future, 2027.  Due to quite a few calamitous circumstances, North and South Korea have united and basically invaded and started occupying the United States.  Well that doesn't sit too well, with some of the people, so they form a grass roots kind of rebellious group, called of all things ..... the Resistance.Beginning in Montrose, Colorade, you play as Jacobs, a former Marine pilot, the strong, silent type,  (who was obviously a former stuntman, given the amount of falling he does) along with your prototypical teammates:Connor, the foul-mouthed, agitated, gung-ho, brash, leader wannabe.Boone, the African-American representative, who is the brains behind the Resistance in MontroseRianna, the token tough-chick, who knows how to handle a weapon, andHopper, the Korean-American, tech-savvy member.Now there is really not any backstory for the main characters, which is what I was craving.  Why is Jacobs so sought after he's worth a daring rescue?  What made Connor so angry?  How is Hopper dealing with this invasion, being of Korean lineage?  None of which were really answered through the story gameplay, which is a shame.  Now that the price has dropped $20 (or more), does it deserve a look?GameplayBeginning with a cutscene that looks and feel like actual news footage (some of which is), you're kind of thrown into the action.  No shooting or anything, but you're pulled from your home, and placed on a bus, on your way to a detention center.  The scene, for me, was reminiscent of the beginning of Half-Life 2, which was a good thing.  Eerie, bleak, and caught my attention.  There are a few instances where the developers push the envelope and it earns its M rating.  Instead of shooting your way out, it set the tone, and made the occupation feel more real and the experience a bit more intense.  While the Call of Duty games are very cinematic, the single-player game still feels like it's missing something, like an atmosphere that feels dangerous.  There's lots of running and gunning but I don't feel all that invested in the story (sorry \"Soap\").  If I die, I know I can always restart.  Homefront gave me a different feeling.That's not to say that Homefront doesn't feel predictable at times, but there are a variety of missions to undertake.  Jacobs is a pretty well-rounded soldier and is called on to do the obligatory gunning down, but also defends areas, snipes, sneaks, flies copters, and remote controls tanks.  While a few of the protagonists have military training, Homefront gives you the sense that most of the Resistance are made up of regular men and women, possibly picking up guns for the first time.Once the action starts, it seems like North Korea transported their whole population over here.  Enemies will respawn infinitely until you reach a certain checkpoint.  It was early on in the game, and I was playing at the hardest difficulty level,  and I wanted to pick off all of the troops in order to move safely.  However, after about 15-20 minutes, I figured something was amiss.  I decided to run up ahead a bit, and  the troops stopped coming from the area there were spawning from.  Interesting.  Also, hit detection can be quite capricious at times.  I was sure I was making contact, but to no avail, they kept firing at me.  I also was able to fire through my teammates to hit enemies, at times.  Ammo, at least on Hard mode, was not plentiful, and you really had to conserve, to be prepared for the enemy onslaughts.The gameplay itself is quite linear.  Invisible walls really put a downer on many missions.  The setting sometimes look expansive, but you can only traverse through a small corridor, or go so far until your teammates catch up.  My team was running through some suburban backyards, and I wanted to run through a swing set, but wasn't allowed.  From a game that wanted to be, and occasionally feels, epic, this was a huge step back.  I wasn't looking for a total sandbox experience, but I wanted to be creative in the setting.  As for collectibles, there are newspapers scattered throughout which broaden the scope of the story.  The trouble was that when in the midst of battle, I didn't really want to stop to read a newspaper, but there is no other way to access them.  Of course I didn't realize this until pretty late in the game.  Seems like a waste, considering a lot of time was put into the articles, they should be available to read in an extras section of the menu.The campaign is pretty short, and the pacing is off at times, but luckily there is online multiplayer, which can support up to 32 players.  While there are only two modes (the obligatory Team Deathmatch, and Ground Control, basically CoD's Domination), online multiplayer really saves Homefront from being a total disaster, and tries to shake things up a bit in the process.  During matches, you earn Battle Points, which are then to be used in-game, for upgrades and purchases for yourself, or to help out the team.  No more waiting until the match ends, you earned them, use them when you want.  They can be used for some pretty cool things, too.  From controlling ground and air drones which can mark players, to different bomb strikes and driving large vehicles like Humvees, along with tanks and helicopters.  As a side note, I will say that I played for a couple of hours straight, and did not get disconnected from a match once, which is something that is rare for CoD.  The online multiplayer is actually fun, and does not feel just tacked on.Graphics:  The graphics in Homefront are not exceptional, but get the job done nicely.  The  environments are especially well done, as you get the sense that since the invasion, things have really gone to hell.  The NPCs have this strange quality, where it looks as if they were cut out and placed in the locales, as they have a kind of outline around them which was distracting at times.  There are also instances where your teammates will get stuck in doorways or once I witnessed a Korean soldier doing the \"Running Man\" on a rooftop.  There is quite a bit of product placement in Homefront, which I actually didn't mind, as I thought it gave more of a realistic feel to the setting, even though some of the choices were interesting.Replay Value:  After the campaign is completed, there really isn't much reason to revisit it, unless you're a trophy or achievement hunter.  The online multiplayer while fun (there are a couple of DLC packs), with only two game modes, does not have the diversity that today's players crave, although I could still play with full teams.Score: 7.25There are memorable, as well as shocking moments in Homefront, but the brevity of the campaign is a big distraction.  Even if they had only doubled the length of the campaign, I wouldn't have been as critical.  Just when you start getting into it, the campaign ends.  This makes Homefront feel rushed and incomplete.  I definitely would have felt ripped off, when this game was $60.  While it will probably spawn a sequel, without fixing some of it's downfalls, it will have a difficult time competing with the Modern Warfare or Battlefield games coming out shortly.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2011"}

If you earned all the trophies on the PS3 version, you'll need to earn them again on the PS4 version.-Improved game resolution, 1080p. Also improved hair-dirt-skin-water effects. Over-all I didn't notice a huge difference as the original PS3 game looked amazing.-It is the same game, nothing new, nothing missing in relation to the PS3 version. The DLC from the PS3 version is automatically included in this PS4 version, so you get to switch outfits throughout the game and so on. Nothing special.-This PS4 version utilizes the PS4 controller. The touch pad is used as an additional button and some close notices in the game will now also come from the controller speaker. The light bar changes colors depending on what you are doing. Holding a torch it will blink red and yellow as well as other neat little touches throughout the game, however I see the light as a distraction and the speaker on the controller with this game doesn't always 100% match up with the audio coming from the speakers, resulting in me turning the controller speaker off from the game menu.Over-all a wonderful game and I had no issues double dipping at the release date cost of 60US. I played through it a few times on the PS3 to get most of the trophies, and I intend to do the same on the PS4.Hopefully Tomb Raider will start a chain of PS3 games to be released on the PS4.

{"product_name":"B0050SY9WC","description":"","reviewerName":"Nishi","summary":"Awesome game with challenging co-op that has NO ONLINE PASS","reviewText":"After playing the demo I was really looking forward to this game since it was so much fun to play, and I'm pleased to say it did meet my expectations. This game has a really cool single player campaign with a really challenging co-op campaign.In the Extras menu they added a manual to tell you all about the game, so even if you rented it/bought it used you can check that out. I like that they added this due to the fact EA seems to hate physical manuals these days. Also if you are part of the EA Gun Club you get some challenge unlocks along with a Bloody skin for the Kusanagi.Story:The Single player campaign has you playing as Agent Kilo working for EuroCorp and the battle against the enemies that love to steal the products they create. You don't get to know many characters through the campaign but the few that you do talk to and learn about are really cool and unique individuals. They did a good job with the voice acting and I didn't really notice any annoying voices throughout the game. The story is really fun rollercoaster that comes to a solid conclusion at the end.In the Co-op missions I believe you are working for your own created syndicate since the missions have you fighting all sorts of different corporations that you are stealing information from. I will go more into Syndicates in the gameplay section. Before each missions you are provided with a paragraph on what you are doing and why you are in that location. Most of the descriptions are pretty amusing and made me laugh a few times.Gameplay:This is another first person shooter that has a really awesome combat system. Regardless if you are in singleplayer or Co-op you rely on your implanted brain chip along with weapons you come across. Majority of the weapons in the game have an alternative firing mode that can range from having a grenade launcher to having both a red dot sight and an ACOG Scope on at once.When it comes to your brain chip you have a system that is called DART that allows you to see enemies and friendlies through walls and makes killing them a lot easier. In both single and Co-op you can get upgrades for your implants that range from dealing out 25% more damage in DART to improving your health regeneration. Majority of the enemies in the game can be executed in a multitude of ways(One way has you kicking them below the belt and punching them in the face).In singleplayer your DART also slows down time and with the right perks you can set it up to heal 7% of your health per second. The singleplayer campaign is pretty short, even on hard. I did have a ton of fun playing it and really enjoyed the story though. Some of the locations are really cool to visit and kill all the enemies in. I did find myself looking forward to what was going to happen next. You can also find a lot of side items in the game that expand upon the story with little tidbits of information.In the Co-op campaign you are tackling over 10 missions with up to four people that are manageable on normal mode, but really require good teamwork in the Expert difficulty. As I said before, I think they set it up so that you're working for your own Syndicate.  Syndicates in multiplayer are guild like organizations that can be created and everyone works towards goals (everyone's play time is over 7 days of hours, X amount of kills) and leaderboard standings.When upgrading your Agent you most of the talents you have in the singleplayer game, but harder to unlock (can't just pick the bottom talent, you need to work towards there). You also upgrade a bunch of weapons that end up making them more powerful, or unlocking their secondary fire mode. Two abilities can be used at once (Only one until you get the talent) that ranges from a Protective shield to reviving yourself once when you go down. This really adds replayability to the game, and will make the Expert modes more manageable, even if it's just a small percentage of stats.Every co-op mission has a surveillance report that shows you a computerized 3D map that shows you the objectives you need to complete and where you start. I think this is pretty awesome, and makes you feel like you're on an actual mission. Just like the singleplayer game had collectibles, the co-op mode has challenges for you to complete that are pretty different from each other (Kill X amount of employee's to disarming X amount of grenades)Soundtrack:The Techno music they added to this game just fit so perfectly. It adds that sense of a futuristically feeling world. A ton of famous (IMO) techno artists add to this sound track, including Skrillex, Nero and Digitalism. When I fought the first boss fight and the main theme starts playing it made me pumped up and ready to kick some butt.Some of the specialty guns sound so cool when you fire them and you could tell they didn't just use a stock sound for the weapons. I think it's a really good job when companies do this successfully because it adds so much more to the immersion of the game.Graphics:The graphics and look of this game scream a blade runner/Deus Ex esc world. Some people have complained about how the light bloom in this game gets annoying, but I think it really fits in the game. I mean if you try to stare into a light in real life it's going to be bright. The guns look really awesome and when you fire some of the specialty weapons the animations of the bullets look just amazing.When you go into the DART overlay you see a computerized view of the world and the enemies appear yellow and when you kill them the blood is white. This is a nice addition to the game where they could have just been lazy and just made the people stand out in the normal looking world. The people look really cool, and you can see the expressions they make.When you kill enemies sometimes their heads explode or they get cut straight in half. This adds a sense that some of the weapons you use are really powerful tools of destruction. The executions look just as amazing as I previously stated, and really make you feel like a total Bad***.Verdict:I had a blast playing through the single player campaign, even if it was short. It's so worth a rental if you're just interested in story based games, and not Co-op. If you're planning on playing co-op with friends or wanting to unlock a bunch of stuff this is a definite buy. It's so much fun completing missions as your supped up Agent, even if it's your 10th or higher time through a mission. Even after completing this review I am planning on continue playing the co-op on this game for at least a month, and that makes it worth the sticker price.Also even though this is an EA game there is no Online Pass, Locked content, or on the disc crap. Starbreeze actually specifically asked EA to not put an Online Pass in the game. This makes me really respect the company and its worth supporting games like this that don't want to be part of the BS that mainstream games are being torn apart for.Positives:* Fun combat that requires strategy in co-op missions* Tons to unlock, find, complete and advance* Well made story that had me wanting more, but also had a great conclusion* Soundtrack that fit the game really well* Fantastic graphics that shine through DART and enemy dismemberment* NO ONLINE PASSNegatives:* Hard is really easy until you get to the final boss, which can be cheap if you're not ready (singleplayer)* Co-op menu seemed to crash a few times, but a patch is going to fix thisAchievements: The achievements in this game are actually pretty fun to complete. They range from killing the bosses without using some abilities, unlocking everything and beating the game on hardest difficulty. Both the Single and Co-op Campaigns have achievements, and I think it's a fun game to attempt 100%.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2012"}

It's almost understandable; after all, the only substantial PS2-exclusive first person shooter was the fairly primitive Red Faction, and Red Faction 2 ended up being so viciously bland and mediocre that the series has been on hiatus since 2002.  That pretty much left multiplatform games such as Turok: Evolution, Medal of Honor: Frontline, and Timesplitters 2 as the only FPS options on PS2- games which saw better versions on the more powerful Xbox (which also had a controller more suited for FPS games).  With no real answer to Microsoft's Halo, Killzone was billed by many as Sony's answer to Halo.Make no mistake: this is no Halo killer.  It will not make you forget about Halo, Halo 2 or that girl at Starbuck's who looks kind of like Halo's Cortana.  After all, Killzone, for one, lacks the driveable vehicles that Halo is known for.  What this can best be billed as is Medal of Honor set in the future.  Essentially, your character, and up to 3 computer-controlled squadmates (depending on how far you are in the game), fight your way through the battlefields of a besieged planetary colony under assault by the vaguely Nazi-ish Helghast, a faction of slightly mutated humans from another colony planet.  It's straightforward FPS action, for sure.The bad news is that Guerilla Games apparently never hired a QA tester, as there are all sorts of bugs and technical issues which hurt the game.  The framerate is often inconsistent, and it doesn't help that sometimes pressing a button will produce literally no response.  Sometimes draw distance problems will result in faraway terrain or objects flickering in and out of existence.  The audio, while not great to start with (you'll find the voice-acting undulating between repetitiously annoying, cliched stereotype, and just plain uninspired), also suffers from bugs, whether a bit of prior dialogue being caught in an endless loop, or mysteriously disappearing sound effects.  The game, on a whole, moves oddly slow, as if mired in molasses.The good news is that, underneath the sheen of incompetence slathered on at the production and programming stages, there's actually an entertaining game.  Level design and progression manage to be one of this game's saving graces.  While the promotional angle for this game was urban combat, there's more to it than this.  The first third of the game does take place inside a besieged city, and a lot of effort went into designing credible urban environments in both indoor and outdoor flavors.  As the game progresses, you and your squad leave the city, and venture through war-torn beaches and docks, misty swamps, forests, barren badlands, enemy entrenchments, craggy hills, snow-covered mountains, and even a space station.  The game uses a number of smaller set pieces to keep the player interested, and the game, unlike some games, isn't unduly short.  The graphics are decent overall and nicely stylized, and it's obvious that the developers tried pushing the envelope of the PS2's somewhat meager capabilities to the point that the game seems like it was meant more for the Xbox. To help extend the game's lifespan for those who aren't into online gaming, Guerilla, unlike many developers, actually provided AI bots for the multiplayer games, allowing everyone to at least get a quick fix of competitive gaming in an offline, solo configuration.  The not-too futuristic weapons are also pretty entertaining, especially Rico's giant howitzer/rocket grenade combo.I also have to take my hat off to the developers for actually providing a somewhat competent squad to accompany the player.  In many respects, this game actually accomplishes what Red Faction 2 promised to gamers, but never delivered.  The biggest problems here, though, are the slip-shod manner in which the game was delivered to the public, and the competition from Xbox titles.  By releasing this game before it was obviously ready, Sony not only delivered a product that could have used a couple more months' worth of polish, but also guaranteed negative comparisons to Microsoft's much more slick Halo 2, which came out at the same time.  As whacked out as Halo 2's truncated storyline was, it was still executed more professionally than Killzone's mix of dunderhead dialogue, \"square peg in a round hole\" interpersonal relationships, and over-the-top forced drama.  As the game is now cheap, I can certainly recommend it as more or less the only Sony-exclusive FPS for the PS2 (although I have yet to try Cold Winter), and as having a nice amount of bang for the buck.  However, you have to first get past the poor presentation, which may be a deal-breaker for some.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2007"}
{"product_name":"B002I090AG","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Finkel \"Jack of Trades\"","summary":"DS Finally Receives a Major Revision","reviewText":"After enjoying the Nintendo DS line of handhelds way more than I'm comfortable admiting as an adult with a kid, I've been looking forward to the Nintendo 3DS.  The minor bump up in resolution was a disappointment when devices like the iPhone are showing off \"retinal displays,\" but the graphics are a huge step up; and, I think the new graphics capabilities of the 3DS should be the main selling point rather than the 3D effect.++Positives++In addition to a slightly better resolution and major Graphics upgrade, the 3DS sports a decent size, 3D-capable top screen (though still undersize compared to the excellent DS XL screens) and a familiar lower touch screen on par with the size of teh DS lite screen.  The LCD's are plenty bright, performing better against glare, while the new directional analog nub lends much needed versatility to the control scheme. The new Home, Select and Start buttons below the touch screen are the only part of the 3DS that feels cheap or slightly unresponsive.  In general, this handheld is built extremely well and should last years without major abuse.The 3D effect was immediately noticeable to me and easy to adjust into a comfortable, crisply clear virtual world.  Pilotwings makes excellent use of the 3D view and it becomes integral to playing the game.  The games I've played all looked great in 3D!--Negatives--The biggest negative (which I deducted a star for) is the headache people seem to get when playing.  After only about 5 minutes I could feel my head starting to hurt from the strain on my eyes.  It took over 2 hours for the headache to go away after my first 5-10 minute gaming mini-session.  I'll have to see if the headaches go away with more frequent playing.  It brought me back to the nauseau I got from first playing first-person games with 3 dimensions like Descent for the PC way back when.  The only other significant negative is a short battery life (though I usually play with brightness turned down and sound off, which extends battery life).Also, the games out now are not that great, yet they're are all priced at $39.99 retail.  Street Fighter is the only one I would pay full retail price for.  Nintendogs seems like a quality game and I imagine fans of previous Nintendogs titles will be thrilled with it.  The games roster currently offers little else.  Pilotwings is decent as is Madden, but they seem more like quick ports than full-fledged 3DS blockbuster titles.  Most of the games out are not even worth playing and do little with the new graphics and 3D capabilities.==Conclusion==Overall, the Nintendo 3DS is a graphical powerhouse compared to the previous DS models. When games are released that are really tailored to the 3DS, it will become a must-have system regardless of the discomfort that the 3D effect can have.  Until then, I recommend finding a demo model to see how you like the 3D effect and how much of a headache it gives you.  However, even without the 3D turned on, the graphics are amazing and Nintendo's first party titles will be sure to make this another must-have entertainment device, just like the Wii and DS.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2011"}

I played Modern Warfare 4 and MW 2 until my eyes bled.  Many hours were dedicated to attempting to have the highest kill/death ratio on the team.This game is like the mario kart of COD's.  that is, every game is frantic and requires more luck than skill.  Gone are the days of tactically picking off people online.  People spawn right behind you.  You spawn right behind your enemy.But my kill death ratio is fantastic.  Why?  Because as soon as I spawn, I hide for the closest corner and enemies will walk right past me.  It's awful.  There was always camping in COD's, but not this bad.On top of it, lag compensation.  Let's just say that I recently now have awful internet. I stopped playing COD because of lag.  Well, the compensation is so bad that I actually have a chance in this game!  I can imagine why those with good connections are so upset.  So why am I not happy for this compensation??? because I dont' feel like i'm really killing the person, it's a huge handicap that muffles any talent he/she may have.Yeah...the COD's will keep selling, and I'm sure the kids will love these changes....by the way when I first played COD I could have good conversations with adults.

I finally opened it up and installed it about a month ago and gave it a ride.  Unfortunately, that is all this game really seemed to be for me: a ride.  I did not get very far into this game before becoming bored with the constant car driving missions.  I am probably not being completely fair to the game, perhaps there was a lot of great action later in the game that did not involve being a taxi service, but I could not stand anymore of it and gave up.  I am not a person whom enjoys timed missions; in fact, I find them almost completely useless and very aggravating.  Nearly every video game I have ever played that has timed missions gets marked down in my book.  Mafia is no exception.  I found the graphics to be decent, especially for an older game.  I also enjoyed the dialog quite a bit.  But I just can not get past the monotonous driving sequences.  How many times do I have to taxi some schmuck across town before I can actually do something else???In my humble opinion, this is a slight knockoff of Max Payne, which is a much better game without the needless driving sequences.  I love the whole Mafia storyline, I am just disappointed it didn't play out a little better in the beginning.Overall = Average","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2007"}

I love my Wii U!","reviewText":"I have been a Nintendo fan since the early 90's. I used to play on the NES, followed by the N64, followed by the Wii, and now the Wii U. First off, unlike PS4 and XboxOne, the Wii U is backwards compatible. This is definitely a bonus because it allows me to get rid of the originial Wii console and just play ALL my games on a single console. This means less clutter under my TV and I can make a little money off my Wii when I sell it.I will be honest and admit I am not a big fan of the Gamepad. I don't mind using it if I have to (certain games/levels require it), but I do prefer the regular remote such as the wii remote or the classic controller. Thankfully, most games allow you to choose your controller. I tend to use the wii remote with the nunchuck the most. The gamepad is definitely nice though if someone else needs to use the tv or you just need to glance down at it to see a close up image of something on the screen.People say there are no games, but I recently got Super Mario 3d World and Donkey Kong Tropical Breeze. Both games are amazing! I am having so much fun with the both of them. On top of this I've got NintendoLand (great game to play with family/friends), Super Mario Bros U, and Luigi U. They've also got Mario Kart 8 coming out in late May 2014, which I am super excited for.Overall, it's a great system. Also, $300 for the deluxe console and 2 games. You can't beat that price! It is well worth it. Don't let the media fool you into thinking PS4/Xbone are the only good consoles out there. The Wii U is fantastic as well. Sure, it's more of a family type of console to own, but I enjoy it. I currently own a PS4 and a 360. After some hardcore games that involve blood and gore, I like to relax and play some Donkey Kong or Mario.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2014"}

The graphics are good, the variety of weapons and the way they feel and sound is very good, and the overall experience is fun.  I found a couple downsides... first there are *very* few ways to change the control setup.  These days you should be able to totally customize the controls any way you please but it's just not in this game.  Second, most of the gameplay takes place in tight hallways and corridors -- there are a few open environments but they could have mixed it up a bit more.  Also the story is not as compelling to me as it may be to others, and the ending is extremely disappointing.  Finally, the online/multiplayer component is completely empty, I never saw one other person in any of the online rooms for this game.  I say this game is worth one play through the campaign mode.  That's what I did and am now selling my copy.  3/5 stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2012"}

There is a very convoluted story here that you may never quite grasp, but in the midst of this is a very good single-player campaign that lasts upwards of 10 hours and remains incredibly tense and thrilling from start to finish.The F.E.A.R. series is sadly one of the more underrated series of games this console generation, which is unfortunate because it really shouldn't be.  The games in this series deliver very intense shooting action against AI that is significantly more intelligent than the other FPSs it competes with, and F.E.A.R 2 is no different.  The ability to carry 4 weapons and 4 grenade types keeps the combat very fresh and varied.  Enemy types aren't the most varied, but their tactical intelligence always keeps you on your toes and forces you to think strategically.  Certain segments of game allow you take control of a brutally powerful mech that decimates your enemies with chain guns and missiles.  Overall, the gameplay mechanics are quite solid and the game really delivers in its action, making for a really enjoyable experience the whole way through.Where this game really stands out is in its spooky atmosphere.  Taking strong influence from supernatural Japanese horror films and mythology, you'll find that this is a game best played in the dark with your surround sound turned up.  Ghostly apparitions, ghastly images, and creepy sound effects come at you at a perfect pace that is never under or overwhelming, particularly during sections in between major combat action.  This is a stand out feature for the game, and one that really differentiates it from other games in the genre.  It is not a game for those who are easily startled, but those who also enjoy a good scare, the blend of horror and intense combat make for a very satisfying experience.The game isn't perfect.  From a presentation perspective, it isn't quite on the level of other FPSs circa 2009 such as Resistance 2 or Modern Warfare 2.  The graphics are suitable but won't blow your mind.  The characters you come across can seem wooden and unmemorable, much of this having to do with the aforementioned convoluted narrative.  But these are minor pickings in what is an otherwise very good game that stands apart from the pack with its well-paced, intense combat and its spooky atmosphere.  It's a very good bargain at the price it's at now, and should definitely scratch the itch for gamers looking for a solid and very enjoyable shooter with a nice touch of creepiness.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2012"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

Mass Effect has a rich amazing universe attached to it with believable races, characters, religion, culture, and it feels like a whole alternate universe that could exist. Mass Effect 2 expands on this for fans of the original (yeah don't play it unless you played the first...seriously). Not only is this just a direct sequel, but all your actions from the original game effect the outcome of this one...amazing. Mass Effect 2 has Command Shepard being remade as a machine almost after the Normandy gets destroyed by Collectors. Cerberus fixes you up for the over 2 years and now you have to rebuild your team, find your previous one, and stop the Collectors from destroying the human race and working with the Reapers.Mass Effect 2 has so many changes that were much needed and the game just feels tighter, more fluent, and action packed. Action is the key word here since a lot of the mundane RPG elements were stripped. To get an idea of what was improved I'll start with squad management. Instead of finding armor for each type of race and maintaining every stat of that armor and the character you no longer manage your teams armor just yours. You also no longer have to go find armor like the original. Armor can be bought from world markets and you equip each piece in your cabin on the Normandy 2. You can even change the color and scheme of the armor as well as your casual clothes. This is great and I love it becasue micromanaging armor in the first game was a real pain.The same goes for weapons. You no longer have to find and add each element to every weapon like ammo types, and add-ons because those are now gone as well. Instead you find weapons during missions or in markets. You can equip them via a loadout and the same goes for your squad.Let's take about the radial menus here. You get three ammo types: Cryo, incinerate, and disruptor. Each can be used for certain enemies. Your powers are activated here too but you can now map them to buttons. When shooting weapons you now longer have a \"heat guage\" but actual ammo. The weapons draw heat to a \"clip\" which is discharged once it gets too hot. If you run out of these clips your weapons won't fire thus solving that annoying heat meter crap from the first game. This helps the game feel like a solid shooter instead of a game that doesn't know if its an action game or straight RPG.The shooting and fighting in the game is now really solid and you just feel so powerful will all these guns at your disposal. You can upgrade everything (including your ship and this has outcomes during the last mission) by finding research projects while on missions. This solves all the RPG elements from the last game so it feels like a solid shooter. Don't get too upset there are still RPG elements, but they are only in upgrading your team mates and yourself. Instead of upgrading every single element such as each ammo type, every biotic type, this and that you only have about 4-6 traits you upgrade. This includes your main character's ability, biotic or ammo types, and any other special skill. Each one can be upgrading up to level four and after that you get a choice between two special bonus perks. This makes the leveling feel more solid, fluid, and more resourceful.Another great improvment is the galaxy map navigation. No longer are you just a cursor floating around the map, but you actually move your ship. When you are outside solar systems traveling in dead space on the map you use fuel, but the biggest improvement is no more excavating resources via the stupid rover vehicle. In fact all vehicle control has been stripped from the game. Instead you use a scanner on unexplored planets and when the controller vibrates you will see your meter spike over a certain guage. This will be one of the five resources used to upgrade things in the game. While is sounds more repetitive its nice to break up the action of the game and get some down time.If those don't sound like enough of an improvement how about the story? The story is still as epic and emotionally engrossing as the first if not more so. There are a couple of new races added such as the vorcha, drell, and Batarians. There are new characters that you can recruit and they are all as loveable and memorable as the first game. Of course all your old pals return, but what my favorite part about the game, that isn't in any other, is how your original save carries over.If you had a relationship with a previous mate you will see that in the game, savings and killing certain characters in the past will pop up in the sequel reflecting certain outcomes of missions, if you chose the renegade or paragon path reflects off your character with red scars and reddened eyes if your were a bad ass. You truly feel like you were dead for two years and all your choices in your past came back to haunt you. It's a mind trip and is really makes you that much more involved in the story. Every choice you take during dialogs trees effects what you do, and BioWare are masters of this.The only reason why this one scores lower than the original is because most of this has been seen in the original and isn't anything new for vets of Mass Effect. The new additions just keep the score really high, but doesn't give us that new feeling. With improved graphics and the same amazing voice acting Mass Effect 2 will keep fans buys for a good 25-30 hours, but watch what you do because it will effect your outcome in Mass Effect 3.BUYING A NEW COPY: Will grant you access to a free content update that's normally $15 for free. This includes a new character, Zaeed, and two other missions that involve the crash of the Normandy. While this update is not worth $15 buying a new copy makes you feel like you're truly getting your money's worth.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

I had to get Rockstar's latest Western epic; Red Dead Redemption. Rockstar is known for their sand box games, in which they allow the players total freedom in deciding what part they play in the world. Be it villain or hero. So having played GTA4 and enjoying that, i had high expectations for RDR. I already figured out that i was going to play a GTA clone. What i didn't figure out until i played the game, is that the game has all the hallmarks of a rushed product. Being a GTA clone it was too much like a wild west GTA and not unique. The much hyped multiplayer was not worth the price of the game. (Editors note- I played the game after Rockstar patched the servers)In their build up till game launch, Rockstar hyped up the \"Free Roam\" mode as sort of a wild west MMORPG. Players could form posses, run around villages terrorizing people. Or they could bring justice to the land as lawman. This sounds great on paper, and one could imagine bands of criminals and lawman duking it out in a wild west setting. The problem is this is not what we got! Getting on to Free Roam mode. I was allowed to create a character and get a mount (it's kind of funny cause you start out with donkey lol). Some Modern warfare 2 elements are added to this game as you are allowed to pick titles, weapons, new mounts, and different characters as you advance in experience points. I soon found myself in the massive setting of RDR. It was just like the single player map only not as many NPC's or players others around. I looked around and noticed the ghost town atmosphere and wondered if their were any human players online with me. So i bring up my map and to my surprise their was TWO other human people in my free roam mode. Maybe it was just a fluke, so i tried to play free roam again and again several times in the next few days and every time i was put on a map with only FOUR other people at most. Is this what Rockstar promised us? A ghost town map...with fewer then 10 players maxed? This was not what was advertised. This was not the epic gun battles between warring posses that i expected to encounter. It was a big yet down. Sure, it can be fun playing it with your xbox live friends. And it would probably be best to have a group of friends in order to get the best out of Free Roam. But don't expect much in the way of player vs player posse fights. Im hoping when the Rockstar devs are online with their posse their will be a lot more activity in free roam as everyone wants to kill the Rockstars. Free Roam as it is, is just an polished up game lobby. Of course, that's if you can even get into Free Roam. Several times while trying to log on to free roam, my xbox failed to get a connection, so i was left at the loading screen for more then 10 minutes waiting to play. Most of the times i just give up. Rockstar doesn't have anyway for you to get out of the free roam loading screen. So you have to push the xbox button and reset the game by going to launchpad every time you are unable to load and don't want to wait 10 minutes just to get connected. I believe that i spent more times at the loading screen then actually playing free roam.Quick matches and the assorted gang matches are a little bit better then free roam and for the most part have more people. They usually begin with a shootout which honestly is the most fun part of the multiplayers. The matches range from Gold rush(by far the most fun), to shootout(deathmatch), to a sort of capture the flag only with gold bags. They can either be played as a gang or free for all. Now when i mentioned that RDR was a GTA clone i wasn't kidding. Killing enemies is as easy as pressing the right trigger and allowing yourself to autotarget. The same as it was on GTA's multiplayer. Yep that's right folks, no skill required! Just auto aim and fire. And unless you have a nice weapon, it takes like 5 hits to kill one guy. Your jaw will drop as you blast an opponent 6 times at point blank with a two barrel shotgun and yet he doesn't die, he doesn't even flitched! I had no idea unarmored Cowboys could withstand five shots with a shotgun at close range. The matches pretty much come down to who has the best cover and who has the best weapons. Nothing more. It gets boring after awhile. Though i do like the fact you can call your horse at anytime though. If their is someway to play a game without autotargeting i would like to know!By far the best part of RDR is the single player. Rockstar always had a knack for clever story written and character development and this game doesn't disappoint. You play as John Marston and are tasked with finding an old friend of yours who you use to run with in a gang. Your search will take you all over the west and you will have to work for some interesting characters along the way. The deadeye is probably the coolest aspect of the game. In which you can slow down the pace of the game like a matrix bullet time and place well aim shots at various target(s). And dam will you need it, cause this game is tough! Besides the story, their are a nice assortment of mini games (Poker, horseshoes, five finger) and side quest (such as hunting) to occupy your time. You can become an outlaw of sorts, and at times you will accidentally become a outlaw if you pull a gun out on a citizen (watch out what button you press) but just like GTA you can always evade authorities or pay a bribe.So pretty much it's a fun game.

But even after several console and handheld systems later, he is still proving that he is the most recognizable character in the video game world. Back in 1996, Mario made his 3D debut with Super Mario 64, which revolutionized 3D gaming and platforming as we now know it. Super Mario Sunshine on the GameCube further reaffirmed his top status. And now comes his triumphant return on Nintendo's Wii with Super Mario Galaxy. A lot of skepticism came about when first hearing about playing Mario on the Wii. But any previous doubts will immediately be pushed aside the moment you start playing. In the end, it is pure fun and this is a game that progresses the series while still staying true to its roots.It will be the Star Festival soon, and Princess Peach has invited Mario back to her castle to enjoy the festivities. However, Bowser and his minions foil the event by once again kidnapping the princess. It will be up to you as Mario to not only rescue Peach, but to also recover the power stars to restore the galaxies. The minute you start up the game, you are almost instantly placed right into the action. You'll soar through dreamy worlds, starry skies, and alien planets throughout outer space while defying gravity and meeting all sorts of characters. You can tell Nintendo really let their imagination run wild here. Mario also has more transformations in this game than any other game since, being able to become Fire Mario, Ice Mario, and Rainbow Mario just to name a few. Familiar faces including Goombas, Piranha Plants, and Boos all make a return here as well.With the controls of the gameplay, Nintendo has once again proved that no one knows their own hardware better. Using both the Wiimote and the Nunchuk to control is done in an almost flawless fashion. Anyone familiar with the controls of Mario 64 or Sunshine will certainly feel at home here, but newcomers should have no problem getting accustomed. The gameplay stays responsive and intuitive even while controlling Mario from various directions (sideways, upside down, etc.). The camera is also one of the best in a 3D platformer, and is a vast improvement over the previous 3D Mario games where your view often gets stuck or is simply in the way. There is also a 2-player option called Co-Star Mode in which one player controls Mario and another collects star bits. It just further adds to what cooperative fun a single-player game could be.The graphics, despite how simplistic they may be, fit the game's overall image very well. It stays in the tradition of the Mario series while not looking completely backward by today's visual standards. These are among the most creative worlds yet imaginable. The music is also very appropriate for the game's atmosphere which perfectly accents the action, and longtime Mario fans will be happy to know that a few tunes from the older games make a comeback here. Even the classic sound effects can be heard and all these nostalgic elements make the game even more enjoyable for the player. Everything about it makes you feel comfortable while you're exploring each world and it all comes together as a well-rounded interactive experience.Any fan of the Mario series or Nintendo's games should be able to enjoy Super Mario Galaxy, as well as newbies. But I would also recommend it to anyone who just wants a straight-up title that fuses together the best elements of exploration and action. It isn't overly lengthy and nor is it made to be extremely difficult, which means players of many ages can easily get into it. The only problem would be getting used to the sensitivity of the controls, but one should adjust quite quickly enough that it won't hinder gameplay. Also, if you're playing the game around other people, it might be dizzying or disorienting for those who are watching Mario running upside down. These minor issues aside, it still remains simple, enjoyable, and you can pick it up and just play. As one of the best games to come out in a long while, Super Mario Galaxy fully reinforces Nintendo's philosophy of just simply putting the fun back in gaming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2007"}

O'Niell","summary":"Awesome but not perfect","reviewText":"I picked this up a week ago at a Game Stop, I really like it so far. It's for sure the best of the PSMove shooting peripherals I have ever seen or used, mainly because of the fact the Move actually plugs in to a mini USB on the Sharpshooter remapping the \"hard to reach\" buttons to easy to reach location, it all works very well for what it is.I have tested as many games as I could, Killzone 3, awesome once I tuned it in to my personal preferences, it did take me a while to get all the sensitivities right. One thing I noticed was that the adjustable stock got in the way often during turning, in fact I would remove it all together if I could and I may one day if it really bothers me, I just don't want to have to take it apart.Dead Space Extraction works amazing with the Sharpshooter, it feels really good, no complaints for that game, well maybe except for the weight, if starts to feel a bit heavy after a while, but that's to be said for all games using the Sharpshooter I guess.Works well as you would expect for The Shoot and, Time Crisis: Razing Storm, they are a bit more basic though.I Haven't tried MAG or RE5(as I don't have them) but I'm sure it's fine, and probably works better then any other Move housing.One thing they should have added was a mini USB port some place on the gun, so you could charge the Move as you play, also I might rap some hockey tape around the handle, it seems a bit weak and may feel more comfortable if I do.And now for my biggest complaint of all, I'm sure it will be on every ones mind in future reviews. When the move vibrates it rattles the Sharpshooter like crazy, at first I thought it wasn't plugged in right. Nope it's loose'ish in the housing, I can disable the vibration function in controller options. It's ridiculous I really shouldn't have to turn off the vibe to accommodate for the Sharpshooter. I solved it for now but putting foam and double sided tape under the move cap of the Sharpshooter, it works and you don't see it.Oh and it comes with 3 different sets of stickers to stick on the Sharpshooter, depending on your preference.Killzone 3 HelgastKillzone 3 ISASOCOM 4--------------------------------------Update 02/28/11After using the Sharpshooter for a little while (daily) I found no other issues at all, and I'm learning to like the ajustable stock, But I still wish you could remove it sometimes.Also I FINALLY found some good KZ3 settings.I'm using (in multiplayer) '0'/'0' dead zone, '0' sensitivity and '30' turn speed You may want to turn up the turn speed once you get used to it, if feels as close as I could get it to the Dual Shock 3","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000O5DS32","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"Krav Maga","summary":"Its alright....","reviewText":"I did enjoy the campaign while it lasted, but the multiplayer is complete garbage and the servers are dead no one plays, and the campaign is short and easy even on hard, bought this in 2011 and only got it cause it was cheap.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2012"}

You won't be disappointed with this game.The only single gripe that I have about the game is that it doesn't go on longer.  The story gives the ability for ENDLESS sequels and that just gives me that little burst of stupid grin/giggle gamer joy thinking about the possibilies.  Consider the awesomeness of multiple unactivated stations that go to uncharted/unknown areas of the galaxy, or a new type of station that sends you to OTHER galaxies.

{"product_name":"B002I0H79C","description":"Gears of War 3","reviewerName":"Greg","summary":"I can't quit you, Dom...","reviewText":"Gears of War has done what almost no one in the history of anything has done - crank out a near perfect trilogy (eat me,Halo 3and get bent,Aeschylus!).  It's a powerful, satisfying and suprisingly emotional close to what has been my favorite video game franchise in years.  A well played end to one heck of a ride.Take a bow, everyone, you deserve it.But... Note that I said \"near perfect\" - there are some flaws and short comings that I'll be happy to point out in obnoxious detail below.  But if you read no further, know this - if you enjoyed anything at all about the previous Gears games, even in the slightest bit, then this is a must play.  It's a wonderful blend of story and gameplay successes and a deserving end to a bloody romp.  Seriously, I could end the review here, because that's all you need to know... but how is that any fun for ME?Commence my pointless bitching...Vissually, Gears 3 is both a huge leap forward and a huge leap in the wrong direction.  Now stay with me, because I may be the only person alive who's going to gripe about this game's visuals.  They've given it a much shinier, smoother, more photo-realistic look and it's truly impressive to see - until you start to move around with any speed, that is.  The color palette (the infamous Gears of War brown on grey on bleh) that has worked well in the past is now too muddled and blurry to actually SEE anything.  And don't give me any crap about my eyes not working, because I'm playing this one on a 40\" HDTV, where I played the others on a 26\" tube TV and was able to make out what I was shooting at just fine.  They've put such wonderful visual detail into the characters and the enemies (especially the newly intorduced breeds of Lambent locust) that to lose them all among the backgrounds and foregrounds in a mess of brown and grey is a real shame.  I know Gears is supposed to muted and muddled and to do anything else would make it not feel like Gears, but they've kept a small portion of the tone at the expense of my eyesight.  Though changing that would have made it feel like a different world, I suppose.  Now get ready for a big ol' paragraph of contradiction, because...They've made unecessary artistic choices that start to make it feel less like a Gears game and more like a different world.  ...Why?  How come, all of a sudden, no one has any sleeves?  I guess they were like \"huh, they've been living on a boat for a while, they should probably look like they're all beat up and tired... Eh, take away their sleeves, that should do it.\"  That's... that's weak.  It just looks like they're sporting their summer armor or something.  If the desire was to give the impression that the COG soldiers were short on supplies and living thin, they should all have, like, partial armor.  And patched up armor.  We should see more guys sporting those silly Baird goggles instead the full helmets - things like that.  And how come Anya is now in full armor and has a big gun?  I get that they wanted to put women on the front lines (something curiously lacking in the other titles) and I've no problem with Sam, or the gal with the white dreadlocks - I buy them just fine.  But Anya?  Shouldn't she be on the bridge of the destroyer with, like, a compass and a... protractor or something?  Giving her the full Gears armor just felt out of character.  And who the hell is this Jace Stratton weenus?  Is this my new sidekick?  Could they have found a WORSE actor to play him?  He doesn't sound like a Gear, he sounds like glass-jawed weenus. Seriously, screw that guy.Some other strange things happen - the locust no longer appear out of big holes in the ground, they now pop out like lemurs.  Why?  You spend a half chapter with Cole as the lead character all of a sudden... why?  Sure, it was cool to learn more about him and he feels less like a racist charicature than he ever has, but it's a little late to back-track him from the last two full games.  All it does it break continuity and lead to some awkward story transitions.And oh, God, don't get me started on the story elements they don't follow through on and the plot threads they introduce just to forget about... just, just don't even go there.The biggest sin throughout, however, is the refusal to simply give us what we want - more old-school Gears action.  The last level of the game is incredible: it's an old-school, no-holds barred slog through waves and waves of locust grunts with your lancer at your side and a shotgun in your back pocket that leads to a neat and challenging boss fight that fits fluidly into the rest of the combat - tride and true Gears of War awesomeness.  But... about halfway through that level I realized I had to wait THE WHOLE GAME to get what was the staple for the other two.  I should be SICK of that by that point and ready for some kind of endgame treat (like the Brumake ride in Gears 2 or the showdown with Raam in Gears 1).  All the other chapters a sprinkled with so much arcade-ish feeling BS.  Silly weapons (oh... a 'one-shot'... cool) and unncessary new eneimes (look, a centipede... that shoots lightning... neat).  There's no painful and obnoxious \"drive the vehicle\" level (thank God) but there are plenty of \"man the turret and shoot at something silly\" levels.  And for the first time, we have Gears standing toe-to-toe with a Brumak... you know, the giant dinoaur with rocket launchers on it's arms?... and surviving.  After they spent two games establishing that you don't take those (or other monsters) on without some sort of heavy weapon or high-tech advantage, now you just shoot it in the eyes... like everything else... \"eh, just give it a glowing and obvious weak spot, they'll figure it out\".  It's a laundry list of tone altering and genre bending sillyness that is just so unnecessary.  I can't tell if it was all added because the developers were worried they were boring us or if they were bored themselves... I'm inclined to believe the latter.All in all, I'm glad this is the last installment.  Sera's a broken world, our protagonists have been beaten to and battered to the point of no return, and delving back in for another go just wouldn't be fun anymore.  They've lowered the curtain on the series, taken a final, beautiful bow and I truly hope it stays that way.Oh, wait... I just read about the prequel they're planning... with a different dev team......oh...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2012"}

And the extra time sampling this at almost 1:30am EST considering the other games I could have sampled, was worth it.  FIFA 14 showcases what a good launch sports sim could be and also shows the potential of what we could expect from the new gaming systems to come about!To be fair, it does not need reiterating the game set up and modes as for now, FIFA 14&#8217;s menus operates the exact same way that it does on the current gen systems so as some of you already know, there are no changes to that or need to trod over old ground about what it can do.What I can tell you however is all of the changes that happen are the tiny and noticeable changes within the game itself.Starting off the pre-game presentation, the first thing I picked up on that I noticed that went missing in the 360 version from last year, is&#8230;the ESPN logo.  It&#8217;s a small arbitrary thing but considering the fact that it was in FIFA 13 and then quickly disappeared in FIFA 14, it was just a chuckle to see it re-appear for the PS4. Also, once you get a game fired up, you will see a nice small EA HD transparent layover in the upper right corner of the screen.After that is when you really do start seeing the smallest nuances within the game it as EA had mentioned. The crowds are no longer 2D pixelated cutouts but look more &#8216;alive&#8217; although still not exactly up to 2K sports standards but it&#8217;s forgivable.  The commentary thus far is much more varied and dynamic as Tyler and Smith give a great overview of what&#8217;s to come. A nice added touch is that now as they talk about new transfers and other rumors, the game does cutaways to the players being mentioned as the sit in the stands.  All in all the pre-game presentation has been stepped up.As the game itself starts, one can really notice how much smoother it feels to play this on the next-gen consoles as opposed to the current gen.  The game stoppages are smooth when balls go out of bounds and you really can feel the crowd get behind you with ball movement.  The controls are the same and with the Dualshock 4, it&#8217;s very comfortable now considering that I have large hands, it&#8217;s not as cramped as before.  Action on the field looks much more realistic as of course advertised by EA, they added a lot of animations to players to make the game more realistic and it shows.  Slide tackles are different from many angles as you don&#8217;t get the same slide tackle each time you push the button. Shots are also different from players and I have also noticed that in many cases, balls when deflected react with a lot more variety than before and it makes it a challenge sometimes to see where it might land.  In short the realism is getting better.So what are some things that EA could improve?  So it IS a launch game largely based on the current gen version so it&#8217;s really hard to criticize at this  point but if I had to point a few issues out I would say that for one, the player models look slightly better and a little less dead under the eyes and they still move a bit stiffly close up.  The crowd noise is about the same as this gen&#8217;s version but it is a lot more reactive when things happen.  And the dynamic lighting as not been changed as of yet but it is one improvement I hope to see change as gaming on this new system continues.The last thing I want to cover is remote play. Even on the Vita with it scaled down, it looks excellent and still plays marvelously.  You may have to get used to using the touchpad on the back but the game still works fine.  I experienced a few hiccups here and there but nothing game breaking so now, I can play anywhere in my house when I don&#8217;t feel like sitting in front of my TV and I love it!All in all, FIFA 14 is a great entry into the next-gen system and if you are a footy fan, you would be remiss to not get this game.  Also remember, if you were one of those that got this game for the PS3 and you are getting it for the PS4, certain stores will allow you to trade this in and you pay only $10 to upgrade and the same applies if you are upgrading it from an X-Box 360 to the X-box One.My score is 4.5 out of 5 and a highly recommended pickup if you are a FIFA fan.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2013"}

There are some good improvements including the ability to build a coaster without time or financial worry, and the inclusion of more thrill rides and many more shops and stalls. The graphics don't look better just smaller.Obviously Chris Sawyer (the developer) said to himself &quot;if it ain't broke don't fix it&quot;, but RCT1 is very old now and with the new technology out it seems he could have made more original changes. Like better AI on the park guests for one. Better, not smaller, graphics which could have brought the player closer up into the amusement park creation. Being able to see your shops, stalls, rides and especially your coasters up close would have been great. It's time he take a risk and make wholesale changes. Again though, if you have never played the first this is still a great game. Especially the ability to build your own coaster; the thrill of making a coaster that the people love to ride is a good feeling.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2003"}
{"product_name":"B004FYKWZU","description":"","reviewerName":"H. Le","summary":"Last Flight of The Normandy","reviewText":"For obvious reason, the ending of Mass Effect 3 is where I will start my review to get it out of the way.  Having played ME1 four times and ME2 six times - along with various saves with various sets of decisions, I really looked forward to ME3 - but with apprehension.  Needless to say, much to my disappointment, my apprehension became a reality in an unexpected way:  A highflying tale of high adventure - and one of the best of all time - crash landed both literally and figuratively at the final moment.And it does not matter how I will attempt to salvage the wreckage of an ending that was stolen from Ion Storm's Deus Ex (and badly applied to ME3), whether by believing that it's all is a marketing scam to sell more DLCs; or get indoctrinated into believing the `Indoctrination Theory'; or pandering to some cop-out philosophical concepts like cosmicism,  the circle of life, the galactic cycle, cyclical history, etc.; or wait patiently for EA/bioware to release the CE (*complete* edition in this case); or simply made one up on my own... The ending still remains what it is, and just like the Normandy, it's a wreck.In other words, no matter what I dress it up in, and how many times I take it out on the dance floor for a spin, and what tune we dance to, the ending still sucks -- That's that and it's now out of the way as far as my review is concerned.In spite of the pretentious ending, not all is lost because there is still a good 30 hours or so of excellent gameplay here if one can somehow temporarily put aside the ending.  Granted, a 30-hours game is noticeably shorter than ME1 or ME2, but whatever length there is - after whatever EA/bioware ripped out for DLC(s), or never get the time to complete -  is excellent for the most part.In terms of gameplay,  ME3 is the undisputed winner in the combat arena for the ME series.  Although the different races that you can fight against are now narrowed down to human, Geth, and reapers, the sub classes within each race have increased significantly and will require you to employ different tactics and team members.Also, melee combat is also improved with the addition of a strong melee attack -  which your enemies also employed - with a new weapon, the Omni blade featured on the DVD cover.  The cover system have also improved - but still need work; Shepard is now more mobile and agile than ever, but still can inadvertently get into cover position at inopportune time.The most significant improvement of all combat-wise is that the enemies have vastly improved AI which really boosts aggressiveness.  They will now try to flank you; use smoke screen for concealment; melee specialists will close in on you; snipers will harass you; and some enemies even camp out behind a wall or a corner until you sauntered past.Unfortunately, your fire team members'AI improvement is a no-match to your enemies' AI.  Although your teammates can now shoot a little better from cover, without tight management, they still run head first into hostile fire or into friendly line of fire (blocking my view), or worse yet, come up behind me and try to shoot at the enemies through my helmet.Also, another minor let down is that, for about half of the game, in spite of the improved elements, the combat itself boils down to holding an area against waves of enemies until a certain event took place; this gets progressively worse especially when you returned to Earth.In terms of RPG, in general, ME3 is a mixed result between ME1 and ME2.  To be sure, ME1 is still has the best RPG elements in the series; while ME3 is better than ME2 is some ways, but worse in others. To be more precise, in tern of conversational options, ME3 is the worst by far.  Way too often - and almost to the point of all the time, your choices are limited to either paragon or renegade; whereas in ME1 and ME2, there is almost always at least one neutral option.However, the weapon mods in ME1 - which I really like - are making a big comeback, along with a significant increase in weapon upgrades and selections.  As for armor, there is now a wider selection of armor and armor components for Shepard.  Your team mates' armors, unfortunately, remain purely cosmetic.BTW, The Normandy also saw some improvement, most notable is the fact that you can now move about the ship freely.  Incidentally, your teammates also move around the ship - which certainly adds a touch of more realism than before.Thankfully, the mini games have been almost completely eliminated.  Scanning the planet is now a painless task - And along with planet scanning, there is also a totally optional mini game of `eluding the reapers' - which I do not mind playing (I also discover a startling fact while playing this mini-game: Under normal propulsion, reapers can move faster than the Normandy !)Story wise, which is the heart and soul of the ME series, (not counting the disastrous ending), ME3 also shines brightly in the relatively short amount of game time.  The highlight of the story, and one that is extremely well done, is the resolution of the Krogan/Turian/Salarian conflict and the Geth vs. Quarian war - And this part alone is the saving grace of the game for me.Also, it suffices to say that you will meet all of your former teammates again - provided they did not kick the bucket.  Some of these former teammates will happily rejoin you again - and if you have hooked up with them before, needless to say, you will get the chance to rekindle the romance.  In short, in terms of the story, everything that takes place away from Earth is noteworthy - if not superb.If I have to rank the game in the series, it'd be ranked precisely in its chronological order of 1, 2, 3.  It's too bad ME3 is a cracked diamond.  Otherwise, the ranking would have been 3,1,2.  For what it's worth, I still recommend this game to ME fans and new comers alike - but not at full retail price.In conclusion, for better or for worse, it is what it is; and as is, the Mass Effect story has come to an end in my book - And for the most part, it certainly was a grand adventure while it lasted.  Keelah' Selai.--------------------------------------------Update: With the Extended Cut DLC, although still no where worthy of the Mass Effect series, the ending is definitely an improvement.  Unfortunately, due to EA's Origin client and DRM - which is a vastly inferior copycat of Steam - being completely broken during the initial installation process - and if you download any DLC, offline mode no longer work and the DRM becomes the much-hated persistent internet connection DRM scheme - I cannot raise the product rating any higher than 2 stars; but I did give the fun factor an additional star.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2012"}

This game had so much potential for greatness, but sadly it fell far short of its potential.  After having spent quite a bit of time playing it, I have to say that it is a very fun game.  Once your character becomes sufficiently powerful, it's more fun and less frustrating.I could go on and on about this game's many flaws, but let me break it down this way instead.  The combat, combos and force powers, are designed for one on one type of action against enemies, but in 99% of the scenarios you encounter in the game, you face off against large groups of adversaries and the moves you have just aren't sufficient to take them on in an elegant way.  The combat is extremely unpolished to say the least.That being said, there are a ton of combos and the combo system itself is pretty nice.  It's just not applicable as much as you'd want it to be.  The force powers are very fun.The level design is sloppy.  You find yourself getting stuck in certain areas for unknown reasons.  You also slip and fall a lot off of things that you'd think you'd be able to stand on.  The character basically has a very poor relationship to his environment.  You can't grab on ledges or anything like that.  The attention to detail with regard to your character's movement through the environment is extremely sloppy.All that being said, the story is nice and the DMM technology is fantastic.  What works in the game works very well but sadly only 30% of the game is polished at all and it really destroys the overall experience.I hope they keep going with this technology though and create other jedi games.  I just hope they polish them more.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2008"}

Players are immersed in the role of apprentice at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Academy where they learn the power - and danger - of the Force. Amidst a multitude of complex and richly detailed Star Wars environments, including twice as many unique locales as those inStar Wars: Jedi Outcast, players face a variety of powerful and insidious enemies.For the first time in a Jedi Knight series game,Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academyallows players to create and customize their own characters by choosing various characteristics including species, gender, clothing, and physical attributes such as hair and facial features. In addition, players can create a custom lightsaber, selecting from hilt design and blade color. As apprentices progress in their training, different lightsabers will become available, such as the double-bladed lightsaber or dual lightsabers.Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academybegins shortly after the conclusion of events inStar Wars: Jedi Outcast. Players create a Jedi apprentice character and join the Jedi Academy on Yavin 4 to learn the ways of the Force under the tutelage of Luke Skywalker and Kyle Katarn. While the young apprentice embarks on various missions to hone their skills and abilities, a mysterious group is discovered creating havoc throughout the galaxy. Until order is restored, the fate of the Jedi Academy - and the future of the Star Wars galaxy itself - hangs precariously in the balance.While players are able to accomplish more by using the lightsaber inStar Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, they also will have a variety of weapons - new and old - at their disposal including a blaster, blaster rifle, Wookiee bowcaster, Imperial repeater, and a Destructive Electro-Magnetic Pulse gun. A unique level selection system allows players to choose their own path through the game as well as the missions they undertake to improve their Jedi skills. The game adds new multiplayer modes and bring back the most popular modes fromStar Wars: Jedi Outcast.","reviewerName":"Derek G","summary":"Let the battle begin!","reviewText":"I have to confess that, even though I played the earlier Star Wars themed games like Dark Forces and Jedi Knight, I just couldn't get into them.  The main problem I was having was that it all seemed too familiar.  I know they were all well made games, but with all the blaster fire, puzzle solving, and platform jumping, it just felt like I was playing \"Doom with Stormtroopers.\"  Enter the battles of Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy.From the outset, you realize this game is all about light saber battles.  This may or may not be a big plus for you, but it's what I expected from the very first Star Wars themed game.  Even as an inexperienced jedi, you can easily deflect blaster fire like it \"ain't no thang.\"  Since most of your opponents can do the same, your blaster quickly becomes second fiddle.  You start off the game as a new student on the way to the academy to learn the ways of the force when you are thrust into battle against a cult of jedi (outcasts?) who seem to have developed a way to drain force power from the universe.  Your training turns into trial-by-fire as you are sent to investigate this mysterious cult and learn what their plans are.As you are assigned to different missions, you are given a choice of light sabers and various force powers to can add points to.  These include Light powers such as Push, Pull, Protection, and Heal, and Dark powers like Lightning, Grip, Rage, and Drain.  As you complete each mission, your skill levels increase and your force powers increase their effectiveness as a result.  While this is a nice touch, you start to wonder what the purpose of the academy is, considering you're not learning anything there.No matter, the focus of this game is on jedi battles, and that is where this game shines.  We're not just talking one-on-one battles either, but against multiple opponents at times and Jedi Academy really blows the roof off close quarter fighting.  You have multiple fighting styles you can specialize in, such as Fast (to defeat your enemies through sheer speed) or Strong (used to overwhelm an opponent's defenses.)  Your fighting moves vary dramatically depending on which type of saber you select and, most importantly, the battles have the same intensity as they do in the movies.  Blades crashing make the screen explode in color and kills cause a slow motion camera spin around the victim which adds a cinematic effect to the battle.  As you progress through the game, the enemies get much tougher so it pays to learn combinations of force powers you can use with special saber moves.  Simply hacking away at an enemy may work at the beginning, but it'll get you killed later on.The story itself is a little ho-hum, but at least the levels are a treat to look at.  Depending on which mission you select, you'll find yourself battling opponents on Hoth, Corsucant, or Tatooine and you'll even run into some familiar characters from the movies and earlier games.Finally, I run this on a fairly dated 1Ghz Athlon with 512MB Ram and a Geforce2 Ultra without problems at 1024x768.  If you do run into problems, turning the dynamic glow to off, turning the shadows to simple, and turning the anisotropic filter to low or off will give you the most dramatic performance gains.As a quirky side note, it was a programmer at Raven Software who gave the cinematic effects to the now infamous Star Wars Kid video while this game was in development.  While there is no official endorsement I'm aware of, I'm sure Ghyslain would be proud of this game.Hope the review helped.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2003"}

Party games such as Nintendoland and iconic games such as New Super Mario Bros U are usually thought of when you think of the Wii U. Ubisoft decided to change things up with releasing a game that was primarily for adults called ZombiU. But is this a game that can sell the Wii U or will you give it a pass to see if it will come out on other systems?ZombiU puts you right in the middle of a zombie apocalypse in London as it has been foretold for 400 years that a black prophecy will be come to fruition in 2012. And that prophecy has taken place as a zombie outbreak as you are trying to survive and also help find a cure that is rumored to be under buckingham palace.There is a difference between this game and the other games out there as you can get hit in games such as Left 4 Dead or even Resident Evil with no consequences. However in this game once you are bitten by a zombie you will die and become one of them. The game however will put you in the role of a new survivor but you will have to find your previous bug out bag (or BOB for short) which contains all the weapons and items you have collected.This is one of the games that will reward you for being cautious as you cannot survive running blindly into a pack of zombies and hope to survive. If you are patient , careful and a bit paranoid you might be able to survive for awhile but no one would be able to survive forever and eventually you will succumb to the undead horde.The new Wii U controller has more than a few great uses as it not only keeps track of your inventory but you can use it to pick locks / hack doors and if you are lucky to find a sniper rifle it acts as a scope so you can kill some zombies from long range.The only drawback on this game as it looks great to play but it's only available for the Wii U and I am not about to go out and spend $400 just to play one game. I would love to see this game ported over to the PS3 and Xbox 360 as they can handle the graphics with ease.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

That's the problem I have with 90% of new games, they try to be as realistic as possible and that's it. They also worry too much about the story and in game cutscenes that break up the gameplay. You'll be fighting enemies and then the next thing you know, it's a cutscene. This game must have 200 cutscenes, all of which are taking away from the actual gameplay. I don't want to watch a freaking movie, I want to play a game. I thought the first two games did a great job telling the story while still allowing you to play the game. The only games I've seen this gen that were compelling enough to have this many cutscenes was bioshock and the new last of us game which is nothing short of amazing. Another thing I hate about this game is its difficulty. I'm not one to complain about difficulty usually because I love hard games that challenge me, but this one was way to hard even on the medium setting. I don't understand why they did this, but the ai in this game seems to never miss and max can only take a few bullets before he's dead. Idk, maybe I'm not very good, but I beat almost every game I play on hard and this one was tough on medium, so I honestly don't think I would even try hard mode. Now, with that said, I will tell you the two most underrated games in history. The punisher for the ps2 and original xbox is still the greatest third person shooter I've ever played and I can't see anything being better in the future because no developers give a crap anymore about fun. Except for Nintendo that is, but they don't make 3rd or 1st person shooters. The other one is zombiu. It's the greatest zombie game ever and it has great replay value just like the punisher because it has great gameplay and it's scary. Neither one of these games focus on story, the gameplay tells the story and that's how a game should be. You people can do what you want, but if this is the future of games then I'm out, and I'll continue to play the classics from my ps2, ps1, and n64. I'll also continue to play my wiiu because Nintendo obviously feels the same way I do about this. I'll also play the last of us again sometime because it really is amazing.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00309XHD0","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"The Sequel Does Not Measure Up","reviewText":"Dead Space 2 follows the path laid out by Visceral Games surprise hit Dead Space released back in 2008. Dead Space marked an important entry into the survivor-horror genre that by many folks estimation had become somewhat stale. The basic setting of Dead Space on the USG Ishimura, a planet-cracking, mining ship in the far-reaches of the Solar System is a perfect setting for a horror title. Dead Space 2 capitalizes on many of the best elements from the first game, however, Visceral Games focus in the sequel has strayed a bit of course.Dead Space 2 places the player once again in the shoes of Issac Clarke. This time Issac is aboard Titan Station - a colony set on the remains of Saturn's heavily mined moon Titan. Issac is a patient at Titan Station suffering from Dementia after the events that transpired on the Ishimura in the first game. Soon after waking from a sleep Issac finds that things are not well aboard Titan Station. Within moments Necromorphs attack and Issac is in a frenzied run for his life bound in a strait-jacket. Suffice to say the it's clear from the first moments of the game that Visceral has pumped up the action elements in DS2. I'll leave there as to avoid any possible spoilers.Graphics, sound effects, voice-overs are all what you would expect from a top-tier, 'AAA' video game title - in other words, very good. It is evident that EA/Visceral have a strong motivation to make Dead Space a must-own title as production quality is top-notch. The graphic style in DS2 although similar to the first game has it's own cleaner look. Being that Titan Station houses a complex research center in addition to a operational mining base the environments can vary from similar gritty interiors a la those found on DS1's USG Ishimura to much smoother and cleaner lab spaces. All of that is sprinkled with gratuitous doses of enemies and gore of course.Sounds effects are amazing. Playing DS2 on a large HDTV with surround sound and the lights turned off is the way Dead Space was intended to be played! Visceral has done a fantastic job utilizing sound to build the terror factor. Distant moaning, crying and whispers will make the hairs on your neck stand as you creep down a corridor knowing an attack is imminent but unaware from what direction.Gameplay in DS2 is almost identical to the first. That is, a run-and-gun, 3rd person perspective. Unlike Resident Evil 5, Issac need not be stationary to fire his weapons. The only area that has received significant change is the zero-g segments. In DS1 Issac relied on magnetic boots and catapulting himself from one surface to another. In DS2 Issac has complete 360-degree freedom thanks to improvements to his RIG. Now Issac can move freely about a la Iron Man with variable thrusters providing for movement adjustments and rocket boots even allow Issac the ability to quickly traverse zero-g spaces.All the good aside there are some major disappointments with Dead Space 2. First and perhaps most damaging is Visceral's direction for Dead Space 2 - mainly that of an action game first and then a horror element that feels tacked on. From the beginning chapters of DS2 I kept waiting for a story to unfold only to find that it takes many, many hours for anything like a story to be found. In fact the first 5 chapters are spent running from hallway to hallway, blasting away Necromorphs in order to meet a figure named Diana who claims she is on Titan to help Issac. Seriously that's it. I didn't feel a clear direction or story presented itself until much later in the game and by then things are winding down. In the story department I felt DS1 did a much better job keeping a steady pace throughout the adventure.At moments DS2 felt like I was playing a shooting gallery game. Enter a new room/hallway and blast away with the plentiful weapons and ammo. The careful balance of enemies of the first game is gone in favor of an over-the-top swarm of constantly attacking enemies. Because of that the psychological fear factor is greatly diminished in DS2. There were periods that were genuine edge-of-your-seat type moments but that effect quickly wore off in favor of gun-slinging gameplay.Another huge disappointment is the lack of bosses. There are some larger enemies like Brutes, a new enemy called a Tripod and some projectile hurtling space creatures but no true boss battles. Even the last segment of the game is not really a boss battle and ultimately I couldn't believe the game ended on such a whimper. For anyone who played DS1 this has to be a letdown on some level.None of these problems have prevented me from liking DS2. I would even recommend it to a friend. However, this game doesn't measure up to the standard set by the first game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

What I enjoy about the gamecube is the ease of accessing my memory and when I need to delete memory on the memory cards. I know that this console is not as great as the Wii but when this first came out in 2001. It has and had its issues. I've had a couple a problems like for example when I plugged it in it wouldn't start, because I had the Gamecube sitting in a room with too much light coming in it so I unplugged it and took it somewhere where it was a little darker. Also I tend to play my games at night which I hold the belief my system functions better and doesn't have to deal with exposure to light. I love how quiet this system, it makes virtually no noise. Compared to the Wii there about the same but it all depends. I also love some of the accessories that Nintendo made but I will talk about those individually. The model I have is the early 2001 model with the Analog (A/V) and Digital (Component) which I don't use at the moment but might use later down the road which I will be sure to update this review, when I do. I This video game system is awesome so for anyone looking to buy a Gamecube go for it, It's an awesome system also lots of great games to look into. You can check out my reviews for info on games I highly recommend for this system. Also keep in mind on some games that have two discs vs. one disc keep in mind to keep those games especially clean and make sure the system can read them.

The graphics to the game are awesome, and the action is absolutely amazing.  This is one of those games that I am absolutely addicted to and just can not put down no matter how hard I try.  I beat one section, and i'm like, ok ok, i'll stop right after this, and somehow I just have to keep going!In essence the storyline follows the invasion of the Helghast homeworld in which you must invade their planet, destroy their defenses and overthrow their government.Everyone seems to complain about the controls on this game, I did not have any problem with the controls as to me they seemd pretty standard for an FPS.  The game itself is not terribly difficult so veteran gamers should probably crank up the difficulty.  I read some of these reviews claiming that the original Killzone was better than Killzone 2, how this can be I have no idea, when Killzone 1 was pretty sucky... and besides dealing with that damn sniper scope was a nightmare! You have tons of weapons to use, tons of enemies to kill and tons of blood to spill.  I find that the NPCs are almost invincible and that they kind of make the game a little too easy.On the negative side, I do wish their were more wepons and I do wish that there were a bunch of futuristic weapons to choose from or something but perhaps I am spoiled with the choices of Fallout and Borderlands.Aside from that minor complaint I find the gameplay to be amazing, the graphics to be brilliant and smooth and it to be for the most part, glitch free, something that anyone who plays Fallout or Skyrim can certainly appreciate.  I must say, I have no complaints at all about this game and I definately recommend it.  It is fun, its addictive and it keeps you wanting to just keep shooting anything that moves.  Additionally, I find the missions to be far more creative than it predecessor, instead of just get from point A to point B, now you have to not only kill the onslaught of helghast, but you have to sabotage defenses, destroy gun emplacements and dont forget about find and destroy all of the Helghast symbols for a special trophy.Definatly buy this one, you wont be disappointed","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2012"}

But, alas, I did not....Blasphemy?  Heresy!?  Probably.Ni No Kuni is the product of a collaboration between Level 5 (Dark Cloud, Dragon Quest VIII & IX) and Studio Ghibli (Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro) which instantly piqued my interest and legions of anime and RPG fans out there.  How could this go wrong?  It feels so right!Well, the collaboration was a success!  Beautiful art direction, a compelling story, great characters...this game actually has it all.So why the middle of the road rating?  It's a personal preference on my end; I honestly hate the battle system.  After playing hours of Xenoblade, this game and others with a battle system that can't decide between turn-based or real-time combat I have (finally) come to the conclusion that I can't stand this weird amalgamation of real-time/turn-based combat.  Developers gotta make up their minds as to what approach they want  to take as this half way stuff is quite clunky.  It literally made each battle, and especially boss fights, extremely clunky and cumbersome.This, along with the Pokemon-esque monster collection aspect, took the fun right out of the game for me.  I feel like any game that introduces this concept as a core aspect of gameplay is artificially lengthening the game for the sake of 1) catching 'em all, 2) having to grind up monsters with certain abilities in order to even progress through the game.I recently played through Blue Dragon for the first time and was quite pleased with the focus it had in it's battle system.  It knew what it was and proceeded accordingly.  Instantly, I drew comparison between Ni No Kuni and that game.  Despite Blue Dragon having the worse art style, graphics and story, I had more fun with it.That being said, if you can deal (or enjoy) the battle system and dig the monster collection aspect, this game is right up your alley.  For those of us that don't, Ni No Kuni is still worth it for the excellent visuals and touching story but be aware that you may find yourself slogging through the experience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2013"}

It all starts one night when you are about to escort a scientist, and love interest to go talk of the discovery that she thinks will revolutionize augmentations in humans. That's when it goes all wrong and the building comes under attack. You have to fight your way through to try to rescue not only that scientist but many others before it is too late. Not to give too much away, but you're just a bit late and get severely injured. Once you recover, though, you come back wanting to know what exactly happened, and this is where the real game starts.Graphically this game definitely screams next generation (or whatever you want to call the XBOX 360). Sadly its early next gen. There's some wierd kind of overly glossy imaging going on that really grated on my nerves about halfway through the game. There's also the fact that the motions of the characters are jerky and you almost fear that some might be going into a seizure. All the areas that you'll be going through have a faint yellowish tint to them, but I don't think its enough to distract you to the point of not being able to play the game.The music definitely fits the game. It gets you pumped up and also tells you of the mood that the current surroundings is in. If there's trouble, or people are on high alert you get a more intense musical selection. The voice work is outstanding, I did enjoy the script, though there was definitely some stereotyping with certain voices.The controls take a bit to get used to. Trying to focus on aiming your weapon is probably the most difficult part. Aside from the sniper rifle I never really felt comfortable aiming any of the weapons in the game. There was also a slight issue of after you've enhanced your augmentations to run longer or jump higher that the controls really didn't feel like they responded exactly how you would expect them to.So as I stated before you're playing the part of Jensen, and though sometimes he goes through slight voice changes, he's a pretty solid character to play with. You'll have a wide variety of weapons at your disposal, sniper rifle, revolver, shotgun, pistol, rocket launcher, and more. You'll also have to keep an eye out for ammo so that you can use the guns throughout the game. I believe this game is suppose to be more about stealth than combat, at least that's what I hope it is because the aiming and combat just didn't feel right to me. No matter the setting or what types of augementations you have a couple of stray bullets might knock you out for good. Even though sometimes the same amount of bullets in a less armored foe doesn't take them down. There's also the issue of falling, or jumping and missing. If you fall any further than 12 feet, no matter what there's a very good chance that even at full health you will find yourself having to restart from the last checkpoint. Speaking of checkpoints the autosave feature will save at some very strange times and if you didn't manually save soon before you might find yourself loading right into a gun fight over and over again, until be some act of god you find a way to survive the first couple of rounds and fight your way through the area.I will admit I've never played a Deus Ex game before, but with all the hype that people have been giving the series over the years, coupled with the amount of excitement over the fact that the series was coming back, I had to play this game. I found that this was an interesting game, and one I definitely wanted to see through, even with the flaws that sometimes mounted. Would I say that people need to run out and get this game, definitely not, but it is definitely a game to at least put on your must rent list. For me this is yet another game that once through and I'm done, that's why I say rent it. So without delaying much more, I give you my rating of the game, a 6.9 out of 10.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

The game is a good mix for those that are hard core gamers and casual gamers.  However most of the hard core would say it was too easy; but this is a common complaint of all Mario type games.  Controls are good enough that most young players will not have too hard of time sucking up ghosts and Boo's.  The game is typical in length for a Mario franchise, meaning you won't get it done in 10 hours and it is not a Zelda game requiring 80 hours.  Probably safely in the middle of that.

So, its been a while. Starting with BF 3, the franchise started a slow slide into mediocrity. Because of my very lukewarm love of BF 3, I decided to not buy this on release day like I had all prior entries in this franchise. Glad I waited given all the now legendary launch problems, gameplay glitches, and massive patches. I picked this up on sale for $30.The good news is I have played 5 nights straight without any of the glitches or bugs that I have read about. The multiplayer plays as it should. The not so good news is the gameplay is identical to BF 3. It looks the same, plays the same, and for all intents and purposes BF 4 appears identical to BF 3. The campaign is the exact same tired formula you have played in every other modern military shooter. Even on the hardest difficulty setting, I am a bullet sponge. My AI teammates also appear immune to enemy grenades. Of course when I go into McDonalds I expect McDonalds food. But even McDonalds adds some new menu items from time to time to keep things fresh. No such variety in BF 4.I was also disappointed with the graphics. I am not one to overlook gameplay in favor of graphics, but I was really expecting BF4 to pop on the Xbox One. Instead, the MP maps look muddy and muted. It is actually difficult to see at times. I am switching back and forth from this game and the new Wolfenstein - and the latter game's graphics really pop and are impressive on the Xbox One. So, I know it's not just me or my TV. I also googled the issue and saw similar complaints. I point this out only so you don't pop in the disk and expect \"next-gen\" graphics from BF 4. The campaign graphics are a little better than the MP, but they are nothing that will make you go \"wow.\"The other item I have an issue with are the game modes and multiple weapons that are shown as menu items and weapon options but are only available with expansion purchases/premium membership. It leaves the impression that EA has sold me 80% of a game and if I want the remaining 20% I must pay another $50. It's not a consumer-friendly business model, especially after how they have botched and degraded this franchise. Frankly, these \"pay-to-win\" additional weapons and extra game modes/maps should be free to restore some good will from players. EA is crazy if they think customers will flock to the already announced next addition to this franchise.If you decide to try this game, I can't recommend spending a dollar more than the $30 I spent. Better yet, wait for the inevitable drops to $25 or $20, especially if you think you might also purchase the premium content.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2014"}

It's fast paced, unique and very hard to put down. The first thing that will grab you is the style of the game. The graphics are very nicely cel shaded and the music will keep you jamming along nodding your head. The music isn't all golden, but for the most part, it's wonderful.The gameplay is rather simple but very fun. Skate around, find red arrows, spray paint your tag. All the while avoid cops, tear gas, dogs, even missile launching helicopters. It's hard and frustrating at times, but it's oh so worth it. You'll keep coming back for more and more.The game stands up to repeat plays, and the style never wears thin. The story is entertaining and well told by DJ K. Unlike so many games where the story between levels is the dull part, you'll be jamming along with DJ K all the way through. It's quite hard not to be brought into the Jet Set Radio universe. It's very well done.If you still have your Dreamcast around and you never gave this one a shot, try it. You may be quite surprised.- Rirath_com","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2003"}

It is so clear and detailed it almost jumps from the screen in 3D.That said, I LOVE LOVE LOVE this game although I am not a huge RPG fan, but it will not be for everyone. It is NOT a fighting game like Persona 4 Arena. There is a story. There is text reading.What is it about for anyone who has never heard of it? A new student comes to stay in a small Japanese town, and strange murders begin that coincide with the start of a mysterious program that shows up on TV on rainy nights. The bodies turn up upside down on roofs and poles. The student ends up falling into a TV with his new friends and discover that the murdered people were somehow thrown in there and killed. When another student disappears, she appears on the mysterious program and they jump back in to save her. While in the TV, the students meet the dark sides of themselves, called shadows, and if they can defeat them and accept them...they become creatures they can call on to defend them in battle against demon shadows inside. With a giant bear costume...creature, they decide to solve the mystery and find the murderer.What can you expect from the gameplay?It is an RPG game where you roam freely around the world, making friends and social links, taking jobs, attending class, and going into the TV to battle in dungeons. The battle is free roam until you run into a shadow and then you fight in in a turn based RPG battle. NOt tactics, so very easy. PIck a physical or magical attack, heal, boost, or use items. You wake up, go to class, participate in clubs, activities, or hang out, go home, study or work or play...then repeat.What else can you expect?Japanese humor that at times will have you literally laughing out loud. Not many forms of entertainment can accomplish that with me.Actual socializing and talking to other people to accept quests, build friendships, and level up personal knowledge, courage, understanding, and diligence through all of those activities.It has an in depth story, and you may spend time reading and watching cut scenes.Be prepared to spend hours leveling up and passing the days with activities.If you hate reading, this is not for you.If you hate anime, this is not for you.There is quite a bit of loud poppy Japanese music, but it grows on you like a fungus.The humor can border on typical Japanese perversion commonly seen in anime, but if you have a sense of humor, you should be fine.Some of the dubbed voice-acting (Chie!) can be a little shrill, but not a huge deal. There are no Japanese language with subtitle options.If you are still unsure, I suggest watching the trailer, watching a gameplay video of both battle and regular gameplay, and then running out to get the game. I also recommend Persona 3 Ps2 or PSP.I am only about 24 hours of gameplay in, but judging from how fast Persona 3 went by, it will end all too quickly.I cannot speak more highly about this series, just based on the last two entries and both ports, and can't wait for Persona 5!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00020LZAM","description":"Jak 3concludes the Jak and Daxter trilogy with a truly plot-driven adventure game filled with friendship, betrayal, death, and a long-awaited understanding of the Precursor civilization that has, until now, remained a mystery.One year has passed since Jak and Daxter saved Haven City from Kor and the attacking Metal Heads, yet Haven City is still immersed in deadly chaos as three groups fight for control of the streets. The people of Haven City have grown to distrust Jak's dark powers, and as rumors boil of Jak's ties with Krew and Kor, the city blames Jak for its current woeful circumstances. When the palace is destroyed by a surprise Metal Head attack, even Ashelin cannot protect Jak as the High Council's power broker, Count Veger, forces Jak into banishment to the desolate Wasteland. Jak is flown to the harsh island and dumped. With Daxter and Pecker bravely by his side, the three begin their next adventure where the battle for the city has just begun.Five times the size of Haven City, the Wasteland is a desert environment with multiple areas including mines and a volcano. Given the enormity and variance in terrain, vehicles play a large role as off-road transportation is introduced, fueled by a true-to-life physics engine. With a rugged new look and suited with armor, Jak is also equipped with an arsenal of new weapons with upgradeable mods that enable players to increase their firepower and enjoy the freedom to strategize and activate their arsenal at any time.As Jak has been exposed to Light Eco, players can now experience Jak's magnificent transformation to Light Jak. With a glowing electric blue aura and a massive wing span, Light Jak introduces new move sets, including the ability to glide great distances, emit an energy to block enemy attack, and power up at anytime, all of which provide the player with a sense of being invincible. Dark Jak also returns with more capabilities, forcing Jak to find a balance between light and dark.Additionally, game developer Naughty Dog continues to push the genre forward with the introduction of new technology. For the first time in the franchise, enemies feature realistic ragdoll physics, which will allow gamers to witness a unique death for each enemy that is killed. Naughty Dog has also implemented independent cloth movement technology and enhanced the enemy artificial intelligence (AI) with wall climbing and smart formation capabilities.","reviewerName":"Robert Evans \"Robert\"","summary":"A fitting ending to one of the best Ps2 series ever","reviewText":"Jak3 continues the story of our buddy Jak and Daxter.  This around Jak has bin betrayed and abandoned from Haven City for having more Metal heads coming back.  I mean..HE SAVED THE WORLD GIVE THE GUY SOME CREDIT WILL YA!  The game pretty much gives you a new, new weapons, new weapon upgrade and a new Jak.  Daxter is more playable in this one too unlike Jak 2.  Now let's get one thing straight...This is a very awesome and underrated game but it's getting ignored by games like Halo and GTA.  This has an awesome story even close to Zelda series.  The characters are very memorable and all in all...it's a very great game..The visuals are fantastic eventhough a bit glitchy.  The visuals for the characters and cutscenes are very cartoony and breathtaking especially when you play the racing mission.  But the choppy visuals arn't as good as Jak 2's Choppy visuals mainly cause there was less choppeyness in it.  Besides the visuals the voice casting is superb, even though Keira's voiced is changed and you don't here her talk that much.  The missions are just as good IF NOT better then Jak2's mission.  Some new elements have bin added like gun mods for each of you weapon and they'll be highly worth it.The New Dark and Light Jak elements are even better then ever, especially how when youre in light jak mode you can freez time, and you can even fly!  Yup.  There even more new Dark Jak abilities that I won't spoil.  The game isn't as hard as Jak2...meaning..you won't die as much as you did in Jak2, not to mention it isn't as long as Jak 2 which is a big dissapointment.  The Missions are absolutely amazing as I have said before but the creators could have added a bit more, not to mention the big \"CONCLUSION\" they slap at you at the end of the game.  You will be either happy with the end or semi-happy like me or you'll literaly break your ps2 for such a wierd ending...sadly This is ND's last Jak game so there just gonna leave us hanging....Overall...It's an amazing series as a whole...Good-sweet Visuals-New weapon mods are great-Awesome Missions-Haven City is more corrupted then ever-Some very memerable missions-More Dax parts in the game-New Dark Jak Light Jak abilitiesBad-The choppy visuals get annoying-Some of the missions kinna seem the same-More driving in the game then any of the other things you can do-Not as a hard but still a bit frustraiting in some missions-This game is just TOO SHORT.  I beat it in 12 hours, Jak 2 took me about 23 hours.  Big difference-The Ending will make a few angry-... :( The last Jak game...sigh..Overall Jak is the best cause it has everything that Jak 2 has but less of it and adds new stuff, but ruined by the ending AND the short game itself.  Still Jak 3 is a great game, great visuals, great characters, awesome memerable weapons and is overall...a great game and should be in your PS2 collection and that is why I'm giving it a4.4 out of 5By the way this is to a \"KIDS REVIEW\" can you stop overreviewing this game?!

A year later, Electronic Arts released enhanced versions of the same title for the PS3 (The Don's Edition) and the Wii (Blackhand Edition.)The Godfather: Blackhand Edition is based on the classic movie, The Godfather and pretty much covers it in every sense of the word throughout the game itself. Set in New York during the 1920's, you control an up and coming kid working his way up through the Mafia in the hopes of someday being the Don of New York in the criminal underworld.The Grand Theft Auto series set the standards of the open world game play and thereby this game essentially borrows all the good things with regards to presentation, sound and visual effects and music. There's lots to do in this game with various missions, warehouses to raid, businesses to extort and rival gangs to take out in the name of the family you belong to. You can customize your characters with different clothing items and even detail your character's face and body build. When you complete various missions, you earn character points to fill out categories affecting your strength, performance and speed. And since money is a major factor in this game, having lots of it lets up buy cars, clothes, property and bribe cops in various neighborhoods. Why do that? Because if you bribe cops enough, they won't go after you when you commit crimes and they even go after people who give you a hard time. When your rank goes up, you unlock abilities like weapons and gang support to help you on missions. The list of things to unlock and discover keeps going and going....With the enhanced version, you get more missions, perks and rewards and more gangs to take out and more warehouses to raid not found in the Xbox360 version. If you love playing the GTA games as well as Bully and Scarface: The World Is Yours, then this game is for you. Outside of the occasional game glitch and camera mishaps, this is a fun game for the older, gaming crowd. It's rated M for a reason so parents, don't let your little ones play this game.

Yes it was one of the few games that pushed the Xbox beyond its limits but now that the Instincts games are on 360 there's not much of an upgrade. Predator, in terms of visuals, is just a slight upgrade from the Xbox versions. It seems Ubisoft just added a bit of bump mapping here and there and that's it. Instincts seems very realistic and the guerrilla warfare was implemented really well here except when you get half way it falls apart and becomes your typical run-n-gun shooter.I rented this and I just stopped playing about 75% through the Instincts story since Evolution was just the same but with the second part of the story and slightly better visuals. The story isn't anything really special here either and it's kind of messy and hard to follow. The main attraction to Instincts though is the Feral Senses which gives you super human strength and the ability to see in the dark and sense smells. While these are great and all they don't make the game much better. You can set traps on trees and plant claymore mines which is also why the stealth in this game is just so awesome.The best part about this game though is the multiplayer. I never got a chance to try it but if it's anything like the PC version then it would be wonderful. You can make your own maps and everything and that's a big plus but it doesn't hinder the fact that this game feels too much from 2003.

The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate.

{"product_name":"B0047TG2R0","description":"","reviewerName":"nathaniel furedi","summary":"Not as great as Dragon Age - Origins","reviewText":"I rated this game at 4 stars originally. Now after playing for over 30 hours with the same map after map after map I'm dropping the rateing to 3 stars. Seriously besides the main city maps there are maby 10 maps in the whole game that are coppied over and over for every side quest. I'm basing my rateing not only on the game but I feel that Dragon Age 2 should have been improved over Dragon Age Origins. Not only in game mechanics but with improved story line and characters which they did not do or even come close to. to me the developers have lowed the quality of the Dragon Age franchise.THERE ARE MABY 30 MAPS IN THIS WHOLE GAME THAT THEY USE OVER AND OVER. NOW THINK OF DOING 1,000 QUESTS AND ALL OF THEM USE THOSE 30 MAPS.So far Dragon Age2 is like playing a low budget hack and slash Mass Effect 2And is just me or do the Shade Demons look almost like the Geth in ME? With the light coming out of the front of their faces?Pros :(1)Voices and audio care crisp and clear.(2)The main charector has a voice now but I would have liked to have been able to pick the voice like in DA-O(3)Graphics are modern. Same as ME2(4)The Sustained skills now remain active even when changing maps which I think is a great change they made. So you don't have to reactivate them everytime the map changes.(5)They brought back some of the characters from DA-O which is nice to see. Awsome story line with Justice :)(6)Your hound is now an ingame skill summon instead of a companionNot the best RPG game I've ever played but I still think it is worth 3 stars and $60.00 because of the time your able to play and an ok story.Cons:(1)They took out the Pickpocketing.(2)You can't CHANGE your other party members armor.(3)They don't let you import you previous char from DragonAge Origins. The only thing the import does is choose your beging story(4)They took away the race's you can choose for your charector. You can only be Human male/female(5)You don't get the same feeling of companionship with your followers in DA-2 as you did in DA-O. There is no warmth or feeling when you open a conversation up with them.(6)There seems to be alot more running around in this game.(7)They use the exact same maps for alot of the side quests sadly which makes the quests somewhat boring. The same maps are used constantly and I am starting to dread having to do side quests.(8)The Skill Tree is a joke. Whoever designed it should be shot. Each one is a big circle and it doesnt matter pretty much which skill you want becuase they make you choose pretty much every skill in it in order to upgrade or unlock better skills.Example: There are normally 4-6 main skills in a tree. In order to get an upgrade for the skill or choose a higher skill it says you have to have 5 points in that skill tree . Which means you have to put 5 points into the skills or other upgrades in that skill tree before you can get the upgrade for the skill you want.The games feels like im playing a hack and slash game like Final Fantasy 7 Crisis Core","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0047TG2R0","description":"","reviewerName":"Spence","summary":"Great, if it's what you like...","reviewText":"This game is going to cause quite a bit of controversy for RPG fans. Before I get into it, I'll just let you know what old school, turn based, stat heavy RPG's really arent't my thing. I enjoy the occassional one, but generally these games aren't viscerally exciting enough for me to really get into and play through to the end. I did however, really enjoy the first Dragon Age title and its subsequent expansions. Mass Effect 2 is my favorite game ever, and I'm a big Bioware fanboy.For Dragon Age 2, Bioware decided to make some \"improvements\" to the game. Some of these really are improvements, some turn out not to be, but the way you feel about them depends on what type of player you are.COMBAT: The biggest change is that rather than hitting \"A\" once and letting your character have at it until the enemy is toast is now gone. The combat in this game requires a button press for every attack, similar to a standard 3rd person action game. I personally enjoyed this, as it gave a lot of flexibility. For instance, if you are surrounded, you can direct every attack in the direction of the opponent you want to direct it to. This makes for some really dizzying and impressive combat if you play as a rogue. You'll be flying around the battlefield decimating everything in your wake at ridiculous speeds while maintaining complete control of what your character is doing. The way spells and talents work is not change at all. You select them from a radial menu or attach them to a hotkey on the controller, activate them, and go. The combat isn't hugely different, but it is much more action focused and a lot less strategy is required, though it's there if you want it.INVENTORY/LOOT: Here's something I have a big problem with. Hawke, your character, is the only one able to equip different types of armor, which means your party members will always look the same. This is irritating yet bareable as their costumes are very good and fitting of their stories. Where this becomes a problem is that you will still pick up TONS of loot, and 75% of it goes to waste. It's all well and good finding mage armor that boosts your mana, but if you're playing a warrior you can't do anything with it but sell it. Your inventory fills up quick, and the customization level is really not on level with DA:O.ROLE PLAYING: Here is where people will disagree, as most of the changes Bioware made also have a trade off. For instance, you now have a fully voiced character a-la Shepherd in Mass Effect. This does a lot more for getting you emotionally involved in the story. The trade off is that you can only choose male/female human and you will have a set backstory. All of those cool different Origins from the first game are totally out the window. Now that your character is voiced, you use a conversation wheel to talk. Very cool, except you don't ever know exactly what Hawke will say. Sometimes the result is not what you necessarily wanted it to be, whereas in the first game you knew exactly what the other characters would hear. What I did like was the high level of interactivity with the companion characters and how developed they are. Each of them has a great backstoruy and interesting things going on. Your relationship will grow organically, and you will grow to love and maybe even hate the people that you are with. Great stuff.SETTING: I can't even fathom anybody that would not consider this a step back. Kirkwall. That's it. One city. In the first game, you can travel all of Ferelden. In this game, you are stuck in a relatively bland city and go to the same locations over and over again. Everytime you go to a cave or warehouse or mansion, it's the same exact layout. It's very frustrating, but the story is compelling enough to make it not ruin the game. Speaking of which...STORY: The story here is much more focused and personal. Instead of a blight coming to wipe out the world as we know it, you're dealing mainly with Hawke's family and friends and the politics of Kirkwall. I enjoyed it, as I like to really get emotionally involved with the characters, but going to a smaller scale might disappoint some people. The story has some great twists, many decisions that can have huge consequences, and lasts for a good 40 hours at the least.So overall, it's going to be split down the middle. I found that some of these improvements were really great, and some not so much. It's still one of the best games I've played in a long time. What I'd say is remove your expectations and enjoy it for what it is. When you eventually become the Champion, you'll be glad you took the journey.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0016NRS8M","reviewerName":"S. Griffith","summary":"Great game, worth every cent","reviewText":"I was Ok with the first one, so I did not have either bias, or high expectations. But TW2 demonstrates that the devs can make a very good game if they put enough effort. This game is not really similar to TW1. Not a real open world RPG (you travel through the islands, and unlock different areas according to the story), but in this case it is more of a virtue then a vice. The main story is interesting, to say the least, and a lot of side quests can take a lot of time to finish. They vary greatly, and a lot of them are really good.The environments are beautiful. This game is set not as much in purely fantasy settings. Savannah area is made in Ancient Egypt settings, with wildly beatufil temples,  tombs, and catacombs. The second island is very medieval Japan-like, truly beautiful. Also it is obvuius that the devs used a lot of elements from other games. The swallows area is similar to the Valley of Defilement from Demon's Souls, and Tir Geal area - to the swamps in The Witcher. The end result in TW2 is superb, very atmospheric.Magic, crafting and alchemy systems are unique, and really cool. Battles are challenging enough, and appearances of monsters and their variety is praiseworthy. Horseriding is fun, and not as difficult as in TW1. Overall, I am extremely glad i bought this game.

It is completely addictive, fun, and even raises your intelligence!OK I can't be exactly sure about that last one, but I do a lot of research on how to keep your mind sharp and alert, and this game is PERFECT for just about everything they say. In essence, this game includes a TON of minigames and you are never given instructions for what to do. At most you get one or two words to give you a hint - like \"push\" or \"shoot\". Then you have only a tiny amount of time to look at what is shown to you and figure out how to play the game. Talk about testing your grey cells!The amazing part of this game is that the unit has a motion sensor in it. You turn the actual gameboy unit, and the game reacts. Some games involve spinning - a skater moves out onto the ice and you give the unit a quick \"whip\" to get her spinning like a top. Some games involve pushing a button, to fire an arrow for example. Many games involve spinning AND pushing, like when you turn the system to point to a given sushi piece and hit the button to eat it.The collection of games is just amazing. You unlock them as you go. Each game has multiple levels, so as you move on in difficulty, the games get harder and harder. There is HUGE fun in replaying the games, and they get incredibly quick and tricky near the end of the game.In addition to all the fun games, there are a ton of special items to unlock - from toys to more mini-games, from random accessories to silly gadgets.There's even a set of mini Nintendo games, like Zelda, complete with the theme music! It's really quite fun. If you really like a particular mini-game, you can go back and replay just that mini-game as much as you wish.Every person I've shown this to - from kid to aged adult - has LOVED the game.

Once you get used to the blocking the game is a cakewalk from there.EDIT #2: I see the price has come down quite a bit, at the time of the writing the game was $59.99, It's now $39, now that's a good price and the price it should have been when it first came to PS3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2009"}

Along the way, you can check your brain age by doing three randomly picked (out of 5 or 6) tests.The daily training involves a total of 9 exercises, 3 of which are available at the beginning.  As you progress, you unlock more exercises (as well as different difficulty levels for some).  Some of these exercises are really boring, like doing simple arithmetic calculations.

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

When DOOM was first released in 1993, IT was the game that displayed gaming evolution. DOOM 1 offered what no other game has at it's past time; a whole new atmosphere to interact in. It set the new standards for FPS gaming and GAMING. But compared to today's standards, it looks like a ant compared to mike tyson, 2x worse.Let's just put it in those terms. Doom 3 will not only put you in pre-rendered CG PIXAR quality graphics with amazing realistic sound effects, having you not notice the difference between reality and video gaming, including mp and sp modes, it'll put you in amazing game play atmosphere that will begin a new era of gaming. Not the third party* era of gaming, NO, the fourth party era of gaming. Expect Doom 3 to show up at E3 once again soon and be released on March 1rst, 2004. Yes, a little far aways from now. Doom 3 WILL be a very demanding game though. In may 2002, when it was previewed, it was said it would require at least a geforce 3 with a 1ghz p3 or equivelant processor with lots of RAM and more. It sounds huge. It seems like your at least gonna need a beefy fairly-state of the art system(WinXP Pro, P4 2.8-3.06ghz+, 512-1gb of ram!, DirectX9a, NVIDIA GeForce FX 5800 ULTRA or ATI Radeon 9700, Sound Blaster Audigy 2, a huge hard drive, etc...)to turn on all the fancy-prancy visuals and other effects that add amazing depth and realism to gaming. Multiplayer will be seen in a whole new way. The beyond-revolutionary light and shadow will be actually put to use in doom 3, as it was in splinter cell, just looking at a much higher quality and more realistic and a lot more use of it. The shadows look so freagin' realistic, your gonna need at least a top of the line graphics card to enable real-time shadows in doom 3. Lightning also looks very realistic. And more. All I gotta say it come with a prepared system and cross your fingers when you install doom 3 to gain the ultimate without lurching foward into a universe of video gaming.

As you progress, the enemies and puzzles get harder and more complex. There's usually a twist that helps set each game apart. \"The Wind Waker,\" for example, looks like a living, breathing cartoon and takes place in a vast ocean populated with islands to sail between and explore. The twist with \"Twilight Princess\" is that much of the game takes place in the Twilight Realm, with you playing as a wolf. It's also a bit of a throwback to \"Ocarina of Time\" on the Nintendo 64. What I love about \"Twilight Princess\" is the darker themes and atmosphere of the world (especially when in Twilight), the more mature look of Link and Princess Zelda, and the pacing of the adventure from one moment to the next. The dungeon and world design is fantastic, expertly detailed and including ingenious secrets. One thing that's surprising is how the motion controls of the Wii are able to win over someone like myself, who's not the biggest fan of motion gaming, by not being too intrusive. \"Twilight Princess\" is a game whose pieces perfectly add up to a remarkably great adventure.--- 5 STARS ---","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2014"}
{"product_name":"B003O6EAM6","description":"","reviewerName":"Don Squeek \"Don Squeek\"","summary":"EA Season Ticket Holder Review","reviewText":"So I was able to get my hands on Madden last Friday as part of the EA Season Ticket promotion going on. For those of you who don't know you can get access to all EA titles 3 days early for 20 bucks. There are some other benefits but they aren't worth mentioning. I personally figured the 20 dollar amazon credit was worth buying EA Season ticket since I also get NHL, FIFA and NCAA Football next year early as well. So with that out of the way on to the Review.GAME MODE IMPROVEMENTS:Franchise Mode: So nice improvements here. The improvements aren't as great as EA would like you to believe but they are there. CUT DAYS 75 man rosters to start each season. IT makes you want to play the pre-season to see if you have any Diamonds in the rough. Basically every year in franchise mode at the end of the off season your team will be filled with \"walk on\" players to fill out your roster at 75. ITs a nice feature but doesn't really change that much gameplay wise because you still start the regular season with the same amount of players that you did in all previous maddens. The only reason this system works is because your walk on players attributes aren't available to you until you play them in preseason games and practice. These walks on will have 99? Overall ratings until you play them and find out how crappy they really are. That 99? QB you have on your roster is probably a 67 just a heads up don't get too excited.The New Franchise Feature I liked the best was the new FA Bidding system: This is totally revamped. Instead of going through a free agent list at the end of the year and picking the best players you want, every player has a timer. The timer starts once a team has \"Bidded\" on a player. It's now nearly impossible to get all the best free agents every year because you really have to watch each player's timer and bid accordingly. *MY tip, bid once on a player to get the timer started then let the timer run to 2 seconds and bid again to win the player* By far the best new feature in Madden.*NCAA OWNERS NOTE* If you import your draft classes into madden you can scout the players now before the draft. You can also scout players without importing them but if you have NCAA and haven't finished more then a season or two I recommend simming just to get the real draft classes. The scouting itself is rather basic. You pick 15 players every 4 or 5 weeks and a few stats become available. By the end of the season you have 4 or maybe 5 players that have all their stats unlocked for the draft. Its rather unrealistic but if you do some research as to where you are going to get stuck drafting and what players will be available you can find out how good your first or second round pick is going to be before drafting them.BE a PRO MODE: There are some nice little additions this year. For one you can create a player and walk on to any team you want instead of being drafted to a team you never wanted to play for. (Really who wants to play for the Panthers? )  However if you import a player from NCAA 12 you cannot choose this option you have to be drafted. The good news is this year you can demand a trade to a specific team. Essentially this is the first Madden BE a Pro where you can pick your team in all situations.This year you also get to improve your player yourself. Like NCAA 12 you gain \"XP / Skill\" points after every practice and game. While it's nice to customize your character the way you want him, after 4 seasons (AT MOST) you will have all 100 ratings. You receive too many skill points per game and practice.GamePlay: The new tackling system looks great. There are defiantly less WTF moments playing this year's madden. CB still making amazing interceptions without looking at the ball but it happens far less these days. The best new gameplay feature is defiantly the new GAMEFLOW feature from last year. This year it lets you pick between pass, run or strategic each down. So instead of being 3rd and 5 and being forced a run play down your throat you can tell GAMEFLOW to give you a pass play. Game flow itself helps speed up the game and now being able to pick pass or run makes it worth using. I found the presentations to be as repetitive as years past. After your first season you can go ahead and play madden with MUTE on for the rest of the year.There are some little additions this year I'm leaving out but really aren't worth mentioning. Player ROLES are included, they essentially give you reason not to be mad when all of the sudden a RB breaks 15 tackles in a row. You can blame it on the fact his \"player role\" allows him BEAST MODE... Or when a CB jumps ten feet to the right while not looking, makes an interception and returns it for a TD you can blame it on his \"Ball skills\" Player Role. Hot and Cold streaks were taken from NCAA and effect the game a little while playing on Madden Difficulty but on all-pro or pro it's not noticeable. The awkward audible/hot route system using the directional pad is back. I hate this, especially after playing NCAA for a month straight.The only feature I can't review as of this date is the Ultimate Card team online game since it was not available for EA season ticket people.All in All this is the year to BUY Madden. If you have skipped out the last couple of years there have been enough improvements I can recommend getting this game and you will get your money worth. I personally think Madden has finally caught up to NCAA in terms of gameplay and franchise/be a pro features. While playing this year I finally got the feeling that this is as good as it going to get for us football fans until the next generation of systems come out. Is it the best game in the world? No, but will you get 60 dollars or entertainment out of it. No Doubt if you're a football fan.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002GPPPS4","description":"","reviewerName":"There's No Stopping Space Vikings T. Edwards!","summary":"Good","reviewText":"Graphics:Opening with some cut-scenes as many games do, I was slightly disappointed with the graphics. While for the most part they were beautiful, great scenery and fine details, there is a sub-par looking rendering of water, hair, cloth, and facial definition that took it down a couple of pegs. After putting several hours in with the game though I was greatly pleased to find that the actual gameplay is gorgeous. The environments are rich and imaginative, comparisons to Guillermo del Toro's Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth have been mentioned periodically to which I'd agree.  For the most part many of the areas fit the feel of Castlevania despite a couple of stinkers, but if you took the more traditional Castlevania castle and simply spread its locations around then the better half of the game feels appropriate.Sound:Lords of Shadow has been knocked here and there for not feeling much like Castlevania, a sentiment I don't personally share at large, but I'd so far have to agree with in regards to the score.The music is, as far as I can tell, high quality orchestrated music.  My personal 'problem' lies in what I feel is a failure to maintain the heart of what Castlevania music was. There were no cheesy electric guitar symphonies, no eerie choir, and really not a lot of blood boiling music.  The music never once stood up and demanded attention. There are most certainly songs recycled from the past but they have been re-tooled to what I would call a more generic sound. This will probably go both ways for fans of the series, some may appreciate the progression of the music, and others may find themselves waxing poetic about the good ol' days along with me.The voice acting is good; you get typical Patrick Stewart along with some serviceable performances from everybody else. Generally you're only going to be dealing with it in cut-scenes and I think the storytelling there is good enough. Again I think the not-quite-right character models mar the delivery more than the actors themselves. There is however sporadic occurrences of NPCs nagging you through the levels which can be nerve grating when all you're trying to do is explore.General:The game unfolds in chapters and stages. Individual levels present themselves in different ways, some are longer combat areas, and some are really short with only a boss fight, and so on. Each individual level has a completion percentage which can ultimately be maxed out by playing the level on max difficulty, finding all of the hidden objects (which is tracked, nice), and completing a trial for that level. Out of the gate you can access 3/4 visible difficulties (don't know if there's any 'secret' difficulty) and switch them on the fly so as you progress and backtrack you can flesh out some of that completion if that tickles your fancy.It took me roughly 15 hours to beat the game on normal with relatively minimal backtracking.  I'd say I skipped probably  - 1/3 of various unlockables and skipped over the challenges entirely.  I'm thinking I probably have 5-10 hours more of gameplay to get the missed items and probably much more than that in challenges.  The game has its hairy moments on normal but a person looking for a challenge could probably start off on Knight difficulty without too much added frustration.The camera can be highly problematic at times.  Nine times out of ten it's going to be fine but in the one time when it isn't the frustration can be high.  Some of the more minor things are a constant jitter to the camera and a poor correction to the analog controls as you switch areas but the single most irritating to me were enemies hanging out of your field of view.  The enemies being out of view typically wasn't a problem but there were a couple of boss fights which forced me to play conservatively because of the camera which kind of took my head out of the fight.  It's not game breaking, and turning on enemy life bars helps a lot, but it's certainly what I'd call a problem with the game.Achieves/trophies aren't too crazy, basically finish the game 100% (or 110% as the games suggests). I personally have no desire to play on higher difficulties unless I uncover some incentive for doing so but it looks like even a normal play should be able to get the majority of them.Combat:The core of the combat is Gabriel's weapon, the combat cross which I'm just going to call a whip. With your whip you have direct attacks mapped to a button and area attacks to another which you can string together in various ways as you unlock combos to execute... er combos. It's very straight forward, a little button-mashy, but since the two attack types perform in very different situations you'll generally be methodically timing one or the other. Many of the combos manifest themselves in a situational sense such as direct attacking after a grab, charging an area attack, and so on. I feel this contributes greatly to avoiding an indiscriminate faceroll of the controller since most combos have a pretty particular use and using it is mainly a matter of timing and positioning.In addition to Gabriel's whip you have secondary weapons and magic. All of the secondary weapons have a primary function but can also unlock additional abilities and combos. The magic is used sort of like combat states; you can hop in and out of light mode or dark mode provided you have enough energy to use attacks while in either. In their raw form light mode causes your attacks to heal you and dark mode causes your attacks to do more damage but their use doesn't end there. Each school has its own unlockable skills, which are quite powerful, but they can also be combined with certain secondary weapons. As an example you get fairies as a sub-weapon which serve as a distraction tool but when used in light magic mode they become seeking kamikaze fairies. The secondary weapons have limited uses and require occasional replenishment from kills and the environment. Your magical energy is replenished either from kills, fighting well and filling out your focus meter, or refilling at neutral energy wells.  It's also worth noting that you can over-charge your magic up to an additional full bar but this bar will deplete itself over time regardless of whether you use it or not.In addition to the magic and sub-weapons Gabriel gets a small handful of additional relics.  Some of these also serve as weapons or lend more combat abilities but they have more nuanced uses and can be a little difficult to effectively use in combat at times.  They generally grant you some very cool moves but I personally found it difficult to find much reason to use them over the whip but it was nice to have them available for situational opportunity.Certain enemies also open up opportunities when weak to execute them via a simple button sequence while others can be ridden which is generally a progression tool. Riding a troll for example will let you smash walls, and you can certainly fight with it, but you're pretty caged in with the creatures you're allowed to ride making them have limited use as a mount. It's fun, it's there, but as I said it's mostly used as a tool to access new areas.Platforming:It's about what you'd expect I guess, lots of climbing and swinging. To me it feels mostly like a segue from one combat to another, which is fine because finding your way around is fun, but there doesn't really seem to be a lot of danger in doing it which adds to a sense of going through the motions. So far the majority of my failures in getting around have been to poorly defined barriers of where you can go or jumping in a pit because I didn't see a really obvious exit. Failing in the platforming isn't instant death, you just respawn at the last solid point you were on and take a bit of damage.  Only if you repeatedly fail or find yourself low on life already will you actually die from a failed jump.Periodically you will be fighting titans which are really big bosses done Shadow of the Colossus style. You enter these fights and you're tasked with scaling the creature and attacking specific weak points. One could almost consider the platforming before these guys to be practice of sorts. You'll be using all of your jumping/swinging/climbing skills in conjunction with quick time events to methodically disable the titan as you traverse its body. It's quite a bit of fun but again it feels more like a game of memory and less like there's any real risk of dying.Story:It wasn't New York Times Best Seller material but I was certainly engaged from start to finish and towards the end my desire to unfold the next chapter ramped up so I'd call it a success.  The ending wasn't what I expected at all, and I'm still gathering my opinions on how I feel about it, but it will certainly have Castlevania fans talking I believe.  Be sure watch through the credits (assuming there's an option to skip).Pros:Gorgeous gameplayGood voice actingFun to playCons:The camera can be weird at timesIn closing I'm a big fan of Castlevania and I enjoyed the game a lot.  It's a genre that doesn't find its way in to my house much but I had a blast playing this.  If you're coming in to this game after having played the numerous similar games to come out this year it may be prudent to find a more discerning opinion on how this compares to other games in the genre but I assure you this was a very well done and fun game right out of the gate.  I'd strongly recommend this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2010"}
{"product_name":"B007UM59L6","description":"","reviewerName":"GintaxAlvissforever","summary":"Another Game That Proves Capcom and Ninja Theory Can't Do Anything Right","reviewText":"I love how people love to forget the faults of this game that has been a controversy for 3 years now. This game is up there with Sonic 06, Street Fighter X Tekken, Metroid:3 Other M and Ninja Gaiden 3 in terms of failing to impress anyone. I'll just make a list.Gameplay: The game is dumbed down for casuals to play. No matter what Capcaom says, this game was not made for the hardcore players. The game is too easy even on the hardest difficulty, and the game holds your hand all the way through. Triple SSS is easily obtained with just spamming the same move repeatedly (most specifically the axe which is already an overpowered level able to kill most bosses in a couple of hits). You can no longer lock on and that is bad for a game like this. Yes there are fewer enemies but without a lock on, you just attack the direction Dino (I refuse to call him Dante as I'll explain later) is facing. The enemy AI is very bad and only stands idle and almost never attacks Dino and when they do, they only attack one at a time. The game only goes at 30 FPS MAXIMUM (but the PC is 60 FPS which basically means if you get the PS3 or X-Box version, you got screwed over in terms of quality) and tends to drop lower when you're trying to play this game like DMC3 or DMC4. There are so many glitches in this game that it's laughable with the flying glitch being most memorable and you're able to skip entire levels because of said glitch. Other glitches in the game makes some bosses invincible, freeze at random moments when it shouldn't or turn your screen white to where you have to hard reset your system. This is unacceptable for any game to have so many glitches. The fact that the \"journalists\" either skip it or bash DMC4 for glitches that were not this terrible is deplorable. The gameplay ends up ripping off of many games such as Bayonetta (who Tameem said was too \"Japanesey\", Dark Siders, Spider Man, Batman and Alice Madness Returns. The list goes on and on but this game is just Heavenly Sword 2.0.Story: The story was supposed to be \"Breaking myths that could rival movies\" according to Tameem and according to the fans of this game, the story was more important than the gameplay. The story not only fails to break myths but the story is cliche and original ripping off of the movie They Live. Someone even pointed out that this game rips of of the two animes X/1999 and Panty and Stocking With Garterbelt (which is ironic given Tameem shows his dislike to anything that is Japanese). The story is supposed to be dark and edgy but because of trying to appeal to the hard core fans, they make it narmish from beginning to the end with very bad dialogue that would make anyone point and laugh saying it's not Shakespearean (the boss battle with Poison (which the entire reference is taken from Futurama) and Dino and Vergin's \"fight\" is a good example of \"good\" dialogue). Which is another thing. There is too much swearing. There is no problem with it but swearing does not make a game dark and edgy. It's like a 3rd grader learning to curse and then using it on everyone. Plus, there is one scene in the game that is arguably offensive and not only is its bad writing but its unnecessary, destroys an established character's personalty and comes off as sexist. The ending was just horrible and left it opened for a game that isn't going to get a sequel because at the end of the day, nothing was accomplished in this game.Characters: Besides Phenneas (a one-shot character used for a plot device) and arguably Bob (who is just a parody of Bill O Reilly) all the characters are poorly written or destroyed an established character from the original. Dante who while was a jerk had a heart of gold and didn't take things seriously to hide the pain inside, Dino comes off as a punk who doesn't care about anything. If he says he cares, it's a lie given how his actions speak louder than words. He's just obnoxious and the guy you want to punch in the face for being a jerk. Kat is just a relationship sue whose only purpose is getting captured and being the love interest for Dino (and Dante didn't even need a love interest in the other games). She's such a wasted character but what do you expect from ammeter writers? Vergin was destroyed along with Dino. He was a man with honor and now he has no honor doing things behind the scenes and using guns instead of swords. The boss battle with him is just a dumbed down version of DMC3 given he never used his sword in battle and wasn't even threatening toward Dino through the entire game and the betrayal came out of nowhere with no foreshadowing whatsoever given it was supposed to appeal to the original fanbase. Mundus is just...a banker now who will control the world through debt...yeah...the original Mundus would have just killed everyone since he was already dead. Sparda who was a legend is now just an unimportant character who was too weak to stop Mundus and Eva was changed to an angel. Which is another thing. The game never brings up the half angel/half demon thing and when it is, it contradicts itself. A Nephillem is a half angel/half human in true terms but in this game, they insist its half angel/half demon. Which doesn't make any sense. There are no angels in the game except Eva who is brought up a few times and that's it. Angels aren't doing anything when demons are in control so there is no point for them to even be brought up. A half angel/half demon is almost ALWAYS a Mary/Gary Sue when used incorrectly and this game just proves it as they're the only ones who can kill Mundus apparently. This also destroys something about Dino. He has NO reason to help humanity if he has no ties with the humans. They treat him like crap anyway so why help them? Kat doesn't count since she's just the token love interest. At the end, Dino still doesn't care about humanity.PR: The worse part of the game is how Capcom and Ninja Theory handled this game. BOTH sides (the pros and antis) are to blame for the fighting but the developers are worse BECAUSE THEY ALLOWED THE FIGHTING TO KEEP GOING TO THIS DAY. They even encourage the fighting and stated that bad publicity is better than no publicity. It didn't get them anywhere because gamers spoke with their wallet and didn't buy the game and their reaction is to blame the very people they insulted for the game's failure. This all could have been avoided if Tameem kept his mouth shut. Now this game will be known as the laughing stock of video game history no matter what \"journalists\" say. This game has destroyed a fanbase similar to how Other M destroyed the Metroid fanbase and Sonic 06 breaking the fanbase never to return. If Capcom just listened to the fans instead of reaching out to the casuals who didn't buy the game anyway (they bought Animal Crossing New Leaf in Japan), then things would have been different, but if things were calmer, then this game would have been like any other Ninja Theory game.Gets high reviews, fails to get 1 million copies sold, Ninja Theory blames someone and then the game is forgotten, but not this one because of the controversy. I doubt NT will be handling a big game again if companies want to make more money.The lesson of today kids? The golden rule. Treat people how you want to be treated, That will at least earn you sales, but it still wouldn't change how bad the game is.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2013"}

There are five different types of challenges, appropriate for all ages and challenging for all skill levels.","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Great Potential but Not Enough Games","reviewText":"Big Brain Academy for the Nintendo DS is a lot like Brain Age. It's a collection of puzzles designed to test and stimulate your intellect.While we enjoy Brain Age, it has numerous issues. You only get 'scored' on each game once a day. The number of games is REALLY limited and many of them can get maxed out within weeks of playing. How much fun is it to get straight 5s on Head Count hard, with no chance of ever improving? I was really happy, then, when Big Brain Academy came along. While it still doesn't have nearly as many games in it as it should have, at least it has a wider selection.In Big Brain Academy, you're not fighting for a low brain age (which I always found to be an EXTREMELY questionable goal). Insead, you're working towards a \"big\" brain which is much better. There are puzzles split up into five areas - thinking, memorizing, analyzing, computing and identifying. Each area has 3 games, with multiple difficulty levels. So that's 15 games total. You're already far ahead of Brain Age with that quantity, plus the difficulty levels too.You can practice as much as you want, aiming for a gold medal in each game at each difficulty level. As you go, you fill up a 'brain graph' - a pentagon that shows which areas you're best at. When you're ready, you do the actual test.The test randomly chooses a game from each of the 5 areas and sets you at them. It's on a timer, so you do as well as you can within that time limit. At the end, your total brain weight is calculated. This isn't of course \"real\" - it is more a general scale to show how well you're doing. It also gives you a \"type\" of brain you have based on what you did well in. Someone who does really well in computing is called a \"calculator\" - while someone who's great at memorizing and thinking is a \"museum curator\".The puzzles are simple but fun. They're the type of puzzles that young kids would enjoy but that adults would find entertaining as well. Traditional things such as memory games, box counting, shape recognition and more are the norm here.Just like Brain Age, this game shares the problem of INCESSANT CHATTER from the \"helper\". You have to go paging through numerous completely meaningless messages to get through some areas. They really need to get a handle on that for future releases.I'm still baffled why they can't have 6 games per area, instead of 3. At least this is a huge step up from Brain Age in that area, but still, there should really be far more games included in the set. It would really help to make this an excellent game, instead of a fun game that has a limited lifetime of enjoyability.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2006"}
{"product_name":"B001HB7K6I","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"An excellent Wii game....4.5 stars","reviewText":"Muramasa: The Demon Blade is one of those games that many people will pass by because either they don't know what the game is about and/or it's assumed to be a \"shovelware\" title and will be avoided at all costs. But it is far from that. Muramasa: The Demon Blade was released on the Wii in 2009 and received great reviews from certain websites that bothered to do some coverage on it.It's a hack and slash platform game set in the world of feudal Japan featuring beautiful backgrounds and Japanese orchestral music. You take control of one of two characters each with his and her storyline. After you select the difficulty level (easy or hard), you set out to defeat enemies, collect items and unlock various stages. Depending of who you choose as your main character, you get access to various swords each with special attacks and attributes. The items you collect range from artifacts, maps, stone tablets, food and cookbooks (to learn how to make recipes from the food you collect.) This game features a weapon system called \"Forge\" in which you use souls (collected from enemies or by looking around) along with the blades you earn to make new, powerful swords. These new swords come in handy when you progress further into the game and encounter tougher enemies and bosses. When you earn new blades, they have the power to unlock sections of stages that are not available from the beginning so you will return to areas you cleared before to access it entirely.THE PROS: This is a very unique game in that it is set entirely during the feudal period of Japan as the characters you meet all dress and talk the part. The graphics are outstanding from the various enemies and animals you fight down to the various bosses and backgrounds of the stages. They all animate smoothly. The music is amazing as it fits the mood perfectly as do the various sound effects from the item pickups to the clanging of swords and sword slashing your enemies to death. Muramasa features Japanese voice acting so don't worry about following the story because you'll see subtitles whenever a character is talking. The controls are easy to get into no matter which way you play it (support for the Wii Nunchuk & Remote, the Classic Controller and the Gamecube controller is available.) And since it's been available for awhile now, you can get it pretty cheap. There are save portals scattered throughout the game so you can always save your progress and come back and play it again later.THE CONS: Quite frankly, there isn't much to complain about. Since there isn't enough variety in the game (you kill enemies, collect items and repeat), it can get repetitive at times. Also, it's worth saying that easy mode is not that easy as you'll still be in for quite a challenge but the hard mode is no joke. Expect to die a lot in hard mode so I recommend starting out in easy mode first.This is a game that shouldn't be widely ignored as it's a great title and worthy to be in anyone's Wii game collection. If you like 2D games that are colorful and the weapons revolve around different kinds of swords or anything that has a heavy Japanese influence for an action game, then this game is for you.********HIGHLY RECOMMENDED********","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"Too Old for Games \"casualgamer\"","summary":"Great game; adds nothing new though","reviewText":"I would have to say that this game has nearly perfected the action/adventure genre with it's precise controls and jaw-dropping graphics.  The enemy AI still needs improving as they don't always detect you as they should and they rarely if ever rush at you.  (I started Killzone 2 after this and the NPCs in that game are really smart and tough forcing you to outflank them whenever possible.) It does play out like an action blockbuster movie.  There just isn't any innovation so you will have seen all these elements before in other games.  I would have to describe MW2 the same way.  The original MW was truly innovative, but the 2nd was just a derivative of that.  But back to UC2, it's definitely a top shelf game. I can see myself replaying the campaign again because I love the diverse environments that you play through, unlike the first UC which is set in similar locales throughout.  Add to it that there is multiplayer and co-op missions and you have yourself a keeper.  Oh, and I have to add in that the last boss battle was really a let down for me after the whole journey to get there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2009"}

If You're on the Fence","reviewText":"I agree with most reviewers here, but in short:Buy it if:1. You like the PilotWings franchise.2. You want an app that is visually appealing and shows off the 3D.3. You don't mind repetition.4. You are a perfectionist and love to beat your own times/scores.Don't buy it if:1. You're looking for something wildly innovative2. You don't like repetition3. You are looking for a very deep, flight simulator experience4. You are easily disoriented, or tend to move your DS around5. You are expecting a lot for $406. You want to play multiplayer.All in all, I thought this game was fun for what it's worth.  The graphics are beautiful and the 3D effects are subtle, but effective.  I think Nintendo did a great job of recreating the feeling of a nice, leisurely flight.  It's almost soothing to fly or hangglide around a beautifully rendered sunny island.  It's also fun to find all the hidden paths and try to get those (sometimes challenging) 3 star scores.My only issues are 1. this game may get boring for some because ultimately after you fly through the game, there's not much else to do beyond trying to top your existing times, etc.  2. I also think folks who are looking for a multiplayer experience will be disappointed.I think the game is fun, but a touch pricey relative to what you get.  However, it is a fun/cute/pretty little game that will offer a nice distraction until more titles are available.  For a launch title it does the job just fine (as long as you don't mind the price factor).Final note: If you have a tendency of moving your hands while playing the DS, just note, it may be easy to get disoriented if you accidentally move the \"sweet spot\" out of your field of vision.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003PHLT8W","description":"","reviewerName":"Felllix","summary":"Generic in search of an audience","reviewText":"Vanquish skirts that line of decent so finely that I had to think long and hard about that star rating up there. Since the game shares many similarities to other modern third-person shooters, your enjoyment of it hinges on what you're looking for in a shooter. So, to start this review off right, I should come out and say it;I wasn't a big fan of Gears of War. I thought the technology on display was impressive, but the game had a sort of sluggish pace that didn't lend itself to a shooter, an extremely weak story coupled with uninspired villains, and a general lack of creativity. Vanquish, it seems to me, is the uneasy marriage of the Gears of War model and a fast-paced sci-fi action game, which doesn't exactly gel.You play as Sam Gideon- what happened to game names?- an utterly generic future power-armor space marine assigned to... do something with the help of Robert Burns, a Gears of War reject, complete with a gigantic minigun. They're fighting robots, an invading force attempting to take over what I assume to be Earth. I'm a little hazy on the plot; the opening scenes did not paint a great picture, and it wasn't long before I was skipping cutscenes just so I wouldn't have to hear these people talk.On a quick side note, I'm curious as to why games like this feel the need to have a story at all; remember the days of Sonic the Hedgehog, and Mario, when games didn't really need stories? It seems to me that if you don't have an original story to tell, just focus your millions of dollars on making a game that's fun to play instead of interrupting gameplay every 10 minutes to tell us more about the robots and their nefarious plan to... do something.The features that Vanquish claims as unique gameplay are twofold; first, Sam can enter \"Augmented reality mode,\" which temporarily slows down time in order to give the player a short period of uninterrupted shooting. Apparently no one told lead developer Shinji Mikami that the heyday of Bullet Time was around ten years ago. The mechanic isn't original, but it does work well, especially during boss battles.Second, Sam's suit has a sliding dash feature that allows you to close the distance between you and the enemy extremely quickly. I can imagine this mechanic working well in an action game, like, say, God of War, but the strange thing is that Vanquish didn't seem to be designed with it in mind; most of the time, dashing up to an enemy means attempting a melee attack, which automatically overheats your suit, making a quick getaway using the dash impossible until you hide behind a bit of rubble for several seconds, which breaks the flow in what comes billed as a fast-paced action game. We have instead a game not designed for close-range combat coupled with a mechanic that demands it.In general, it seems that the gameplay was designed by someone attempting to imitate Gears of War while attempting to meld in elements which would work better without the Gears of War model. It's a strange hybrid.On the side of good, Vanquish does not share Gears' problem of muddy graphics. It looks just as good, for the record, but it contains bright colors and character design other than gigantic fat people (other than Burns), which I like. The environments sport impressive detail, even from a distance, too. Vanquish also sports some really nice boss battles, the first against a transforming spider robot being a high point in the game. I wish they happened more often, but an advantage over Gears of War in this regard is pretty nice.The points I haven't touched yet are the nails in the coffin for me, however. Vanquish doesn't contain a multiplayer mode, which will irk some, but it seems like it was designed to; the only weapons worth a damn are the generic ones. While the game sports several original weapons, like a disk launcher and a lock-on laser, they shrink in comparison to the big five of every shooter; the assault rifle, the heavy machine gun, the shotgun, the rocket launcher, and the sniper rifle.  I found exactly one situation in which I didn't have some combination of these, and the rest of the weapons, such as the disk launcher and the LFE gun, are severely underpowered. You're better off using the same guns you find in every shooter. Mikami had a great futuristic setting in which to premier new guns, and wasn't tied down to having to balance them for a multiplayer setting; why not give us something a little more interesting?Beyond that, the enemy variety is pretty paltry; you fight wave after wave of the generic shock troops, then the two kinds of heavy, then the tank. Another strange thing is that the larger battles don't feel as if you're having any effect; I'm not sure why the designers saw the need to give you a team of inferior soldiers to follow you around all the time, but they're there. About halfway through the game, you have to take on a spaceship on your own, and I felt that this section does a great job at showing off what the game could have been, had it been designed entirely around its mechanics instead of with Gears of War constantly in the rearview mirror.And that's the major problem with Vanquish; it's pulling itself in one direction with its two innovations while steadfastly sticking its shoes in the mud with its devotion to formula. I can't recommend it, but if you're a fan of Gears of War desperately in need of an adrenaline rush, you might have a better time with it.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2011"}

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"A great system for casual gamers and old-school Nintendo fans","reviewText":"I purchased the Nintendo Wii in September 2008 and it has been working great for me ever since. As an old school gamer who grew up playing Nintendo systems, the Wii was the first \"next gen\" console that I sought out and I have been very pleased with the gaming experience that it offers. It is not a system designed for the hardcore gamer, rather one that is meant to reach a wider demographic of people who may not have grown up playing games. Below is a summary of the good and bad aspects of the system and the games available; keep in mind that these are subjective to the gamer.Pros:1. Quality first-person titles and an improving library of third-person games. Many may dismiss the Wii on the basis of it being a \"kiddy\" or \"lifestyle\" system based on the lack of adult-oriented games, however few can argue that Nintendo really delivers with their franchises. \"Super Mario Galaxy\", \"Metroid Prime 3\", \"Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess\" and \"Mario Kart Wii\" are all fantastic games that really do the franchises justice. As the system has aged, more quality third-party titles have emerged such as \"Mad World\", \"House of the Dead: Overkill\", \"No More Heroes\", \"Okami\", and \"Klonoa\".2. Innovative controls. When properly utilized in a game, the unique motion controls of the Wii Remote are a blast and they do bring a new level of depth to the gameplay. Sports games, puzzles and platformers all benefit from this and it makes the game more involving; rather than having to remember what 8 buttons perform what functions, it's all about pressing a few buttons and waggling the remote.3. User-Friendly Interface. The Wii menu is perhaps the most streamlined and easy to use dashboard out of all the consoles. The Wii Shop is also easy to navigate in and out of, and shopping for games and add-ons is a snap.4. The Virtual Console. As was the case with the GBA and the DS, Nintendo is making a killing off of their old titles. The Virtual Console allows you to download classic games from the NES, SNES, Genesis, Neo Geo, and a host of other systems. The Classic Controller is require to play them, however this is a nice add on especially for older gamers who grew up in the 8-bit and 16-bit eras.5. Integrated wireless card. If you have wireless internet and your router is compatible with the Wii, this is your best bet for connecting the console to the internet.Cons:1. No Ethernet port. I am not sure how Nintendo screwed this up, however there is no Ethernet port in the back of the console; there are only 2 USB ports and you will need to purchase a LAN adapter separately. This is an annoyance if you don't use wireless internet.2. Inferior graphics. If you are a gamer that needs to have the best graphics, then you will be better off with the PS3 or the Xbox 360. The Wii has good graphics however it is technically inferior to the competition. Sadly, this means that some of the cross-platform titles will be inferior on the Wii, but then again graphics are not everything.3. Gimmicky games. Because of the unique controls, a lot of the games being produced for the Wii are gimmicky and focused more on the controls rather than story and gameplay. For me, this includes the \"Wii Fit\" and \"Wii Sports\". Both games were fun for the first few weeks, however I got bored once the novelty wore off and I have not played either game since. This has improved over the lifespan of the system, however this is still a lot of \"Shovelware\" being produced.4. Limited memory. The Wii only comes with 512 MB of internal memory, which is a drop in the bucket compared to the 120 GB and 160 GB hard drives being offered on the Xbox 360 and PS3 respectively. I guess this is because the Wii is not download-intensive, however the 512 MB gets eaten up quickly if you download a lot of Virtual Console and Wii Ware games. Fortunately, they system allows you to use an SD card to store and back-up downloaded content.The Pros and Cons of any video game system often depend on the gamer, so the above is just my own personal impressions after having owned my Wii for almost one year. Overall, I like the system a lot and I play it often despite a few shortcomings. I also own an Xbox 360 and that fulfills whatever needs that the Wii is not currently meeting, so I have no regrets about purchasing this console.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2009"}

From a grownup's POV this really doesn't seem to deserve to be a Wii game: the graphics is crude, the sound effect poor, and the interface juvenile. And there're only 16 stories plus 4 short sing-along songs. The voice-changing mini game is extremely low-quality, although the voice painting mini game is a lot of fun for a 2- to 5-year-old. The included microphone is lightweight and looks good in white and is made by Logitech -- supposedly it can be used with other Wii games that utilize a mic, but I haven't tried.But it's exactly the simple (but colorful) graphics and simple sound effects that appeal to a preschooler or pre-kindergartener. And, really, the deal is, this is the only video-console storybook game, so if you want your kids to learn to read and have some fun at the same time on your precious Wii, I think this is your only choice. The price can seem a little high, but it's a good way to get your kids something to play on the Wii.To be honest, I can barely stand the game myself, but my preschooler thoroughly enjoys it (esp. the voice painiting game!), so I'm not going to argue with its merit for its target audience. And it really beats having to let the kid play Wii games that ain't appropriate yet.Now, I'd like to share a few important tips:1. You must plug in the included USB microphone before starting the game. There are two USB ports in the *back* of the Wii.  You can plug in the mic before or after you power on your Wii, but before you start the game from the Wii Menu. It's totally okay to leave the mic plugged in, whether you play this game or not. (The mic, made by Logitech, also reportedly works with other mic-compatible games, but I haven't tried.)2. Before you start the game for the first time, I highly, highly recommend that you have created a Mii for each of your kids who will be using this game. A kid's Mii will be required to unlock the \"Mii Story\" feature. Five of the 16 stories have this \"Mii Story\" feature whereby after it's read three times, your kids' Mii's can be used inside the story starting with the 4th read.3. When you start the game for the first time, do the following two things before you do anything else!3a) Go into the Sticker Book Desk from the main treehouse menu (it's the icon behind the Grape Room door). Open the sticker book for each child and change the background to something he/she likes. The default background is a Christmas tree but you can change it to one of 7 other designs. This is important because if there are stickers in an existing sticker book and you want to change the background later, all the existing stickers will be lost. (So, if you do want to remove the stickers, simply change the background.)3b) Go into the Grape Room from the main treehouse menu and click on the red computer, to set up profiles for your kids who will use this game, as well as a profile for yourself or your spouse. If you want the kids to use the Mii Story feature (see tip #2 above), you should pick their Mii's for their profiles.4. The instruction booklet is difficult to understand. Once you have followed my first three tips, go into the Acorn room on the main treehouse menu, click on the board icon on the right, and read the four-page \"TV-Head's Tips\" (TV-Head is the little guy that runs around on the menu screens and gives you instructions.) These are way much better to read than the booklet - which also doesn't include enough info.5. You need to remember that, in the Orange Room where the stories are located, the \"Mii Story\" feature is locked until your child's profile has a Mii (see tip #3b above) and one of the Mii Stories is read through three times (by anyone). Also, remember that only 5 of the 16 stories are Mii Stories. Also keep in mind that the \"Favorite Stories\" feature is locked until a story is read at least three times, and the \"Recorded Stories\" feature is unavailable unless you or your kids have actually recorded a story.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2010"}

Brawl Review","reviewText":"This was one of the reasons why I finally caved in and purchased a Wii. The Super Smash Bros. games won me over from that first day, when, visiting my grandparents in Texas many many years ago, I rented a copy of the original N64 Smash from Blockbuster and spent a whole weekend with that beautiful grey cartridge. It was, quite simply, a smashing good time.Then there was Melee, and now Brawl. Brawl is hard for me to rank against the others. Of course it is the best looking graphically...or is it? Melee's graphics still hold up today, they are crystal clear. Brawl really isn't a giant leap from Melee's graphics. But graphics don't matter in the end right? It's all about gameplay.Brawl is a lot of fun, as should be expected from a Smash Bros. game. There are a ton of characters to unlock, and a lot of awesome debuts onto the Smash scene, such as Solid Snake, Diddy Kong, Pokemon Trainer, and Meta Knight, to name a few. It always fun to learn to master a new character on Super Smash Bros., learning the right strategies, strengths, and weaknesses. Brawl provides a lot of opportunity to get to learn a lot of different characters.There is also a ton of new items, and the Final Smash mechanic. These are all neat additions, but they can wear out the welcome, and stray from the simplicity that made the first Smash Bros. so great. The Final Smash mechanic in particular can be a bit unbalanced, with some characters' Final Smashes being absolutely devastating, while others' are next to useless. The new items can also tend to inundate the battlefield unless you tweak the options, turning a test of skill into a race for items (which is cool if that's what you want, otherwise you may want to reduce the amount of items available in the menu options).Brawl also features a single-player story-ish mode, the Subspace Emissary. It's really a sort of quasi-platforming game with the Super Smash Bros. mechanics that doesn't really work...but it provides some sort of entertainment if you don't have any friends around and are tired of brawling with CPUs. It is also one of the methods used to unlock characters.There is online play, but it can be problematic at times. I have been in many matches that get plagued with terrible lag that ruins the experience. Perhaps just as often, however, it works fine, and it's a blast brawling with friends online.Brawl is another fun entry in the Super Smash Bros. series, and worthy of the name. Aside from a few minor flaws, it is a great return to taking our favorite Nintendo characters and having them beat the snot out of each other.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2011"}

The graphics in this game looks fantastic, with a significant upgrade OVER Reach. What is lacking is an update to the animation system which was left alone on purpose. But look at the scenery, water, reflections, physics, and it's absolutely gorgeous.Now, one aspect of the game that caught me completely by surprise was the very well done remastering of the music track, and the exceptional sound effects in the game. You will hear bullets ricocheting off shields, shards impacting into bodies, and individual bullet muzzle sounds. The sound of each weapon was significantly upgraded over Reach, let alone the original Halo, circa 2001. Let loose on the warthog cannon with your full 5.1 surround, wow, quite an improvement! I play on the same TV/surround system with both games, and the audio is a huge leap beyond the audio in Reach. It is truly glorious. I played with my son for 4 hours straight and we had to stop for the day because it was so engrossing, so much fun, it would be easy to forget to eat!This old-school gamer, long time Halo series fan, gives it 5/5 without hesitation.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2012"}

The addition of Pride mode is a plus, and the roster is huge. The game looks pretty realistic and controls well. They fixed some of the Major problems from last year and created some new ones in the process (THQs MO) . The made the standup combat at close range alot better , no longer is it the elbow spam war. Overall it is a better game than 10 , because it is less broken. The Submission system while still crappy is a improvement over last years but the rest of the ground game is about the same. The major problem with the game is the stamina system is terrible. The AI will throw shot after shot and never get tired, you will get tired after throwing just a few. They also have it set up where the person working to get out of a submission is drained of stamina instead of the person going for the submission hold. So say I escape a submission hold , I am now drained of energy and the cannot take advantage of the position gain from escaping. Also the computer will just try immediately for another submission and now since you are tired they will get it eventually. That and like every other THQ game online doesn't work right.Overall I would rent this game or wait, it will be $30 in a few weeks. It is not worth $60 , I probably would just go pick up EA MMA as it is a much better game and is way cheaper.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000034DMG","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"you can't handle the constant fear","reviewText":"Resident Evil 2 HAS to be one of the most groundbreaking games ever to hit the original Playstation gaming console. Not to mention the most addicting. Well, Dino Crisis 2 is probably the most addicting, but this game comes next.As I surf around the internet reading peoples opinions and thoughts on video games, I like to search for reviews from people who reviewed innovative games back in the day, and compare those reviews to the most recent ones to see if the general opinion has changed any, as the years went by. Sometimes a game that seemed unstoppable back in the day won't be remembered today, such as Earthworm Jim. With Resident Evil 2, opinions have remained extremely positive all these years later. People are *still* talking about Resident Evil 2 today, in 2007. Why? What IS it about Resident Evil 2 that makes people keep coming back for more?Could it be an addiction to shooting zombies over and over? That may be it, because, despite the fact that zombies walk slowly and predictably through each area of the game you explore, something about wanting to keep killing them *never* gets boring. Maybe it's hearing that \"pop\" sound from the handgun and watching a zombie bleed and take a step back to gather their brain dead thoughts that makes the game so memorable? These zombies are actually pretty animated when you consider the age this game was released (1997-1998). Sometimes you walk into a room and a zombie will be walking the other way, you shoot, and it will slowly turn around and come after you. This is pretty cool. It means they're not entirely stupid. They know when someone is trying to kill them again.You can literally blow zombies in half with a single shotgun blast! To add even more creativity to the game, Capcom allowed the top-half of their bodies to CRAWL after you after they've been blown in half. Sometimes, only two or three handgun shots will kill a zombie off, while other times it might take up to eight or nine shots to kill one. It's all part of the mystery and uncertainty that makes shooting these bad boys so much fun.Other times, zombies will trick you into thinking they're dead, only to grab around your ankle when you try walking past them. You really have to make sure you finished them off before heading towards the next part of the police station. Otherwise, they will be back when you return. Or at the very least, make sure you walk around them *completely* when they're laying on the ground, and don't come near them. I won't spoil anything, but using a magnum bullet on a zombie will give you the ultimate satisfaction. I guarantee it!There's no telling what will happen. Zombies will simply continue walking up to you until a puddle of blood forms on the ground, confirming they're finally dead. I like the added special touch of having zombies dressed in a police uniform, in addition to having female zombies walk up to you and attack. You don't want to hurt a female zombie but, you know, it's either you or her that dies. Decide!What else makes Resident Evil 2 still *very* addicting 10 years later? Maybe it's the multiple storylines and all the quests? You see, the game is 2 discs long, and each disc contains two different quests. To get the ultimate experience out of Resident Evil 2, you need to beat all four quests, twice with the female character (named Claire) and twice with the male character (Leon). Each one of these four adventures has zombies and items appearing in different locations, giving the game a ton of replay value. Of course, most of the replay value is found in just shooting zombies left and right. This is very addicting, trust me. You will love killing them over and over.Besides zombies, giant spiders, vicious dogs, and these disgusting creatures called \"lickers\" also occupy the police station. I'd say lickers are definitely the most complicated enemy to deal with because they have a habit of leaping at you with their claw hanging forward, and stabbing you. I love when you enter a room and you can't see a licker, but you can definitely hear them. You might hear a ticking sound or a very deep breathing sound to alert you a licker is around somewhere. I can't put into words how disturbingly Exorcist-like this game can be.To save your game, you need to put an ink ribbon into a typewriter. Each ink ribbon you find actually holds two of them, so you can save your game twice when you find one of these. Most ink ribbons are found in the same room as the typewriter, but others can be hidden in rooms where no typewriter is found. You don't need to find ALL of them in order to beat the game, but it would certainly help you out in the long run if you store as many ink ribbons are you can. You never know when it might be a good time to save.Bullets are plentiful. Handgun bullets, especially. They're everywhere on easy mode. So are shotgun bullets, however, make sure you save as many shotgun bullets are you can because towards the end of the game, when enemies get meaner and angrier, they will come in handy. You don't want to come face to face with three angry lickers and only have handgun bullets with you, believe me. Also, the magnum (which is found in the beginning of the game) is the ultimate weapon.Of course, shotguns and magnums are only available for the Leon quest. In Claire's quest, you have something called Acid Rounds and a Bow Gun, which are equally as dangerous. They do tremendous damage to enemies, which means it would be wise to save them until the end of the game.To heal yourself, you need to collect green herbs that are laying throughout the police station, and white spray bottles (which heal you completely). They are everywhere in the game, which means, on easy mode NONE of the four quests are really that hard. Just don't go around shooting everything you see and you should have no problem finishing the game.The graphics are dated now, obviously, but back in 1998 we've never SEEN anything like this before. Outside on the streets is nighttime, and the lights in the police station are dim and just as scary and fitting. It's hard to believe how real the atmosphere is. The only negative is that the music isn't quite as good as you've probably read. Neither are the sound effects (except for the sounds those lickers make). Silent Hill has the game beat in this area.The only problem is that each of the four quests are between 2 and 2 and a half hours long. By todays standards, that's incredibly short. However, if you add up the play time for all four quests, you're looking at a good 10 hours of zombie-shootin'. Honestly, you're supposed to go through the four quests to get everything out of Resident Evil 2 (something I didn't realize until a year after I bought it).Saying this game is groundbreaking isn't really enough. Resident Evil 2 opened peoples eyes about the mystery and fascination of zombies, and how frightening they can be. Capcom showed people how zombies walking around moaning and spitting can catch your attention and frighten you. The zombies shown in movies aren't nearly as scary as the ones in this game, in my opinion. Zombie movies are laughable, almost like comedy movies. In a video game, it's a more serious and terrifying situation. Not to mention much bloodier in video game form. I'm sure you can find me an example of a scary zombie movie, but I haven't seen one yet.It should also be noted that the Playstation One had a bunch of similar zombie games available when the console was popular, but almost every one of them went by unnoticed. The Resident Evil series was simply too popular and fun for any imitations to catch on and gain success. Then again, I haven't really played any of the games that supposedly rip off the RE series, so they might be worth playing as far as I know.Resident Evil 2 also helped the whole \"survival horror\" genre gain major popularity. Before this game, the genre didn't really have a proper name. We just called them \"scary games\" or whatever. Also, the play control in this game was excellent, not to mention important in helping people understand how to control characters in a 3D world. The Resident Evil series might not allow a lot of room to walk around, but I don't think it's supposed to. You're supposed to get a sense of claustrophobia. You spend the majority of the time in tight hallways and small rooms.Resident Evil 2 stands proud today as a major achievement in the world of video games and a game people will probably never forget. Owning it will do you some good.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000FQBPCQ","reviewerName":"Ray-Review","summary":"An Absolute Must Buy Zelda","reviewText":"If you have a Nintendo Wii and don't have this game, than there is something wrong with you. So far this is probably the best game out for the Wii right now, the hype behind this game is real because this game is ingenius. First off is that this is actually a little more on the mature side, so people that are used to seeing Link like in \"Windwaker\" you most definetly won't find him here. Link is pretty much a man right now and it is for the better.Zelda: Twilight Princess is one of those games that bring a groundbreaking experience like no other, this is probably better than its spiritual predecessor \"Ocarina of Time\" so this is arguebly the best Zelda ever created. As much as Ocarina of Time was THE first Zelda game to go 3-D, and that it was the first to do what it did, this Zelda is pretty much an upgrade in every possible way. The graphics, gameplay, music & sound, cinematics, pretty much everything is upgraded for the better. The game is a living, breathing world that is huge and diverse....you have grasslands, snow, underwater, even in the skies. You can mingle with people, buy and sell stuff, all sorts of things. This is a very long game it took me about 50 hours to beat (only because I decided to do extra sidequests), and even when your done with the story there are plenty of sidequests for you to do like collecting Golden Bugs or collecting Poe Souls.The controls are the sellin point of Zelda, this is why people prefer the Wii version over the Gamecube version because of the things you can do with the Wii controller. The wii controller allows you to really have a feel to what your actually doing in the game, like for example swinging a sword now for a regular gamecube controller is just pressing a button repeatedly, but for the wii controller you actually have to swing the controller which really gets you in the game and never gets boring. The gameplay is great, whether your riding a horse, fishing for fishes or shooting at enemies with your bow it all just feels refreshing. The sound and music is epic and beautiful, you will hear familiar sounds when you recieve items and Links grunt never changes.Now while this is a great game there is still little things that I have problem with. For one is the lack of voice acting in the game, you would they would do that sort of thing by now, although the cutscenes alone bring a certain depth that you can actually feel what is going on you still need some voice acting because reading is one thing I don't like to do in games especially in these times. (This is My Problem) I think that the game is extremely frustrating to get through by yourself without a walkthrough, I always find myself stuck somewhere almost in every f***in level it really makes me fell hella stupid sometimes that it's not even funny. But again they're just little things other than that this is a very good game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00004U1R3","description":"Paper Mariohas a 2-D look in a 3-D game world--an aesthetic designed to make players feel as if they've entered an animated pop-up book. A stationary camera helps reinforce this storybook illusion. The game's title is taken from the paper-thin characters inhabiting the Mushroom Kingdom. For example, when Mario is sleeping, he flips and flutters through the air like a leaf falling from a tree.Paper Mariois the sequel to the classic Super NES role-playing gameSuper Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. Like the original, it contains a mix of turn-based battles and intricate puzzles, as well as timed attacks. Players time their attacks by moving the D-pad and pressing the A button at exactly the right moment to inflict maximum damage. This seasonsPaper Mariowith a little action/adventure flavor. Classic characters, such as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Bowser, and Toad, are joined by the likes of Goombario and Kammy Koopa.","reviewerName":"A. Bennett \"Will 'vouge' For Food\"","summary":"Cute...but a little disappointing...","reviewText":"Since I am a super huge Mario fan, I was more than happy when I heard he was finally making a return to the N64.  I am also a super huge fan of Mario RPG for the Super NES, and I was ready for Mario to really make a splash with this game.  I am a little disappointed.  The game is very nicely done and is very cute, but a little too cute.  Mario isn't as fiesty as he once was.  One of my biggest issues with the game is the selection of characters.  I didn't like how you could only have Mario and another character.  And the characters you have to choose from are pretty lame. I would have like to see Peach(the whole captured thing is getting old), Luigi, Toad, and a whole mess of other Mario characters.  The low amount of damage and hit points also really ticked me off.On the bright side, the gameplay and graphics were very well done.  The flat story book thing was neat, but I hope it doesn't make an encore performance.  The storyline(although Peach needs to learn some self-defense) is good, and you do get to travel to some interesting places.  PAPER MARIO is a good game.  It is unfortunately geared towards younger players and that may turn some old schoolers away.  But in the end, like any Mario game, this one is worth a try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2001"}

Not sure what makes this one even more addicting than the rest but it is. I couldn't put it down. Maybe is the graphics, interface, streamline of everything or the online.Take your pick but the game is just plain fun and addicting. The way the shared exp. is handled makes the game less of a chore to level up your pokemon and makes you concentrate more on exploring, catching and other things instead of worrying about the rest that are being left behind. It makes the grind better knowing everyone is leveling up.Now this was in past games but the way is handled here is so much better and smooth.The lack of 3D in most of the game is disappointing but not a deal breaker. I'm sure the game will be optimized in the next installments much how B/W were huge graphical improvements over the 1st DS Pokemon games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2013"}
