{"product_name":"B00004YUWA","description":"Icoweaves the tale of a young boy trying to escape his  imprisonment in a large, vacant castle. Along the way, he discovers another  captive--a beautiful princess named Yorda. Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play. Few games are as  elegant in their simplicity as this puzzler from Sony.--Raymond M.

I feel the game wasn't as polished as Modern Warfare, but there are some great aspects to the game. Being able to drive tanks and helcopters was fun, but a couple frustrating problems do get in the way with single player campaign. The overall single player is what i enjoyed the most however. The background visuals could be quite impressive at times. The guns felt good too since they actually showed some recoil when fired. Another great aspect is that almost everything is destructable. Blow through houses, blockades, and even trees. Battlefield is a solid game that can provide some fun. Be warned though it does have lots of language if you're thinking about letting kids play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2011"}

Cel-shaded graphics are really only so good...\"Even if you've played these titles already on the PS2 and you're just in the mood to play them again, this is money well spent.  The Sly Cooper games are fun, they're entertaining, and as a PS3 re-release I was surprised at how very much clearer everything looks.  The Sly Collection isn't going to look Final-Fantasy-realistic, and you wouldn't want it to, but you'd be amazed at how many details you didn't realize you were missing before.  Levels look sharper, colors are a bit more vivid, but then we get all the other added bonuses that you'd expect in an update:  trophies and minigames (the minigames do require a PlayStation Move controller).For those of you not familiar with these games, Sly Cooper is a kind of 'gentleman thief'.  Playing him is less about smashing things around like your typical platformer and more about being clever and sneaky.  There are occasional gadgets and abilities that you can unlock for Sly, plus the trilogy gets a bit more open and less linear the further you go.  Sly can't do it all by himself though:  he is aided by his driver and muscle \"Murray\" (a hippo with a heart of gold) and his uber-geek genius Bentley (a turtle with a brain the size of a planet).  At times you get to play each of these characters, and while their abilities do the same things as Sly's, you have to do those things in a different way (for example, Murray can't climb along wires and Bentley really can't run very fast).Moving Sly around is fairly simple:  there are very few times in which I had trouble pulling off a series of moves, that a couple more tries didn't fix.  The stealth mechanic of the Sly games is very forgiving:  if you do get in over your head, often being judicious enough to run away will solve all your problems.  While I can remember having a bit of a tough time getting the hang of Sly years ago when I was new to consoles, the difficulty and pacing of the games seem to be just about right.  There are whole stretches of the series that you can easily make your way through and have fun, and then a few bottlenecks that tend to resolve themselves before reloading a bunch of times.For me, the Sly Collection was an excellent way to relive old times.  It also has me a lot more excited at the prospects of a \"Sly Cooper 4\" built exclusively for the PlayStation 3.  If you haven't tried the original, or you're just in the mood to play them again, you owe it to yourself to check out The Sly Collection.NOTE:  There is one huge glitch you want to be aware of though:  one of the musical minigames in the first title has you timing your button presses to the beat of your enemy's notes.  We discovered that the rhythm of the remastered audio was just slightly out of sync with the game, and it made catching the right moment incredibly difficult.  I think this has to do with using a system (TV or Home Theater Receiver) that has Lip Sync enabled...because your opponent doesn't really have 'lips', the hardware gets the timing of the sound off-kilter with the visuals.  If you experience this, just turn off Lip Sync and you should be able to get through it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2011"}

It had an emotional impact on me throughout the game which is a rare case for me in games. Although I did get all weepy eyed both times I played Journey. At times I was sad, others I felt tense, other times happy and other times were definitely \"Awwww s***!\" moments.The gameplay itself is fun. If you have ever played an Uncharted game then you will feel right at home although there is less combat and not jumping/swinging around. The stealth element is satisfying and needed since supplies are hard to come by which leads to a need to get up close and personal quietly in order to save on ammo. It also adds to the feel of trying to survive by scavenging since weapons and supplies aren't allover the place. Sometimes you'll be lucky to find one bullet in a 10 minute period and be grateful a guy you had to kill actually dropped a couple bullets. Having to create items and use them mid game forces you to constantly check your limited inventory and always trying to be prepared as well. You have to be careful in combat since taking time to bandage yourself while enemies are closing in because you went in guns blazing is not a good idea.The story is fairly clich&eacute; but not bad by any means. It has its own unique style and look and feel. It also has quite a few very unique moments as well. But clich&eacute; aside it is definitely more than capable of standing on its own two feet.But what really makes the game is the characters. The characters all feel like they are their individual personalities that seem lifelike. They also seem to convey real emotion at times.The sense of less is more really resonates in this game. From the often quiet and seldom used music in the game, lack of supplies, the way you can play for 20 minutes without seeing anyone or getting in combat, the emptiness of cities, and so on lend themselves to this great line they walked in making the game where there isn't much of what you would expect but all that does is add to the game.The ending (no spoilers) is one of the best I have seen in years. It didn't feel cheap, it didn't feel like they were done and just slapped an ending on it, it wasn't clich&eacute;d, or anything else. I felt satisfied with the ending, you could tell they put a lot of thought into it. And to me the ending of a game is the most important part, well unless youre just doing a shooter or arcade style game where its all about just playing the game. But games like this that have a real story and real characters rarely ever get a worth ending, and like I said that's the most important part of a character piece because the ending is the last thing you leave your audience with.I paid full price for this to get the survival edition and I did not feel cheated one single bit, it was worth every penny. This is a rare case of me encouraging people to buy this brand new because Naughty Dog deserves the money while most developers do not. I want to encourage them to create more great games like this.Far as what comes with the SE, I thought the bonus material was very cool. Normally I never buy special editions at full price, I wait for them to drop in price because they usually want too much for some digital stuff and a couple crappy items. But this was only 20 dollars more for a nice steelbook and artbook and soundtrack cd which made it worthwhile to me, the rest was just extra.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2013"}

Be the hero embarking on an epic quest or a thief rising to leadership of his guild. Be a sorcerer developing the ultimate spell of destruction or a healer searching for the cure to a plague. Your actions define your character, and your gameplay changes and evolves in response to your actions. Confront the assassins' guild, and they take out a contract on you; impress them, and they try to recruit you instead. No two sagas are the same in the world of Morrowind.Players can choose to follow the intriguing main story line or set off to explore the province of Morrowind and the many interesting people and exotic locations it contains. Vast cities and remote villages dot the landscape, each with its own unique look and feel. Hundreds of quests and adventures await as you interact with characters and learn more. Regardless of whether you play a murdering assassin or a noble knight, the game holds endless possibilities and allows you to revisit the main story line at any time.With Morrowind, the Elder Scrolls character system is coupled with an increase in the world's richness of detail. Utilizing advanced 3-D technology, Morrowind features hyperrealistic textures and polygon counts, real-time shadows, vast landscapes, skeletal-based animation, and a complete weather system. Gameplay is further extended with the inclusion of The Elder Scrolls Construction Set, which allows players to modify and add to Morrowind in any way they see fit. Change character or creature attributes and skills, introduce new weapons or dungeons into the game, or create entire new worlds to explore.","reviewerName":"Jeff Johnson \"Jeff Johnson\"","summary":"Morrowind is whatever you would like it to be","reviewText":"Imagine your perfect epic RPG where you see directly what the character sees. What would your perfect RPG have, would you want to be a guard, soldier, warrior, adventurer, pilgrim, healer, mage, sorcerer, wizard, thief, murderer, thug, miner, killer, vampire, demon, unimaginable creature, should I keep going? You can be anything and everything with one character in this game. Would this game have you helping others, defeating enemies (there are some amazingly creative ideas for creatures), selling goods, ruling a kingdom, going treasure hunting, tomb raiding, dragon slaying, charting undiscovered lands, casting spells, making spells, making weapons, fixing armor, enchanting objects, stealing souls, flying, swimming, swinging axes, staffs, swords, hammers, spears, throwing daggers stars or shooting bow and arrows from a distance. This game has it all, and the more you do something, the more you get skilled at what you do. If you swing a sword to defeat every enemy you will become a great swordsman, if you use magic to destroy everything, you will become a great mage, if you hide yourself you will become a great ninja, if you constantly pick locks you become an expert in security, when you run around you become a better athlete, when you jump around you become a better acrobat, and when you take some damage to your armor, clothes or skin you get better in heavy armor, light armor or medium armor. That's how the game works there is no structure, you can become an invincible force. So why is there a main quest if you can do anything? Because there are 350 mini quests! You do not have to do them all, in fact you do not have to do any of them and the quests vary from deliver this message, kill the rats in my attic, take me to this city to the more challenging slay this dragon, eliminate the enter thieves guild, assassinate the emperor. Your actions dictate this RPG, you begin on a minor quest (which leads to the real quest of the game) if you steal something, you are arrested and must pay a fine or go to jail, if you free slaves expect the owner to be angry, if you prove your love, expect to get some love, if you tease someone expect for that person to hate you, and if you kill someone you are feared heavily by the public!

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B00006LEMX","description":"Looking for a new obsession to keep you up nights? Let me introduce you to Hotsuma, the main character inShinobi, the much anticipated new action-adventure game from Sega. Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics. The anime-style cutscenes woven around the slice-and-dice sequences provide an interesting story, but one that doesn't relate very directly with your job on the streets of postapocalyptic Tokyo.

Every bad guy in the first stage is exactly the same, and there are no other challenges except to stab and slash your way through them.  The first boss is ridiculous, and you don't even get to [dispose of] it before some woman comes and helps you out.Then when the second stage started, and it looked exactly the same as the first stage, with the same enemies and backgrounds, I said, \"Enough with this.\"Revenge of Shinobi had creativity, unique challenges, well-thought-out levels, good music, excellent graphics and more... none of which this version has.

I was excited for this game when I saw the trailer- how dark it looked and how sick the action was made me pumped. And then I got this game.This game is nothing new. Just different characters. The gameplay is actually shorter than Halo 3. 4-6 hours? That's it? And actually, it's WORSE than Halo 3. Halo 3 was disappointing at times, but at least it had its moments. But this is just... bad. To the two other people who commented on my Halo Wars review and said that my calling Halo Wars \"Terrible\" was lying- yeah, go on and tell me that for not liking this game. But be warned; at least I don't devote myself to the series.The main character is... in a word... boring. We hadrly know a thing about him at all. And he dies every time somone looks at him weird, just like in the the game of \"The World Is Not Enough\", you can shoot the wall and someone can die.Another thing is that while this game is being advertised as a new game in the series, it's not that- it's just an expansion pack. They are charging $60 for an expansion pack. This should be downloadable and not full price.The one redeeming factor is the HD gaming. The game looks gorgeous in HD! I only have a 32\" 720P HDTV but it looks gorgeous on that. Don't believe me? You must see it to believe it.

It was both breathtaking and revolutionary.  Unfortunately, the next two sequels were more cookie cutter and repetitive - with a fake dark atmosphere and repetitive, needless fighting.This games returns to the fun of the Sands of Time.  The acrobatics are the showcase.  The atmosphere, though not the most vibrant, can be lush at times.  The concept is simple - you go to an area, find a way to the boss level, fight the boss, the area becomes \"fertile\", then you explore the area and get light seeds.  You get enough seeds, you get a power.  Your goal is to make all 25 grounds fertile, then fight the main boss.You jump, drop down, climb onto poles.  The same usual Prince of Persia stuff with the great, easy to understand mechanics.  No falling because you misaligned yourself, no dying because you didn't press two buttons at the exact right time.There are only about 3 puzzles and they are relatively easy.  There are also very few enemies - you only have to fight the boss at the end of a fertile ground, and possibly a simple enemy in between the grounds.  The amount of fights has reduced significantly.  The main change to the platforming dynamics is Elika, a princesses who helps you double jump and can pick you up when you- meaning you never die.  This allows you to actually worry about the game as opposed to worrying about whether you can make a jump.And for fighting - no needless swarms to take care of.  As usual, there are a combos you can use, you can use Elika's magic, and that's about it.It's not all great though.  There are two main problems - the boss fights are long.  You face the same boss for each level 5 times, and these things take forever.  Each fight is about 10 minutes long of basically button mashing.  Really boring and dull after a while.  The second main problem are the special powers your receive.  Basically, you jump to a plate, and then you either jump to another plate, fly, or run on a wall.  This is basically eye candy with game mechanics that don't run well.  You'll find this to an tedious exercise of trial and error.  These two things break the flow of the game tremendously.All in all, it's a fun, simple game that returns to the splendor that was the Sands of Time.Pros:Great acrobaticsOpen endedFunNo walkthrough neededLess emphasis on fightingCons:Bosses are somewhat annoyingGraphically - no wow factorThe \"special powers\" are annoying.Time to Complete: 12 hoursDifficulty Level: LowFrustration Level: Low","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2008"}

Well, let's find out shall we?  How about a little versus here.First of all, the graphics.  It's no contest here, the Gamecube version wins because of it's excellent lighting and framerate.  There are points in the PS2 version where it lags and just all around doesn't look as good.  This is mostly due to the PS2 being released in 2000, and it's realy starting to show it's age now.  Graphic wise, the Playstation 2 version just isn't as good. Plus, the Gamecube version ran much much smoother.  It's the little things about the PS2 version that stick out, such as how enemies are just... uglier and more blotchy.Now what about the gameplay?  Well, we can't accurately compare these two.  It depends on what you're looking for.  The PS2 version is certainly harder, throwing in more enemies in certain areas.  The aiming system that made it incredible on the Gamecube is back, and it's just about the same.  In all essence, the gameplay on PS2 is exactly the same.  However, I CAN rightfully give it to the PS2 version because the control scheme is just all around easier than the Gamecube version.  Simple to learn, and easy to use.It's no contest that the PS2 has more secrets and extras to unlock.  The most rewarding being \"Separate Ways\".  Gamecube version had \"Assignment Ada\" but \"Separate Ways\" which is a side story featuring Ada, is just as good.  The PS2 version also has new weapons to unlock and more costumes.The storyline remains the same, the presidents daughter is kidnapped and it's up to CIA agent Leon S. Kennedy to go to the mysterious village and save her.Sound wise, again, is a tie.  Both versions sound exactly the same in all aspects including voice acting (which is terrific).Basically, the PS2 version is like receiving a special edition DVD to one of your favorite movies of all time.  The downgraded graphics are no problem.  \"Separate Ways\" on it's own does make this version worth a buy.  Other than that, the Gamecube version is a little more superior as far as presentation.  But the extras do make the PS2 version worthwhile.In other words, it depends on what you're looking for.  If you just want solid gameplay, get the Gamecube version (if you don't have it already).  And when it comes to all those nifty secrets, the PS2 version is far superior... but note that there aren't THAT many new features, guys.So it is worth it, even on the Playstation 2.  If you already have the Gamecube version, I'd still pick up the PS2 version.  You may even stumble upon things you missed on the 'cube.Don't be turned away by the downgraded graphics, think of all the extras--especially Ada's \"Separate Ways\".","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2005"}

Everything or Nothing is based off the film when Piece Brosnan was still the famous spy, and Everything or Nothing is pretty solid. The story is pretty nonsensical and is your typical Bond plot with a bad guy (Willam Defoe) hellbent on ruling the world. Diavolo has nanomites that can eat through metal, and plans on attaching payloads of this stuff on nukes. Bond runs into henchman (Jaws) and beautiful women to stop the evil mad man.The best part about the are the vehicle sections, and the shooting sections are hard as all hell and mundane. I'm going to throw that out there right now. The vehicle sections have Bond driving real world vehicles with missiles, machine guns, flame throwers, and oil slicks attached to them. What makes the driving sections so grand is the sense of speed. Driving across a bridge, jumping through signs, finding shortcuts to trigger \"Bond Moments\". While these are hard to find (even in on foot sections) they can be satisfying. Every driving section is different from escorts to flying over rooftops to races. All vehicles handle very well even at high speeds and this is what truly matters.The on foot sections are mundane and extremely frustrating. Even on the easiest setting the game throws dozens of bad guys at you and ammo is a loot and hunt type thing. You start out with a puny P99 pistol and the game throws about 10 bad guys at you. The lock on feature is clumsy since you can't lock on unless the camera is facing an enemy. If you get close enough to someone Bond will put his gun away and start meleeing while other guys around him are shooting. This can make you die in very tight spots. The melee is pretty basic with heavy and light punches along with counters. You can hide behind cover, but this tends to be a problem if the cover is taller then Bond can shoot.You can use a lot of gadgets, but they tend to be useless unless the level requires them. You get Q spiders which are remote operated spiders that can blow thing up and go inside little nooks. The coin grenades are pretty straight forward, but have crappy physics and bounce around like rubber balls. There's the nano suit which makes you invisible, but I never even had to use this since stealth in this game is very hard and almost not an option. The rappel gun is what I used most. Being a Bond game I wish the gadgets would have come in more handy, but they are they if you really want to use them. The shooting sections are just so frustrating due to the unbalanced difficulty. I died over 10 times on certain missions, and there are no checkpoints. Some of the longer levels have one, but most levels have none and this can make you throw your controller across the room.The graphics are pretty decent for a 2004 PS2 game. The textures are solid, the audio is nice, and there is only slight framerate problems due to the PS2's limitations. There is online co-op, but this will never be tested since the servers were shut down. There's a lot of missions in this game, and it will keep you busy for a good 8-10 hours depending on how many times you die. The game is pretty solid and you won't be disappointed. Even people who don't like Bond can enjoy this game and that's the beauty of it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

With a never before seen sense of movement and perspective, you will be drawn into Faith&#x2019;s world. A world that is visceral, immediate, and very dangerous. Live or die? Soar or plummet? One thing is certain, in this city, you will learn how to run.","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"The Loneliness of the First-Person Runner","reviewText":"The biggest difference between Mirror's Edge for the PS3 and the PC is that the PC can support Phys-X.  This is a relatively new technology that adds a layer of realism by dropping real-world behavior into the game using complex real physics formulae.  Believe me, this makes a big difference:  shattering glass, blowing smoke, billowing curtains and more are substantially different.  Unfortunately, if you don't bring some hefty hardware to the table, you'll run into serious problems that make the game unplayable.  Even substantially powerful machines may still have this issue.  Patches have been released to address this issue, but even that success will vary depending on the system and the configuration.If you are experiencing performance problems, the first thing to do is turn Phys-X support off.  Next, disable anti-aliasing:  the way the world of Mirror's Edge is designed, AA does not add enough to the experience to make it worthwhile for gameplay to suffer.Mirror's Edge is the first immersive game experience that can truly capture the high-speed acrobatics of Parkour and fuse it with an action game that, in defiance of years of shooters, actually demands that you think of your own survival first. The beauty of it is that there are times when you start thinking like a Runner and suddenly you're doing combination moves that you figured out an instant before you pulled them off: the acrobatics are fluid and seamless and the environment does a good job of guiding you by sparse colors that light the next object you need in neon red.This game was originally written for the console.  While many console ports are very frustrating on the PC, with Mirror's Edge you get a mixed bag.  On the one hand, it seems like the keyboard is more responsive (and faster) than the PS3's controller.  Aiming is a thousand times easier when you have the pinpoint precision of a mouse instead of the sluggish jerkiness of a thumb stick.  On the other hand, PC gamers know the ropes when it comes to games:  performance can drop at any time, and for any reason--and when it does, in a fast-paced action game like Mirror's Edge you are screwed.When those beautiful moves don't work, it can be very, very frustrating. Sometimes the combination you need to work to get out of somewhere isn't obvious, or worse yet, it's extremely hard. You may land on a surface, only to have Faith keep moving and slide off the other side, unable to backpedal under the impetus of your jump. And of course there are also \"duh\" moments where the \"wall-run\" key (space bar) being the same as the \"jump\" key means if you're not spot-on, Faith does the wrong thing, and away you go into space.Which is the scary part: knuckle-biting adrenaline moments where you just sealed your doom play out all the way to the crunch of hitting the pavement. Being shot to pieces leaves you with a slow-mo falling sensation that will give you amusement-park vertigo and near-death-experience chills. I put this down to simple \"oops\" mistakes, but one larger complaint that looms is that you are a skinny twenty-something in a roomful of heavily armored SWAT and police soldiers, some of whom are carrying belt-fed miniguns. You are supposed to get a reward for making it all the way through the game without killing anyone, and I find it extremely unlikely, especially on the last level, that this is possible to do. Even more so, you get a trophy if you can avoid getting shot--I simply do not believe that is possible.This game has been agony and ecstasy for me, and when I beat it I felt exhilarated. If you are a high-energy gamer who has the patience to try and try again, you will find yourself rewarded. If not, you should know ahead of time that there's no cathartic blasting your way out of trouble in this game. Mirror's Edge marks the beginning of a new genre: the First-Person Runner.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0001KUE7S","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. If your PC has the juice to set this game loose and you have a thirst for first-person shooter action, you're in for a treat. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have.Hell on MarsYour character is a low-ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the Mars Research Facility of the United Aerospace Corporation (UAC). That's pretty much all the backstory you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the storyline department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of the Doom franchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?), it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well-crafted sound effects succeeded at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth... ethereal Revenants fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy... a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll often find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might easily be solved by duct-taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.Looking GoodDoom 3looks incredible. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. The eye candy does come at a price, though, and we were forced to play at fairly low resolution even on a Pentium IV 2.8 GHz and an ATI Radeon 9500. Even so, gameplay was smooth as silk. For higher resolutions (1024 x 768 and above) the latest generation of ATI or Nvidia cards is suggested.--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessRich variety of enemiesPlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineStiff system requirementsNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multiplayer options","reviewerName":"Corey Turner \"The Musician\"","summary":"5 Years?","reviewText":"Being blown away from this game was what many of us thought,ecspecially since it took five years.I wasn't the least bit blown away from the actual gameplay as it wasn't as spooky as aclaimed.I will say the environments(though incredibally dark 2/3's of the time) were outstanding.They kept it almost as good as the PC version.The online is incredible too.The online truly saved this game as the co-op is tense.When your bud dies and you have no clue where he is and you have only a flahslight, your in for some quick and fun manuvering.It requires some teamwork though wit hno gameovers it feels as though there is no penalty for dying not even a repeat/checkmark zone.The load times could be better online and the frame rate online could of been abit smoother,but requiring so much power you can't complain of lag.The death matches are almost pointless but they do have a good variety of weapons and uprgrades to keeps the battles going.The level designs are cool some places feel very familiar and soem are completly new,so thats a nice bonus.The gampeplay is what truley dissapointed me the most.It's bassically run n' gun ok i can deal with that Halo was run n' gun.Though this game just feels so slow and you feel lost looking for little keycards and pin points on your navigation system and the countless enemies just become boring.Don't get me wrong the games fun for a half hour or so but then it becomes the same thing over and ove ragain.The controls are nice all the screens seem adequate.The weapons felt somewhat balanced.Overall I'd reccamend a rental at tops.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2005"}

And it is lot of fun as well!","reviewText":"I played this game and I beat it. This game is a lot of fun and I highly recommend it especially if you were a fan of the other 2 games. Graphics? This is simply the greatest looking video game ever for a video game console. Nothing is even close. There is so much detail and interaction with the environments. And there are plenty of times where your jaw will drop. Story? The story is very good and makes sense but it is a slight notch below Uncharted 2. It is still a very good story especially when they explain Nathan and Sully's past history. Control? You have a lot more control of Nathan and he moves nicely and smooth whether he is climbing, shooting, fighting or anything else he does. There are a lot more fighting animations. However, the aiming was just a little bit smoother in Uncharted 2. It isn't nowhere near as bad as some other people complain about but once in a while, I noticed the aiming issue with little lag and deadzone at times. Gameplay? The gameplay is simply great as Uncharted 2 because Nathan Drake is going on an adventure with amazing graphic environments, battling enemies with lot more weapons and hand to hand fights, more running chases, more epic moments, more exploring, more puzzles, etc. The game is also longer the previous. I would give this game a 92 score out of 100. Get it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2011"}

I beat it and shelved it for a while. I heard a patch was coming out for the aiming, and realized that was the problem. I did a second playthrough a few months after that to get my platinum. Something still dodnt feel right compared to the other games. I hen shelved it again for about a year and I recently beat it again. After my third playthrough I finally think its the best in the series. I think the second would be if it had some of the mechanics I love in this game such as the melee combat and the throwback of grenades. I think the campaign was slightly better in 2 but I think the gameplay and pretty much everything else is better in this one. It grew on me.

Many reviewers out there really just bring the score down for minutely small details and flaws such as taking too many shots to kill enemies or comparing it to Modern Warfare 2.  However, with this sort of game, you really have to look at the big picture, admiring the package as a whole and how carefully polished each aspect of the game is even though some parts of the game may be slightly imperfect.The campaign is the second best of the series, following the masterpiece story that was excellently told in Halo: CE.  The third best would be that of Halo 3: ODST for personal reasons despite the second and third games' epic scales.  While friendly A.I. are helpful on grounded missions, they become utterly atrocious behind the wheel just as with all other halo games.  Fortunately, the enemy A.I., especially the Elites, are absolutely nightmarish to deal with on heroic/legendary.  Their complex and unpredictable behavior and the sandbox qualities of each level adds tons of replay value to the campaign.If the campaign isn't enough for you, head on over to the bread-and-butter of Bungie's excellent series, the multi-player, now including tons of customization,options, and a plethora of modes to choose from.  A beefed up forge, firefight, huge maps, and the inclusion of armor abilities add a whole layer of fresh to the series.When starting the game up, I noticed the menu layout was especially striking and sleek.  This amount of polish and care is carried over to all parts of the game.  Imagine that!While Bungie has always been super artistic with all of their games, the art, design, and visuals in this game are the best of the series and make you stop in your steps and drool at the amazingly detailed and believable background vistas and back-drops.  It's truly a sight to behold and gives the planet Reach its own character.  In addition, wildlife makes its first appearance in this game, which is a definite plus in my book.In the end, Halo Reach is absolutely stunning in every aspect and delivers on all fronts despite few, if any, flaws and poor design choices.  If you're a Halo fan and you want to witness a satisfying conclusion to the Halo series by Bungie, don't even think one second and pick this game up ASAP even if you're a newcomer to the Halo series.  There's something in this game for everyone!  I'd even hand over more than $60 for a game like Halo Reach.  Seriously, it's that great.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00000J9J9","description":"One of the best things about the Game Boy Color is that it's  basically an original Nintendo Entertainment System that can fit in  your pocket. What this means for gamers is that many of the great games  for the classic system are being ported to the Game Boy Color, giving  us a chance to re-play (or in some cases discover) the best game titles  from the '80s.Nintendo's ownSuper Mario Bros. Deluxeis among the first of  these conversions, and it certainly remains one of the best. Actually,  calling this game a conversion really doesn't do it justice. This  version actually contains more levels than the original game, including  the entire Japanese version and a slew of extras (such as a two-player  mode).The controls in this game are easy to grasp--even for novice gamers.  All Mario can do is jump (and shoot fireballs with the right power- ups), but it is amazing to see how much gameplay can be squeezed from  these simple actions when the controls work in direct harmony with a  player's thoughts. The only element of this game that could have been  better is that the Game Boy Color's screen isn't quite large enough to  show the entire layout of the original game screen, so players may  occasionally need to press up and down on the control pad to see some  offscreen action. While this can be distracting, it ultimately has  minimal impact on gameplay. If you are looking for the quintessential  side-scrolling platform game, you can't do much better thanSuper  Mario Bros. Deluxe.--T.

Accordingly, a rerelease for the Game Boy Color seemed fitting. All 32 levels from the NES classic are back, in all their pixelated glory. The music is left unchanged from the NES as well! Plus, once you beat the 32 normal levels, you get to play through them again in an expert mode with tougher enemies more common and smaller lifts. Beat those and you get 32 NEW levels, from the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2 (these are often called &quot;The Lost Levels&quot; in America.) In addition to these amazing features, there is a challenge mode where you must find a hidden Yoshi egg, 5 red coins, and get a high score. There's even a mode where you have to race to the end of a unique level against Boo! Lastly, the game contains several extras you can print out with your Game Boy Printer, which increase in number as you progress through the game.

I'm a big fan of the McElroy brothers (MBMBAM!), but it's safe to say that I don't have Griffin's taste in video games.One other reviewer here, who gave the game 1 star yet still praised it, summed it well: You'll either love it (5 star) or hate it (1 star). \"Fun\"-wise, I gave it 1 star, mostly because I've never been so frustrated so soon in a game, especially a highly-rated game. I tend to do a lot of research before I buy a game, because I don't want to waste my time and energy, and I usually find something to enjoy in the games I play.Overall, it's probably a 2 star game, for what I like in games (Amazon's 2 star rating supposedly means \"I don't like it.\"). I'm sure the maps are huge with lots of exploration options. The graphics are decent enough, though I wasn't blown away by the first level. There's lots of character customizing. The real buzz-kill is the sound design. Every step you take sounds like you're walking on corn flakes. After walking through water, it sounds like you have a couple of sloshing buckets for feet. Sometimes when you get hit, your character makes a lame whimpering sound.It's ridiculously difficult. You die constantly. To some extent, it's part of the game, as the story line revolves around everyone being dead? or something like that. But it's too much. I died so many times in the opening level, and waited for it to reload, and fought the same baddies, over and over. It was just tedious. I'm sure part of it is learning the finicky and unforgiving melee.Maybe I should spend more time trying to figure it out. But, life's too short, and I've got a stack of games I know I'll like. It doesn't make sure to force myself to play this. It feels like work.Luckily, I was able to find it at Red Box, and I'd recommend spending two dollars and an hour or two before biting the full price. Who knows?

(one of the puzzles are somewhat simular to 2008's highly underratedDark Sector.)The concept is somewhat original or shall i say, timely as there have been an influx of dystopian films as of late:Book of Eli, The Road, Daybreakers and now Legion.Out of these films I would say Darksiders falls more within legion's camp as the protagonist War is responsible for igniting the apocalypse and is forced to take on both demons and Angels and like the movie Legion, War packs a Pistol.I mistakingly purchased  this game for the PS3 instead of the 360, but when I heard that this game was orginally programmed for the PS3 meaning better framerate while the XB360 version is a port, I think of my error as a blessing in disguise.Aestethics aside, the game provides some decent voice acting especially from the former Jedi Master himself: Mark Hamil and the Music is nothing to shout about (that's where the 360's customm soundtrack option would have been helpful.) but it's doable.The game has received stellar reviews from most VG publishers even 1Up, however those Anal retents a G4TV/X-Play gave it a 2 out of 5.This is from the same guy (Adam Sessler) who gave Dark Sector a 2 butToo Humana freaking Four ?!?overall solid game and worth buying if not a rental.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2010"}

It did fix the issue for some players (those who made ONE character in ME1, and then never altered it again, just imported it), but not for others.  Female characters seem to be the most broken.  For more detailed information on this, visit their forums for the game and search for the topic with the title, \"ME2 Faces Cannot Be Represented In ME3 (Even After 1.02, Especially Females).\"In the time I have spent waiting for a patch for the (inexcusable) face-import bug to be fixed, Bioware has also announced downloadable content (an \"extended cut\") to address the endings which everyone seems to hate (I don't know for myself yet, as I swore not to play the game until the face import was fixed, and I am now just working through it), to be released this summer.  They are also doing multiplayer promotions to try to get people to play the multiplayer game.I will update this review with a final verdict once I have finished the game, but now, that the (inexcusable) face import bug has been addressed (I still *CANNOT* believe they DARED to release this thing to market knowing full well that feature was broken -- if they was a surefire way they were going to anger long-term fans, that was it) I am setting my review to an undecided 3 stars.  I will issue a final rating once I have finished my first play through.As things stand right now, Bioware has still lost all of my trust. [...]I cannot tell you how excited I was to get this game. I have been a day-1 player of the Mass Effect games since the original game's debut. I didn't even know there were any known problems with the game until I had gotten done with installing both discs to the HDD, downloading all of the content that came with the collector's edition, and registering the game with EA's Origin service (which I am not at all happy about, but don't really have a choice about). So, there I was, happily running through the game start-up, after finally finishing with all of those tasks, getting ready to settle in for a game-launch-night play session, and I fired up the character importer to carry over my character I have been playing with since the first game. My custom \"femshep\" who imported fine into ME2. And that is when I got hit with the error, \"Mass Effect 3 cannot successfully determine the custom face code used by this imported save game. Please update your character's appearance.\"I thought to myself, \"surely this is a weird glitch, they have been promising continuity for all 3 games as one of the major selling points for the game, since ME1 launched.\" So, I popped online and looked for the text of the error, and that is when I found out I wasn't alone. The Mass Effect 3 forums are exploding with people yelling about this, and Bioware was aware enough of this before they shipped they game, that they had an EA \"help\" page already setup with a response to the error,\"Will I be able to make changes to my Shepard when I import?You will be given the option to alter the appearance of Shepard, and you will be able to change class (i.e. Soldier to Adept) as well.NOTE: Some ME2 saves will not be able to import the face-file of your Shepard.

It just wouldn't feel right to be playing as anyone other than MY \"femshep.\" So, I have been forced to shelve the game, and wait for a patch. Their official response to this has been, and I quote, \"Hi everyone, We are aware that some players are having issues importing the faces of characters from Mass Effect 1 or Mass Effect 2 into Mass Effect 3. The issue is likely in how faces were detected when imported from Mass Effect 1 into Mass Effect 2, and we're working on the best way to correct it for affected players.\" They have been silent on the matter ever since -- and their new rules on their forums will get you banned post haste if you complain too loudly or persistently, as well.So, ... they are working on it. No ETA, no apologies, no acknowledgement that they shipped the game knowing full well this was waiting for their 3-game, loyal fans.So, as things stands right now, the game is unplayable for me. I cannot rate it on any other metric right now. I have been hearing rumors of missing characters in cut scenes, and much fewer dialog choices, but I cannot confirm those right now. When/if a patch is ever released that allows me to play with MY \"femshep\" character whom I have been playing the game with since ME1, I will update this review with a new rating, and an evaluation of the rest of the game. Until such time as a patch has been released that fixes this, in my opinion, game breaking bug. The 1 star rating stands.I am afraid that this behavior from Bioware since their take-over from EA has broken my remaining loyalty to them. All Bioware games used to be day-1 purchases for me. I trusted them.I no longer do.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2012"}

Just a tip:  if you look around you can get some older games for Wii and other systems very cheap.I like FPS games, but never got into them on the computer (the mouse/keyboard combo just doesn't work for me - I've been a console gamer all my life), and have a number for PS2 that are good to great.As far as WWII games go, I'm very familiar with the Medal of Honor games (though I've not played any on Wii).After a few weeks of play my overall impression is that this is a worthwhile game.  The Wii is tailor-made for FPS, with point-and-shoot aiming.  Now, your base mechanics, ie the majority of what you do, fits the Wii-mote & nunchuck very well.  A couple of issues though - having to rely on the \"-\"  (minus) button to switch weapons and reload is a bit of a pain.  It's just not in a great position for constant access.  Kind of the same with the cross pad to throw grenades, though in general I don't find that as cumbersome.What I like about this game is that you DO feel like you're part of a squad or group.  The NPC AI on both sides is OK - no better or worse than most FPS - and enemy soldiers in general will try to take cover and remain out of site.  THis gets a bit iffy when you rush a position and they stand there 10 feet away looking at you.  Not too quick on the draw.There are fairly brief sections where you control vehicles (jeep or tank) that actually control surprisingly well, and serve as little breaks in the first-person action.Complaints are fairly minor:  cut scenes are not skippable, aiming is at times a bit wonky (all FPS suffer from this to some degree, I'm afraid) so you will sometimes clearly shoot someone and it has no effect.  Maybe \"aiming\" isn't the issue so much as hit detection.  One other thing - and again this is true of many/most FPS games - sometimes you can be stuck wandering around without knowing what to do until you trigger the next \"event\" by reaching a pre-set area.  Of course if there's a big enemy counter-attack they shouldn't start it until you're there.  But still, it can make the flow feel a bit \"canned\".  Also, some of these events can lead to great frustration (warehouse level, I'm looking at you) as enemies continue to spawn until certain objectives are met.Overall this is a fun game.  People make far too much out of the graphical differences between the Wii and the 360/PS3.  This is a very good game on its own merits and any comparison to those other versions is not really useful.  I will also add this:  if you've played more recent Wii FPS like Goldeneye...well, this game feels more than a little dated, both graphically and otherwise.  It's still fun, and it's not fair to compare it to a game much later in the Wii's lifecycle, but it's worth noting.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2012"}

Arkham Asylum is that game.  I put it in at about 1:00 PM, and I completely forgot about supper and bedtime.  Fourteen hours later, I was absolutely amazed that so much time had passed.There are a few stages here that I did not like.  I didn't enjoy the sewer stage with Killer Croc, for instance.  Plus, the button mashing does tend to get repititive.  But there is a knack invovled in the combat system.  You can get good at it.  And there is nothing like mashing up against a horde of baddies and seeing results.  I'll even go out on a limb and say that this might have been the most exciting button masher I have ever played.It also takes some elements from Assassin's Creed.  The sneak from behind attack is pretty awesome.  It's not a necessary skill to learn, but it sure does make a lot of scenes a lot easier.User controls are also quite intuitive and even streamlined.  The learning curve was small, and that's pretty amazing considering all of the tools you get to use.  The boss fights were absolutely awesome.  My only complaint with this game is how pushing in the right toggle causes the view to zoom.  I didn't use that feature once intentionally, but I always seemed to be hitting it accidentally at key points.I wouldn't give this game a full 10 out of ten if I could rate it bsed on such an accurate measurement system.

By moving around with the Nunchuk and aiming Samus's gun with the Wii Remote, you'll do more than look through the eyes of Samus&#8212;you'll experience a quantum leap in first-person control.

You'll need to carefully balance your need for ultimate power with the inherent danger of corruption.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"The Perfect Game for the Wii","reviewText":"Ever since the Wii's launch, good games have been few and far between.  Certainly we got good games like The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess and we got a ton of mini-game compilations, but for the most part, the Wii has been getting mini-game compilations, ports with tacked on Wii controls, and games that were originally slated for the Gamecube.  Now we've finally got a high quality Wii game built from the ground up: Metroid Prime 3: Corruption.  Nintendo once again sets the bar.  Metroid Prime 3 is not only fun and easy to get into, but the controls are just an intuitive as ever.The game begins when Samus returns to Galatic Federation Station Olympus, a base of operations.  She's there to report for duty to Admiral Dane, as are other bounty hunters.  It appears the space pirates are up to no good as they've planted a virus in a series of the Galatic Units super computers, the Aurora Units.  Just as Admiral Dane is explaining how the bounty hunters must go and neutralize the virus, Olympus comes under attack.  It's time to suit up, escape Olympus station and get started on your mission.  Samus is not alone through her journey, as she has the help of other bounty hunters as well.  No, you won't get to play as any of them.You'll begin the game with a fairly basic arsenal.  Your power beam at your disposal, along with your morph ball and bombs for your morph ball.  As is usual for the Metroid formula, you'll get several upgrades along the way.  Including missiles, grapple beam, upgrades for your power beam and morph ball and a plethora of other upgrades.Playing the game itself is fairly simple with the Wii Remotes controls.  Using the joystick on the nunchuck you can go forward, backward, strife left and right.  Pressing the C Button goes into morph ball mode.  Pressing and holding Z locks you onto an enemy target.  Pressing A on the Wii Remote is how you'll fire your weapon, while pressing B makes you jump.  You can turn Samus by simply moving the cursor on screen via the Wii Remote left or right.  It's all pretty basic and all pretty simple.  The 1 button pulls up your map while the 2 button will supply you with hints to your objective.  These controls are pretty tight and simple to learn.  The game will also help you out every step of the way by providing hints to help you out.  It can sometimes feel like the game is holding your hand, but if you really want to go at things on your own, you can turn the hints off.  If at any time you have trouble with the controls, you're able to change them.  You can also change the sensitivity of the Wii Remote.How the game uses motion sensors, however, is where it gets innovative.  Throughout the game you'll have to pull switches or press in switches.  While Samus will interact with some things on her own accord, there are plenty of moments when you'll have to do it.  For example, at the very beginning of the game, you'll have to control Samus's hand movements with the Wii remote and make her press buttons.  Later you'll have to pull switches by pulling the Wii Remote back, and then turning the same switch clockwise (or counterclockwise)  and then pushing it back in.Even more engaging is using the grapple beam.  To use the grapple beam you'll have to flail the nunchuck forward and then pull back to flail whatever it is your targeting.  You can only target specific things, however, and usually the game will provide you with an icon to let you know.  This is also essential to the gameplay as you'll also encounter enemies who use shields and you'll have to use your grapple beam to take them away before you can damage them.A lot of your weapons and accessories will receive upgrades as you go through the game.  New to Metroid Prime, however, is hypermode.  Soon in your adventure you'll get the Phazon Enhancement Device (called a PED).  This will allow you to enter hypermode.  While in hypermode your attacks become more devastating.  You can't stay in hypermode forever, though, and while it's a great asset to you, it'll cost you one full energy tank to transform, so you'll have to watch your health.As with previous entries in the series, though, Metroid Prime 3 wants you to scan things.  Switching to the scanning visor is easier than ever here.  Just press and hold the minus button and you'll be able to switch to the scan visor easily and scan your targets using the Z button.  Like previous Metroid Prime games it plays a part in completion.  Here it isn't just for completion, but also to access unlockables.  Throughout the game you're awarded credits.  Red credits, blue credits and gold credits.  Most of these credits (such as the red and blue) will be earned through scanning.  Red credit are obtained when you scan new creatures, blue when you scan new lore and gold is awarded when you meet special conditions such as defeating a boss.  You can also obtain credits in others ways, such as saving allies in distress.  The game also presents friend vouchers to you, and these are also acquired through meeting special conditions as well as getting lots of kills throughout the mission.  Friend Vouchers are useless on their own, but send them off to friends and they'll instantly become friend credits for them.  If you want friend credits, have a friend send you friend vouchers.The credits will grant you access to some of the games galleries, like the concept gallery, the bonus gallery and the soundtrack gallery.  There are tons of extras and a ton of scanning to be done to get them.Another aspect that Metroid hasn't changed.  Throughout the game there are missile expansions and energy tanks for you to collect and the game keeps track of all your pickups.  For completists this is perfect.  As you don't have to get all, but getting to some of them can be a challenge.  This is what is so nice about Metroid, it encourages exploration.  However, you won't find yourself lost ever.  The game is very good about telling you what to do next and where to go, and the in game map is also detailed about it and puts your objective there.  So even if you decide to explore, getting back on the main path is no hassle. One crucial thing the Metroid Prime series has suffered through, however, is how they use their save rooms.  They're too few and far between and Metroid Prime 3 is no exception.  It's a pain to complete an objective, but be too far from a save room and then die because of a surprise attack from a group of enemies.The games boss battles are monumental, though.  Each boss battle is a memorable one and makes the gameplay intense.  Mostly because many bosses you have to meet certain conditions before you can actually damage them.  This adds a bit of strategy to many of the battles.The environments here are beautiful looking, at least, and huge.  Absolutely fantastic.  In terms of showing us what the Wii can do, this is a good start.  By far it's the most beautiful looking game on the system to date.  The environments are detailed as are your enemies who will hunt you down.  The game also doesn't suffer from any framerate issues or long load times. The game also sounds breathtaking.  Almost every part of the sound is a winner.  The sound effects are perfect, and the background music is brilliant.  Some tunes are remixed from previous Metroid titles (notably Super Metroid), while all the new stuff is just as good.  The voice acting is also brilliant.Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is a brilliant game.  Well worth the wait.  The amount of time put into the game shows.  Hopefully we'll see more games like it in the future, and ones that make as good of use out of the Wii Remote as this one did.Pros:+Gorgeous graphics+Fantastic soundtrack+Good voice acting+Tight intuitive controls+Intense boss battles+Lots of bonus content+Huge maps to exploreCons:-Save rooms are too few and far between","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"Sam Maisel \"samtheman_17\"","summary":"Insomniac Games is back, and better than ever!","reviewText":"One of the first PS2 games that I definately wanted to get was Spyro 4.

{"product_name":"B000088KH9","description":"Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis the third in the successful mission-based stealth series that first appeared on the PlayStation in 1998; few changes have been made to the basic format. Players can once again choose to be either Rikimaru, the silent sword-wielding assassin, or Ayama, the acrobatic younger ninja. Both characters pass through the same game world, but each has slightly different goals that take them on different routes. A third character can be unlocked later on.During the first mission, you're required to choose a number of weapons to aid you in your immediate tasks. Throughout the game, more and more weapons--from melee to ranged weapons--are added to your arsenal depending on your performance during each level; your chosen weapons dictate how you approach the mission goals. The silent approach is always encouraged, and there's a variety of graphically satisfying stealth kills that will only work if you remain elusive and strike unexpectedly and silently.Aside from the stealth kills, the game is a mixed bag in terms of its graphics. Light shimmers off your sword menacingly, but the environments are bland and repetitive, and the game fails to maximize on differences between light and dark areas in ways that might have added to the experience. Also, the stealth dynamic is made less challenging by the shortsightedness and slow reactions of the enemy guards and the iffy AI. Since guards give up searching for you within seconds and are unable to follow you through doors, this potentially atmospheric and tactical stealth game is actually just a hack-and-slash arcade romp. Multiplayer options are included, though, so if you feel the need for a more realistic opponent, you may want to call a friend.Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis still an enjoyable experience despite its flaws. It&#x92;s just a shame that, after doing so much to establish and define the stealth-game genre, it fails to raise the bar or introduce any novel elements. The game feels more like an update of the first Tenchu, and while this is no bad thing, fans will probably be expecting more.--Chris Ryan, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"I.

One thing is certain - Black &amp; White is more of an experiment than a game.  The backbone of B&amp;W is a god RTS - you have little villages on tropical islands which you watch over as their guardian deity.  You can play either as Good or Evil or anywhere in between - anything you want to do is allowed.  To top it off, you have a gigantic creature (like a 50 foot monkey) acting as your pupil/pet in the world, which you can train to do your bidding.Your creature is definitely the highlight of the game - the Artifical Intelligence is revolutionary and absolutely amazing.  They watch watch you, imitate you, and learn from you.  You can teach them things like go find food when the village store is empty and poop in the fields instead of on people's houses.  Eventually I've heard you can teach them really complex tasks like planting and growing forests.  However, it takes hours of dedication to get your creature beyond the simplest of things.  To me, the pace of creature learning is just too slow.  Casual gamers will not get much from the game with only a few hours of playtime.  Also, the methods which the game expects you to communicate with your creature are usually hidden from you and often subtle.  Often my advisors would comment that my creature had learned something completely different from what I was trying to teaching him.Take away your creature (which actually happens on one level) and you have a generic, shallow RTS game, with limited options.  The hyped ability to play as either Good or Evil is also very shallow and limited.  Both sides have to impress villagers into worshiping them - Good gods do so by casting Good miracles, Evil gods cast evil miracles.  That's all there is to it.  There is no strategy except to train your creature to do your work, so that you are effectively 2 places at once.  Supposedly the land would change to reflect your alienment, but the only thing I have witnessed is my temple growing horns when I'm evil, and doves circle the temple when I'm good.  Many promised features of the game obviously did not make it into the final release.The single player story mode in Black and White is very good yet riddled with bugs and uncertain goals.  Constantly you are presented with moral challenges that push you to do good while testing your patience.  For example, 3 lazy sailors need help getting their boat afloat, but they are so annoying in their songs that you will certainly be tempted to chuck the little twerps out to sea without their boat.  Then there are quests which are so vague you don't know what to do, or at least logical solutions do nothing.  Plus, many many bugs seem to halt your progress as well.  One quest with some stolen cattle I completely on my first play thru, but on my second time around the same actions did nothing. ???In the end, I'd recommend you buy the game after the patch comes out, just to see what the fuss is about.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2001"}

{"product_name":"B00AMA4L4E","description":"The most controversial game in recent years returns in this special director's cut. Unofficially the best game of the year (2010) according to fans and critics alike, Deadly Premonition split the gaming community right down the middle and earned itself cult status for its memorable cast and story.","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"A Richer, Bolder Blend","reviewText":"Jim Sterling of Destructoid fame once described \"Deadly Premonition\" as \"watching two clowns eating each other,\" in the sense that such a thing is perverse and wrong, yet hilarious and able to grasp your attention in a choke-hold. While some critics missed the entire point of the experience (IGN, for example), SWERY's sick yet beautiful game managed to carve out an audience in today's gaming landscape, an impressive feat for a $20 budget game.Fast-forward three years, and the video game industry is in turmoil. Corporate corruption, homogenized sequels, and AAA titles that simply attempt to outdo each other as opposed to being genuinely good games... everything is messed-up, and it seems developers have forgotten what it means to make interactive entertainment. Not Access Games, though, because their massive facelift of their modern cult classic reminds us that there are still developers that give a darn. Somehow managing to improve an already perfect game, \"Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut\" is what we, the gaming community, need. And I can't think of finer praise to heap on a something.Before delving into this version specifically, it's important to introduce new players to the events of the game. FBI Agent Francis York Morgan (call him York, though, everybody else does) is sent to the sleepy town of Greenvale to investigate the bizarre murder of a local girl. The method in which she was killed is similar to other cases he's investigated, so he quickly takes over the case. However, things get weirder from there. From \"mysterious capitalists\" that wear gas masks to futures being read in a morning cup of coffee, and from a killer decked out in a red raincoat to people being turned into freaking tress, this game pulls out all the stops in its attempt to confuse players.What's most beautiful about the narrative, however, is how many genres it encompasses. It works as a metaphysical drama, as a serial killer murder mystery, as a black comedy, as a romance, as... well, it works on just about any level. It will make you laugh as many times as it shocks you, and oftentimes, it will do both at the same time. Not only that, but the characters are truly memorable. York, the perky blond officer Emily, workout nut George and others will stick with you for years to come, and make you wonder why today's gaming landscape is still filled with such cookie-cutter characters, when such original ones are housed in a game that costs a small fraction of what AAA titles run. While growing attached to these protagonists, you'll laugh, cry and most importantly, be entertained.One thing that still impresses is the ability to essentially stalk every single character in the game through their daily routine. In an ambitious AI system (where most of the game's budget was admirably sunk), every person in the cast, and even people who aren't part of the narrative, have their own schedules. There are no random pedestrians, no repeated character models; you can follow everybody for in-game weeks, and see their schedules shift over time. It's an amazing system, and one that can give you serious insight into even the most minor of characters.As far as new story content goes, we have a new intro, outro, and segments that intersperse the main narrative. It adds new framework to the game, and puts everything in a much different context than before: a story being told to a little girl by her grandfather (who is obviously a certain character from the game.) This little twist makes everything a bit more terse, in my opinion, and was a bold direction for Swery to take. Fans are sure to enjoy these characters' interactions, and newcomers are in for a slightly more fulfilling story.Now, the differences in this Director's Cut are subtle, but they make all the difference in the world. Combat still functions \"Resident Evil 4\"-style, making players stand in place as they shoot from an over-the-shoulder perspective. However, it works more fluidly here, and the controls are much more responsive. But the largest area of improvement in the combat department can definitely be seen in the melee area; using pipes, knives and even laser swords (yes, they're unlockable)feels like a viable alternative and not a crippled mechanic. Furthermore, the addition of a more pronounced weapon durability meter is a godsend. Overall, the combat feels more fluid and enjoyable, and it's a lot easier to respond when the horrific eyeless zombie-things pop out of nowhere.On the exploration side, we have some definite improvements. The biggest of these, in my opinion, is definitely the minimap. No longer are you forced to go into a screen in order to navigate the sprawling environment; you can keep up a map to help you figure out where you need to be at all times. Furthermore, York's main control scheme has improved, as has the camera. The quirky agent can finally move freely in any direction, and the camera doesn't annoying snap back to the center anymore. Control-wise, this is definitive version of \"Deadly Premonition.\"The other big change is apparent as soon as you start playing: the graphics. While it still doesn't look like a big-budget retail title, the visual aesthetics of this game are a definite improvement over the past version. High-definition adds a new level of depth to the game, most noticeably on the new character models. Veins bulge, mouths are lined with teeth, and you can see strands of hair in more detail (especially on York.) Furthermore, the environments are much more detailed; signs that used to clash with their locations now blend smoothly, and building interiors are rendered with the utmost attention to the smallest of things. That being said, I do wish more attention had been paid to the outdoors. Water looks jarringly plain, and some of the grass textures are rather blurry and ugly. Overall, it's a definite improvement, but some issues I wish had been addresses were left alone.My biggest complaint about the HD transfer, really, is the framerate. Namely, it kind of sucks in some areas. This only really affects cutscenes and exploring areas with a lot things on the screen (expect a lot of pop-in textures), but it's still a noticeable problem. While this is something that could probably be patched out, it's something I take some issue with.The sound department is a mixed bag. True, we do still have the wonderful, eclectic score and the offbeat, lovable voice acting. That's all still there. But unfortunately, the audio is poorly mastered, and jarringly so. Sound effects are too loud, voices too quiet, and the music not as enjoyable due to the fact that you're trying to listen to the characters. Everything players loved about the game is still there, but handled in an incredibly inept fashion. Thankfully, you can tamper with the three audio tracks to reach the right level, but seeing how this was never an issue in the original, I consider it a flaw of this version.How does one review \"The Director's Cut\", then? As a game, it's still everything I fell in love with, topped with some additional narrative bits, and some really stellar gameplay improvements. But as a definitive cut, it falls a bit flat due to the framerate issues and sound complaints. Overall, \"Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut\" is very much worth buying if you haven't played the original, or if you were a rabid fan of it. The gameplay is better than it's ever been, and the graphics are as good as they're going to get. All others, however, may find that the A/V issues dissuade them from completing their journey into Greenvale's twisted web of intrigue.\"Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut\" is like a shot of espresso; there's a definite audience for it, and newcomers should try it if they haven't already, but for others, it might be a bit too dirty and strong to handle.Game: 10Director's Cut: 8.5Overall: 9.25","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2013"}

The idea of continuing with a story from an earlier game is good, but they definitely picked the wrong one to go with.  Wouldn't it have been much cooler to see Cloud and the aftermath of FF VII?  The story is just terribly uninteresting in this game.  What I absolutely hated was the amount of \"humor\" that they tried to put in.  I felt like this game was geared more toward 14-year-old girls than to the gamers who have been playing FF all along.  Rikku and Brother are the two most annoying characters ever to be in a game.  I couldn't stand listening or seeing either one of them.  This was the first FF game that I didn't play through a second time.

(For those who are Simpson illiterates, that's Mrs. Krabapple describing Millhouse's science fair project.  Millhouse bellows \"Behold the power of gravity!\", and then lets a slinky step once down a ramp.)There are so many great games that I wish they would copy and insert Simpsons characters in.  The only time I ever played Doom on the PC was when someone installed the Simpson?s wad.  To be Homer Simpson and to fight giant Flanders throwing Bibles at you me was great fun.  Of course, when they blatantly copied a game, they had to blatantly copy one of the worst games out there - Crazy Taxi.  Why couldn't they copy something good, like Grand Theft Auto 3.  They could have had a hit with Grand Theft Donut.The fact it's the Simpsons and you drive through Springfield is pretty cool.  That's about it.  The 10 missions levels are decent enough to finish, but aren't exactly fun.  The graphics are decent, and they actually have the characters speak which is somewhat fun, though not clever or laugh out loud funny.The main game consists of getting money to unlock cars and levels and to get one million dollars.  Each time you go through a run, you gain about $6000.  The run takes about 10 to 15 minutes to complete.  Every 20-30 grand, you can unlock a new level or a new character.  The unfortunate thing is that after 10 rounds, you've done pretty much all there is to do, and the novelty factor wears off.  I got up to $70,000 before being thoroughly bored with this game.  There was no way I was going to unlock all six levels and all seventeen characters.  No way would I even consider trying to get one million dollars, the monotony would have killed me.The Simpsons' Road Rage is a game that gets old really, really fast.

{"product_name":"B001PKHRUK","reviewerName":"CallMeZoidberg","summary":"sinkt: Wolverine's claws are always out in this game, and sharper than you could imagine.","reviewText":"Most gamers know to be suspicious of movie-based games because, frankly, they're almost always terrible - even if the material they're based off of is excellent. Well, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a bit of an anomaly because the game is probably better than the actual movie, and for one reason: rewarding, visceral, brutal combat.This isn't \"Saturday-morning cartoon\" Wolverine or even the Wolverine seen in the film; it's a whole different beast, more true to the original material's primal nature. The game features gore and violence befitting of its \"M\" rating, which is the reason why the game is so fun. From decapitation to dismembering to ripping the mechanical arm off of an enhanced soldier and beating him to death with it (One of my personal favorites), Wolverine never runs out of brutal, satisfying ways to dispatch his foes. The game also employs slow motion and cinematic camera angles beautifully, capitalizing on each and every insane moment.On top of that, Wolverine is almost unstoppable. There is a bar on the screen representing Wolverine's regeneration. Take more damage than he can regenerate, and Wolverine's vitals are exposed, opening up another bar that can be drained, leading to a game over. However, it's not a screen most will be encountering very often, as Wolverine heals rapidly, and the game's foes are rarely enough to incapacitate you. The coolest thing about taking damage in the game is that it's displayed in real-time. As Wolverine survives an onslaught of bullets, explosions, and whatever else the enemies throw at him, his shirt rips to shreds and layers of skin are destroyed, exposing muscle. Take more damage, and his adamantium skeleton is exposed.The average 15-hour experience also gives you an extra layer of depth when you're not hacking people to pieces with experience and a leveling system. Skill points can be used to increase health, damage dished out, and rage, as well as be used to increase the strength of certain, special moves. Aside from maxing Wolverine out, the game also features unlockable costumes and trophies. The unlockable costumes are a nice addition, however, because collected figurines in the game only opens up the option of getting secret costumes. After opening up the bonus option, you'll have to defeat whichever Wolverine you're trying to unlock, which can lead to some rather fun, challenging battles.It doesn't revolutionize the third-person action mechanic, but the game is elevated far beyond hack n' slash, as varied enemy types and situations force the player to react in different ways and take advantage of a wide variety of moves, including \"Fury Attacks\", which can be activated after filling a Rage Meter. Furthermore, some of the best death sequences require skill, combos, and the implementation of \"Quick Kills\", which can be done by pressing Heavy Attack after grabbing an enemy.I had so much fun with the combat that I never felt it get stale, which is why the boss fights were a bit of a disappointment. There are two different types of bosses that reoccur frequently throughout the game, and the strategy for killing both is exactly the same, making them feel more like a chore than an accomplishment. But while the more frequent boss fights got stale quickly, the game also features some unique ones which fare much better - particularly a multistage one against a 250-ft Sentinel.Unfortunately, rewarding and enjoyable combat is where the heavy praise stops. The game sports a few pre-rendered CGI cutscenes, which look fantastic, but the actual in-game graphics aren't much to look at. They occasionally shine, but generally don't look too spectacular. Even the real-time damage, while still cool, lacks detail. Thankfully, Hugh Jackman lends his voice to the character, but the majority of sound effects are average at best - though they serve their purpose well enough. A few glitches, while not a deal breaker, can be a minor annoyance. Once I \"fell\" into an area I wasn't supposed to fall into, forcing me to restart a checkpoint, while the AI occasionally lapses into stupidity and doesn't move. During the rather uninspiring platforming sections, your enemy will occasionally be the camera, which locks in place every once in a while.Most disappointing, however, is the disjointed, utterly confusing narrative. The game hops between \"Three Years in the Past\" (In Africa) and \"Three Years in the Future\"...which is the \"present\", but not really because the opening cinematic is further in the future than the supposed \"present\". Sounds confusing? It is. Furthermore, characters are rarely introduced properly and almost never expounded upon. With the liberties the new film takes in regards to the source material, even X-Men fans that have yet to see the new film might end up confused. Of course, I can't knock the game for certain liberties it took with the story, because it's based on the movie, but Deadpool fans are bound to be disappointed, as well as those (Such as myself) hoping that gambit would play a large role. While the actual story is poor because the story in the movie is poor, the game doesn't help the cause any by making it even more confusing and disjointed.Wolverine's past videogame outings have left the player with a feeling of disappointment because the character feels weakened or has a health bar, despite his regeneration ability. X-Men Origins: Wolverine, on the other hand, embraces the character for all that he is: a badass killing machine. Words can't do justice to the visceral, savage, and brutal combat this game champions. Even a terrible narrative and occasional technical hiccup can't hold this game back, thanks to the unadulterated fun and satisfaction the gameplay brings, as Wolverine is thrown from set-piece to set-piece. The game starts off with Wolverine jumping out of a plane without a parachute, you can beat a certain enemy-type to death with its own arm, and most enemies you face will lose a limb or a head, and that's really indicative of the entire experience. The game is a brutal thrill ride; certainly not the deepest of games, but a ton of fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2010"}

The whole package looks prettier than ever and adds new match-enhancing strategies. It's a pretty big step up and there are very few complaints, but some do exist- the biggest of which is the fact that female characters can do very, very little in this edition.THE LONG: There's a great amount of new material to discuss in this game. So what I'll do is list some of it and give my opinions on each aspect. Online mode is supposed to be much imrpoved, complete with belt-swapping, but I don't have online so I'm afraid I can't describe it. There's lots else to discuss though, so if you want a short review you better skip this one!PRESENTATION: The graphics are very polished. Well-done, realistic animation (season cutscenes are great) plus lots of little details such as the ring announcer saying what kind of match it is, if it's for a belt, character's hometowns, etc. Plus, it's small but great at the same time: Now wrestlers stay in or around the ring even during their opponent's entrance. Just extra realism, and it's really cool. Commentary seems slightly better this time, with some banter about the actual wrestlers as well as some joking and bickering. The comments stay pretty up-to-the-second, even to a fault (pin attempts for example will cause a new comment to interrupt the dialogue). It doesn't get on my nerves and doesn't seem to repeat as noticeably as before, but I admit pretty much everyone else hated it so I guess I'm in the minority. Music is the same hip hop and scream-rock as before, so take it or leave it. There's no music during matches, which isn't too big a deal but bothers me during backstage brawls which wind up feeling eerily quiet. Speaking of brawls, this game has great blood. Instead of just a facial smear it now also leaves droplets on the mat, which follow in a trail of the crimson masked wrestler and even pools up if they stay in one place. Unfortunately it fades away (slowly at least) and they don't have blood everywhere when more than one person is cut. Still, it's very vibrant and realistic- I find myself actively cutting or getting cut, because just like on the show, it gives the impression of hardcore combat.SEASON MODE: Ever since Smackdown 5, the season mode has relied mostly on animated cutscenes and recently the addition of spoken dialogue. Since only so much voice and specific animated scenes can be used, it limited how deep and different the season could be. But this time, it's the best yet. For one thing the acting is better all around the board and very well done- It's not Shakespeare but every single wrestler sounds just as convincing as they do on TV. This is even better thanks to lip synching and lots of subtle animations and gestures. It really feels like watching an actual WWE show this time around.Best of all, the storyline has a lot of surprises. Right away most wrestlers you pick from can play through either a RAW or Smackdown storyline, each one pretty different. But better yet, lots of characters have their own scenarios that are unique and not shared between everyone else. I played through Smackdown with Hogan and later the Undertaker, then RAW with William Regal and Mankind. While some stuff was repeated, every one of the 4 characters had a unique plot twist that wasn't in any of the other 3. In addition, you'll still make a few decisions here and there, some of which lead to entirely different cutscenes. This time there really is motivation to play through the season mode repeatedly. And since anyone you choose has loads of spoken dialogue, playing through with different characters keeps the experience fairly fresh. This is the best way to present the season mode in an interactive way, and I was really impressed (especially since I hated the last 2 games' season modes). One bad thing though- not every character can play through season (no females, but more on that in the summary section). But you do get more than 30 choices and lots of favorites are represented (Kane, Mysterio, Cena, Batista, Triple H, and others) so you'll be busy. This time, the realistic vocal work, animation, and storyline variations made the season mode one of the best parts of the game, which I never thought I'd say.GM MODE: What this is is a WWE booker simulation. You pick from either brand, choose your roster, and compete against the other brand for the best TV ratings, against the CPU OR a 2nd player. You're given total control of what wrestlers go in which match at any point in the card. You can manufacture whatever feuds you want, and make champs of anybody you choose. But you have a certain budget, and some wrestlers cost more than others. Running each show costs money too, as does spending money to throw in cages and ladders and so on. Be careful your wrestlers don't get unhappy by repeatedly losing or getting injured either.The good thing is you can play or simulate any match on your card, so it's wise to help out sometimes when you want a title change or a certain wrestler to stay happy. It's pretty deep, and there's a good half hour of fiddling with options to get the hang of it. It's really addicting when you do, though. My only problem is that a wrestler's popularity has more to do with how well your show is than anything: 2 jobbers could have a main event ladder match, but Triple H in a basic singles match will do just as well. This can be tricky, since it's difficult to push your undercard guys to high popularity. And with no random settings, the same 10 guys will be at the top every time you start a new game of GM mode. So it's definitely challenging, but not impossible- Chris Benoit had about a 65 on my popularity scale, but by careful booking and giving him the much-deserved title belt, I shot him into an 80s rating and he brought in the fans. It's addicting, and though challenging, it's fun to work for it.LOCKER ROOM: This is a basic 3d room where your profile records can be accessed. The game can store multiple profiles on a single card (easily changeable from the main menu), so 2 players can share a card and have different unlocked items and so on. The locker room is cool in that you can color the wall and floor any shade you want, decorate a few spots in the room with any of several dozen unlockable items (like Bobbleheads or tshirts and posters) and modify the furniture a little bit. The whole point is to make the game feel suited to you: Instead of having all your records like belt histories and win/loss records represented in a basic text menu, you now get a customizable room to sort of call your own. Sort of cosmetic and more detail/custom minded than extremely helpful, but I think it's a nice addition.EXHIBITION TITLES: I've wanted this since Smackdown 2 five years ago. You can now, right from the main menu, play a title match of any kind (minus Royal Rumble, Buried Alive, and the women's match) using any wrestler at anytime, and you can even do title vs. title matches. If you like having your own \"fantasy wrestling league\" and don't want to play through GM mode to do it, this is for you. If you want to put a belt up against 5 others in Hell in a Cell and fight a bloody battle to see who'll win, you can. Only this time, it \"matters\" since there's a belt at stake. You can fight for any of the real-life belts (some have to be unlocked) but you can also create the belt of your choice and fight for it too. And if you want to just leave it to fate and let the CPU fight the matches against each other, you can do that- but you DO have to be involved in created-belt matches, which for some reason are only 1 on 1 (lots of match types though). Oh, and created belts are insanely cheaper this time. Play a few matches in season mode and you'll have enough for the best belt you want. One thing: The game does keep track of title histories (and even who was in and what the match was) but it only goes back about half a dozen fights. That's a shame.CUSTOMIZATION: They really want you to make this game as specific as you want it. Besides the Locker room, GM mode, and Exhibition titles, you can now also create an entrance by setting what the wrestlers do at multiple different points during their trip to the ring, as well as fixing lights, camera angles, and pyro. Strangely though, the post-match celebrations are pretty generic, meaning they're always basically the same. Cheesy.More importantly, you now have loads of options for gameplay. Aside from standard difficulty setting, you can go into advanced options and set, on a sliding scale, how much you want the computer to do reversals, how easy it is for you to reverse THEM, how much damage finishers do, and other stuff like that. This way, a player can make it as frustratingly impossible or lazily easy as they want. In addition, all the created belt options are there, and so is Create-A-Wrestler. The latter is slightly imrpoved, with an easier interface. MOST of the items that were there still are, with some extra here and there. In general though, they just look better. Some characters wind up looking about as good as the standard wrestlers, and you can now REALLY tweak the faces. You can still take photos of them for the wrestler select screen too. But it's not all perfect: Still to tassels or realistic neckties (even though Mankind's is 3d, that's unfair!). Altogether still very good though. Create a move-set and stable are the same (but you know what? Now you can build a team's level of compatability!) Create a Pay Per View is in and offers what you think it would, the ability to set up a whole card of matches whenever you wish.NEW MATCH STUFF: For starters, there's a Buried Alive match where you must throw your opponent into a coffin and slam the lid. This match can be a lot of effort, since the other guy can resist being thrown in as well as letting the lid shut. It's tough sometimes (as are most matches, but more on that soon). Also new is the \"Fulfill Your Fantasy\" match, which is a slighly more strategic bra and panties match. In addition to the clothing removal, you can now spank your opponent and hit them with pillows and bounce on a bed. Fans of the original will be pleased with the new silliness (the spanking is meter-based and kind of fun) but anyone who thought bra and panties was already pointless and sexist still won't like it. Oh, and yeah- guys can't participate, which evens out the fact that divas can't do a lot of the more bloody match types either (again, see the Summary).There's a new stamina meter, which can be adjusted or turned off. What it does is slow your character down if he runs around and is too active. He'll get winded and need to catch his breath, which you do anytime by holding select. Big people get tired easier than the littler guys. It's a whole new strategy element to the match and I find it really fun- try wearing them all the way out by irish-whipping them around on the ramp, the watch them slowly try to make it back before the 10 count! Another cool aspect of this is that, realistically, if all participants in a match get absolutely drained, they'll keel over onto the mat and have a 10-count to get up. Again, this can be turned off.And now instead of a \"life bar\", there's only a momentum meter. This sets it up so that if you do lots of different moves and exploit your heel/face side, the meter will build and you'll quickly get your finisher. If you use the same moves over and over or defy your good/bad guy alignment, you won't really fill your meter and will have to change up to get that finisher. This too can be adjusted, but personally I think it's a good, simple way of keeping an eye on how the match is going. It adds to the flow and pace of the match, since your creaming of an opponent can sway quickly if he starts getting in the shots. Body-specific damage still plays an important role too however.There's other new stuff too: Climbing the cage is meter-based, and you can now be grabbed down as well as smacked off (and you can now try to crawl out the cage door too!). You can do possum pins, where you hold down the buttons to play dead and trick your opponent. The new submission system adds the old school \"drop your arm 3 times and you're out\" gimmick. And finally, you can now ignore rope-breaks up until a 5 count to cheat. They really added lots of little (and some big) ways to make the matches feel a lot more like WWE pacing. All of these adjustments have given the matches a \"filled out\" feel- in general the matches now last a little longer and seem more like combat with some decent momentum changes and reversals.UNLOCKABLES: Legends like Mankind, The Rock and Austin, Ted Dibiase, Bret Hart, Andre the Giant and more (including 3 seperate-era Hogans, which really should've just been a wardrobe option like Kane's mask). Old-school blue steel cages, the ECW arena and the gorgeous, outdoor Caesar's Palace WM9 arena. Plus lots of trophies for accomplishments big and small, all of which can be viewed in the Locker Room. Some of these are gotten through the Challenges, which are many and of varying difficulty like last year.SUMMARY: So what do I think? In general, there's very little I dislike about the game. The worst is how females are treated. I play these games with my girlfriend, who naturally wants to use a female character or create one of her own so she can enjoy the game in a more realistic way. But now, no females can play through season mode, not even created ones. Before, we'd just set the character to \"male\" even though it was obviously a female, and my GF could enjoy the whole game that way (even though it was silly to have to do it that way). So no season mode for females, but their use in exhibition matches sucks now too. No women can be used in any kind of gimmick match like Ladders or HIAC, nor can they bleed (which is probably why). This strange, PC oriented philosophy does nothing but severely limit what a female can do in this game: Play in a few standard match types, act as a manager, or be eye candy in the new FYF match (no created characters there either). This may not affect most players, but is needlessly prohibitive to the women that DO want to have some fun with the game. Let the men be in a FYF match and let the women be in a TLC match, I say. It's my game, I should be able to play it however I want.Thankfully the rest of my complaints are pretty minor. Partners in tag matches don't act very smart, and sometimes the CPU will pointlessly leave the ring or even deliberately get DQ'd (which was HILARIOUS in my season mode Ironman match when JBL handed me chairshot victories over and over). The ref gets too closely in the way, causing an occasional unfair DQ (save often!). Ladders are now harder to push over (you can only do it if 2 people are on top of it) and you can't throw weapons. Little things like that.But honestly? I think they really fleshed out the experience. If you were burned by last year's game, don't feel uncertain- I was REALLY disappointed by it, and thought I might hate this one, but I wound up loving it as probably the best in the entire series and the most option-packed, immersive and player-catering wrestling game in years. They give you about as much customization as you want (play a match, for the title or not, play against a friend, play season mode, create your own with GM mode, etc etc). There's just lots to pick from, I can't see anyone getting bored with this game easily. Critics ranked this one the best in the series, with only a very ignorant Gamepro review dragging its overall percentage below #1. In general, this is really the most complete, stuffed Smackdown game there is. If you're a fan of the games or the WWE even in the slightest, you'll find something to like about this game. It really surpassed my expectations.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2005"}

Though one twin escapes, the other is kidnapped. InSuper Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island, the docile dinosaur Yoshi must find Kamek, defeating his underlings to reunite the newborn twins!","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"The sequel was one of the best SNES games","reviewText":"In 1991, Super Mario World was the pack in game when you bought the SNES and it was a great game. So to everyone's surprise, Nintendo announced it was making the sequel to it and in 1995 it was released on the SNES. Not only was it one of the best games for that console, it also was a sequel superior to the original and also very different. It sold very well and went on to be a solid entry in the Super Mario Bros series.Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island stars the lovable dinosaur named Yoshi. As it turns out, this is a prequel of sorts as on the night the stork went to deliver twin babies Mario and Luigi, a sorcerer came out of nowhere and attempted to steal them. He only got Baby Luigi while Baby Mario fell straight down and onto the back of Yoshi. Yoshi and his fellow dino buddies decided that they would reunite Baby Mario with his brother and go off on a grand adventure. What lies ahead for Yoshi and Baby Mario are 6 worlds, each with 8 stages filled with enemies, traps, obstacles, puzzles and secrets.Each stage has the same goal: go from point A to point B. Yoshi can run, jump, duck down and do his flutter kick which lets him hover in the air for a few seconds. He can also swallow most of the enemies and turns them ito eggs. They are your ammo for shooting at other enemies or stuff floating in the air. Some stages call for you to transform into objects (submarine, train, helicopter, etc.) while others let you control Baby Mario after you touch a \"Starman\" (this game's version of the invincibility star.) After you finish each stage, you are graded in points with 100 being the most you can earn. Getting a perfect score on each stage in every world means unlocking a secret stage in that world. The game provides 3 separate save slots and saves your game after you complete a stage.The PROS: The game looked so good back and by today's standards, it still passes as a nice game to watch in action. The graphics and overall presentation give it the preschool feel of lush colors, catchy music and kiddie sound effects. The controls are spot on; you will master them in a few seconds and start having fun quickly. There are lots of items to collect and so many enemies to defeat but you won't mind because there's so much variety as far as stages, puzzles and the enemies and bosses you encounter. Don't be fooled by the cutesy graphics and kiddy theme here; this game is notoriously HARD. It's also going to take you a long while to beat with 48 stages from the get go, plus 6 bonus stages open up once you get perfect scores for every stage.The CONS: Like I said before, it's a HARD game and will turn off some players if they are going through it the first time. Some players might also be turned off by the cutesy graphics and automatically dismiss it which is a shame because it is such a great game, it adds charm to the whole package.This game was so good it was released as an enhanced port on the Game Boy Advance in 2002 to a new generation of gamers. So if you haven't played this game yet, you can either find the SNES cartridge or get it for the Game Boy Advance. It was one of the best games and sold millions around the world. Find out why as soon as possible. I highly recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2011"}

Let's talk about negatives first.First, they made it RPG. Meaning when you first start your fighter is weakling. It is all good if it was button pressing game. But here you get up and use your whole upper body. Initially no matter how fast you punch, your fighter on screen feels like an old man swinging his arm.Second, so you have to gain skill points that you can assign to various attributes such as speed, power... In most, RPG's you gain skill or experience points for fighting. But in this game you have to hit the training area where you can train with punching bags, and spar with trainers. This is really boring. You don't get any skill points for regular fighting.Third, you can purchase fighter attributes. Each attribute is only $1 but my guess is that it raises each attribute by 1 point. There are 5 categories of attributes. Each attribute can be raised all the way to 100 points. This is just such a cheap way to make extra money. I haven't done it but it seems unfair that some people will bypass going to training center and spend a few hundred dollars to beef up their fighters.And lastly, yes move detection is not 100% but I say it is near 90% accurate. Calibration is never an issue for me.Now the good part. Game is actually very fun and addicting. Fight moves look very real. It really works my shoulders. My wife says my shoulders are getting wide. I feel totally exhausted after the fights. After I beat the game then I can fight online. Also I don't train (for skill points) unless I really have to. This adds more challenge to each fight.

Atomizing first person shooter begins a new franchise","reviewText":"`Half-Life', `Doom', `Quake', `Farcry' and now `F.E.A.R'. Boasting the new Havoc engine and a story as big as Half-Life 2 it is not hard to see why F.E.A.R is occupying a whole shelf by itself. Sierra has certainly found a new contender that is going to demand some sequels. F.E.A.R is a mixture of all the well loved first person shooter titles, and then some more. You are a member of a tactical recon team pitted against other recon squads that are controlled by a telepathic genetically engineered squad leader. It mostly resembles `Half-Life 1', not `HL2', as the action takes place inside buildings. The new Havoc engine is similar to the Source engine in that most objects in the game are movable and or destructible. There is a higher degree of special effects in such things as bullet impacts, dust effects and blood gushes. The F.E.A.R engine also includes slow motion bullet time effects so you can literally find yourself using a shotgun to blow the enemy into a pile of guts while moving through the spray. The atomizing effects make fighting more furious and certainly creative leaps and bounds ahead of any other game out there. F.E.A.R simply has an astonishingly evolved enemy AI that leaves `HL2' to go pound on sand. The enemy AI is a step beyond `Farcry'... in fact, is a step beyond anything you have seen before. The enemy reacts realistically enough to hide, aim, miss, crawl, limp, walk wounded, shoot you, gang up on you or leap over a stairwell. F.E.A.R now owns the enemy AI market! Sierra delivers on its promises. You will be enjoying hours of going around office floors just blowing everything to dust while the enemy advances. Expect a non-stop running, window splintering, limb flying and cement shattering experience all the way. In terms of scares, `Silent Hill 3' still rules, and `Doom 3' is one big scare-a-thon, but F.E.A.R can compete. Even though it rips off the movie `Ring' completely, and mixes it with dashes of `Resident Evil' the hybrid nature of F.E.A.R being a combination of all the top material does not stop it from being a contender... and that it is... very much so. There is a number of interesting in-game dream sequences that are semi-playable. There are various subliminal ghostly flashes and lots of environmental poltergeist activity. It has a `Doom 3' atmosphere where the story is told by listening to phone messages or downloading vital information from a laptop that is relayed to you `Splinter Cell' style by your advisor on a microphone. Although being a five star experience, this does not necessarily make it the first person shooter replacement by any means. The texture detail, modelling and environments try to compete with Half-Life 2 but HL2 still rules them. F.E.A.R also still resides in the world of button touching puzzles that are easy to understand and beat. It is hardly likely that you will get stuck anywhere or have your brain teased much. The new Havoc engine, for all its glorious special effects (the main reason to play F.E.A.R), can be a demanding game engine like HL2. If you use DirectX 9 then ensure that DirectX 8 shading is turned off (it is automatically on sometimes) or else it will only play with your systems settings and allow you minimum settings. Turn it off and DirectX 9 will allow you to max out even on a 265mb card. The Havoc engine is all about particles and time dilation, and for that it scores in aces. With that said and done F.E.A.R can literally display bullets rippling through the atmosphere. This means that F.E.A.R is a fully fledged Directx 9 first person shooter. The single player campaign is closer to HL1 than any other first person shooter out there (except for Half-Life 2). It has elements of `Die Hard' where you shoot up about a thousand foot soldiers in the Armacham Technology Park buildings. Sweeping through each floor gives it a real recon feel. There is lots of vent crawling and automatic laser dodging to keep you occupied. You can also save wherever you want to save and it is not like the current wave of checkpoint save games that have found their way into mainstream gaming that has drawn so much negative criticism. However F.E.A.R lacks the number of enemies that \"HL2\" and \"Doom 3\" have to offer with five or six variations in characters... eeekk, however the animations of these characters are top of the line stuff. Another downside is that the weapons are limited to about six or seven that offer nothing really new, but the machine gun is by far the best any game has had to offer and feels the smoothest of any of the shooters. Instead of using target area pixel sensors, it actually feels like the bullets are moving through the air and impacting with the target. Overall it took me 3 days play to beat the game. That is akin to HL2. Does it beat HL2? Not by a long shot. Does it have anything new to offer? Yeah, heaps! That is why the name F.E.A.R will be household terminology soon enough. F.E.A.R has its power in being the only first person shooter to do slow motion. And for that it is an exclusive smash hit... and yes F.E.A.R rules \"Quake 4\" that was released at the same time. Q4 is all scripted (no enemy AI) with OpenGL graphics that are not a patch on F.E.A.R - the new DirectX 9 screamer.Pros:- Enemy AI is the best ever- Abundance of frights- Multiplayer is not bad at all- One big gunfight from start to finishCons:- Heavy system requirements leave a lot to be desired- Last scene is terrible!- Not enough characters.- The whole game is set indoors.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000069BD9","description":"Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliancebrings theMortal Kombatseries a new 3-D fighting engine, adds tons of features and extras, and still offers up classic gameplay.This installment features a 3-D battle system that still manages to maintain a 2-D feel. For example, pushing up on your controller makes you sidestep your opponent&#x92;s attacks, yet also allows you to jump in the air by tapping up plus a direction. A revamped fighting system offers up three different styles for each fighter (one includes a weapon technique). The multiple styles provide countless varieties of attacks for any given fighter. Different combinations of punches and kicks can be combined for very lengthy and powerful chain attacks similar to those in theMortal Kombatof old. Fatalities are also back and rich in graphic representation.New fighters join the cast of old favorites such as Sonya, Kano, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Kung Lao, Kitana, Quan Chi, Reptile, and Shang Tsung.

{"product_name":"B0050SZBP6","description":"","reviewerName":"genocidal_maniac","summary":"The magic is spent","reviewText":"I adored WOW when it came out. MMO aspect aside, it was one of the most beautiful game worlds ever conceived. The art direction was awe-inspiring, and the combat was very good. I was invested in the warcraft lore and so actually being able to run in a building was pretty amazing to me. Thunder Bluff, the Undercity, Stormwind, Tendrassill have some of the best architectures ever seen, in real life or in virtual life.I played through burning legion then took a break. But when I came back for trials, I'd still play ravishingly, burning through the new content as fast as I could while the trial lasted. The last time I did this was with the Cataclysm scroll of resurrection.I just played the trial. I played a hours of it, completed a few quests.Then got bored. It was a chore to complete. I stopped at the first pandaria 85 zone.The magic is gone.WOW has really changed over the years. Where it had once been bustling with life, now it is largely empty. I remember when it was so full that completing newbie quests could be hard because there was always someone killing the newbie stuff. Now, I go to 85 Horde Pandaria area like one month after launch and it is *empty*. It's like the people who still are playing the game max out the level within a week of release and then go raiding.World PVP used to be real. Starting around level 25, Alliance and Horde were channeled to the same zones and so while completing a quest you might see an opposite faction player and decide to gank him, or he gank you. That added a sense of chaotic spontaneity and I loved it.Now, you largely quest alone and there's no one to challenge you. Or, a high level griefer will drop by, kill you, and then fly off with a flying mount.All of this is I believe a natural result of MMO's developing expansions which spread out the player base, as well as the game just getting old.My biggest problem with WOW as it is right now though are the numbers. My druid has something like 16 million health. I remember when he was like level 15 and had 112 HP. I prefer having HP and damage be in the low 3 digits and the high 2 digits. That makes it easy to keep track of stuff. Now, stats are in the hundreds of thousands which makes them meaningless. I do not notice out how a piece that improves my agi from 293 to 333 makes things better, because the damage goes from like 30,203 to 31,212.In RPG's, it's really cool getting a new sword that lets you increase your damage from just 8 to 9. But from 68382 to 72384?Also, WOW as it has aged has only streamlined more and shed its RPG lineage. Shamans and Paladins are had on each faction. Yeah, balance, but still it takes away contrast. Druids used to go on this epic two-continent quest to get water travel form. The quests were tied in with the lore, because the people in charge were story-tellers first, power-levelers last.Now, the power-levelers have taken over. You train water form at the trainer. Exciting, I know.Also, complexity has increased exponentially, and customizability has gone down. With my druid there are like three charge skills, 5 \"oh shit\" skills, 5 finishing moves, 4 bleed moves, at any times there will be like 15 -20 skills to hit. But the other classes got skills too. So basically it's just all overwhelming and it all evens out anyways so you're frantically hitting buttons with no real idea how it will affect the underlying statistics.There used to be 31 point talents. You could jigger out new builds using talent calculators.Now, you pick from three abilities at certain tiers.The game is more a beat-em-up game now than it is an RPG. A shame. I actually stopped playing 3 days into the trial and couldn't get myself to go back in the game. A first for me, and a last.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003P9C6QY","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Weapons and Destruction!!!","reviewText":"If you've ever wanted to level a city using Sci-Fi Weaponry, this game is for you!Concept: 8/10Red Faction Armageddon takes a step back from Red Faction Guerilla in the sense that this is a story-driven linear game.  It's not an open world / sandbox game.  However, this game focuses on giving you new and creative weapons, enemies to fight, and cities that you can level to the ground... literally.Story:  8/10The game takes place 50 years after Red Faction Guerilla.  After a terraformer malfunctions, the atmosphere becomes uninhabitable and the colonists are forced to live underground.  Darius Mason heads out to repair the downed terraformer and a doomsday cult sabotages the operation.  Mason unwittingly disturbs a massive hive of predatory aliens and they swarm the colonies.  Armed with state of the art weaponry, Darius must battle through the hordes of aliens and save Mars.  The story is pretty straightforward and does a good job at connecting the missions, but that's about it.  Because Darius is a wise cracking character voiced by a \"nice guy\" actor, the tension and drama are missing from the story.  Millions are about to die and he's cracking jokes about the air conditioning...  The game really could have been darker, with more of an emotional impact.Weapons:  10/10Best Weapons Ever!  There are the standard weapons in this game, dual pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles, grenade launchers...  But where Red Faction Armageddon pushes the boundaries on the tech based weapons.  The Magnet Gun allows you to literally hurl a building at an enemy, or hurl an enemy at a building with the force of a wrecking ball.  The nano gun and particle beam literally erase parts of a building and when you hit enough of the load bearing walls, the building collapses.  There are explosive weapons like rocket launchers and grenade launchers, too.  Mason is also armed with nano tech weapons that allow him to throw up a force field, paralyze enemies, rebuild destroyed structures, machines, cover, stairways...  You can level an entire city, then rebuild it, then destroy it again...But the weaponry isn't just limited to side arms.  There are mechs as well as land, sea, and air vehicles as well.  These are also outfitted with some of the most destructive weapons ever.  Rocket pods, chain lightning guns, cluster bombs...  After playing this game, I'm not sure that I can go back to using MP-5's or Desert Eagles.  They just won't feel the same.Levels:  7/10When the game puts you in a city and allows you to cut loose, it is phenomenal.  However, not all levels are great.  There are a few where you are in caves shooting at demons that jump around like giant grasshoppers, cling to ceilings and attack you.  You feel like you're in a giant bowl surrounded by snipers.  On Normal Difficulty, this isn't that tough, but on the Harder Difficulties, this can get really annoying.  Fortunately, most of the game allows you to Blow Stuff Up!In addition to running around on foot with an arsenal of weapons, you also get to pilot futuristic mechs, tanks, planes, and a floating barge.  All of the vehicles have impressive weaponry.Graphics:  8/10The graphics are pretty good and the cutscenes are well animated.  This game isn't going to win awards, but the setting is believable.  The look of the weapons, vehicles, demons, and characters is also worth mentioning.  The art team did a great job at bringing the creatures, weapons, and landscapes to life.Sound:  9/10BOOM!!!  CRASH!!!  CRUNCH!!!  CRUMBLE!!!  This game is best enjoyed when played LOUD!For the most part, the voice actors do a good job, it's just that the witty dialogue takes away from the drama.The soundtrack is also pretty good and highlights the action.Replay Value:  7/10The Campaign is about 7 - 9 hours long and there are two online modes.  All of the modes have 4 difficulty settings.Infestation is a \"survive the waves of enemies\" mode where you can play in a group of 1-4 players.  There are plenty of maps with different types of objectives.  There are 30 different waves for each map and difficulty settings for each wave.  In the earlier waves, you are attacked by swarms of alien grunts.  As you progress through the waves, the enemies get tougher and in some cases, the levels are quite dark.  To add to the challenge, if you are killed, your character falls to the ground and starts to \"bleed out.\"  If you bleed out, you are done.  Another character can rescue you by standing near you and quickly pressing the X Button.  When you are rescued, you lose 1 life.  You get a set number of lives depending on the number of players playing and the difficulty of the level.  It is possible to fail if you don't use teamwork.Ruin allows players to see how much destruction they can cause in a set time limit and earn some fame on the leaderboards.Maturity:  OK for TeensThe game is rated M for splattering aliens and a few swear words.  It's about as graphic as stepping on a grasshopper and than swearing.  If you can handle that, you can handle the game.  There are a few human enemies encased on armor, but their deaths really aren't graphic.Overall:  8/10Red Faction Armageddon is a fun, linear, game that will allow you to happily destroy things to your heart's content.Buy this game if you love the Red Faction Series.Buy this game if you love Destruction!Buy this game if you love Science Fiction Action Movies.Rent it if you have 8 hours and you want to finish the campaign.Avoid this game if you NEED a sandbox game.Avoid this game if you NEED VS Multiplayer Modes.If you like linear monster stories in space, check out Dead Space 2!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2011"}

{"product_name":"B006WQR3OM","description":"","reviewerName":"buru buru piggu","summary":"Fun and addicting game marred by bugs and frustrating gameplay mechanics changes","reviewText":"Like many reviewers here, I was a huge fan of the original 1994 XCOM game. It was truly lightyears ahead of its time and just the perfect culmination of sci-fi storytelling and thousands of finely-tuned gameplay design decisions that just made the game so much fun and immersive. It took months off my life and contributed to some poor grades in high school and college. 2K had very high expectations to live up to and for the most part, the reboot is successful. I'm glad for that because it could've gone horribly wrong and become a giant letdown (ahem.. Duke Nukem). It brings the graphics and gameplay into the 21st century (Unreal Engine) while retaining the spirit and vision of the original. Overall, it is worthy of the tremendous legacy that is XCOM while standing on its own two feet as its own unique experience. By no means perfect (because of some awful bugs and the removal of several key gameplay aspects), but still very much fun and I've already lost 3-4 hours of sleep a night to it since I bought the game.Because this game was designed primarily for consoles, many many of the interface elements have been severely stripped away or over-simplified. I'll talk mostly about the annoyances because the gameplay and fun stuff you can read about elsewhere. The download is 1.5GB, so be prepared to wait several hours for it (3.5 for me over cable modem). Installation afterwards is very quick however. I ran it on aHP Pavilion dv7-7010us 17.3-Inch Laptop (Black). Cranked up to high on all graphics settings, the game was still smooth as silk.What I didn't like is the first level tutorial which I didn't know was skippable until reading forums. In it, 3 of your 4 squaddies die. When you start a new game, consider checking off the tutorial box.Next is the annoying chatter from the NPCs, especially Dr. Vahlen who can't decide if her accent is German, French, or British. The voice actor for her is terrible. This isn't a big deal as it has no effect on gameplay. I just wished they'd gotten a real German person to do the acting.Movement is confusing in the new XCOM. Both games limit how many squares you can move during your turn. The old one had time units explicitly spelled out as a bar as well as numbers in the HUD, and you can reserve some time units for shooting with a button toggle. The new one just has a segmented arrow indicator. You also can't group select to move all squaddies. Gotta move them one at a time. Sometimes the camera is extremely problematic and defaults to the wrong z-plane (elevation), especially when inside of UFO's. The hull of the UFO will sometimes be cut away (but then dead aliens will still show up floating on the roof). Sometimes not.I HATE the no inventory system in the new version. You can only have 2 or 3 items which you must assign to backpacks before the mission, forcing you to choose between a medkit, grenades, stun gun, and a scope. In the old one, you had multiple slots and you could fully load out your squaddie with as much as he/she could carry. The penalty, of course, being that this slows down movement (reduces the number of time units available). The old game had ammo clips, adding another layer of strategy to the game, forcing you to budget ammo (take single shot, or multi-shot?) or scavenge. The new game has unlimited ammo, but the reduced inventory is not fun. You can only carry 1 or 2 grenades (if you level up and take the upgrade). That also means you can't pick up items from dead squadmates or aliens like you could in the old game. The ability to pick up spare grenades and alien weaponry at will was a key element of fun in the old game. You could even pick up dead aliens, stuff them in your sack and walk around to build up strength. The new one you can't.No free-targeting. You MUST have an alien in your line of vision in order to shoot. You can't just shoot whatever you want. This is a severe lack. The old game let you shoot doors, walls and barriers to destroy cover and expose aliens. This one doesn't. While cars catch fire and blow up when aliens shoot at you and miss, you can't return the favor if they're hiding behind cars. You can't shoot cars.Terrible market mechanics. Periodically, a nation will send equipment requests which reward you with money, scientists, or engineers if you fulfill. The old game let you manufacture and sell equipment to generate a source of income. Enemies very infrequently leave behind intact weapons. When killed, their gun and grenades shatter. WHAT??? But it doesn't matter since, you can't sell weapons.. only alien corpses and UFO parts. But you need these parts to research and build things, and they fetch only 1 or 2 credits each, so there's really no point. So, the items you don't need, like antiquated tech, you can't sell. Go figure. So, there is almost no way to make money in this game, if you are short on funds. You have to wait until the monthly stipend.Very limited customizability of squaddie appearances. You can change the face, skin color, hair and head shape, but they all pretty much look the same. This is really boring and I had hoped to be able to make some really unique looking squad members. No height, body shape, uniform color. I also don't like the overt nation flags plastered all over the squaddie UI menus or on the backs of their suits. Yes, flags are sewn onto the back of each squaddie's collar!No concept of friendly-fire. Shots just go through squadmates if they're in the way. In the old one, you could accidentally kill a team member with a stray shot, or if they are in your line of fire. Sometime shots go through walls due to clipping problems.No ability to hire scientists or engineers. You get them as monthly rewards from nations, missions, or by building the required workshop or laboratory. You can hire soldiers but not scientists or engineers. What?? Not that it really matters. You can only have one base. The original, you could have maybe 6 or 8.. basically a base and interceptors at every major world region.These are just some of the things that frustrate me and I don't know why Firaxis decided to change these mechanics that worked so well in the original. Don't break what ain't broke.Worst of all, however, is a bug that renders the game unplayable. Sometimes the HUD completely disappears when you're back at base, making it impossible to do anything except quit the game and reload. SAVE OFTEN! On several occasions, after returning from a mission, I found that all my squad members had turned into men. Somehow, their appearances all got changed to the same character model (same face, hair, etc). Reloading solved it. Two of my squaddies are permanently wounded and unusable until Firaxis fixes this bug.Graphics are as good as I expected, with some weirdly Halo-looking weapons and monster designs (Brutes... erm... I mean mega-mutons.) Maps all look the same, regardless of what country. Firaxis claims to have several hundred hand-crafted maps, but I'm on my second play through and I see the same maps again and again. The VIP extractions are the same map every restart.I do like that saving and loading is very quick. Overall, there's not a whole lot of load time and most of it's hidden with transitional animation or a narrated briefing. Bewilderingly, Firaxis decided to make F10 quick save and F11 fullscreen/windowed toggle. You will hit this F11 many many times by accident, I assure you. It may sound harsh or overly longwinded to list out all the flaws, but really this is a fun game, and would've been vastly more superior had they not made these changes. I doubt that Firaxis will change any of the gameplay mechanics with a software update, but a guy can hope.I've finished the single player campaign. I abandoned my first game because I progressed too far towards the endgame goal too fast, following the mission objectives. It feels really short and very rushed. The tech tree is super short. I ran out of things to research very quickly. The old one, tech research was a BIG BIG DEAL and it took forever researching multiple branches in order to unlock all the dependencies of creating a new weapon, vehicle, or item. I liked this challenge. In the remake it's a breeze. They made it even easier with research credits that you earn by capturing live aliens. They half your time. So most of my things took 2-4 days to research.In sum, still a fun game, but owing to the console pedigree, many of the things that made XCOM fun are dumbed down. Console games typically target 40 hours of gameplay, so I think that is to blame for most of the negative impact of these design decisions. There's no real reason to play the game again, as there are no unlockables of any kind.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2012"}

What I like about this game is that it doesnt hold your hand or try to steer you in the way the devs want you to play. You can, as I did my 1st 10 games, play this game any way you want right until you lose, without any kind of warning or game tips from the bluetooth dude on how to correct the error until its too late - then go back to the drawing board and redesign your base, your resources and your money.At first the combat starts out as simple turn-based fighting, but each new skill your soldiers learn adds another layer to the fight, allowing you to specialize them for offensive or defensive capabilities. Combat is never the same on any two missions (although the maps themselves get reused quite a bit, which can be advantageous for replays) and there are enough of different mission types (Abductions, Bomb Disposal, Downed Enemy, Landed UFO, Terror) that the combat doesnt feel stale or repetitive on each drop.As the game progresses you gain access to various forms of armor and weapons to help combat the invasion, the higher up the armors you research the more specialized they start becoming.By researching the aliens' corpses you will gain the access to capture them alive. Capturing aliens allows you to keep their weapons (which usually explode on their death), unlocks a new piece of technology and will apply research credit for projects that you will come across later in the game. Dangerous but worthwhile to capture one of each type (some simply cant be captured), if not for the technology for the free plasma weapons.As the game goes on, you will gain access to other specialized buildings (labs/workshops) which will further advance your research and your equipment for your soldiers (Foundry).Psionic abilities open up for your men, at this point you can start testing your squad to see if they are gifted with psionic powers.When I first bought this game I thought I wasted $50, now I play it every night, two things changed that for me:1- Satellites.  Your lifeline. You'll learn REAL FAST that this is your top priority in the game, especially in the 1st few months. Build as many as you can afford, not as many as you can launch- hold them if you need to but get them built.2- BunnyHop.  It's very tempting to dash in and get right to the fight. In the 1st few months you'll get away with it, you'll think it's ok to start off the 1st round or two and develop a habit of doing so...until mutons show up and 'nade half your team. Dont do it. Use your movement actions in two parts, its slower but way safer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2012"}

After thinking about it, I decided that I'd wait.  I'm glad I did.  I think I got it when it dropped to $30, so for that it was worth a shot.  It was just pretty linear play.  I mean, there are different ways to complete a task, but they all pretty much lead to the same conclusion.

I am a huge fan of classic RPGs and love the DS (being the greatest system for classic style RPGs in the market).I read a lot of reviews about this game and had mixed expectations before playing.  I have now played through a bit of the game and I have to say I am impressed.  Though you lose the ability to target foes, the system does a great job of 'auto' targeting.  It's a great setup and it reduces a lot of the button mashing RPG monotony.The graphics are amazing.  I love the storybook look to the game.  Day night progression is nice, though the days and nights flip pretty quickly (unlike Dragon Quest games).  I also like the limit of items being held in your possession.  It makes it a little more challenging over the long run.Though this isn't the deepest RPG, it's tremendous fun, gorgeous, and lighthearted.  This is one of the best DS games in awhile (up there with Bowser's Story and Mario Kart DS).  Good stuff.----------There is quite of bit of party juggling in the middle of the game.  The main heroes split up and their individual stories run parallel, sometimes intersecting, which makes it fun and unique (kind of like FF6 where the story splits).  There are also some interesting temporary party members during these times.Update: the difficulty definitely ramps up towards the end of the game (once you defeat Rolan).  The feel is great, good balance, the battles are fun without being tedious.  Some of the later big boss battles take a little time and patience (20-30 minutes for a couple), but they are tough and require thought as to actions.  The wide variety of hats are great to experiment with.  I am in love with Ranger and Bard!  But lots of variety and a pretty strong story.  Highly recommended!----------Update:  For extra insane bonus difficulty, the bonus towers are optional and very tough and frustrating.  Also note:  it appears that enemies do grow stronger as your level rises (ala Oblivion or FF8).  Obtaining the strongest weapons and items is a fun challenge.Also I forgot to mention:  The auto targeting tells you which row you target with the attack, so no big surprises.  I like to equip one warrior class with a front row attacking weapon and the other with a back row attack weapon, makes it a little more balanced.  Also watch those pesky elemental weaknesses and strengths.  Overall still good, and the extra content near the end is appreciated.  Still a rather weak story, but that's okay.  I would rather get to the action anyway!----------Update:  So I've read a lot of the gripes and I appreciate the game even more.  I like that it is tough and a bit annoying at times.  I don't get frustrated when I have to backtrack back to town to grab things from storage.  I enjoy the random battles and collecting gems.  Besides, most of the towns have NPCs that give clues as to the upcoming bosses weakness or strengths.  Try talking to people yahoos!  =)Oh, the towers are INSANELY tough.  Seriously.

NEVER AGAIN!! First off, they don't tell you that once you download it to your system that you would be the only person playing it online, so forget it if you have like 2 or 3 other user names on your system. They each have to download it themselves if they want to play. Another way for Sony to rake in the dollars.After downloading which took about 30 minutes it was time for two updates to install which took almost 2 hours because it kept kicking me offline everytime it tried to update. If that wasn't bad enough, it took me almost another two hours just to get online to play my first game.Trust me, no game is worth this much headache, bad news for me I can't resell, but I'll always read the reviews before buying another game.

I also play SOTN on the Playstation. I was lucky enough however, 2 completely miss the N64 versions.Simply put, its Castlevania in 3D. Yes, it is similar 2 DMC. But what the heldija expect ? I can't see the game being any good in 3D without being like DMC. Other than that, its Castlevania. You use a whip to perform many combos and subweapons to defeat enemies. You can also mix sub-weapons with orbs allowing a different type of attack with each combination. You'll be having plenty of fun, but it'll be over real soon. I beat it within a week. But I'm sure others play more than me and would beat it even quiker. They put hidden things in the game for the sole purpose of dragging the time out. What I mean is, you WON'T find these things by chance. For instance theres about 9 or so relics in the game. I had found only 2 by the time I beat it. So I go back and find them, but by that time I'd beaten the game. Also when u finish it, u can play as an alternate character. That just isn't worth it. Remember on SOTN when you could unlock Richter ? Yep, its exactly like that. Meaning the other character is nowhere near as complete as the original.2 wrap it up its Castlevania for the PS2.I came up with how game companies think . Here is a conversation between the fans and the producers.Fans - We want a 3D version of Castlevania. But we want it to be good. Not like that N64 garbage.Konami -.....? Whadaya mean ?Fans - We want you to make it in 3d but keep it real to the old Castlevania feel.Konami - ....? {looks puzzled} What..you....you mean like this ?{Konami releases &quot;Lament of Innocence&quot; for thePS2}Fans - YES !! YES!!!! Exactly like this!!! Now could you make a longer,complete version ?Konami - ..... Sorry, but we don't make em like that anymore.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2003"}

A little off subject here, but if you ever decide to pre-order, use Amazon.  SCREW Gamestop.  I got the game a day earlier, but here is the catcher, I couldn't get to the post office in time to pick it up so I had to wait another day, lol.Anyhow, after finally picking up my special edition copy I must say, for a special edition, it was worth it.  The bag, the game art book, CD, and safe deposit box (which I have no idea what I'm going to do with, lol) with key was worth the extra $30.  I did expect a bigger library of music and a strategy guide would have been nice.Pros:  The game itself is awesome.  If you like the past GTA's you won't be disappointed with this game.  It's San Andreas with more, much more.  It's so open it's rediculous.  The story line is engaging.  I was up till 2am playing and would have kept playing if I didn't have to be up in the morning.  I won't go into great detail.  Just know, if you are a fan, you won't be disappointed.  If you've never played the series and are looking for a reason to play, here is your reason.  The game will make you feel stupid for never playing in the first place.Cons:  My first con is the graphics.  I really expected a better appearance for a PS3 game.  Next, there has been talks about game freezes.  I experienced it once after installation, but it's been fine afterwards.  I also have a first gen, 60GB system.  Rumors have been circulating that that was the main system with the freezing problem.  I haven't experienced it but once myself.  Played a good 3 hours with no problems.  Just a heads up.  Controls aren't perfect, but I think with time, you can get used to them.I will say, easily, this is a must buy.  I haven't put in a whole lot of time which is the reason I gave it 4 stars.  This is based off of what I've experienced thus far.  If I get to experience what I've been reading about for months, I would easily give this a 5 star.

The limited music selection is where things start to go south.  You see... when most gamers say, &#34;I love Final Fantasy music&#34;, what they really mean is, &#34;I love Final Fantasy IV, VI, VII, and IX music&#34;.  So when Theatrhythm presents an equal amount of music from ALL the games, there's going to be trouble in the lifestream.  Each game only has about 3 measly tracks (there are a handful of bonus tracks too).  At first I thought Square was just planning to soak me with DLC but there really isn't anything to download either.  (Maybe the upcoming Curtain Call will remedy this.)  For now Theatrhythm has very little content.  Which ties into my other gripe about this game, it takes FOREVER to unlock extras.  50 hours in and I've gotten about 50% completion.  This game doesn't have nearly enough content to justify that.  By the time you 100% this game, the mere mention of One Winged Angel will make you vomit.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2014"}

This is a kick butt action game with all the variety and story you would ever need in an action game. The voice acting and animation is down right the best I've ever seen in any video game in my life!! The personality that came from all the characters, especially King Bohon, was unbelievably cinematic. Honestly, in action games I'll usually play through them, have loads of fun, and love the game, but if someone asks me what it was about, I have no clue. I just chop, slice, dice, shoot, and destroy whatever they throw at me. This game was different. I was so into the story that I felt actual emotion when certain things happen. I won't ruin any surprises but there's one part towards the end where a villian does something that I genuinely felt pissed off about and wanted revenge. (Those of you who have played it know what I'm talking about) My girl usually hates watching me play games and she got into this game like she would a movie. She saw that part and started cursing and cheered me on to kill that SOB. This is truly that game they talk about where you feel like you're playing a movie. There are a ton of combos for you to learn but you don't have to if you don't want to. It's up to you. There's plenty of variety in game play too. Along with hacking and slashing, there are rocket launcher parts, crossbow sniping parts, button seqence parts, problem solving, and extremely fun boss fights.  This is one of the coolest games I've played to date. It's been out a while so I'm sure you can find it used for cheaper too. I did. After playing it though, I would gladdly pay full price for this game if I had to.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2008"}

{"product_name":"B003L51GW2","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"The best looking game on the PSP","reviewText":"The Good: Superb visual showcase, excellent story telling, epic memorable moments, Thera's Bane adds depth to the combat, amazing ending boss fightThe Bad: Lack of bosses, feels more repetitive than the other games, a little too short still, simple puzzles, frame rate hitchesGod of War is just one of those games no one gets tired of, and each game brings new and excellent ideas to the table, and this has to do with the fact that each game has a new director. Ghost of Sparta borrows a lot of what God of War III did, tweaks it, and adds things to it as well. I honestly think Sparta is the best example of how to do a portable game well, and bring a console experience in without cramping the game's style. Sparta is probably the most complete console copy on a portable to date, and there is nothing like it out there.The game is set between the first two and is a side story of Kratos following a haunting vision. The vision of finding his long lost brother, Deimos, and trying to cleanse yet another horrible memory. Along the way you battle through Atlantis and other new locales for the game, but the style isn't anything new. The locales in the game are pretty dark this time around and really focus on the whole dark aspect of the game.The core of God of War is the combat and Ghost of Sparta trumps Chains of Olympus by a mile. Borrowing the recharging meter from III you get to infuse your blades with Thera's Bane and this adds a whole new layer to the combat. Holding down R allows you to set your blades on fire and make them more powerful, but you have to time it and use it wisely. This is also used for breaking down armor on foes that can't be hit normally, environmental puzzles etc. Thera's Bane is really fun to use, and there's a lot of complexity that goes along with it that adds another layer of depth to the standard combat in the series.There are new magical items, but they're not as exciting as one might expect. I never really used them as often as I'd liked to have, but they come in handy in the later levels. The game also borrows the Hyperion Charge that shoulder rams enemies to the ground and lets you wail on them. I also never really found much use for it, and never used it through the entire game except when introduced, so it feels like there's some filler in here, but it's great for people who have a different play style. A whole new weapon is introduced and this is the Arms of Sparta. These are Kratos' spear and shield and it's good for close up combat, and using the spear for far off enemies, but it's not a favorite, and is no good and mid to long range and doesn't have the reach of the Blades. I never really used this except for when it was required during puzzles or exploration.Sparta has a really good story behind it, and it doesn't disappoint with it's epic interactive story elements such as one scene where he fights his own past in a brutal way you would expect in a God of War game. The game also opens up with a classic gigantic boss battle with a Scylla, but it's not as memorable as the console games or even Chains of Olympus. Speaking of bosses that game lacks hardly any with only maybe four in this six hour adventure. The ending boss is probably one of the best in the series with an awesome co-op battle that has never been down before. The game's ending is well worth it, and you'll be pleased with how the whole story rolls out.On a technical term this is the best looking PSP, or handheld game, ever made hands down. I don't think any other developer can make a PSP game look better than one of the best looking PS2 games ever made. Yes, it looks better than God of War II and it's just full of lush detail and is bursting at the seams with effects. If you thought Chains of Olympus looked amazing this trumps it by a long shot. Water drips off every ledge, the backgrounds are fully animated, the game has a high poly count and highly detailed textures with even bump mapping! It's just something to truly behold, and I doubt we'll see another PSP game look this good. Of course the game also comes with frame rate issues and never really goes above 30 FPS and some times drops down below 15, but that could just be my old PSP hardware.The game also has it's usual treasures, but adds the Temple of Zeus and lets you unlock videos, costumes, art etc. by spending orbs you earn during the Challenge of the Gods. You can also create your challenges as well, and this lets you keep playing this epic game without having to tread through the story again (which I know I will be doing again).Other than that though the game is lacking something. It's not as well paced as other games in the series, and the lack of bosses hampers the experience a bit. The game mainly focuses on balanced combat in which you get a variety of foes and must take each battle in a different way since some foes are weak to something and some aren't. As well as focusing on exploration, and there really aren't any puzzles to think of except very simple ones we've seen a dozen times in the series. The game is also just too straight forward and feels more repetitive than the other games, and that's a bit disappointing considered the reputation of the series. However, the game is amazing, and I am not quite sick of seeing what Kratos has in store for us. Is this the last God of War game since III marked the end of the trilogy? Probably not since this is Sony's major staple for it's consoles. Ghost of Sparta achieves many things, and will become an all time classic.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00005LOXE","description":"The two classic RPGs in this compilation not only represent hours upon hours of story, character, and action, they also present the background for two recent bestselling, critically hailed games:Final Fantasy IXandChrono Cross.With all the different names for the original 1991 release of the first title in this compilation (Final Fantasy IVin Japan,Final Fantasy IIin the U.S.), role-players new to the game may get confused. Make no mistake, though:Final Fantasy Chroniclesmarks the first time this pivotal installment of the cherished game series has ever been available on the PlayStation. InFinal Fantasy IV, players take on the role of Cecil, a loyal captain who questions the orders of his king, and for it is sent to slay a mysterious beast in a nearby valley.InChrono Trigger, Chrono must follow princess Marle's teleportation through time and locate her before an intergalactic parasite arrives to destroy the world. The original game, also on the PlayStation for the first time, was one of the first nonlinear role-playing games. The decisions that players make during the game will point them toward one of more than a dozen possible endings.These new versions retain the authentic Japanese SNES stories and characters while updating their graphics and adding new full-motion video sequences and other features.","reviewerName":"Timothy Lovett","summary":"Final Fantasy Chronicles, Great Compilation Game","reviewText":"Since this is a compilation game that consists of two games I'll review them separately.First, before that, I just want to remark that these two games were perhaps the two of the greatest RPGs to hit the SNES in America. Final Fantasy IV was marketed to the American audience as Final Fantasy 2 and Chrono Trigger is often called the best RPG ever created and has a fan base larger than many of the big hits of today.Final Fantasy IV:-----------------------------Final Fantasy IV (or 2 American) is definitely one of the more interesting storylines and is as exciting to play now as it was back when it was first created. The general story revolves around one man's quest to understand himself and in the process atone for his sins committed in the past.It's different than the usual Final Fantasy's in that characters who are in your party leave and come back throughout the storyline but you never have the ability to select your own party. So one character may run off to do something and you'll quickly have him replaced by another.It definitely removes the need to switch around characters to level them all up but when you get stuck with characters you may find goofy (cough Cid, cough) you're stuck with them until the story progresses.The most groundbreaking thing about the story, which never really happens in RPGs these days so much was that characters in the story may die at times (as part of the story). It's just something that most stories today shy away from but playing through Final Fantasy IV I never knew if I'd lose someone in my team and it always made me cling to the story hoping for the best even when put into impossible situations in the story.Pros:The game's major flaw was how slow your character moved. That one tiny enhancement makes a world of a difference playing.Same great story.Cons:It still uses the old four block save system. How does this translate to the playstation saves? You have to save this gigantic file onto your memory card and then inside of that file save on one of the four saves. It just doesn't make sense why they didn't update that. It's a slow process to save as well.-----------------------------Chrono Trigger-----------------------------Had this game been released without any changes, it likely would have been fine as it was. Still the CG movies added to it are somewhat interesting.The game revolves around an interesting story dealing with time travel and brings you to the edge of your morality as you understand the complex interactions between the characters. As you begin to unravel the story you instantly remember pieces of it unveiled earlier and begin to make connections, something most stories in RPGs today lack as well.Another fun piece of the game was the multiple endings it had. This isn't like Final Fantasy X-2's good or bad ending style but a unique ending system that involved how you went about beating it and at what point in the game you were at when you beat it.For example, one ending, if you beat it before completing one storyline, caused the world to become an imp only world where they lived like humans do. It's just a fun game all around.Pros:Great game, I don't even need to list these, an amazing piece to add to your collection.Cons:Nothing I can really speak to.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00420K18K","description":"","reviewerName":"Andrew \"Andrew\"","summary":"First Baseball Game","reviewText":"First off, let me preface this review by saying that I despise the game of baseball as a form of entertainment.  I find the sport too similar to Golf or other \"turn based sports.\"  I personally prefer free flowing sports like soccer, combat sports, and other \"net sports.\"  However, as you can see by my rating, I absolutely am sold on this video game based on the sport.  Weird I know.The reason for my score of this game can be summed up in one word: Depth.Sports games generally have the highest replay value as long as you don't worry too much about rosters and this game delivers on all fronts.  I have already lost many hours.The modes are as follows:Road to the Show: most people abbreviate this to RttS.  This a like the \"be a pro\" mode in other sports titles.  The player customization is unbelievable and the announcer call names are in the hundreds, they have so many names it's almost unbelievable.Franchise: is like a manager mode that's very deep and full of information, too much for me personally since I still don't know the full organizational rules of the MLB.  I usually play manager mode on all sports games I purchase and this one is no different, however, I admit to being a bit wary of dealing with minor league farm teams and all the other complicated baseball specific details.  However, I will give it a go, I'm on my second games post spring training.Season: a regular season minus all the frills in franchise; just the actual playing of the on field game.  (Haven't tried this yet)Exhibition: Pick up and play (you can shorten the game to a few or the full 9 innings)Home Run Derby: Another pick up and play mode.Diamond Dynasty: This is like EA's card buying/trading Ultimate Team.  However, I can't seem to get into it since I can't even manage my roster correctly, once again due to my ignorance of the sport.  This mode is incredibly customizable as I've spend hours already creating my teams uniforms and team logos.  The logo creator is very good albeit clunky and time consuming to use.  The non-MLB players in this mode can also be edited to your liking.  The biggest flaw to DD mode is it's reliance on being an Online-centric experience.  Although you can play this mode against the CPU it's meant to be played against other players.  The problem:  Online is horribly hit by lag.  Hitting in this game for me vs CPU is challenging, against others online it becomes frustrating due to the stuttering and lag.In Summary:If you like sports game, or even strategy games, I highly recommend this game.  I have found out the reason why this game is rated so highly for so many years.If you like a smooth online experience, I suggest looking elsewhere.If you want a simple pick up and play arcade game, you may want to give it a try.  The reason I say this is because if you have any patience or desire to customize game play you will be okay.  The kind of person that may not like this game are individuals who dislike depth and enjoy quick games.  I have time and patience to change sliders and options, so this game is great.  I always give sports titles an extra star simply due to freedom to create and customize.Oh, and just a side-note, the actual game play on the field is great as well...I thought that's a given though.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2012"}

First: It is clearly targeted towards the early-to-mid-teen male audience.  Second:  There was a lot of contorversy when this game came out when it recieved the &quot;Mature&quot; rating from the ESRB, becuase the Dead or Alive games had all been rated &quot;Teen&quot; and Tecmo wanted it to recieve a &quot;Teen&quot; rating as well so its target audience would have an easier time purchasing it.  The the ERRB tagged it with the 'Nudity' mark for its reason on giving it the &quot;M&quot; rating.  Well, whether there is nudity or not - (there isn't except for very briefly in the intro) - this game more than deserves it's &quot;Mature&quot; rating.  Dress up one of a number of young, virtual women, (the womed from the DOA fighting series) in a nukber of ultra-revealing swimsuits and then  you are free to do whatever you'd like with them.  You don't HAVE to play volleyball.  Wanna get them tanned?  Send 'em to the pool, and rotate the camera, zooming it in and out on any part of their bodies as the lay in the afternoon sun.  Buy them accessories like visors, sunglasses, and suntan oil.  Have them ride their bike along the beach, or just feel free to stare at them as they swing around on a large tree branch, strectching, flexing, etc, etc.Still, it's actually a lot of fun.  The volleyball system isn't half bad considering it's not the only focus of the game.  Sure, the swinging camera takes a lot of getting used - (Your character will spend an awful lot of time off of the screen if you're not careful) - but it's not a hard  to deal with.  Also, the game includes a virtual casino, where you can bet away your winnings from the volleyabll matches.  PLay a number of different slot machines, roulette, poker, or blackjack.  Then head back to you hotel room, get some sleep, and start it all over again.Fun, Funny, enjoyable.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2003"}

Romano \"Avid Gamer\"","summary":"Lost Planet: Extreme Condition is a Great Game","reviewText":"First off, let me say I have always been a PC gamer for years.  I never thought I would like playing on a gaming console as much has I like playing on the PC.  When Call of Duty 3 came out last year and the game developer didn't make a PC copy of that game, I knew I had to buy an Xbox 360 because I love all the Call of Duty games on the PC and I didn't want to wait until sometime this year to get the next version of Call of Duty on the PC.  So I broke down and bought the Xbox 360 console not only so I could play Call of Duty 3, but I also wanted to play Gears of War.I really didn't expect any console game to be, graphic-wise, as good as a PC game so I didn't expect too much from Call of Duty 3 or Gears of War.  Boy was I wrong.  Let me tell you something.  The graphics on both Call of Duty 3 and Gears of War are just awesome.  I have to admit that the graphics on console games are just as good now as on PC games.  I thought I would never admit that since I have always been a die-hard PC gamer all my life.  I am so glad I went out and bought an Xbox 360.And just so you know.  I do not work for Microsoft trying to push the Xbox 360 console or its games.  I'm just what you call a gamer junkie who just loves to plays games.  If I didn't like the Xbox 360 or its games I would tell you the truth.  It took me a while to get used to using a wireless Xbox 360 hand controller because I was so used to using a keyboard and a mouse on the PC, but after playing on the Xbox 360 for a while, I found out the hand controller is pretty easy to use.Now on to my review on Lost Planet: Extreme Condition. I have played through the first two singleplayer missions in Lost Planet: Extreme Condition.  The storyline and the graphics are really good.  The graphics for this game are right up there with Gears of War.  The creatures in this game are very well made.  Plus the harsh cold climate in the game is very believable.  You have the neatest vehicles to control and maneuver around in.  You are also fighting against other humans on the planet called Snow Pirates and I was really impressed on how the Snow Pirates maneuvered against me.  The AI in this game is really good.  The explosions in this game are just mind blowing.  The sounds in this game are really good. My recommendation is to go out and buy this game. It definitely one of the top games out there right now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2007"}

It is a perilous path &#x2013; one that will take Ezio to Constantinople, the heart of the Ottoman Empire, where a growing army of Templars threatens to destabilize the region. In addition to Ezio's award-winning story, the acclaimed online multiplayer experience returns, refined and expanded, with more modes, more maps and more characters that allow players to test their assassin skills against others from around the world. The latest chapter in the Assassin's Creed saga also includes revolutionary gameplay, allowing players to manipulate the construct of Desmond's memories and the Animus to decipher the mysteries of his past and gain insight into the future.","reviewerName":"Chevy","summary":"Assassin's Creed Revelations","reviewText":"Title:  Assassin's Creed RevelationsSystem:  PS3 (also available on XBOX 360 & PC)Style:  1-Player Action (8-Player Online)Developer:  Ubisoft MontrealPublisher:  UbisoftRated:  M (Mature 17+)Assassin's Creed Revelations reveals previous unknowns about Desmond, Altair and Ezio in a story-driven action-packed adventure that brings to satisfying conclusion the stories of Altair and Ezio.The opening video offers insight to Desmond, Altair and Ezio's past to briefly recap what has happened in the previous games.  This acts as a reminder to those that have played the previous games and an introduction to those who have not.Revelations has playable sequences for all three characters, but the main story still revolves around Ezio.  Since joining the Assassin's as a young man, Ezio has matured and become even more deadly and is now the mentor and leader of the entire assassin order.Ezio's quest has taken him to Constantinople where a power struggle between the Ottoman Empire and the Byzantines threaten the very things he has journeyed there to find.  While here, Ezio's story also involves making the aquaintance of a lovely woman who helps him decipher information to aid in his quest.  All the while Ezio grows fond of this lady who has started to break down his hardened heart and he once again begins to have feelings of love.The sequences where you play Altair, the assassin from the first game, depict him from a young man up to a very old man.  These are short, but each one reveals more about his life and adds to the already rich storyline.Desmond sequences are played out as a surrealistic first-person puzzle platformer.  Each sequence gives more insight to Desmond's past.  These may be skipped entirely, but if you want the most of the story then these are worth playing.The monetary system allows you to purchase shops and monuments to earn money for items and to invest in certain missions for your recruited assassins.The citizens you recruit to become assassins can be called to help you in game or sent to other locations to fight Templar ruled areas and earn you money.  You may also assign assassins to a den once you've defeated the Templar captain(s) controlling it.  Once assigned, there are missions to help your newly appointed Den Master on his or her way to becoming a Master Assassin.There are also factions available, each with their own uses and each has challenges for Ezio to complete so they will become even more useful.The graphics offer a refined detail that shows off each design in the armor, every stitch in the embroidered clothing, and every stone and grain of wood.  It's a beautiful open-world you will want to explore.Climbing to rooftops or the top of towers offers astounding viewpoints that will have you looking into the distance just to soak in the surrounding beauty.The game design is very well done.  You can be running through a rich part of the city where elegant architecture and fancy clothed citizens roam then suddenly you're surrounded by people in rags and decrepit wooden buildings offering a more dreary outlook welcoming you to the slums.Controls are easy enough to master.  Fight sequences are satisfying with every swipe of your sword or jab with your hidden blade.  Death sequences of your victims are top-notch and depict plenty of graphic violence.Some missions are time sensitive and there are enemies that are a challenge to defeat.  Fortunately all missions are replayable.The soundtrack melds with the surroundings in a symbiotic style from light background to intensifying as action escalates.The manual is in the game's main menu.  There are playable tutorials as well.New items include a hook blade that aids in combat, climbing and zip-lining about the city.  A bomb-craft system permits creation of lethal, tactical and diversionary devices to help Ezio kill, confuse or distract his enemies.Rather than having multiple difficulty settings, the difficulty increases as you progress in the game.  Missions may become more difficult to achieve and enemies become stronger and more of a challenge.There are some negatives.  The Den Defense strategy mini-game puts you on a rooftop to command assassins to attack oncoming Templar invaders.  This sequence seems out of place.  The Den Defense should have simply allowed fighting as normal game play rather than making it a mini-game that doesn't really fit into the game structure.There are also times when the camera angle is not under player control and this can make platforming difficult at times.  The Den Defense is avoidable, however the camera angle issue is not.The country-side exploring is also missing from Revelations.Even though there are a few negative aspects it's a pittance compared to all the goodness in this game.The main story can be completed in about ten hours, but if you play side quests, challenges and assassin quests you'll have many more hours of enjoyment.  If you like treasure hunting you can add even more time to your adventure.Revelations does a good job with graphics, gameplay and story and sets things up nicely for Assassin's Creed 3.  Even though sequences can be replayed, starting a new game from scratch is always fun.  I appreciated the game even more on my second play-through.I highly recommend Assassin's Creed Revelations, especially if you've played the other Assassin's Creed games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2012"}

Your character has a fully interactive story 'rpg' that they separate into \"3\" Chapters initially.  Yes, this is an Online Game so if you want more? play the game.  Show BioWare what you like and dislike;  They are constantly creating more content.The Old Republic{T.O.R.} has romance and all the other drama likeKotOR,Mass Effect, andDragon Ageavailable for player's to explore.  If you are like me, the 'adding' of the 'option' for interactive romance really is essential.  I lose all interest in games without it.  It boggles my mind why some developers seem so very resistant to what BioWare has shown is obviously successful in the free market.I know that I wondered if it is even possible for them to really make a game that has a dynamic and interactive story as an M.M.O.R.P.G.  The short answer is yes;  The story does tailor itself to the player's choices.  As inKotORsome of the choices are big and some of them are small.  Some choices have a larger impact later on in the player's story.  Every character is different.  Your decisions really do matter even though it may be hard to see sometimes {like in real life}.  The story for every class is different and compelling.  This adds to the Game+ value along with their legacy system.As with Warcraft and other Online Games.T.O.R.has plenty of things for players to spend their time with advancing their max level characters, while we wait for more content to be released.  There are dailies, raids, and pvp along with left over planets to explore and adventure on.  Their legacy system empowers all characters within any given legacy/account.  Every account has it's own legacy that automatically links all characters across factions on the same server.  So the game really does favor the casual gamer who wishes to explore more of the game than raiding 5 nights a week like a job.Those considering buying theCollector's Bundleshould do so because you get an authenticator {security key; [...]} to protect your account from hackers.  Others still can break into your account but the security key makes it nearly impossible to do so.  Plus you get the Soundtrack which I love.  The pewter doll is nice but I would have rather got one with Satele Shan in it.  lulz  Most of all, I buy collector's edition because I am supporting the developer and gifting them 'money' for what I like and want more of.

{"product_name":"B003Q53VZC","description":"","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"God awful rubbish","reviewText":"I was afraid of this... I got Crysis 2 and Homefront at the same time and I played Crysis 2 first and loved it - see my review. If you've played both then you can probably see why playing C2 before Homefront would be a bad thing - it's a tough act to follow.Now I knew nothing about Homefront other than the basic premise which is 'Red Dawn' type antics involving the Korean army. As soon as the single player campaign begins you can tell what you're in for - Black Ops style of repetitive escort missions where you're nothing more than an extra in a movie. This game isn't about you, it's about a whole bunch of unknown people that you don't care about, and you're just along for the ride. Except this isn't a fun ride, it's a ride whereby you must continuously follow some people while being surrounded and out-numbered by never-ending bad guys and rewarded with extremely limited ammo. The game expects you to run-and-gun constantly. The fact that there's several achievements for doing parts of the game under 200 seconds or so shows what little regard the devs had in terms of allowing you to play the game your way. You cannot take your time as you'll be overrun, you cannot form a strategy as you'll be out of ammo and thus you're just pushing down and forward on the left stick. They may as well have made your character run forward by default to save wear on the button.It's such an unpleasant experience. I'm amazed no-one at THQ said \"Hey guys, this isn't much fun. Let's drop the infinitely spawning stupid AI and allow the player some freedom\". Surely someone who worked on this tripe must have realized what a nasty little game they've made?But then there's the bugs. At many points I could see where the bad guys were spawning- just appearing out of thin air and following exactly the same behavior as the last one. And main characters walked through me revealing their innards and at one point I ended up floating 40 foot in the air only to fall to my death. Plus the in game dialog (as terrible as it is) is forced upon you - there's scores of parts of the game where you're stuck on the spot and you have to endure some dull, badly acted exchange between the characters. And should you die before a checkpoint you will have to listen to it again. And again. Replay value is nil on this one.The graphics side of things fair little better. It's clunky over-saturated blocky vomit thrown up from the stomach of 2001's graphic technology. The shadow maps have a resolution of about 5 pixels and there's many points in the game where visual dressings such as fallen leaves or puddles are Z plane clipped (this means they flicker sometimes or part of the bitmap is buried under the ground). Sound is equally bad with the barks from the NPCs being repeated over and over again. Connor, the guy who you follow, says \"Hey... over here\" every two seconds until you join him. It's so lazy.Now I tried MP too and the first thing that annoyed me is having to put in the supplied one-time-use MP online code. This drops the resale value of this game considerably if you use the code - something to consider if you resell your games after a while. MP itself seemed little more than spawn, random death, random spawn, random death and so was not really doing it for me. The maps are huge but unlike say, Battlefield 1943 which allows some choices on your spawn point, I always seemed to spawn either right in the middle of the action or about a mile away. Perhaps there's a way of controlling your spawn point but when an enemy spawned right next to where I was crouching I shut it off. I doubt I'll revisit it.In summation - not worth your time or money. If you haven't done so yet, buy Crysis 2 and support a developer who respects gamers and gives value for money.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2011"}

As the game progresses, Fisher needs help the terrorists to earn the JBA's trust while maintaining the NSA's trust by undermining the JBA's activities.This trust system forms the core of the game: various objectives will earn or lose trust with either organization. For example, the NSA could ask you to covertly plant a bug on a JBA phone, and by doing so you would earn trust with the NSA and by failing to do so you lose trust. Sometimes you get what are called \"choice objectives\" at which point the JBA and NSA give you opposing objectives, like the JBA wanting you to kill the hostage and the NSA wanting you to NOT kill the hostage. Balancing the trust of both organizations is a fine art, but the player savvy enough to complete a lot of secondary objectives will usually not have a problem, as only a few objectives affect both trust systems.Completing certain objectives marked with a star will allow the player to unlock more gadgets or improvements to existing gadgets. While not totally necessary, some of the items (especially the hacking upgrades) are worth going out of your way for.I found Double Agent a lot harder to be completely stealthy in, compared to the earlier entries into the series. It can be done, but where my scores were 90th percentile in the earlier games I usually ended up in the 50th or 60th here. Killing opponents is especially rough on your stealth score, as I got a -83% on a mission that turned into a bloodbath with 16 casualties.In addition to the standard mission, there are now \"undercover\" missions that take place inside JBA headquarters. These are the real test of the player's cunning, as Fisher can't exactly knock out the people he's bunking with without making them suspicious, and getting caught doing ANYTHING suspicious is usually a \"game over\" offense. With a little creativity and luck, though, it can be done. I like how some of the objectives, the ones relating to building profiles of the major terrorists, can be completed in any of the JBA HQ missions. The objective screen will tell you how many profile pieces you have attained out of how many are possible at that stage in the game, and if you can't find Moss in the second HQ mission to record his voice, you can try again in the third. As you gain access to more areas, the number of items you can find increases, and your objective screen updates accordingly.A big plus on the game is the ability to save anywhere, as long as you are not in a minigame like hacking a keypad or removing a detonator from a mine. This was also the most frustrating part of the game for me, as the actual process of saving took almost 45 seconds - 40 seconds to load the saved games you already had and 5 to actually save. While an acceptable price to pay, I guess, the fact that the game saves in 5 seconds makes me believe that this was an avoidable nuisance.Another big disappointment is the new stealth indicator - green for hidden, yellow for visible, red for spotted. Gone are the light and sound indicators, which I thought worked very well. The new system only goes yellow when you actually are visible, not approaching it, and the sound measurement is gone, even though people react to sound even more in this game than in previous installments. Ubisoft dropped the ball on that one; let's hope they fix it in the upcoming Conviction entry into the series.There is also a multiplayer spies-versus-mercenaries section of the game, which takes up about half the possible achievement points. I found this to be a weak multiplayer game though - the mercs play like watered-down Halo characters and the spies have no offensive capabilities whatsoever except for a grab move that more often than not can't be pulled off. The maximum number of players for each side is three, and the spies can only be humans while the mercenaries can fill out their ranks with AI bots. I would have liked to see that option for both sides to keep it fair. It does make for an interesting game though, as it pretty much splits the combat and stealth aspects of the Splinter Cell franchise and pits them against each other.All in all though, this is a great game, and well worth the buy, as the single-player campaign is a bit too long for the average rental period.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2009"}

I was genuinely engrossed with the plot and the characters of the game. Near the end, I really came to care for the \"Little Sister\" and the Rapture (underworld city which Bioshock is based on). I know it is silly to care for a video game character and location, but this movie succeeds where the others have failed.The meticulous attention to detail in this game was amazing. It appears they have hired many experts (writers, actors, psychologists, movie effects professionals, artists, and programmers) to create a world and characters which we can genuinely care about. For example, the \"Little Sister\" murmurs her words just like a 5-6 yr old girl saying things like \"Jams and Hamm Yummy!~\". It was the little touches which made this game more real than most movies.I do not recommend this game to kids under 12 since the violence and language are not appropriate. And the game does take its shots against the religious right (I didn't mind but some would).I ran this game on a Dell XPS 1530M which has a NVIDIA 8600M graphics card (same as MacBook Pro and one of the finest notebook card in the market) which ran Windows Vista and the gameplay was very smooth.

{"product_name":"B0050SYLRK","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"Flawed Great Game","reviewText":"I enjoyed this game, but it had a lot of flaws that decreased my enjoyment of the title. This is still classic Assassin's Creed gameplay, and there's a lot of game here. However some of the most important things are kind of lacking is AC3. This is partially because of the 2 cities it takes place in, as they just aren't great areas to free run around, especially the burned out Boston. Then there's the wilderness, which is simply too large, with too few fast travel spots and nothing really worth while between them. The free running here just doesn't feel right, it either doesn't work, or when it does it just feels so artificial and forced, the opposite of the way you want to feel when you're supposed to be free running. It's also just takes forever to get anywhere, I swear that your character's running speed is slowed down, and the horse is difficult to manage especially in the wilderness. The mountain climbing was another thing that bothered me, as I would keep trying to climb something that looks like it should be climbable, but for whatever reason it isn't and you'd have to run all the way around the mountain to get where you were trying to go. The combat is another thing that could be fun, but I liked AC2's version better. In AC3, I feel like it was trying to be more like the Batman games, and if you want to actually counter anything, you have to wait and then counter, which to me really slowed down the combat. For over half of the game, I didn't wait after countering, and every time I would just throw the person instead of actually countering. This was annoying, but it actually made the combat quicker and much more difficult, and when I finally figured out you had to wait for the counter to complete during one of the fist-fighting mini-quests I kind of missed the earlier combat, but I didn't go back to it because a lot of the later enemies need to be countered in a specific way.For the story, there are a lot of amazing moments that are really cool, but the character of Connor was a real let-down. I was looking forward to a Native American character, but he's just so flat and boring that I didn't feel for him at all, I'm not sure if I should blame the writers or the voice actor. It was also annoying with how you were a huge bad ass when you could control Connor, but every time after you killed everyone and completed your mission, there would be cut scene where you would be knocked out or something, it was just so frustrating and it really took me out of the game. There were a lot of cool historical moments, but at the same time with how Connor was involved in all of them, it was again pretty unbelievable and took me out of the story. Still, some of the moments especially towards the end of the game were awesome and cinematic, even when they didn't totally make sense.The sea warfare was probably my favorite part of the game, as it worked well and I'd never really played anything like it before. However, it kind of felt tacked on, and I wish there had been more of the story tied to it, instead of it apparently just being a massive live test of the ship warfare that would be the centerpiece of AC4. I liked the building of your town, where you could gather a bunch of people. My only problem with it is that I wish there was more content, more interaction with all of the people, although maybe that's just because I loved what Mass Effect did with character side-conversations. The mini-games are mostly annoying in AC3, especially the cowboy checkers, which were almost impossible to win, and I swear the computer cheated, or maybe it was just how the game was constructed,Overall, this is a great game, with many small problems peppered throughout. You can have many hours of fun with this game, so I would recommend it, but not heavily.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00BGA9YZK","description":"","reviewerName":"Thomas Riccardi","summary":"One of the best next gen FPS'es","reviewText":"When I got my Playstation 3 there were two games that I purchased with it. The first was Gran Turismo 5 prologue and the other was Killzone 2. I thought that this would be just another first person shooter but it turned out to be a great game. Now with the release of the Playstation 4 one of the same day releases is a game called Killzone Shadowfall. But is this a game that you will want to get at launch or should you wait for a better game?This game takes place thirty years after the events of Killzone 3. It focuses on the conflict between the Helghast and the Vektans and these are two rivals who are trying to colonize a distant planet. For thirty years these two factions have been living side by side separated by a giant wall. There has been a fragile peace that has existed for this time but it seems to be eroding as both factions are on edge.You play as Lucas Kellan who is a member of the Shadow Marshals (a military intelligence unit) who tries to keep the peace between these two factions. The missions will vary from stealthy infiltrations to all out firefights. You will have various weaponry at your disposal ranging from your standard pistols and rifles to sniper rifles and even a drone. The drone is called an OWL as it can not only attack enemies but also hack terminals and shield you from incoming attacks.There is also going to be more content released for this game as there is a $20 season pass available. This gives access to co-op play , new map packs and two additional multiplayer expansion packs. The multiplayer aspect of the game has been tweaked for the better as there are three classes for players to choose from. Assault, Support and Scout are the three classes and each of these have special abilities that you can deploy. For example the assault class has a buddy drone that will automatically attack incoming enemies. There are 10 maps that are going to be available at launch and more will be released in the coming months.If you are a fan of the Killzone games and were lucky to get a PS4 then this is the essential game to get.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2013"}

An uneasy peace settled over the land while, for years, the drums of war were silent. Yet the kingdoms of men grew complacent in their victory--and slowly, the defeated orcish clans regrouped under the banner of a new visionary leader.Now a darker shadow has fallen over the world, threatening to extinguish all life--all hope. The drums of war play upon the winds once again--rising urgently toward the inevitable hour when the skies will rain fire--and the world will tremble before the coming of the Burning Legion.WarCraft IIIreturns players to the war-torn world of Azeroth. Developer Blizzard Entertainment combines the lessons learned from its bestselling StarCraft, the famous WarCraft lineage, and all-new 3-D technology to create an all-new, vibrant strategy game sure to become a classic.Wage war in a fully interactive 3-D world that incorporates nonplayer characters, wandering monsters, neutral towns, strongholds, temples, and environmental effects. Four mighty playable races--humans, orcs, night elves, and undead--compete in a finely balanced dance of conquest. Upgradable heroes gain experience and harness new powers as the game progresses.

I have since learned that his whole reason for it was to play Mongolians to my Great Wall of China. How come every time I put up a good barricade his troops have to go and knock it down?I find myself frustratingly hooked to this game right now, desperate to beat his troops into submission. So far, I have had no luck. I suck at this game.During single player mode I find that this game has amazing pretender FMV sequences that are comparable to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, but the real time graphics are far from impressive, adequate, but not impressive. There is a great deal of stuff going on in this game though, and that's what makes this fun. It's the strategy. Trying to build your defense, and offense evenly, do I train a bunch of troopers, or hold out and train bigger, badder monsters? What are my opponents doing? Will they notice if I send a peasant to steal gold out of their mines? If I conquer their mine, will they retaliate? I can't pull myself away! Help! I can't turn this game off!The only real problem with this game is that I have to upgrade my computer in order for it to run properly. Right now I have some serious lag issues, and the larger my army, and better my defenses the slower the game runs. I'm more of a console gamer, but this game may finally force me to upgrade the motherboard.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2002"}

I remember when it first came out the visuals and music were so revolutionary and stunning. Now theyre old school but it is still a great game. Then Sonic 2 came along and Ive never seen anything so fast and the sound so amazing(at the time). Sonic 3 is a masterpiece and the graphics obviously took up almost all of the Genesis' power.It was one of the first really graphically stunning games since Super Mario World. Sonic and Knuckles came along and it was more of the same only more impressive but Sonic 3 was the first sign that Sonic was evolving. Sega had true classics which were some of the greatest games Ive played ever(Sonic 3 and Knuckles).Historically, Sonic Mega Collection misses a few important games. But thats alright because the games here are all great and I can sense that there will be a Sonic Mega Collection 2 (with Game Gear,Saturn and Sega CD Sonic games on it) and that Sega is just being this quiet this year because they want to surprise us with their 2 secret weapons( a rerelease of Sonic Adventure and a whole new Sonic and Shadow game that will come to X Box and Game Cube).

They were fine back in the days of Operation Wolf but nowadays they remind me too much of those awfully dated (and seemingly endless) House of the Dead games. I was a little wearing when purchasing RE: TUC but I knew it would be far superior to the other zombie shooter.In between the rehashed levels you get to play as Wesker and find up what he was up to behind the scenes of the original games. If you unlock enough weapons and files you can also play a bonus level set in an industrial facility owned by Umbrella in the Russian snowy wastelands.Some levels take a lot of repeating until you get the right combination of weapons and perfect the timing but not to the point that you'll be chucking your remote at the wall. I am terrible at these kind of games and I still managed it.What disappointed me the most was the total lack of any kind of atmosphere. But it's not really that kind of game. RE: TUC is for those craving a dose of mindless violence rather than a problem-solving thinker.But when you unlock absolutely everything there ain't much reason to go back to the game.

{"product_name":"B0038TT8QM","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian Martin","summary":"Great game ruined by steam","reviewText":"Ok, so I guess I'll add to the chorus of people who hate steam. While I see how it can be cool in a way as a games \"hub\" it's too clunky and cumbersome to use for any real games. In a way it's not SO bad, but had I not already bought it and learned it required steam, I defitely wouldn't have purchased it day 1. For one, where you install steam is where all your games are installed. I have a games drive and all I see is a folder called \"Steam\" with civ somewhere in it. I know it's a little gripe but it's just kinda clunky and annoying.As for steam itself, even way back when for Half Life 2 it just seems slow and buggy. I run a quad core with a 9800 GTX, a pretty decent system, and booting up steam is slow and clicking menu items lag. Like I said I see how it COULD be cool, having a sort of games hub, but if I actually purchase the cd what in the heck is the point of having steam? If I wanted to play it on steam I would have bought it on steam! It just seems really cheesy to me that in a sense you are \"renting\" the game. I can deal with a one time online activation, or something, but steam just sucks.As for the game itself, graphics-wise, I can usually put all my games on high settings, Mass Effect 2, Dragon Age, Unreal 3, and they run well. For whatever reason I have to put this game on Medium settings for it to run just OK and I don't understand why. The graphics are nothing special,no fancy effects or anything. I notice as the \"fog of war\" fades it runs better. Needless to say the whole steam + laggy game play seriously hampered my feelings for the game.Those were big road blocks for me, I like to be in control of what gets installed on my pc and where. Once I got into the game I enjoyed it. Though from the opening cinematic it seemed like it would have some sort of campaign. But sadly no, there is no \"story\" and no real connection to your \"empire\". I chose America, and I never see George Washington pop up and give me any backstory or anything. A little more customization in that regard would have been nice. Even if it took some RPG cues and let me create my unknown ruler from scratch.I did spend a good deal of time making choices and sending out my armies. Though, interaction with out civilizations is pretty much summed up in a few button presses. You can either declare war or trade. Again some RPG cues would have been nice, like learning about the actual Civilizations or about the person you're talking to. Like I first encountered the Iriquois and it would have been nice to actually have a \"dialog\" with him, not just do some trading or killing.It seems like it's more fun and less expensive to simply destroy a civilization than actually have real relationships with it. Atleast so far. Traveling through their borders pisses them off unless you pay them. When I could simply just destroy them and take their city for my own. Though admittedly I've only spent about 4 hours with the game.All in all though I am happy with the purchase. I defintely wouldn't have purchased had I known steam was involved and it still miffs me that I have to have that junk on my pc to basically \"rent\" the game. The performance issues are defintely a negative. Is it worth 50 bucks? For sure it is without the extra crap steam and performance issues. As it stands now I don't regret my purchase but don't really feel 100% great about it either.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2010"}

The graphics are better, the controls are better, the menus are better, the voice acting is amazing. The ending of this game though, as many have complained, is really bad. Plot holes abound as well as the muting of antagonist that simply become puppets. WTF is all I have to say. It is clear that Mass Effect 3 never went through any type of quality control or feedback from game testers, because not only did it have bugs not allowing the importation of custom characters from the previous two Mass Effects (which was the most touted feature of the series), but nobody in their right mind would have gone with that ending with a happy \"hell ya\" that was awesome. I kid you not its that bad.I'm not surprised since this game is coming from EA. They are the 2012 WORST COMPANY IN AMERICA.Bottom line the game is awesome. It does have fantastic game play, fantastic voice acting and animations, has a great story...until the very fricking end. Hopefully the \"Extended Cut\" DLC ending that Bioware was forced to release this coming summer do to the backlash, fixes the terrible ending and makes us all happy.In conclusion this should have been a 10 out of 10 game.

I liked MGS2, although it's storyline is a little on the convulted side. However, after playing twin snakes, I have found a new love for this game. There is a lot of gameplay compared to twin snakes, and it shows. The environments are a lot more inventive, and the graphics are somewhat better in areas(ie Tanker rain, outdoor areas of oil rig, and character models). In Twin Snakes, the areas are slightly darker and the gun models are on the black side, which looks cooler for a lot of parts. Still, this game's graphics are top-notch.For those planning on buying Twin Snakes.... Well, this game is a lot better. The extras are incredible! Tons of VR, Dog Tags(In Twin Snakes, they do nothing), Skateboarding, Snake tales, Cinema Theatre, and the list grows. I love the extras now. I love the fact that everything looks great, especially the oil rig outdoor stuff. The extras in Twin Snakes are the same as the original(not alot).As for cutscenes, they don't seem like alot after Twin Snakes. The game is basically much more fun after realizing that this is true stealth action. The gameplay and cinematics balance each other out. In Twin Snakes, the cinematics make the gameplay about 5 minutes total not including boss fights. This game is a solid investment and it truly has no flaws in my opinion.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2004"}

I thought buying it, it wasn't but I had sold the PSX version of it so it worked out good.  The two main differences between the games is graphics and the ability to go into first person view.  Many people will complain about this game vs the original for two or more reasons.  The main being the game was set pretty simple and short, then you give players the ability to go into first person that just makes it easier.  Another big complaint is the controls I like the gamecube controls myself so no problem.  I would kind of assume if you own a WII or gamecube you don't mind that.  So basically the biggest complaint is the ability to go first person only made it easier.  I agree but the graphics and all else make up for to the casual gamer.  Lastly if you are person who doesn't like Playstation or only has Nintendo hardware you'd probably like this innterptation of it better anyway.

Thiel \"John P. Thiel\"","summary":"This takes more strategy and skill than Ace Combat 4","reviewText":"I'm updating my review because I have now gotten all the planes--every last one--and must declare it well worth the effort.  When I had only 'the best' planes, the missions were not nearly as interesting and oftentimes very difficult to do a sortie at Expert or Ace level because the plane I was using was too fast, didn't perform well at low altitudes, or featured weapons that were only really good for dog fighting. I could be flying the Falken through a mission and my wingmen would get the most kills because I would overshoot my target before I had a chance to lock on and fire and therefore have to go at it again, and the enemy aircraft would shoot me down as I literally jetted past them.  The Falken is a great example because, unless your targets are all out in the open, you likely wont be as successful as if you flew something less 'super.'Which plane you chooose is as important if not more than how you fly it or what kinds of weapons it features.  For comparison, if you wanted to play a really great game of golf, you would need a full set of clubs--not just a driver and a putter.  Likewise with planes--and I imagine this absolutely must be so in the real world of jet fighters--there is no one super plane that is the absolute best for all situations.The best thing about this game--even more so than with Ace Combat 4--is how it demands you use strategy in addition to making appropriate choices in which planes your team flies.Unlike Ace Combat 4, you can't just pick the right plane for yourself and finish the level or all levels practically solo.  You need not only the right plane for yourself, but the right plane for your wingman and sometimes a complex combination of plane capabilities for the three other pilots at your command in addition to yourself.  And then you have to give them appropriate commands--or you'll fail.  Sometimes you even have give the most important strategic role to yourself while giving the more exciting dogfighting role to one of your other pilots.You can't just have your team cover you and blast away at everything--you'd likely run out of missles and/or time--and even when the software suggests other choices of commands or planes, you have to take command and make the real decisions.So what I wrote about Ace Combat 4 is far more true of Ace Combat 5.  This isn't a game for dummies, and the amount of choice making you have to do in addition to outflying your opponents is what makes this an intelligent game.They even included a bit of flight school in this one--nice.My only complaint is about the Arcade Mode.  You have to do it all the way from beginning to end.  You can't save and finish it off later--which is no good for those of use who don't have hours at a shot to sit there and play video games.  I'd rather be able to do a few bits in arcade mode, save it and do more later.Campaign Mode is just perfect though.  Sometimes you're stuck having to do more without saving after a really long and hard level, but it's not over the top difficult or lengthy.  Even this adds to the challenge though, as you have to choose planes that you can succeed with in a variety of situations.Great game; much improved over its previous version without losing anything in the process.I do wish the playback at the end of each mission showed the weapon strikes at Ace Combat 4 did.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2006"}

They must make the second part of a trilogy (traditionally, the best of the trilogy (Matrix notwithstanding)) and they must follow up one of the best RPG experiences of this console generation, Mass Effect. At the end of the first game, you killed the renegade Spectre and saved the Citadel. Things, truly, were looking pretty good.This time, the game starts off with a bang. A mysterious enemy absolutely obliterates the Normandy. Blasts it to pieces in minutes and apparently kills humanity's savior, Shepard. You save your crew, but are blasted into space in a suit that is leaking oxygen.Fortunately for you, you are somehow picked up by the Cerberus Corporation and painstakingly rebuilt from the skeleton up. You are then informed that the creatures that helped destroy your ship and very nearly kill you are the Reapers and, naturally, you have to kill them. So, it's up to you to recruit a team to pursue this objective.One of the nicest touches is that the game does correspond with the original title. For example, Ashley died in the original game, so she was still dead here. All of my former allies remembered me and while some couldn't join, the game did make it seem like our old relationship helped me with their people. Of course, Shepard is brought over as well and your preferred class remains the same in this one.The storyline is well-done, if a bit predictable, but Bioware fixed up the game nicely. The side quests mean something now and aren't the exact same quest every time. The buildings don't have identical floor patterns. You don't have to pilot the irritating Mako (there are some vehicle missions in one of the DLC packs, and they are irritating, but they are not required). You must not only recruit party members, but to have them fully powered for you, you must earn their loyalty by performing a task for them. And the task changes, so it's not like you have to do the same task every time. The new additions to the game are compelling characters with a lot of interesting parts to their overall personality. The shooting is super easy and the controls are streamlined enough to make pausing to issue orders hardly a necessity. They also significantly simplified the inventory system, so you won't have dozens of dozens of nearly identical items to wade through.In fact, the only real bad part of the game is the mineral hunt to upgrade your ship, weapons, etc. Those are some tedious little quests. Even with the upgrade to speed up the process, it's still highly unenjoyable and somebody I hope doesn't return for the sequel.ME2 sets up the third title in the series nicely and produces an early favorite for RPG of the year. But it's Bioware...if it wasn't amazing, it would just not be their usual level of work. Couldn't recommend it highly enough.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2010"}

This game is so good that I feel like the less I say, the better. Mass Effect 2 takes everything out that was bad in the first and improves on what was already fine to begin with. The story especially is very deep and multi-layered, with each character having enough depth and backstory to justify any idea of giving them their own title or at least side story. The game is a lot more streamlined this time around and removes things like the vehicle driving (which was just awful in the first) to make the game move a lot quicker. I felt like the first one had a little too much micro management in it when it came to the team inventory but this one does away with all that. Top notch voice acting, graphics, gameplay, music... seriously, you cannot go wrong with this one. The best thing about it is if you still have your save file from the first one, you can integrate your character into the sequel. They even reference certain choices you might have made and some of the choices might have certain effects in the sequel's story. Now that's something you don't see too often.

There were so many platformers on the market and with games like Sonic and Donkey Kong Country no one wanted to give this game a shot. However as time went on it seems that there would not be another installment of this series. The folks over at Ubisoft had always hinted and teased about a new game and after years Rayman Legends was released. But is this the game that the fans have waited for or should they take their money elsewhere?The game starts as we find out that Rayman, Globox and the teensies have been asleep for a hundred years. When they finally are awoken they find out that the ten princesses of the land have been abducted. Murfy tells them what has been going on since they have been asleep and they head out to liberate the land from the Bubble Dreamer.This game is similar to Origins where you can control either Globox, The teensies or Rayman through various levels. Murfy is not playable in this installment but he does lend a hand throughout the various levels either by holding enemies or activating mechanisms. And there is no shortage of levels to clear as there are 120 levels in this game including 40 remastered levels from Rayman Origins. Also when you play through certain stages you will be able to play as the princesses you rescue with their own moves and powers. You can also compete with other players online in leaderboard challenges. The challenges range from who can collect the most lumi in a short amount of time to who can survive on a stage the longest. There is also a local multiplayer game called Kung Foot as well (which is a really fun soccer game you can play with your friends).The levels are beautifully cel shaded and looks like you are playing an animated movie. It seems that Ubisoft really went all out on this game with tons of levels, challenges and a great art style. This was going to be a Wii U exclusive but thankfully this is available on every platform and even the PC! If you are a fan of the old style side scrollers and want something with a ton of levels then this is the game for you.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2013"}

I'm betting most people aren't really into ATV racing. I'm not so bothered, as I'm a racing junkie of any sort, but I will admit I'm into rallying and not so into ATVs. I don't really see the enjoyment in really trashing the environment. :)But that said, this is a game, and not a Hummer H2 (or 1 for that matter). And I love games.Booting the game up, I was glad to see you're given the option (it's not a necessity) of installing the game to the hard drive. This takes up around 1GB, so not too shabby (though not for the first time calling into question the usage of a Blu-ray disc and not a DVD...)The problem begins when trying to start a game. You're forced into Create-an-ATV mode. I don't know about you guys/girls, but building my ATV by picking all kinds of tiny parts doesn't do it for me. Thankfully there's a way to \"auto pick\" all the parts, but it's odd that a game as arcadey as Pure is even makes you go through this monotony. Perhaps if you're more into ATVs, though, this might appeal? But in any case, this isn't Gran Turismo, so I still don't get it...Anyway, once you've created your ATV, you get to pick from the usual races by way of tours. This is very basic, with you racing to win, after which you unlock more tours etc ad nauseam.The game:The game plays very well. It's very much an arcade game, but it runs very smoothly even with a ton of players on screen, looks quite good (720p), though the sound is quite weak and lacking any real punch. The engine sounds are also fairly generic. But it's nice that the Dualshock 3 controller is supported, as the rumble is always a nice addition.There are problems, though,....1.) No local multiplayer, so you're constrained to only one person per PS3, and the only multiplayer option is online.2.) The graphics, while quite attractive, also exhibit a sort-of hazy characteristic. It really could do with being quite a bit sharper, and sadly this seems to be a staple of a lot of modern games (Fable 2 on the XBOX 360 as an example...).3.) The soundtrack is pretty awful, and it's a shame you can't use your own music that you rip to your PS3.4.) Each character you race as yells all sorts of inane and irritating things while you race, and after about a lap you just want it to stop. Thankfully, you CAN make it stop, since the options screen gives you a choice of character voice on/off. I suggest off. Wholeheartedly.5.) Some of the tricks you can implement in mid-air are just quite tough to pull off, and many of the advanced ones are incredibly fidgety. And this is from someone who's played quite a few racing titles.So, overall, it's a fun game, but really nothing you've never seen before. If you're really into ATVs, I wholeheartedly recommend the game. If not, well, it's at least worth a rental to decide if you like it.3.5/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2008"}

High replay value, good create-a-superstar mode, and lots of unlockables. The best overall entry in the series; the only problem is that it doesn't have some of the upgrades that later editions of the game have.THE LONG: Fans of the PS2 Smackdown series have surely checked this one out already, which at the time of this writing is already several years old. This review then is meant for those who entered the series late or only recently and missed out on this title.This game was released at a very transitional period in the WWE. A little more than a year prior the company acquired rival WCW and most of its stars, many of whom appeared here for the first time in a WWE title (such as Diamond Dallas Page, appearing here for the first, last, and only time). This is major, as it's the first Smackdown title to really have major WCW stars. Second, this game came out right after the time of the WWE's \"brand extension\"- that is, splitting its wrestlers between its two main shows. And lastly, the game came out after the spring of the N.W.O. joining the WWE, meaning the first time Hogan would be included since the Super Nintendo days.What does any of this matter? Well, that roster is pretty robust thanks to WWE legends and current headliners combined with the likes of WCW greats like the Chris's, Benoit and Jericho. There's a total of something like 45 or 50 wrestlers to pick from, missing only (but unfortunately) a few of the last half-decade's greatest such as Mysterio, Goldberg, and Sting (who's not under contract to the WWE anyway). Second, that draft makes a great launchpad to this game's also robust story mode. The game begins as you choose a brand, Raw or Smackdown, and work for either Mcmahon or Flair. The first thing you do is watch (and participate) as each of the two brands picks its top ten wrestler choices, and the results aren't always the same- sometimes you'll wrestle alongside your favorites, sometimes against them. This is already much more random and unpredictable than most of the following WWE games.This begins the game proper. You start with some exhibition matches as you try to earn a little headway with the boss, attempting to get enough points for a title shot. Realistically, only the top contenders get to try for the title, with a point system (based on wins and losses) showing who's doing best. Your matches take place on a weekly basis- each of the 4 weeks per month you'll wrestle and talk amongst people backstage, or try for those titles. At the end of the month is a pay-per-view, and the big money-matches usually (but not always) occur then, so if you're good you can participate.The best thing about this game, the thorough storyline, is evidenced here. Even if a pay-per-view (or most common matches) don't feature you, you often get to participate in behind-the-scenes drama like being involved in a fight or jockeying for position with other jealous wrestlers. And if you don't like all the talk, you can watch, interrupt, or take control of (as another wrestler) matches in the undercard of most fights.But, I yet again reiterate, the story is what makes things interesting. Unlike the storylines of the following 2 games, which were linear with little change between a few paths, the stuff in SYM doesn't get repetitive after one or two times through. The season takes place during several years, with a few constants such as the rivalry between Flair and Mcmahon, but there's lots of chance for customization in between. You'll have opportunities to pick match types with your opponents, appear in a film and take time off, and dramatically turn face (or heel) by doing things such as hitting your opponent during contract signings and so on. And during the last year or two, you have a great deal of freedom to shape your own destiny as the boss rivalry and N.W.O. stuff cools off. Whereas the storylines in the next couple games were worth maybe a couple plays through and totaled about 5-10 hours each, the story in SYM is deep enough to last 20-30 hours per play-through. That's as long as some RPGs, to the point that some magazines actually complained that it was too long (the same people, like EGM, who complained, although fairly, that the previous game was too short).Since little changed as far as the graphics, sound, and control go, it's fair to say that this entry looks and plays about as good as the others in the series. The options are very thorough, with just about every match type except the (pretty silly) bra and panties match of the next game and the (slightly less interesting) casket match of previous entries. But it does have the important ones such as Hell in a Cell, Royal Rumble, and Elimination Chamber.Basically, what makes this series any good seems to be most solidly packed in this entry. A great roster of wrestlers (the only one with Hogan, DDP, Kevin Nash, and Brock Lesnar together) in addition to what I've been harping on all this time, the deepest and most open-ended story mode in the series, make this the ultimate version of Smackdown available. I can only guess that some of this was axed in favor of features like voice acting, the bra and panties match, and online capability of the next games (none of which were all that great), so it's my opinion that this is the Smackdown to choose. And at around ten bucks or less, there's not much reason for any wrestling fan to pass it up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2005"}

It's well known that the lines have always been divided between those who view wrestling as a modern day performance art, and those who view it as grown men in tights performing homoerotica feats of fury.  Likewise, the lines have been clearly been drawn between which \"style\" of gameplay the gamer likes in his/her grappling.  While the Aki WWF titles of old, as well as the Fire Pro series cater to the sim minded, with thousands of move possibilities at any given time, the Smackdown series instead opts to portray the \"sport\" as it truly is: a fast paced, rhythmic spectacle. This translates smoothly into gameplay terms, thanks to the streamlined control set.  It hasn't changed a great deal since the series' inception, but Shut Your Mouth has more moves than any other installment, while remaining just as easy to control. Though the controls remain largely unchanged, the graphics have received the shot in the arm they so desperately needed. While hair textures still look plastered on, everything else looks absolutely fabulous. Stages, character models, arenas, lighting; these all look so realistic that you'd think you're watching the show on TV! Well, not really, but it is the prettiest wrestling game on the market. Likewise, the painstaking attention to detail in each wrestler's mannerisms that can break or make a game like this was not skimped on: every ring entrance is 100% authentic, down to the boas on Hulk Hogan's neck. Many other fixes that the series so desperately needed were applied in Shut Your Mouth: The horrid commentary is kept to a minimum, and what's there doesn't sound like a robot clone piecing words together.  Season mode actually feels like an honest-to-goodness season for the first time since the idea was proposed.  The game no longer takes half your memory card, nor loads after every screen.  And while you can't sanction title matches, you can play the role of booker in a limited role by deciding who goes to what show in the pre-season draft. It's in no way perfect, and the gameplay still needs to be slowed down a little, rather than sped up, as it seems to have been in version 4.0.  But despite its few flaws, this year's WWE video game offering for PS2 fans fares much better than its TV and XBOX counterpart.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2003"}

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.PlayStation Network support including PlayStation Trophies.","reviewerName":"Fizhy","summary":"Singularity","reviewText":"It was a fantastic game, challenging but not ridiculous.

There are hundreds of characters in this game but none of them feel very well developed. At least not in the way that other RPG's have mastered character development, like FINAL FANTASY, LUNAR or LOST ODYSSEY (to name a few). I felt very little emotion toward any of the characters, major or not. I must have killed hundreds of NPC's (my bounty was well over 200,000) and shed not a tear for any of my victims.GAMEPLAY: 4/5--I often think to myself, \"If I was making this game, I would improve it this way . . .\" However, this game did things the way I would have done it myself, were I making my own game.A better inventory system is the only major suggestion that comes to mind. It gets too cluttered once you start collecting potions, keys and ingredients.GRAPHICS: 5/5--Very good graphics all around. My only complaint is that the water is too dark. If it were more clear they could have put some underwater caves in or hid some treasure down there.QUESTS: 4/5--The main quest is terribly short and somewhat repetitive. Thankfully, the game does not end when you finish the main quest as you can explore the rest of the world you haven't touched yet. I believe those that say they've logged 200+ hours on this game.OVERALL: 4/5--About as good as Morrowind, the main difference being that I actually cared enough to finish the main quest instead of just roam around for hours on end.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2008"}

That made me confident in my 5 star rating for this game.  Since I had done nothing else to my system for this last problem, the answer can only be Blizzard fixing the problem they caused.  This shows that Blizzard isn't sitting on the high praise on this game, and is constantly working on the game not just in expansion of game content, but in making the game playable to a broad an audience as possible.  Big thumbs up for that!The game itself -The game is surprisingly demanding on your system requirement.  I'm forced to set my graphics and sound pretty low to run this game smoothly.  But even with lowered graphics, I'm really enjoying the art style they chose for this game.  Also worth noting is the distinctive look each area is given.  When you leave one region and enter a new one, there is a completely different feeling you get from the surrounding.  The subtle touches they put in each region is brilliantly designed.There are still a lot for me (lvl 22, Undead Rogue my main character) to do in this game.  New areas to explore, quests to complete, new skills to learn, animals to skin, leather armor to make, auctions to watch, and even goofing around is fun! Nothing like dancing on top of an open flame, let me tell ya!This game still suffer from leveling syndrome.  But thusfar, I have never felt like the next level is too far off, and never did I travel far to complete my quests.  And quests themselves aren't too difficult to do solo, so long as you go for the yellow quests.  Yes, color coded the quests are.  Green is below your level range, yellow is in your level range, red is...wait til you level up or get a group started.  Easier the quest for you, less exp, harder, more exp.  So there is some incentive to try out the more difficutl for your level quests.World of Warcraft has a craft selection.  But I find it just not worth that much to invest my time in crafting.  Also, the game lacks that involveness with your character.  There's very little push for roleplaying outside your own need to do so.  YOu can't set up shop, you can't get your own place...you are constantly on the move from one area to another.  Once you finish with your starting region, there's little reason outside of visiting the major city to even come back to it.  Since all the quests and monsters in your level range is localized, you never have to travel back to where you were.  Your guild has a name, and you have it registered, but that's about it.  There's a mail system, and guild chat system, but there is no place you're guild can call their own.  In short, there really isn't anything that connects you, the person, to the character you play in the game.  World of Warcraft is more of an action/adventure title then a rpg one, in my opinion.A solid game, and as other MMORPG's have shown, things can only get better *knock on wood.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2004"}

Hardy","summary":"Ubi-softs best game since  'Splinter Cell'","reviewText":"Ubi-soft's game, The Prince of Persia: The sands of time is an outragously awsome game! That said, I would like to present to you my review. At first I figued Prince of Persia was some generic Platformer with a Persian and Indian featured in the game, I was unaware it was an old franchise (My sister's constant raving about it didn't help my skeptism either). So after my younger sister and brother had played it I decided to give it a try. And to my pleasant surprise, the game was not bad at all. In the beginning you play the prince (whose name is never mentioned) who seeks honnor and glory for himself and his father, but to do this he has to be the first to get to the tresure vault that resides inside Indain castle that his father is attacking. When he does he comes across a supernatural weapon titled the 'Dagger of time', which can revive you if you die, and stop, slow, or speed up time with a press of a button. But when the prince is tricked by his father's informant to place the dagger into a hourglass that holds the snads of time, he unleashes a deadly force upon the Persian kingom.So in an attempt to redeem himself, The \"prince\" embarks on a quest to retrive the sands of time and stop his father's tercherous imformant. He is ironically acccompanied by a woman named Farah (a princess of the conqured Indian kingdom) whom helps with solve a castle full of puzzles, but does nothing to help in battles. Her motives for following him are clear but she keeps her intier motives hidden from the oblvious prince. That said, the game play is not bad at all.The fighting mechianics are well done; the prince moves fludily during comat, although he tends to pause sometimes which is not a good thing. The platforming doesn't feel stiff nor does it feel as though its working against you. And as you go through the game you are faced with enemies called \"Sand creatures\" who kill everything that breathes air.The prince can stirke them down but they will get right back up, and to prevent this you use the dagger; once they've fallen the prince can retrive them by stabbing the creatures with the Dagger of time. There are no diffculty levels, the game is tough and leave your fingers aching for days. The puzzles are not simple, they will have you using your brain to figure them out. Sometimes it takes more than an hour to figure one puzzle out later on in the game. There are, however, 'Sand vision' clouds that appear once you've killed ever sand creature within every area you enter, that give you helpful hints in the form of rapidly moving visions.The animations for the characters are okay, The prince and Farah don't walk like normal people, they run strangely as well. The voice acting (french, Spanish and Enlgish alilke) is pretty good; it sounds almost normal, Although the prince tends to talk/think to himself alot when he's alone. The CGI and 3D animated Movie scenes move the plot along nicely, giving you that ceniamatic feel. All in all the Sands of time is a really cool game worthy of any PSII owner's collection. The solid gameplay is bound to have you replaying it over and over. --- [A 5 out of 5]","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2004"}

So, I finally bought it and guess what? It just flat-out rocks! First off, the graphics are simply breath-taking. It's almost like a work of art. Even the CG cineamatics are incredible. Voice acting is surprisingly good( I'm still baffled of why some of the characters speak with both British and Scottish accents) and the music is great too. Controls are very simple and easy to get into. The challenge factor of the game is decent. Not too hard, but not too easy either, especially with the swordfights and having to protect Farrah. Replay value is okay, unless you've unlocked the original POP. My only nitpicks? The game is a tad short and sometimes Farrah gets in the way or hurts you by accident, causing some cheap deaths but it's never too annoying. The game should be pretty cheap now, so go and buy it. I'm looking forward to its sequel, Prince of Persia:The Warrior Within. Excellent game I give it a 5 out of 5. Semper Fi, Carry on.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00019HNNM","description":"The close of a trilogy is a touchy thing. Miramax's slasher pic Scream 3 highlighted the role of each part: Chapter one sets the rules. Chapter two bends the rules. And chapter three throws them all out the window in favor of taking the story full circle.Which brings us to the third part of the Onimusha trilogy, subtly titled Demon Siege. In the first of many switches from the franchise's usual MO, there are three playable characters &#8211; Jean Reno's Jaques, the first Onimusha's Samanosuke, and Parisian military woman Michelle. Each offers wildly different play mechanics, and this coupled with the game's time warp storyline (more on that later) offers needed variety to a survival horror franchise that was never really know for its fear factor.Each character will upgrade their weapons and skills through the course of the game (much less so for Michelle, as she's playable for far less of the game than the other two) in the usual fashion&nbsp;&#8211; collecting souls. Without a combo-laden combat system, Demon Siege relies heavily on timing and strategy to master each of the three warriors. This mechanic is very reminiscent of Enter the Matrix for two reasons: minimal button presses result in onscreen action that looks very, very cool. Two, the timing of action is far more crucial than combos. The difference is that Demon Siege is just a much better game &#8211; the enemies offer more variety, the control is more precise, and the elemental weaponry is extremely varied.While some action hardcores will likely fault the game for its simple control scheme, most will appreciate it for the satisfaction it brings to the screen. Kicking a demon away so you have better range with the Ball and Chain of Doom (my name for it, not the game's) is quite cool, after all. Just keep in mind that plot and combat play equal roles in the Onimusha universe, and each are doled out fairly.On the story side of things, Demon Siege has that dual time period hook. How well is the idea executed? Well, Paris really looks like Paris; and without being able to experience feudal Japan firsthand, all I can say is that it looks beautiful in the game. The plot unfolds at a lightning pace and requires players to use one character (in one time period) to do something, which has an effect on the other character (in the other time period). Switching frequently, the game's pace is so well crafted that there are few places that seem to be a pause &#8211; you'll always want to do that next thing.What I really like about this game is that I always felt like I was getting a new weapon, going to a new area, or fighting a new boss (most of which are ferociously tough, by the way). There was no drag for me. That, and kicking Genma butt made me look badass. Personally, I wouldn't want anything else for my favorite samurai/horror sendoff.Concept:Craft a compelling, edge-of-your seat action game to conclude the Onimusha seriesGraphics:3D backgrounds don't mean that players have camera control, but it does mean that everything looks really greaSound:The score alternates between totally inspired and super cheesy &#8211; but it does fit the gamePlayability:Timing is the key to success and I rarely felt robbed, so it did what it was supposed toEntertainment:Demon Siege is one of the most cinematic games to date, and I soaked up every second gratefullyReplay:HighRated:9 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:The final chapter of the Onimusha trilogy radiates excitement and is the very definition of epic. The opening CG cinematic is so detailed and explosive that I wouldn't be surprised if George Lucas started handing out pink slips to the ILM crew. I know this clip is only a few minutes in length, but it is worth the price of admission alone. Further justifying that you absolutely need to add this title to your library, the gameplay is equally exquisite and is brimming with non-stop intensity. The methods with which you dispose of your assailants remain simplistic and true to the series. Plus, the battles are much larger in scope, the pacing of levels is relentless, and the visuals that you breathe in are all the more majestic. This truly is game development at its finest. While I would have liked to see more interaction in the environments, and depth in the combat, I really couldn't ask for a better conclusion to one of the PlayStation 2's finest series.Rated:9.25 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Review Lover \"ReviewLover\"","summary":"Better than its predecessors","reviewText":"As a sequel, \"Onimusha 3: Demon Siege\" works very, very well, being far more detailed and stroy-driven than either of its two somewhat shallow predecessors. As a standalone game, too, it mops the floor with those two previous games, in terms of playability and graphics.Resuming the lead role of Oni, Samanosuke (from the first game) now finds himself unwillingly hopping across time (from 16th Century Japan to 21st Century Paris) in order to thwart yet another of Nobunaga's genbu-driven attempts to rule the world of Humans. He is aided in his quest by Jacques Blanc (a Special Forces Gendarme-type), Michelle (his fiancee) and a desperately annoying (if crucially necessary) Oni fairy named Ako.The graphics are now all real-time, and camera pans and sweeps are far more dramatic and flexible than before, giving a much-needed sense of the Organic to the already-beautiful characters. For this game, too, the character graphics are now far more detailed and complex than before, and the insanely busy colour palette of previous games is now wisely toned down to allow that detail to show through. Visually it's definitely the best of the series, and \"Onimusha 3\" must be one of the best-looking adventure games on the PS 2 to date. The Paris sections are particularly impressive, blending contemporary cityscapes with Oni mythology with flair and ease.Gameplay-wise not much has changed, the controls are immediately familiar to anyone with even the briefest of playtimes on either of its two predecessors, and the various tightenings and improvements really do come into their own later in the game. The difficulty level is somewhat easier, thanks to the inclusion of far more consumable health items than before, and a more simplified version of the combat system.The real improvements come in the shape of a far more complex storyline. Now cut-scenes and (astounding) CGI movies interrupt the action with a story-driven regularity reminiscent of \"Metal Gear Solid 2\", and \"Onimusha 3\" is much improved because of it. Now there is a compelling and tense plot to forward the hitherto-repetitive action sequences (after all, this is just a side-scrolling beat-'em-up done in 3D realtime) and the player has a far better sense of purpose and affinity for the characters because of this.My only complaint is that, in the wake of two beautiful-to-look-at, repetitive-to-play Prequels, the depth and innovation of \"Onimusha 3\" may go unnoticed. But I promise you, it's there, waiting to be uncovered.All in all, another technically excellent offering from Capcom, and a worthy crown to the \"Onimusha\" series. Bigger, deeper and prettier than before, it will certainly satisfy the adventure cravings amongst us, and will almost definitely win new fans to the genre.Highly recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2004"}

{"product_name":"B000R0URCE","reviewerName":"Michael D. Cooper","summary":"Loads of fun, beautiful graphics, and a paper-thin plot: It's Star Wars!","reviewText":"First of all, you should know that this game is kind of short.  I received it yesterday and it took roughly 10 hours on standard difficulty to complete.Yet the fact that I didn't move the entire 10 hours is testament to this game's ability to be loads of fun to play, regardless of game-length.THE GOOD:The opening level places you in command of Darth Vader, giving you a preview of the absolute power of the force... that you realize you can't match at first with the apprentice.  As the developers have stated, this is to give you a chance to realize what you can become.The absolute awesomeness of this level really sets the tone for the game.  Marching down and eliminating Wookies while ATAT's walk down below from the cliff and Star Destroyers, troop transports, and TIE Fighters fly all around left me feeling like this was really Star Wars.The leveling in the game gives you a chance for character customization once you take control of the apprentice.  Want your force-grip to be able to grab two enemies instead of one?  Spend your force points in upgrading force-grip.  Also - you can wear various costumes, make your lightsaber one of nearly 20 colors with various special effects, and really make your character your own.The gameplay is solid, with a few questionable level designs toward the end of the game.THE BAD:The story is 'good' but as I gave the writer of the novel a hard time for not delving deep enough - I have to say that the cutscenes were chopped down to the point where you really can't grasp the full impact of the story which was more clear in the novel.The Romance:The love dialog/romance is worse than George Lucas if that gives you any indication.  These characters develop feelings for one another despite Juno Eclipse being little more than a 'professional imperial' who forgot to button the top 5 buttons on her uniform and having no dialog really outside of a few sentences in the cut scenes.Then again - if I saw a woman dressing like that I suppose it wouldn't take much romance for me to develop feelings for her either.Multiple Endings?  There is a dark side ending and a light side ending, but this isn't Knights of the Old Republic. 99% of the game is the same regardless of what you choose to be/wear/do.  The final 'choice' is made 30 seconds before the final boss fight.  Regardless of how you play the game - it comes down to what you do 30 seconds before you fight the final boss.  I was hoping for a variety of missions or at least a change in objectives.Frustrating objectives:Sometimes your objective is very vague.  I spent more than one level wandering in circles and jumping off cliffs trying to figure out what to do because the mission objective was something like \"Pick out the hydrospanner from the flexoregulator\" which is probably something you would know if you were an uber-geek who knew what either was.  Guesswork and trial and error.  Also - in the second Raxis Prime level the force controls at the end LIE to make you die quicker.Bugs:Few and far between, but I had some ATST decide to despawn (which was good for me) and a few hiccups.  For the most part the game was solid.OVERALL:Despite the flaws, I sat through the entire 10 hours and couldn't stop because it was extremely addictive.  The game is simple - but it works and is fun.  You can tell a lot of love went into this, but you can also tell that the cutscenes feel disconnected from the rest of the story in terms of dialog because of spotty editing which leaves you wanting more.This is better than anything else LucasArts has had in a while, and you really feel like this is Star Wars.Bottom line: A step in the right direction.  A+ Gameplay, C- Story.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2008"}

The game has top notch art direction and settings and the developers and artists that worked on this game should be commended for the work they did on this game. It is a joy to look at your surroundings as you fly, glide and fight your way through wonderland.Alice controls well and there are not any controller throw inducing problems. Minor camera issues, and targeting issues when she shoots the pepper grinder pop up but nothing game breaking. Her jumping and gliding is very forgiving and if you fall to your death you respawn pretty close to where you fell.The enemy types in the game are challenging and must be taken down methodically in order not to die quickly even on normal difficulty. Combat is fast and strategic and button mashing will get you killed quick.The one issue I have with the game is repetition. The settings of the levels are well varied and interesting but what you do in the levels gets monotonous. You pull a lever jump to a few platforms fight a couple enemies wash rinse and repeat. I have only noticed this problem if you play the game for a long sitting if play for about and hour at a time than this does not become and issue  and it is good not to rush through a beautiful game like this. But I wanted to mention  my small gripe with this good game.In the gaming industry today there are tons of sequels to games in over saturated genres. I feel like games like this are a dying breed with multiplayer always being the focus now. Even though this game is technically a sequel it is still a game that is creative and different.

There is a cool assortment of gadgets like proximity mines a small camera that shocks people, and a flare that distracts heat sensors.  In Splinter Cell you have the ability to do many awesome stealth moves like, split jumping, where you hang in the air by pushing both your feet against adjacent walls, rappelling down walls and pipes, and shimmying across ledges.  Splinter Cell also allows you to complete mission's different ways giving the game some diversity.  In all, Splinter Cell is a good game but after a while it becomes repetitive.

Don't be fooled by cheap imitations and crappy knockoffs: this is the real deal.One note: although wonderful, Sony's Dual Shocks do not take kindly to physical abuse. So if you are of the violent type and frequently get angry at your games, be warned: I spiked on of these and it blew in half. So be nice to them.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2004"}
{"product_name":"B002I0GZ5Y","reviewerName":"AJ","summary":"I am at a loss for words..","reviewText":"Wow.. I don't really know what to say except that this game is amazing. I have put in about 100 hours, and I can tell you that every second of it was pure fun. Except for the second secret boss, which I won't say anything about just in case you don't want me to spoil anything. But that boss is extremely unfair and took me over 60 tries to beat him with just Terra, who by the way is extremely slow and is the hardest to beat this boss with. Well that's the only bad thing about the game, unless you hate board games like me. There are tons of minigames, like the frustrating fruit ball, the rumble racing, the repetitive command board, and the ice cream beat. But if you're like me, you will already have gotten 100% in the mini-games category if you are a 100% completionist. Besides the mini-games, there is the story mode, which although Tetsuya Nomura said would be 15 hours for each character, it is a lot less. Don't let him deceive you. I took my time with each one and managed to beat each one in just under 7 hours (all on standard difficulty). So it's around 20 hours total for just the story mode, plus the final episode which is 10 minutes of cutscenes, 2 boss fights, and then another 10 minutes of cutscenes. But the story mode itself is fun to play through. After the story mode and the mini-games, we have all the command-melding, the ice cream shop, and all of the item collection itself like keyblades and other stuff. And then there's a unique world called the Mirage Arena. This is personally my favorite world because it has 13 arenas you can fight your way through. But yeah the whole game is 95% fun except the minigames like fruitball and command board, and then that second secret boss. But it's worth it to shell out $40 for a game you'll be playing for over 100 hours. If you're going to just play through the story then let the game gather dust, you should probably buy it as well because it's just amazing overall. Yeah I'd order this game right now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2010"}

This awesome fighting game is like Mario and Mortal Kombat together. The great thing is that theres no real violence at all! Mario can perfect his fireball move, Fox McCloud can shoot his laser, Link can throw boomerangs and bombs, while little kirby can suck up players and steal there secret powers. All characters have different special attacks. They can all punch and kick, but they all throw, smash, pound, pummle, blast and burn diffrently. Also, items fall down from the sky that you can use againts your opponents. Pokeballs, (which actually contain several random pokemon that each do different things) swords, hammers, Maximum Tomatoes and fire-flowers all rain down so you can reign over everyone on the field. With an awesome multiplayer option, this is a sure Nintendo Classic. Try this game, you'll fall in love with it fast.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2001"}

It's that \"moment\" I live for in an action movie, where the hero gets their crap together and nothing's going to stand in their way. Max Payne 3 does such a great job replicating the action-movie experience with excellent production value that I could forgive it's simplistic gameplay.'Max Payne 3' take place 12 years after the original Max Payne and eight years after 'Max Payne 2'. Max, the now drunken, pill-popping ex-cop is working security protecting the wealthy Branco family. Eventually Rodrigo Branco's trophy wife Fabiana is kidnapped and Max finds himself mixed up in conspiracies involving human-trafficking, crooked cops, paramilitary forces and being forced to confront things from his own violent past. The story of 'Max Payne 3' is vicious and uncomprimisingly brutal, but much like Rockstar's previous 'Red Dead Redemption' the writing's  very sharp and none of the violence is ever treated like a sick joke. Max's world is a serious and depressing one, and he finds that even trying to do the right thing can get innocent people killed.While the writing goes a long way to selling the feel of 'Max Payne 3', it wouldn't be nearly as impressive without the visuals to back it up. The graphics and atmosphere really bring Brazil and New Jersey to life but it's the character models and technical tweeks that really impress: Max is a grizzled, weighty guy and every movement seems to take effort. The screen fuzzes as he pops painkillers (no regenerating health here!) and the levels load during cutscenes which \"glitch\" to reflect Max's burned-out mindset. The game goes a long way to make you feel as weary and drug-addled as Max himself.The grim atmosphere in 'Max Payne 3' also carries over to it's combat. The usual bullet-time is back, letting you slow down the action but the violence has been cranked up for maximum effect. Bullets tear through flesh, spraying blood and shattering bones. When Max dives he doesn't just slide along the floor, he crashes into walls and boxes and you feel every gravel-chewing impact. The added cover mechanics are a welcome sight in firefights...until you realize everything in the environment is destructable and enemies will rush you from all directions. Just getting through these encounters can be draining, but like Max Payne 3's writing it all adds to the immersion making the experience truly unique.While thematically Max Payne is much more fleshed out than, say Nathan Drake of 'Uncharted' he's also a one-trick pony. In fact it's when 'Max Payne 3' tries to change up the bullet-time running and gunning with levels of forced-sniping and vehicle shooting that things become tedious and uninspired. There's nothing wrong or out of place with these moments (there's maybe three in the whole game) but the lack of mobility became frustrating.'Max Payne 3' may not be a perfect game with it's limited gameplay and some uninspired ideas, but it's also got a lot of substance to it with it's excellent writing, directing and voice acting (regular James McCaffrey turns in a fantastic performance as Max!). If you're an action-film fan like I am and looking for a quality that seem to be lacking in most movie-theaters look no further than 'Max Payne 3'.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2012"}

It was a very difficult boss battle so the game glitching in the middle of it was beyond annoying. Stick with the Rocksteady Batmans. They're apparently a developer that knows what they're doing. This one does not.This game has a confusing sequence in which you wander around in a Mad Hatter fantasy. I had no idea what to do half the time and ran around like an idiot.In another frustrating boss battle, you're supposed to somehow know to use explosive gel or concussion ball to differentiate the boss from tons of duplicates. How in the hell could you possibly know this? (it only gives you this hint after you've failed - which you will). And how do you use these things on the fly as a quick attack (I had to look it up online). Normally you have to switch over to the weapon, then aim, then hold down a button for a little while, then hit another button. You'd be dead if you did this in hand-to-hand combat...The combat is so frenetic it doesn't matter anyway. Crap and people are flying all around (as is the camera) that you can't focus on anyone.Hand-to-hand combat is a staple of the game. Not much has changed here since Arkham Asylum. That's a bad thing. If Asylum had any flaws, this was it. It uses a rock-paper-scissors style of combat where you can bounce from one enemy to the next (similar to Assassin's Creed) but it's very very imperfect. In fact, you have to really work at it (more than I care to) to figure out how to disrupt an attacker mid-way through your whirlwind attacks. You'll be bouncing from dude to dude and the game will give you a CLEAR indicator that a particular dude is going to attack, then it'll say \"HIT Y\". Very often when I hit Y, NOTHING EFFING HAPPENS. Hit it quickly, stop what I'm doing and hit it. Nothing. This needs to change. We're not all savants and we don't all have the time to figure out what you're REALLY supposed to do here....Blade attacks are the same. \"Left thumbstick away and hit Y\" -- yep, I do that and still get hit 3 times in a row (about 95% of the time) with the blade which hurts your health quite a bit. Stupid. The game is punishing in this way. Punishment isn't fun. I don't feel like it explains itself well or plays fair...Boss battles are punitive. One of the very first ones was incredible difficult (on normal difficulty). Half-way through the game, fighting another well-known villain proved exceptionally difficult (had to restart maybe 20 times) again on normal difficulty, for a veteran gamer...There was another subsequent boss battle that wasn't quite as hard, but an extraordinarily poor explanation of what I was supposed to do at a certain point lead me to fail it 3 times...Normal difficulty seems rather hard.Also, there's not much to the \"origins\" of the title. Except in brief moments, we don't see Arkham become Arkham, Batman become Batman or the Joker become the Joker. It's already all in progress...","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

Playing as a young, inexperienced surgeon, you use the stylus to cut, suture, bandage, and more in an effort to save your patients.  You have a certain amount of time to do these tasks, as well as keeping an eye on your patient's vitals while doing such surgeries like removing glass shards and re-starting the heart of a flatliner.  There's a storyline to Trauma Center, but it's only here as a way to make the game move along.  The highlight of the game and what makes it worth picking up is the fact that this is one of the titles that makes the DS the best portable system out there today.  The level of interactivity is inituitive, but the game loses steam because it is ultimately too short.  After completeing each surgery, you'll be able to re-play them to boost your surgeon rating, which is a nice little bonus in itself.

{"product_name":"B000QW9D14","reviewerName":"Timothy Lovett","summary":"Great Mechanics with Horrid Story","reviewText":"One of the first things you'll notice as you begin to play Blue Dragon is that the game's story revolves around a simple good versus evil dichotomy with little variation in character outlook from that. The good characters are sickly good and the evil characters are deviously evil --- there are no characters with real depth. It's for this reason I find it hard to see in any of the characters human characteristics or relate to any of them.The models as well are childish in nature and make the characters (which the manual states are in their late teens) look like they're all under the age of 10.The plot from the very beginning is also easy to read and lacks any sort of depth or any form of twist to keep the player engaged. It's like reading a story after reading a summary of the plot --- you just don't find yourself surprised when something happens because you knew it was going to happen. If an RPG doesn't shake your worldview in the slightest I consider it a complete failure.As for the great mechanics I mentioned in my title --- I found the game design to be wonderful despite it's flaws with an actual story. The usage of the charge bar keeps the user engaged and I found the enemies to level up progressively at a reasonable pace similar to your own growth so it kept things somewhat enjoyable. The idea behind making random encounters random but allowing the user to attack them was also very cool (Secret of Mana style meets Final Fantasy &lt; 12 JRPG battle system sort of thing).The real problem with the mechanics, however wonderful, is that it's very very very easy to get higher levels simply because the enemies tend to be plentiful but easy to kill in one or two rounds from the start on once you've gained any sort of advantage. Your fighters will have mow down techniques which hit the whole first row for nearly the life of the enemy which could easily allow you to rack up experience points if that was your intention.Quickly want to mention the shadow system. It allows users to attach a different class to their shadow to gain skills which can be set to other shadow classes they use. To put it simply I level up my black magic class and get the ability to use black magic level 1 spells on my fighter class by assigning it the skill I learned. The classes all have their own stats so it does have variations in terms of attack power in or out of the class but as others have mentioned can also allow you to create 5 distinct clones of each character with little trouble. I didn't, however, and found the system to be fun so it's really whether or not you take advantage of the system which will affect you in that regards. It could have been made better though, I agree, and more class selections would have given a more unique feel to the process as well.Music was wonderful though and the graphics were pretty despite its cartoon feel. In general it's a good game and had the story been even somewhat decent would have been an unforgettable JRPG.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00004SWL9","description":"Just when it seems 3-D fighting games have permanently made 2-D fighting  games obsolete, something likeMarvel vs. Capcom 2comes along and proves  just how deep and fun 2-D fighters can be. It's better than its predecessor in  every way, and arguably the best 2-D fighting game to grace the Dreamcast.The amount of playable characters is enough to put any fighting fan's salivary  glands in overdrive. Beginning with favorites such as Spider Man, Wolverine,  Ryu, and Chun Li, players can eventually unlock 56 characters. We had our hands  full just mastering a few of these fighters, and getting familiar with all 56  would take months of intense practice. There are almost too many moves, all  depicted with superb animation and augmented by several tag-team combos. When  the match begins, you can pick three characters. Once things heat up, you can  call in your pals to unleash a massive move on your opponent. This adds  immensely to the game's depth, and button mashers will be in for a shock when  they find that their mistimed tag-team moves backfire.Visually, this game is intense. The large characters are slightly jagged around  the edges, but that's more than compensated for by the massive amount of  animation frames, colorful special effects, and stunning 3-D backgrounds that  are loaded with detail.Marvel vs. Capcom 2also delivers a sonic  performance that is nearly arcade-perfect.

From there you're allowed to run around, punch & kick enemies & civilians, hijack or buy and customize cars, spray paint walls, buy clothes and jewlery, purchase guns (and boy is there a wide variety of guns such as RPGs, handguns, shotguns, grenades, etc.) , buy CDs, call up your homies to fight along side you, and MUCH more. In order to do missions you have to earn respect. To gain respect you can do \"activities\" scattered throughout Stilwater such as snatching hookers away from their pimps, protecting drug dealers as they do their things, race, participate in demolition derbies, steal cars for stores, kill rival gang members, and many more. Also, if you wear a lot of purple (the Saints' color of choice) you can gain extra bonus points.The missions themselves are BRUTALLY fun (with the exception of maybe 3). They go from destroying planes, storming mansions, robbing cars, blowing up buildings, rescuing people... its all really fun, and your rewarded with viscerally appealing and cool sounding cutscenes afterwards.To earn money you can rob stores (eitrher by holding them up or by opening the safe yourself), beat up people and take their money, do the activities I mentioned, or beat missions. The more money you have, the more things you can buy.Also, as you take over enemy turfs for your own they will do these things called \"push backs\" on random areas. This is when rival gangs try to take back their lands, and its basically an all out war between the Saints and the enemies until you kill the red highlighted lieutenants scattered throughout the territory. Once thats done, you can resume your game. Also owning more territories gives you more money each day... by the time I beat the game I hasd about $8 grand coming to me each day.Moving on, this game has an EXCELLENT sound track. There is something like 100 songs from different genres such as hip hop, rock, and classical to listen to and many of them are really catchy. They even have some big namers on it like Xzibit, Wu-Tang, Winger, and Fall Out Boy (but I dislike FOB). Ontop of that, if you have a hard drive for your system you can upload your own songs into the game which is great. The sound effects are really top notch - like the guns shooting and things blowing up. Additionally, the voice acting is superb as well. Everyone portrays personality through curses, crude humor, and anger.. not to mention THQ also got some big times to do some acting such as the guy who plays Goliath from the Gargoyles and the girl Jackie from \"That 70's Show\".The graphics are great in Saints Row. Everyone looks lifelike, and the city looks so realistic. The weather changes from sunny to rainy, night to day... its breathtaking. The cars look AMAZING, be it really new and shiny to old and rusty, everything has an authentic feel to it. Easily better looking then Grand Theft Auto.But like always, no game comes without faults. For starters, the weapon selection screen is hard to get down and sometimes when you choose a weapon it wont exactly change to that weapon. Ontop of that, shooting while driving is a nightmare. The ally AI is sometimes incredibly dumb and when you want them to get into a car with you they will just stand there. Finally, the ending was terrible - you kill the last guy and take over Saints Row. Julius, who is the head of the Saints, tells you he still thinks something is amiss and that you're his right hand man now. Then they show you cocking a pistol and overlooking a crew of your boys. Then this mission called the \"3rd Street Saints\" mission opens up where you have to take a bus and destroy it, and when thats complete you, Dex, and Gat have to blow up like 5 police cars... evntually you meet with a guy running for mayor and he says \"thank you but I have to kill you\". He proceeds to surround you with like 50 of his goons, then the ship blows up. Uh huh..To sum it up, Saints Row is a MUST HAVE for X-Box 360 owners or people who enjoy GTA-like games. There so much to do, and its so fun to do it that you just have to own this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2007"}

This new iteration of the series puts you in charge of Chris Redfield, a returning veteran, as well as Sheva Alomar who is new to the series. The game is completely centered around a co-op experience, and if playing alone, commands are used to guide the other character. The most enjoyable thing about the game is that an offline or online player can take control of the other character and complete the full single-player experience along with you. Along the way there are treasures and weapons to be found which are fun to collect and help you earn money to purchase upgrades, new weapons and a plethora of bonus unlockables.The game also has a broad variety of experiences during the campaign as well. There are chapters where only the turret on a Jeep are used, as well as boss fights and interactive video sequences. However, besides the co-op experience, there is very little that hasn't been seen in previous Resident Evil games, and feels like more of a visual upgrade to Resident Evil 4. Another interesting fact is that the majority of the game is within an outdoor environment, which in many cases makes the game more visually appealing but a lot less scary. Actually, the game is only scary on a couple of occasions which really doesn't do the series justice.Controls:For some odd reason Capcom decided to not allow shooting while moving in Resident Evil 5 and for a game coming out in 2009, that is just unacceptable. The majority of the game is spent struggling with the controls, and apparently the sluggish controls were meant to make the game more intense. However, the annoying controls take precedence over any small amount of horror that the game has. To top that off, the inventory can only be accessed in real-time, and the controls for the inventory space are exactly like on the original game.Graphics:Resident Evil 5 is a beautiful looking game and uses a great range of color. The character models rival that of Metal Gear Solid 4, and really help story development. Cutscenes and animations are also top-notch, and the graphics are simply remarkable in every facet of the game. The scale of the game is also very impressive with its highly detailed outdoor environments which are really great to look at. It's also important to note that the game advances through several chapters, most of which are in completely different looking areas which help make the game dynamic to some degree.Sound:Voice acting is one of the game's better qualities, and the voice actors did a great job in their roles. Most of the game is told through cutscenes and the audio really helps illuminate the game's environment. Sound effects are also really crisp and clear and although music is absent from most of the game, the environmental sound effects help make up for it.Replay Value:Resident Evil 5 is anywhere from a 10 - 13 hour game, but the bulk of the content lies in beating the game several times. There are emblems to be found throughout the game, money and bonus material currency as well. There are 3 costumes for both main characters as well as the typical infinite ammo unlocks. There is also a mercenaries mode which is a point based time-trial based around killing zombies as fast as possible. It's fun for a few minutes with a friend, but like the rest of the game can become very repetitive because of the sluggish controls and basic gameplay.Rating:Story: 7.0Gameplay: 8.0Graphics: 9.5Controls: 6.5Sound: 9.0Replay Value: 9.0Overall: 8.3Own, Rent, Avoid:Rent: A great co-op experience but very short-lived. Not very fun past the first run through unless played with a friend. Rent it if you have a free weekend and a friend coming over.Last Thoughts:It is a safe bet that we will see a lot more co-op games in the future, but for now Resident Evil 5 is one of the best. Unfortunately it is plagued with annoying controls and ancient gameplay mechanics which drag down what is otherwise a great experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2009"}

Yes, RE 5 has got that \"next gen\" polish.  But, the game is only cosmetically different from Resident Evil 4.  Outside of the cooperative element, the gameplay in RE 5 is identical to RE 4.  I enjoyed the creepy european countryside, spooky old castle and crazed villagers/cultists in RE 4.  It added the right amount of fantasy elements to the game.  And yes, the night time environments helped set the mood.RE 5 loses all of that.  It is strictly an action game that is set largely in the day time against impoverished zombie villagers.  I found myself wanting to eject the disc and play something else.  I got bored fast, since I had seen most of RE 5 had to offer in RE 4.  It is just to similar too RE 4 for my taste.The antiquated controls are horrible, by today's standards.  They were just serviceable in RE 4 back when that game debuted on the GameCube.  But, they just do not cut it now.And I do not buy that \"it builds tension\" stuff.  I'd like them better if Capcom figured out a way to allow you to move around while aiming.Capcom made RE 5 into an action shooter that is better suited by first person shooter controls.  It should have first person shooter controls.  Period.  The Resident Evil series needed to evolve this time around.  It just didn't.  And that is disappointing.This is a \"love it or hate it\" kind of game.  The game is shorter than RE 4.  Replay value suffers because of it.  But RE 5 is very well made with solid production values.  Long time Resident Evil fans will enjoy playing through RE 5 (at least once).  If you loved RE 4 and do not mind a strangely similar experience, then you can't go wrong with RE 5.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"SirPasta117","summary":"The next generation is finally here.","reviewText":"The next generation of gaming is here! I have been excited to get my hands on this console since the moment it was announced. The console is beautiful, the controller is top notch, and the Kinect seals the deal.Ill start off by saying I got the 'Day One' edition. It includes a black box (part matte and part glossy to mimic the console itself), the included controller is Black with a dark chrome dpad and has 'Day One 2013' etched with matching dark chrome. Finally it also unlocks a 'Day One' achievement. There really wasn't too much included but since it was the same price as a standard edition they were fun inclusions.Some say the console is big, bulky, and looks like a VCR but I couldn't disagree anymore. It is larger than the slim Xbox 360, but not unbearably so. I doubt anyone will have an issue putting the One in their entertain shelf. The two tone glossy/matte finish looks slick and unique along with the chrome touch of the BluRay slot and eject button gives the console an unbeatable design. Vents on the top and rear help eliminate the risk of overheating the early Xbox 360s were famous for. On the front you'll see a chrome Xbox logo for the power button and glows when the console is on. The glowing logo is not distracting in any way and looks great when lit up. As for ports the One has the right amount. On the left side you'll find a USB port for easily charging a controller, on the rear you find a non-standard port for the Kinect, two more USB ports, another non-standard power input port, LAN port, IR blaster (which sadly isn't included), Optical audio out, a HDMI out, and surprisingly an HDMI in (Which I'll talk about more in a little bit). With just the right amount of ports, a great design, and sleek color scheme I couldn't find any issues when the Console itself.Moving onto the Kinect it features the Glossy theme from the Xbox One console. While smaller then the original Kinect its still large enough to take up a noticeable presence. I mounted mine on top of my TV and sometimes its hard not to notice it. Like the console it features a glowing Xbox logo on the right side when on, and a semi-transparent camera lens on the left. There is also a small bar underneath that houses the multiple microphones. The kinect can easily mount on top mounts using a standard tripod screw so unlike the original Kinect you won't have an issue finding a mount to fit with your home theater. My issues with the Kinect are the rather short cable and the IR lights. The cable does have a decent length, but I can see it being an issue for people that keep the console a fair distant from their TV. Finally the IR lights the Kinect uses for depth recording is in the visible range. I had no troubles seeing the three red lights emitting from the center of the Kinect. It both distracting at times and annoying. Really it the red that clashes with the rest of the consoles that bothers me. The black with white/chrome accents don't mesh well with the red IR lights.Next up is the controller. Simply put, its the best controller I have ever used. Refining the Xbox 360 was no easy matter I'm sure, but Microsoft pulled it off. My fingers fit snugly and comfortably around the wider triggers, my thumbs grip onto the thumbstick, the clicky Dpad improves greatly from the mushy Dpad of the 360 design, and the raised Xbox guide button means no more accidental presses. My only complaints are cosmetic. I don't understand why Microsoft moved from the well know 'Start' and 'Back' buttons to the odd 'View' and 'list' buttons. Worse than that these new buttons aren't even labeled with words, just an odd three lines for 'List' and two squares representing 'View'. Finally just like the Kinect the controller features two IR leds near the top that are in the visible range and distracting/annoying. Still that being said the One controller is still the controller to beat.Finally software. Right out of the boxed its needed an update to work, which I expected but I'm sure there will be a handful of people that will not. After about 45 minutes to an hour I was finally booted in the new home screen. Clearly inspired from Microsoft's new universal software design its both visually minimalistic and modern but can still be deep and complex at times.  Visually is you see lots of solid colors with white logos and text, but through this simplicity I found myself quickly jumping in and out of settings, apps, and games with ease. It was both easy to spot the next app or game you wanted to get to and easy to go from one home screen to another. With the ability to pin my most used apps and games to the home screen and keep the apps I was never going to use out of sight helped make the home screen a personal place, and at the same time stick with a general design language that I appreciate. But the real star of the show is the Kinect. What once took several button presses and lists now takes a single sentence. The ability to quickly snap Netflix alongside he game I was playing was amazing. Every time I said Xbox On and watch the logo on the console light up made me smile even after the 50th time. There are a few annoyances though. Not every app and menu is Kinect compatible. For example when searching for a tv or movie title in Netflix the kinect offer no help in the search screen. It also requires exact phrases and words. It really needs a natural language filter that you can find from Google Now or Apples Siri. Learning the phrases Kinect seem outdated and confusing these days.All in all the One is the definition of Next gen for me. Its no longer just about gaming, but about entertainment and new ways the interact with whats happening on screen, I'm excited about the potential the One has and very happy with its current capabilities.Good-Excellent hardware design-Best controller ever-Software design and voice controlBad-Annoying IR lights-Voice control phrases and limitations","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2013"}

Rose \"Blu Aficionado\"","summary":"Hands Free Sports Fun!!!!!!","reviewText":"I gotta say I was never a huge fan of motion games, they seemed gimmicky, motion while still using a controller?  Wii and PS3 Move, proved not to be for me.  I picked up Kinect last weekend along with a copy of Kinect Sports and wasn't sure I'd made the right choice.I mounted my Kinect (see my Kinect review) and dropped Kinect Sports into the disc tray.  You're immediately brought into the stadium with your Avatar character, the crowd goes wild as you decide what to play.  I started off like this:Bowling- I couldn't believe how cool it was to be standing in front of my virtual bowling alley, no controllers, just me.  I reached my right hand out to \"grab\" a ball, and and raised my hand up in front of me.  The tracking is just mind bending the transparent bowling ball floated on screen waiting to be fired down the lanes.  I pulled my arm back and tossed my first ball...ouch only hit 3 pins.  Apparently Kinect is pretty accurate, because I'm a bad bowler on the real lanes too.  So far so good, I finished up my remaining frames and headed to my next game.Table Tennis-  This one is pretty straight forward, but nothing short of a blast, the thing that really shines in this game is the ability for Kinect to judge \"power\".  You tap the ball and it barely makes it over the net, wind up and crush it and it tears across the table, even sporting a flaming trail! I figured it would be really easy to beat the AI, but wound up losing by one point in the end.  Very fun and I actually found myself telling the computer Ill be back for a rematch.Boxing-  This one is pretty great too, I noticed a few times my arms were displayed as crossed on screen, but that could have just been me holding my fists to close together while defending my face from the barrage of computer controlled punches.  This one I actually played 4 matches right in a row, the thrill of bobbing and ducking, throwing a jab or two after a long day at work is so therapeutic ha ha.Track & Field- Surprisingly my favorite game so far.  The physical work out from the above games is adequate, getting the heart pumping a bit, but this one takes the cake!  You start off with a brisk sprint, and trust me running in place somehow provides a darn good burn.  Followed by discus, javelin throwing, long jumping, and of course some hurdles.  I literally played through the track and field 4 times in a row it was just so much fun!After throwing my hands up in celebration, hearing the crowd go wild (and looking out my window to make sure nobody saw me doing so) I decided I was 100% impressed with my Kinect and Kinect Sports purchase.  Wii and Move just couldn't hold my attention long enough, and fumbling a controller in each hand just seemed counter productive.If your looking for something new, and a way to get off the couch be sure to add Kinect Sports to your library of games!  The ability to compete with friends and family anywhere over Xbox Live takes gaming to a whole new level.  Challenge a friend to a game of bowling while your thousands of miles away and you'll know exactly what I mean!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000HCQK0A","reviewerName":"Amozarte","summary":"Fun with firearms","reviewText":"Crackdown is a delightful diversion. While it doesn't take more than a few hours to complete, those few hours are packed with plenty of fun and firepower.Using sandbox gameplay as a base, Crackdown's recipe pits you as an \"Agent\" fighting crime in the gang-overrun Pacific City. Your superhero-esque powers allow you to run and jump through town, climbing buildings and pounding bad guys. The weapons you acquire range from puny pistols to rockin' rocket launchers. My personal favourite was the Firefly, whose five-round \"clip\" of seeking missiles allows you to make quick work of massive quantities of gang members.We're all familiar with open-world design by now, but Crackdown puts a few spins on the concept to keep it fresh. First, cell-shading makes the characters and objects look like comic books come to life. Second, your character's skills advance through use. For example, when you defeat gang members by brute force your strength improves while shooting them augments your skills with a firearm. Even your driving skills are enhanced, resulting in better handling and performance. You can also gain skill points through activities like road & rooftop foot races and collecting orbs hidden throughout the city. One other nice touch is that as you take out gang leaders, there will be a noticeable decline in their strength and presence. Even the achievements are amusing- my personal favs were Body & Car Juggler (keep a body/car suspended in the air using explosives) as well as Body Armour (attach 5 gang members to a car using the harpoon gun), which is available via downloadable content.While the innovations used in the game give it a little bit of spice, they certainly aren't mind-blowing. The game also has a few minor flaws, but nothing that seriously impedes your gang busting rampages. The only major drawback I noticed was that the game felt a little short. Overall I would definitely recommend PLAYING the game, although renting may be better than buying.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2008"}

This game would likely be the progeny. To me, this game is extremely underrated. It makes me sick when I buy a game for $60, and it's either just alright or it plain sucks. For the money, this is the best around, maybe even better than a typical $60 game. I actually enjoyed it more than Skyrim (awaiting flame war.) The combat is full real time action, eg. the game does not pause when you enter battle, there seems to be an aggro range. The leveling up, and the way quests are displayed looks strikingly similar to WoW. You can also choose to be either a mage, warrior or archer, but only one at a time. I chose warrior, but it's nice to have the option. I'm somewhat of an old-school RPG fan, to me the combat has to be either full turn based or full action. I hate the new \"enhanced battle systems\" the companies churn out these days which are too complex. I really don't get the whole \"OMGZorZ, the graphics SUX, 1 star!\" To me, the gamneplay and the story are the most important, I really don't care if a game doesn't have the best graphics. The graphics are like a crutch these days; an excuse for a company to put out a subpar game that looks amazing, but plays like garbage.

Online as of May 32st 2005, I have about 6100 Kills and 3500 Deaths. I am not just a hardcore fan, I am also pretty good. Now, there are many many things in this game to go over, and I couldn't possibly do it all. First off, do not bother getting this game to try the offline expierience.. it's well not worth it. With that out of the way, let me get down with the online play. Here are the POPULAR levels, my ratings, and how they stack up to me.( I most likely will not remember them all.. sorry. :( )OLD LEVELS:Frostfire: 10/10 : This level takes place on a very large ship, and it's at night time, but it is not that dark. The main thing I love about this map is how it is all flat, allowing for quick kills, and a lot of fun. A main feature about this level though is probably the tunnels, in where the Terrorists normally ' Camp ' from the SEALs with a shotgun and wait for them to come down. This level is different from the old version simply because the tunnels are connected. This is BYFAR my favorite map of SOCOM and SOCOM II. It is also one of the most popular SOCOM II maps. ( Most likely #3 ) Advantage: Most Likely TerroristsDESERT GLORY: 9/10: In this level, the SEALs must extract the hostages from their cells while the terrorists try and protect them. The title of the level is basically what the level is like. A very desolent level with a lot of sand and run down buildings. There are buildings to camp out in, stuff to hide behind, and it's just a great. This is also a very popular online map. ( Most likely #2 )Advantage: Probably TerroristsNIGHT STAKLER: 6/10: To many people, this reminds them of DESERT GLORY at night. But to me, I see it as a much different level. Though similar in design, this one is in mid-night ( so its not too dark ) and instead of extracting hostages, you have to plant a bomb. This level is similar to DESERT GLORY in some ways, but this level is bigger ( i think ) and not as fun. ( there are too many sniper positions.. it's almsost impossible to hide from them! ) This map, AS WELL is also a rather popular online map. ( Probably about #6 ) Advantage: Possibly the SEALsNEW LEVELS:CROSS ROADS: 8/10: This is the first level I played for SOCOM II online. This is litterally ALWAYS full of people in the public rooms, and is very, very popular. This level has the SEALs starting at one corner and the Terrorists starting at the other. You have to find the bomb and plant it at the opposing base. This level reminds me of a fancy middle-east market place for some reason. This level is pretty average to me, thogh. This one like i said is EXTREMELY popular. ( Definitely #1 ) Advantage: None, in ' Clan Wars ' this is normally the tie-breaker.There is many more maps, but those are just a few. I will now goto the guns ( I will try to list them all )SEALS:M4A1: 10/10: Great gun. Shoots fast, accurateM4A1SD: 10/10: Great gun.

You've to start on the feudal Japan, then on the Underworld, then on the Over world in order to finally finish the game.There are a lot of bosses to defeat like a giant type of cat, a crab, a beautiful big monster who tries to enter the over world.You have different enemies trough the game as you continue, like bigger soldiers, different weapons, giant spider, creatures, etc.You have pleasant surprises like a scene on the underworld where many leaves are falling down and you actually move them as you go through.As you can see, you have a lot of things to do. But, to be honest, the game is too difficult. Many stages are too extensive. In many things, the map could help you with the camera angle trouble. What is too difficult with the camera is when you have to jump on the ship stage. An improvement to the story could be congratulate the user eventually for accomplish goals because the story just continues and it seems that you are not advancing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2009"}

You play John Mullins, a black-ops soldier taking on an evil organisation which tries to spread a deadly virus. The game takes place in different parts of the world from dense colombian forest, snowlands, a ship, an aeroplane ect. The multiplayer gameplay is great and fun online but the single player gameplay is dull with poor level design and dumb enemy ai. The game is very hard because the enemies are very strong and the hero takes a lot of damage in a single shot. The game seem to cheat a bit, i dont know how the alarm goes on in the stealth missions and some enemies seems to be in god mode like the snippers in the first mansion level. The hero also keep of playing with his weapon, like he throws his shotgun in the air and catches it which makes me very angry. The random mission generator is boring and unplayable because it does allow save games. Sof2 is built on the quake3 engine, i played it on the OpenGL video mode and it runs great. The graphics and sound are great, the swimming pool in the mansion level is very beautifull, but most of the game is brown in color. The load times are very long and unlike other q3a games like rtcw and mohaa the quick loading is not instant. Sof1 was a great game and i have even played the game till late night, this one does not even come close, It is very boring and dull. Soldier of Fortune II's single player is disappointing but the multiplayer is good.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2002"}

{"product_name":"B0047TG2R0","description":"","reviewerName":"DM","summary":"A decent expansion pack","reviewText":"- Story 3/5: Step back compared to the original Dragon Age, but about same quality as the Awakening expansion. The game feels very much like an expansion pack, rather than a true or full sequel (it is called Dragon Age 2, after all...). If the first game was as epic as the Lord of the Rings story, this would be as epic as watching Frodo tap dance. Too much time is spent on mundane tasks or fetch quests. Some of these quests reminded me of Assassin's Creed games, because of their simplicity and execution. The game polish is also missing. In many places, DA2 feels like Risen: lots of potential, but too many opportunities missed.- Graphics 5/5: Great improvement over the original.- Characters 2/5: None of the new characters is as developed as Leliana, Morrigan or even Alistair. You also don't get to interact with them enough. Most of the time, in order to talk to them, you have to visit them all over the city. Sometimes they have something to say and most of the time they don't. Spreading them and the merchants all over the city is just another poor idea. It works in terms of how the story is set up, but it's another chore.- Maps and inventory 2/5: If you liked the Mass Effect 2 system, this is very similar. The maps have become big mazes that are difficult to follow. Loot is useless and most of it goes straight to junk (but fills your inventory). Most of the items can only be used by you. Again, don't understand what the developer's logic was.- Fighting 2/5: Gone are all the strategic fights that made DA1 so much fun.In DA2, most of the time the enemies spawn from thin air, so it's impossible to plan a fight (except in dungeons - see below). Even when you do, more enemies keep showing up. You can still issue commands to your team, but playing on highest difficulty is impossible.- Level Design 1/5: This is the biggest problem of this game. The levels are not only similar, in the case of most dungeons they are identical to the last stone! You may have a 5-10 room dungeon that  - regardless how it's called or where it is - it looks identical to others you have visited many times. You already know where the enemies will respawn - it's just different enemies. Now - I can understand reusing some textures - everybody does it - but this is a level of laziness that I've never seen in any other game.This doesn't stop here though. Because the story takes place over 10 years in the same city, you'll keep replaying this over and over. You can now understand better the spin EA's marketing team put on how the story is 'organized'. I can't imagine replaying this game again.I have to give credit to EA and Bioware for knowing how to play their cards. A special edition has been provided to the gamers that preordered before end of December. This pretty much meant most of the DA1 fans. The reason - the gamers that didn't play the first game, will buy this and enjoy it as is. The people that preordered, will get the free characters, maybe bicker a bit and get over it. Professional Reviewers will give this a high rating regardless, since that's the tradition in the industry. Smart play that saved them a ton of development money, for a great profit.One other thing to be aware of: if you received your preordering codes, you probably noticed you have to create a Bioware account to get access to you items. Make sure this matches the same EA account you have on XBox, because no codes will be provided. I made the mistake of creating a new account (not realizing I had one on the 360), so I ended up not getting any of these items.In the end  -this is subjective - some of you will like the game, others will hate it. One thing is sure - this is not a true sequel and it's nowhere as good as the original. EA went for a quick buck, same way they do every year with all their sport games. It's disappointing, but a lesson learned. EA will no longer see me buy their games on first day.That being said - this is not a one star game. As long as you know what you buy, it's up to you to decide when or if to buy it and how much is this worth to you.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00012BSJ4","description":"When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better. Buy it immediately.Rated:9.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"jdealy999","summary":"How can you NOT love this game?!","reviewText":"Being in the Nintendo age, Metroid and Zelda were the series that I fell in love with when they first came out.  Almost 20 years later, the original Metroid gets a COMPLETE facelift/overhaul for the GBA.  The graphics, locales, soundtrack, and play control have all been updated.You will recognize certain weapons from the Super Metroid days -- Super Missile, Super Bomb, Space Jump and Gravity Suit.  But the most delicious part is when you actually start PLAYING the game.  My favorite soundtrack is from the get-go -- when you begin in Brinstar.  And once you get to Norfair and eventually Kraid, the music gets even better.  But for ALL the Metroid fanatics out there, the greatest part is when you finally reach Tourian and have to defeat those pesky Metroids!!Surprisingly, both Kraid and Ridley are very easy to defeat.  I'm a bit disappointed though -- they were much harder (and more satisfying to beat) in the Super NES prequel Super Metroid.Mother Brain is a bit more difficult this time around because you can't hit her unless her eye is open.  And watch out -- it's a doozy.  After you defeat her, it's time to vacate Zebes before it blows up!  But wait, just when you thought the game was over -- the storyline expands!  A horde of Space Pirates finds Samus and forces her ship to crash-land!  Stripped of her entire weaponry, she now has to infiltrate the Space Pirate Mother Ship with only a blue-colored Skinsuit and a stun pistol.  Watch out for the Space Pirates themselves, they are INVINCIBLE -- that is, until Samus gets her credentials back.There is much to explore in Metroid:  Zero Mission.  Once you reach the end of the game, it's time to take on another version of Ridley -- the robotic kind!  If you thought the original Ridley was too easy, THIS version won't hold back!!I guarantee that you won't be disappointed in this game.  You will eventually unlock an alternative power suit for Samus in Metroid Prime for Gamecube and the original 1987 NES Metroid.

{"product_name":"B0044S8DA8","description":"","reviewerName":"Darth Borg","summary":"Money well-spent and full-marks from me.","reviewText":"After spending a few weeks with the game I must say that this the best RPG that I have played for some time now. This game is essentially a offline fantasy mmo where you are self-sufficient, the central star of the story, your actions really matter and don't have to pay any monthly fees either. Just like an mmo you have a open-world to explore, towns to visit, quests to do, craft, engage in commerce and complete quests. The game world is not realistic looking rather by design a colorful fantasy world which makes you feel like you have been transported into a fantasy story book. The graphics, dialogue animations and combat special effects are fairly nice looking (at the highest settings) and do a good job of transporting you into the world of Amalur.I have played upwards of 50 hours or so and I am frankly not even done with 50% of the main quest-line. There is a absolute sheer amount of content in the game for you to do in terms of side-quests, faction quests etc. and they are not your standard go there kill x, get y or deliver z; rather they have a story behind them. If you are not into rushing through the game than these side-quests will keep you occupied for a long-time while you character gets richer, stronger, amass wealth and real estate too hehe. So far unlike some others I have not gotten bored of these side-quests etc atall maybe because I am not playing the game religiously every day or rushing through the game to finish it. My suggestion is to mix the main quests and side quests, trying to get into the rpg aspects/story-line and the game will keep you entertained without boredom setting in.This game excellent combat system needs a special mention too. The combat is fluid, flashy, mix of hack'n'slash/rpg and ultimately very satisfying. Open-world rpg's are notorious for slow/lack-lustered combat (ahem Skyrim) and this is where Amalur really shines. The combat is a perfect blend of a action rpg with a dash of strategy thrown in without bordering on overtly complex and mundane tactics of some other rpg's like Witcher 2 etc. I feel like I am playing Diablo in a fully 3-D world where the central story of the game doesn't take a back-seat either.Last but not least I must mention the freedom of being pretty much any class you want to be rather be forced to go into a rigid warrior or rogue or mage class system that is the forte of many rpg's out there. You have the freedom to mix all the classes together and be a true hybrid or go be a plain warrior or rogue etc if you really want. I really appreciate that the game developers have let me be a true hybrid that I have never really been before. I am a finesse/might/magic hybrid  which lets me start with a deadly stealth/backstab, whip out my two-hander to mow through the mobs and finish them off with strong magic attacks while wearing a mix of heavy and light armor. Trust me its loads of fun...In all I highly recommend the game for anyone looking for a quality RPG which represents a perfect blend of action and a well-developed story-line. This game doesn't short you on content and will keep you occupied for a long time. I hope Kingdom of Amalur succeeds so we can have DLC's, expansion and sequels.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2012"}

Whether it was Super Mario World, or Super Mario All-stars or even Super Mario RPG (I am an RPG fanatic), Super Mario was and still is the SNES for me.But I must confess, I never grew up with the N64 or the GameCube so perhaps my credendtials aren't as good as anyone who has played the Mario games I haven't on the GBA or the GameCube. I only ever got to play Super Mario 64 with my reletives. I downloaded Super Mario 64 on Virtual Console and, while it's still fun, it just doesn't hold my attention for long. I doubt I'll ever beat it.All that aside, I hope you would still trust my judgement when I say this is the funnest and greatest 3D platformer I've ever played and it held my attention until I got all 120 stars, unlocked Luigi, and got 100 more as him.This game is beautiful and plays like a dream. I honestly couldn't have imagined having so much fun shaking and pointing the Wii Remote but this game incorperates it in such a way that pointing and shaking go beyond mere novelty and actually make the game even stronger. Collecting star bits with the star cursor and then aiming at enemies while controlling Mario with the Nunchuck is a minor task in multi-tasking that is rewarding and stimulating. Mario himself plays spectacularly with all his classic Super Mario 64 acrobatic moves intact. His punch-punch-kick combo has been replaced with a simple spin-punch attack that feels less redundant and far more suited to attacking in multiple directions. Occasionally, Mario will have to pull off some tricky wall-jumping moves that feel reminiscent of wall-jumping in Mega Man X. The camra always situates itself just right for these segments and never hinders you once. The camra moves itself almost always to just where you need it when you need it. Only a few times are you not able to move it manually the way you want and that, quite frankly, is the only complaint I could come up with.Now let's talk about level design. My goodness is it gorgeous and mind-bending! Mario will constantly defy gravity and he is able to run right side up and upside down depending on which side of a heveanly body you are on. You'll find yourself moving your head from side to side trying to reorient yourself on instinct. This game takes lots of hand-eye coordination to play and will force you to hone your skills and senses. This ulimately makes conquering a level and getting that last star-piece all the more fulfilling. Levels can vary from lush, green worlds alive with life to arrid deserts to all your classic platforming cliches, including lava levels and ice levels; even the Super Mario World ghost houses make a return. Some worlds might be made entirely out of food or toys. Some worlds are made of geometric patterns that bend the mind and test your vertigo further. My favorite levels are the ones that look like tropical paradises. If heaven exists, that's what I imagine it looks like.Everything from gameplay to music to graphics and level design only further cement Mario's place in the video gaming world as the definitive platforming character who will never fade away and continue to attract fans young and old, or in my case, estranged. The good folks at Nintendo should be proud of themselves. This is the kind of game you saw in your dreams when you tried imagine how much better gaming could get when you were younger. If you get any game for the Wii, let it be this.Let it be this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000QY9C90","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"The game that started it all","reviewText":"The Good: Gorgeous sound and visuals, great characters, realistic looking zombies, powerful weapons, addictive online multiplayer, a true zombie simulatorThe Bad: Lacks content, very short, not so fun offline, not much story except the intro movieOnce again Valve brings us another great game using their Source engine that brings all the elements of Left 4 Dead to life (or death???) The first thing you'll notice (mainly Valve fans) is that the Source engine has had a next-gen upgrade (even more so than Portal) and everything looks amazing. While HL2 fans will notice some sounds and elements of the engine from those games it doesn't really bother you. The game looks stunning with excellent lighting effects, awesome AI (enemy and friendly), great character models, hi-res textures, and just everything you'd expect out of the Source engine. L4D, however, isn't really a single player only experience; in fact you won't even see the full potential of this four player game unless you play online.The game is comprised of four campaigns and each campaign has five levels. Each level gets longer and more and more difficult with a final level where you have to face off hundreds of zombies until your rescue transport arrives. At the start of each campaign you get to choose of the four characters (each character just starts out with a different weapon). Speaking of weapons I was disappointed in the small selection that there was (just pistols, shotguns, machine guns, and a sniper rifle along with bombs and molotovs). The basic idea is these four characters have to cover each others' butts through these levels while you face off massive hordes of zombies. The whole idea is a bit more in depth with some gameplay elements thrown in there. For example zombies are attracted to noise and light, so if you keep your flashlight on near zombies they'll charge after you. Shoot a car that has it's headlights on and you'll have to face off dozens of zombies charging at you because you set off the car alarm. Killing these zombies is fairly easy since a few shots will bring them down, but its sheer numbers that makes up for this.There are over 150 different zombie types, but there are a few \"special\" zombies that are harder to take down. These are the Tanks (massive zombies that will take all four people to bring down), Smokers (these guys have super long tongues that snatch you up), Boomers (no not like in Gears of War if these guys vomit on you they attract more zombies and same if you blow them up if they're too close to you), Witches (you hear them cry through levels and if you disturb them they'll take you down and you are down until someone revives you), Hunters (which are super fast moving zombies that pounce on you and eat you until someone saves you). This changes gameplay up along with certain sections require you to do something such as hit this switch to move this and while this is happening you have to fend off hordes of zombies. The game is probably the only \"zombie simulator\" out there because they just act and look so real and you really do feel helpless in the middle of nowhere with hundreds of zombies around you.Of course you'll blow through the four campaigns in about 3-4 hours, but it's the great online play that extends the replay value. The way levels are played out are very original as well since you have to get everyone into a \"safe room\" at the end of the level (look for the red door) and close it thus the next level loads and you get to restock on health and ammo. Throughout levels you may find rare ammo stocks, pipe bombs etc. It's the final levels that really are hard since you have to fend off so many zombies and this can be hard in single player since the AI won't go anywhere unless you do. When your transport arrive you MUST start heading towards it before it gets to you because if you're surrounded by dozens of zombies you're dead. If your team mates die they tend to respawn in closets or behind closed doors. Once you run out of health you can be healed by other team mates or take pills to temporarily fill your health. L4D is a wonderful game, but it's tight on content and lacks more maps that we need (Valve sucks when it comes to DLC). I highly recommend this game for a great online multiplayer game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

I don't recall these elements in a game before...- I enjoyed the epic &#34;Saving Private Ryan&#34; moments (the one they showed at E3). marching ahead with your army, blocking a hail of arrows and then returning fire was quite fantastic.- some good boss battles- good non-intrusive way to use quick time events by highlighting the enemy in a specific color rather than an obnoxious gigantic A or B or X or Y on the screen...Neutral:- the non-myth part of the story and reality is that Rome was a rather brutal imperialist (obviously) force. thus you're kind of playing the bad guy here. asking an audience to sympathize with the Roman Empire is a little weird. but hey, I haven't seen the Romans in a game or entertainment product in awhile, so why not.Cons:- button mashing. you can get through the game hitting little more than X or Y. shoulder buttons, triggers, others largely unused, indicating a rather simple game. in fact, if you removed the blood/gore, it could possibly be a child's game. it reminded me more of a fighter than a 3rd-person action title. you can miss half the quick-time events without any consequences. you will hit the same damn buttons over and over and over and over again. you will quickly tire of this...- repetitive looking enemies- I can't remember any game that mapped shield to the A button. most games use a trigger for this (e.g. left trigger block, right trigger attack - that's fairly intuitive). it was difficult to get my brain to unlearn that A generally means Action/Advance/Activate, etc.- The game needed more epic army moments and strategy. Instead, thousands of enemies to button mash...not enough variety- not much to upgrade...one weapon, one armor, one etc....More/better RPG elements could have helped kill the monotony and kept the player invested, but it's largely not there...just health, some executions, etc. i barely noticed or appreciated the effects of whatever I upgraded...- Once you advance over an obstacle or through a door, you can't go back, so your missed collectible is gone. Restart the game I guess...I hate that.Overall, it was well worth the price I paid, $39.99 new. It's possible for Crytek to improve upon what they've done here. Obviously they have a premier gaming engine that fuels Crysis and others...I wouldn't give up. Less button-mashing, more variety, more character investment, more RPG elements and they might have something here...They could keep the Roman Empire theme and try to build a new franchise. There simply has to be more for the player to do though...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2014"}

I had about 7 to 8 hours of gameplay with this game. That does not include the Challenges.Star Wars The Force Unleashed II is an action hack-n-slash game and not an RPG. It is definitely not Knights of the Old Republic. The action is fast and furious, sometimes even frantic, but always fun. Starkiller, the player character, has several Force powers at his command, and using the right powers against the various opponents is the key to victory. These force powers are really fun to use.There are boss and mini-boss fights that are really cool and fun. At first different types of enemies will be encountered separately, but by the end of the game the player will have large contigents of many different types of enemies at the same time. Fighting these larger battles is really challenging and fun!The player will earn experience points used to increase Starkiller's powers. Very cool. Also, different types of light saber crystals are found throughout the game. These force crystals have different affects and colors, allowing customization of Starkiller's dual light sabers.The game has some simple platforming areas. These involve jump, double jump, and double jump plus dash (X + X + L1). Platforming while under fire adds to the excitement.The graphics are terrific. The cut scenes are wonderful. The story is engaging enough to keep things going. The sound is classic Star Wars. It has trophies. What's not to like? This is a good game.

I remember playing almost all of these games in my local video arcade for 25 cents a pop. They were addicting, they were challenging, but most of all, they were FUN.Special moves in fighting games weren't very common back then, and the internet wasn't going to arrive for about a decade. Anyone who figured out the \"SHORYU-KEN!\" move in Street Fighter II and could perform it repeatedly was held in the highest regard.Whenever I need to take a break from 7th generation 1080p console gaming and regress back to the age of using my lawn-mowing allowance money to play video games, this is a great collection to do it with.Here's a complete games list and the playing options available:1942 - option for 2 players (alternating)1943 -option for 2 players (cooperative)**1943 KAI - option for 2 players (cooperative)Bionic Commando - option for 2 players (alternating)Commando - option for 2 players (alternating)Exed Exes - option for 2 players (cooperative)Final Fight - option for 2 players (cooperative)Forgotten Worlds - option for 2 players (cooperative)Ghosts & Goblins - option for 2 players (alternating)Ghouls & Ghosts - option for 2 players (alternating)Gun.smoke - option for 2 players (alternating)Legendary Wings - option for 2 players (cooperative)Mercs - option for 3 players (cooperative)**Pirate Ship Higemaru - option for 2 players (alternating)Section Z - option for 2 players (alternating)Son Son - option for 2 players (cooperative)Street Fighter II - option for 2 players (VS)Street Fighter II Champion Edition - option for 2 players (VS)Street Fighter II Hyper Fighting - option for 2 players (VS)Super Ghouls & Ghosts - 1 playerTrojan - option for 2 players (alternating)Vulgus - option for 2 players (alternating)** The first time these games have been released in North America.As you can see, there are 8 games on this disc that allow cooperative play, and the one that steals the limelight is MERCS - it allows three players at once using a multi-tap for the Playstation 2, or three standard controllers on a Playstation 3.GRAPHICS: Okay, like most games of this era, the graphics are not top of the line. Keep in mind, these games were made between 1984 and 1992 so if you're expecting to see detailing likeHeavenly Sword, this isn't your collection. The gameplay is centered in the middle of the screen and there is an option to increase the height and width of the screen - no widescreen option, though. I'd suggest turning off  the PS2 graphic upscaler - the games look better without it.OPTIONS: There are a lot of options here. Most of the selections include:Difficulty (easy, normal, hard)Extra Lives (how many to start)Controller Setup (choosing buttons for shooting, jumping, etc)Rapid Fire (on/off)Sound Remix (original game music or an alternative track)There is also a Bonus section for each game with its history, trivia, artwork, tips, and music tracks.GAMEPLAY: A wide variety of game genres can be found here: vertical shooters, platformers, side scrollers, hack & slash and fighting. The main selling point of this compilation is the Street Fighter collection, which offers a unique gameplay option - Street Fighter Deluxe.Street Fighter Deluxe is a VS only option that allows players to pick a fighter from any of the Street Fighter II games (World, Champion, Hyper) and pit them against each other with the following selectable options:Handicap (1-10)Game Speed  (1-10)Time Limit (on/off)Rounds (1,3,5)Stage SelectCONCLUSION:I won't lie to you, some of these games are controller-throwing-ly, tooth-grinding-ly, fist-pounding-ly, lip-biting-ly hard (I'm looking at you, Ghouls & Ghosts...) There is no in-game save option and some of the games have no continues - so if you want to see the endings you'll have to either increase your gaming skills, or take the easy way out and look them up on YouTube.If you're the type of gamer who doesn't like 2-D shooters or 2-D fighting games, this is probably not the collection you're looking for.But if you're a student of video game history, or an old schooler like me who stacked quarters on the arcade cabinet glass waiting for your turn to play...then look no further.Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2010"}

I didn't expect this game to make it stateside, but after many, many years, Venetica has been released in the North American market. It surely won't change any minds of the people who dislike this game genre, but for those that do like RPG titles and are in for something a little different than the norm, Venetica just might be the ticket!Positives:- A Colorful, Vibrant World - The environments in Venetica are beautiful. Pedestrians roam the streets, street merchants sell their goods, gondola's ride the waters, etc. There is a real nice variety to the locales you'll visit on your journey.- A Good Cast of Characters - Venetica has a certain charm to its character design, animations of said characters, voice acting, and more.- A Nice Storyline with a Female Protagonist - Venetica is the tale of Scarlett, and a rather sad one at that; however it's a tale that ultimately allows her to get the revenge she seeks.- Some Pretty Solid Gameplay - The combat is pretty standard stuff, like attack and dodge, etc., but it works well and is fluid.- Budget Price - Venetica released not too long ago at $40, but now it's only $20!Negatives:- Not a Technical Marvel - Venetica certainly isn't pushing graphics, however it's not a big negative since it makes up for it with visual charm.- Lacks Polish - This is a budget game and it shows. Venetica doesn't have AAA polish. However, it works and does most things rather well.In the end, I really, really enjoyed Venetica. It has the same charm as the Fable games. It's not the deepest RPG, but it still offers some very deep customization in terms of upgrades and such. It's just a game that wins you over with its colorful and quirky world.

{"product_name":"B002I094AC","description":"","reviewerName":"Arch Stanton","summary":"Can Be Completed in Two Hours","reviewText":"This game is fun. I remember playing it at a friend's house when I was a kid. We didn't have an N64 so brief moments like that were all we had to play it in. I remember full well how fun it was and how exciting. Naturally when I saw it was out for the 3DS I had to buy it. Which is why I was unprepared for the giant flaw of this game: it's only two hours long! How can they have a game this short? The N64 wasn't that limited a console.Rogue Squadronhad basically the same mechanics and the gameplay on that lasted for hours. It isn't a grand climax either: I was expecting a midgame boss. He didn't seem big enough to be the final guy. Not that he wasn't hard, but the climax came very prematurely.The levels themselves are pretty brief as well, which is fine when there are a lot of them but less so when there's only seven. Okay, there's double that if you play the game on all the difficulty modes. But that's a pretty stupid way of adding more time. Especially since you can't choose which mode to do, you have to get certain achievements that you don't know about unless you look them up on a wiki. And how many wikis were there in 1997? Combat is based around a rails system that's rather outdated now but still fun. There aren't enough air combat games with lasers for me to be picky about them. Some levels have free roaming as well, though fewer than I'd like. The levels themselves are a mixed bag. Some of them (like the opening level or the one on a rotating space station) are a lot of fun. Others (like the battle on the surface of a star) are not.The port to the 3DS was very well done. Starfox looks amazing in 3D. It's been a while since I played the original but I remember the graphics being a LOT clunkier. Here everything is smooth and slick and the characters look like the cartoons they were meant to and not boxy monstrosities. 3D mode does make it impossible to control the game using their new motion controls. You just can't keep the 3DS a constant distance from your face while jerking it around suddenly. That's a problem they had withOcarina of Timeas well, but I think newer games just avoid using it. You can always turn the 3D off and do this of course. The use of the touchscreen is very well done as well. Instead of your wingmen showing up on a corner of your screen they show up here which works quite well.Anyway, I don't hate the game. I enjoyed playing it immensely for the brief time I was able to do so. But having a game that is this short is just unforgivable. Maybe you could get away with it fifteen years ago, but not now. I see other people praising the game's \"brevity\" and talking about how this means it never has time to get stale, but unless you're the kind who replays the same game repeatedly there isn't enough here to keep you entertained for more than a few hours. So unless you get yourself a really good deal I'd avoid this one. It's fun, but not worth the price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001CWXAP2","description":"","reviewerName":"Pecos Bill","summary":"You should like this game. You've been playing it for 10 years.","reviewText":"Should you get the game?  Let me ask you a series of questions:- Are you a big Star Wars fan?  If yes, go ahead and get it.  It's a good Star Wars game.- Are you new to the MMORPG genre?  If yes, go ahead and get it.  It's a good MMORPG.- Did you play some other MMORPG, enjoyed it, and mostly just thought, \"I wish this game could be exactly like it is now, except with more wookies\"?  If yes, go ahead and get it.  It's got wookies.- Did you quit your last MMORPG because you got tired of the gameplay?  If yes, then you might give this game a pass, because it's really just more of the same, recast as Star Wars.This is a good game.  If you answered \"yes\" to any of my first three questions, don't even read the rest of this review.  Just put it in your cart and click on to the ordering screen because I think you'll be pleased with it.  If you answered \"yes\" to my final question, then read on and I'll explain why you might give this game a pass.It's hard for me to not be a bit bitter about it because it's the same game I have been playing for roughly 10 years, with a few minor tweaks.  (Where are the innovations?)  That is, if you've played Warhammer, Rift, World of Warcraft, Everquest, etc, then you are already very familiar with what SWTOR is going to be like.  There is very little truly new to the genre here.  A bit more story based?  Sure.  A couple neat things with crafting and the \"companion\" system?  Yeah.  But basically you are playing the same game as that last MMORPG you played, whatever it was, except this time it's got more lightsabers in it.  MMORPGs have been stuck in this rut for a long time.  If you're new to the genre, hey, jump right in!  It's a good rut, really.  If you've been in it for 10 years like me, then don't expect SWTOR to jump the rut in any way.  There are no big innovations here:You know how it goes.  See dude.  Talk to dude.  Get quest.  Go kill everything.  Go talk to the dude again.  Get reward.  Go talk to next dude.  The world is linear.  The world is not dynamic.  You cannot impact the world (at least not for more than about 60 seconds).  The decisions you make are very fleeting and don't really matter in any sort of big scheme.  It's set in a time of conflict but there's no real \"war\" to fight in, per se, because, as is always the case in MMORPGs, we enter the game when the war has just been called off (WOW, Rift) or just before it has gotten started (LOTRO, SWTOR).  So yes, there's some fighting, but you're not going to have to fight for or against the Empire as they try to take over a planet in real-time because this is not a wargame -- it's a standard, linear, computer RPG.So it's good, really, it's just same-old-same-old.  They did some neat things with crafting -- you won't find yourself slaving over a hot forge all day making hammers.  The \"companion\" system basically gives everyone their own NPC \"pet\" that follows them around and adds to the conversations as well as providing some tactical interest.  The quests are good.  Everything is a voice-over and done pretty well.  You get to chat it up with some options that have some immediate impact and you can pick \"light side\" or \"dark side\".  So yeah, there are some neat things in this game.But it's still fundamentally the same as the last MMORPG you played, whatever that was.  If you liked that, you'll like this.  If you were sick of that, then you're just getting more of the same here.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2011"}

This first person shooter has an enjoyable array of weapons and upgrades. Turning a sniper rifle into a laser machine gun is a hoot. On the game play side some areas seem out of balance. Player will go from corridors of 2-3 nazis to a room with 10+ and a couple of rocket mechs. The story line is fine; however, the definite drawback is the voice-over. BJ's dialog is a mere whisper and is often drowned out by background noises such as airplanes, bombs, and weapon fire. Also discussed is the picking up of ammo. Having to press the same button to pick-up loot as the reload leads to many deaths when in the heat of battle.Short game that can be finished easily within a week of playing at night.

{"product_name":"B008XMSRKC","description":"Neo-Paris. 2084.Personal memories can now be digitized, bought, sold and traded. The last remnants of privacy and intimacy have been swept away in what appears to be a logical progression of the explosive growth of social networks at the beginning of the 21st century. The citizens themselves have accepted this surveillance society in exchange for the comfort only smart technology can provide. This memory economy gives immense power over society to just a handful of people.Remember Me is a 3rd person action adventure where players take on the role of Nilin, a former elite memory hunter with the ability to break into people's minds and steal or even alter their memories. The authorities, fearful of her knowledge and capabilities have arrested Nilin and wiped her memory clean. After her escape from prison, Nilin sets out on a mission to recover her identity, helped by her last and only friend. This search for her past leads to her being hunted by the very people that created this surveillance society.","reviewerName":"Evildead11","summary":"Remember The Annoyances","reviewText":"Remember Me has a great idea for a game.  Unfortunately, it doesn't really capitalize on it.  The premise is interesting and the story could've been so much more.  It felt like a game that was being developed by a team of very talented people, but with a deadline that stunted the quality of their work.For starters, the game is very pretty.  The backdrop of a futuristic France was really something to behold - from the slums to the nicer parts of the city, everything had a great look to it.  The problem is, I wanted to explore the great looking city and I really couldn't.  The path you must follow is very linear.  Even the platforming portions of the game were linear in that arrows pointed out where you needed to jump to.  This is a very \"a to b\" type of game.Although the game looked great, the sounds are a different story.  Now, the voice acting was ok.  And, at first, the ambient sound seemed just fine.  Until I played on for a while.  The sounds from different areas tend to repeat themselves over and over again.  In some cases, those sounds were very annoying, too.  Listening to some crazy person spout off his craziness over and over and over again until I reached a certain area was bothersome.  Not a gamekiller, just a little annoying.What really kept this game from being better than only 3 stars is the combat.  The combo system doesn't work all that well.  Long strings of combos can be very difficult to pull off when you are being attacked by 10 different types of enemies from all sides.  Not to mention the fact that some enemies are \"protected\" by others, meaning there is an order in which you must defeat them.  The whole thing is just more of a bother than it is fun.There are a few memory sequences that are very well done and fun to execute, but they are very far and few between and have little impact on the game as a whole.Bottom line is this - it's not a terrible game.  You might have a little fun bouncing around futuristic France if you have a great deal o patience to deal with the various irritants throughout the game.  For me, this is an average game at best.  Don't pay more than $30.00 for it.Overall: 3/5","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2013"}

This isn't the longest game in the series but there's plenty to do and the Challenge mode adds replay value.  There's also new guns and accessories and a new upgrade system that really adds to the enjoyment.  The story is good and I was glad to see some new villains.

I just downloaded an mp3 album from amazon called \"Heart of the Ocean\" by Strong & Bryon that I'm going to listen to while playing the game that I think will add to the relaxation and general feeling.  There are all sorts of fish, dolphins, whales, manta rays and other sea life to discover.  You can interact by touching or petting them and you can feed them.  There's information on the different creatures and you can record what you've discovered by saving it in a log back up on the boat by simply choosing to save the part of the game you're playing that day.This is a good way to relax when you have a little time at the end of the day and just want to slow down your thoughts before sleeping.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2008"}

The game is fun and will provide hours of play, but it's not the grand epic BRAWL you've been hearing about.The good - Excellent music and excellent graphics (for a Wii game...the graphics are hardly next-gen, however, as evidenced by the grainy cutscenes).  Seeing familiar characters is just fun.  I found myself smiling when R.O.B. showed up on the screen.  The gameplay is FAST, which is really good.  The single-player \"Subspace Emissary\" is pretty neat since it gives you a chance to play ALL the characters as well as unlock new ones.  It's classic 2D gameplay is nostalgic...I haven't played a game like this in years, and I'm not complaining!  It's a bit linear, but this is hardly the point of Super Smash Bros. Brawl.The bad - The controls are simply not up to par.  You have a variety of options (Wii Remote with or without nunchuck, GameCube controller or Wii Classic controller).  This will let you pick which configuration works best for you, but no control scheme is any more responsive than the other.  The characters simply do not control as fluidly as they should for a fighting game.  For a console whose innovative controls is the main selling point, this is a disappointment.  I hate not being able to use the remote's pointer during the menu screens, instead it's like using that annoying little button between the \"G\" and the \"H\" keys on your laptop!  Very much an inexcusable flaw on the part of Nintendo.If you're basing your purchase of a Wii console on this game, think again (although there are plenty of other better games on this console).  It's fun, and the multiplayer is excellent, but it hardly lives up to the hype.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0002CNUN0","reviewerName":"GamerGirl","summary":"Go back to the old formula","reviewText":"I have always been a huge fan of the Tony Hawk series of video games, ever since the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (THPS). I have seen many improvements to the original formula over the past five years, but the last couple of games in the series have been disappointing. For me, the high point of the series was THPS 4. It had a ton of challenging goals, awesome levels, and is the one game in the series that I will pull out if I just want to goof around.THUG 2, on the other hand, is a shorter game (I beat story mode on normal difficulty in one weekend in between midterm study sessions), has relatively forgettable levels, and shamelessly promotes antisocial behavior. To add to the depth of the game, a classic career mode was added, with the two minute timer and classic goals such as collect S-K-A-T-E, pro scores, and hidden video tapes, all within the same levels as story mode. Nice idea, but I always hated that stupid two minute timer.I still feel that I can give THUG 2 a pretty good rating because it still had the same addicting gameplay as other games in the series and they added a new \"focus mode,\" which allows you to switch to bullet-time in special mode, giving you better control. It was also kind of a cool addition to give you a pro teammate and two special guest skaters for each level, each with their own unique goals. One of the special guests in each level had a different type of ride, like a go-kart or a motorized wheelchair. Nice idea, but I hated the control on some of these rides, especially Steve-O's mechanical bull.Bottom line: This game is too short and not as fun as some of the other games in the series. There were only 6 new levels (I believe) with a few classic levels added in. Trying to play through on \"sick\" difficulty mode may add to the replay value, but you're still playing the same goals, just more frustrating.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2004"}

{"product_name":"B000FQBPCQ","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Great Game, But NOT Perfect","reviewText":"Everybody here seems to be lavishing this game with praises. For the most part, I agree. Twilight Princess is perhaps the best action game on Wii, with an incredibly immersive world, a fantastic story, and nice graphics (for an early Wii game). It took me over 60 hours to finish, between side tasks and the final ending. However, I'm sure that the completest could take another 10-20 hours, easily. It was one of the longer games I've beaten, and that's pretty impressive. There are plenty of different experiences to be had, between snowboard racing with a Yeti, horseback riding, and a wide array of challenges involving the many tools you will collect with the games many dungeons. Some of the best dungeons are the most subtle: my favorite was one in which Link had to fetch ingredients for a special soup by exploring the NPC's mansion. Also, Twilight Princess has some of the most epic boss battles I have experienced. The finale, in the castle of Hyrule itself, is an epic four-part battle that utilizes every major aspect learned in the game. What follows is a very fitting ending, one of my favorites in the Zelda series.Unfortunately, the game stumbles occasionally. The wolf-only segments, particularly in the beginning of the game, really tend to drag. I began this game nearly a year and a half ago, but only just beat it last night (I forced myself). In my opinion, the \"dark\" segments are just not nearly as compelling as the \"standard\" dungeons/environments, and are why this game lost a star for me. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, and definitely worth the money, but it is NOT a classic by any standards, and is also not the best game on Wii (spot saved for SMG2). Still, you're sure to have a good time with TP, so go ahead and buy it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2010"}

It's fun but, the story is way too short and easy, even though there are 2 alternate stories. The blood and gore have been edited a bit, to better suit the comic book fans, who will most likely have started a 21st century punk uprising, had Superman been brutally torn apart. That said, the finishing moves as well as special moves are still fun and this game is worth playing, if you can get your brain out of the comics.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2011"}
