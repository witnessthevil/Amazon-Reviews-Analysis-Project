{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"UziHorowitz","summary":"L.A. Noire - A Leap in Technology and Storytelling","reviewText":"L.A. Noire is the latest title published by Rockstar, but the game was actually developed by Team Bondi. This is Team Bondi's first game, though some of the team were formerly from Sony's Team Soho, whom you'd best remember for The Getaway games on the Playstation 2. L.A. Noire is an exciting and somewhat revolutionary game in the open world genre. So let's investigate this one further and see if it it's top of class or just swimmin' with the fishes.Positives:- Revolutionary Facial Animation Tech - L.A. Noire is the first game to use Team Bondi's Motion Scan technology. This tech fully captures an actor's every movement and displays it on the character model in the game, which allows for very realistic movements that don't feel robotic at all.- An Open World w/ Class - L.A. Noire offers a very large open world that is so detailed. You'll just stare in awe at its beauty. Every street is littered with detail.- Story, Characters, Voice Acting - L.A. Noire is top of the class in every single one of these departments. The story is engaging, with very interesting characters and incredible voice acting to bring each character to life.- Side Quests - While L.A. Noire isn't littered with side quests like Grand Theft Auto IV and Red Dead Redemption, it does have a more elegant and natural way of introducing side quests. When you're out on the main quest, you'll get a dispatch call warning you of a crime taking place, and then from there you can choose to either take on the side quest or completely ignore it. And if you do ignore the side quests, you can then finish them later. There are 40 side quests in total.- Solid and Fun Gameplay - L.A. Noire's gameplay isn't as good as some other games, but it's still very solid overall. The gunplay and cover system are reliable and work well enough. The interrogation scenes are excellent and allow you to question people, look at their animations and try to read their movements to see if they're telling the truth, lying, or you can simply doubt them if you have no proof to prove that they're lying. The vehicles are easy to drive and don't feel very weighty. They feel more arcade-like, not sim-like.- Overall Graphics - Just beautiful. Everything is so detailed in the world of L.A. Noire. Yes, there is some pop-in, but it doesn't take away from the overall stunning graphics.Negatives:- Some Technical Hiccups - A few framerate dips during cutscenes and gameplay, some environment and texture pop-in, and a few other minor issues.Overall, L.A. Noire is a grand, sweeping epic of a game. It could've easily been nothing more than a tech demo for the impressive Motion Scan technology, but Team Bondi has made a game with superb narrative and solid gameplay in addition. Do not miss out on this masterpiece. It has a few flaws, but they're very minor in the grand scheme of things. L.A. Noire is a must play game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2011"}

The core of a game is an action RPG, where you fight monsters using both the stylus and keypad, while improving your characters' statistics.  However, there are so many innovative new features in this game that make it unlike any other game I've played.The combat system is incredibly unique.  You control two characters, one on each screen, and fight simultaneously with them, using the stylus to control the action on the bottom screen and the keypad to control the action on the top screen.  While this sounds complicated (it is, especially when you start out), the game features fully adjustable difficulty, which lets you fine-tune the difficulty to a level you find enjoyable.  On the easiest setting, the game is quite easy, even for novice DS players, but is very challenging at the highest difficulty settings.  The touch-screen lets you attack by using the stylus in various ways on the screen.  Some attacks require you to tap monsters, while others have you draw rudimentary figures on screen.  Some attacks even make use of the DS microphone!The art style is reminiscent of Square-Enix's popular series Kingdom Hearts, although the characters and story is completely new.  If you're not into anime, the art might turn you off, though I don't particularly care for anime and I thought the art style was fine.  The music is a rather strange mix of jpop and techno, but is actually quite enjoyable.  The story is really odd but compelling, and kept me guessing right until the end.  Interestingly enough, the game takes place in a slightly modified version of the Shibuya district of Tokyo, with many prominent real-life landmarks only slightly modified in the game.The RPG aspects of the game are really well handled.  There is a good degree of customization with respect to your combat abilities as well as your characters, and for people who enjoy maxing our their character's statistics, there's plenty of that in this game as well.  Even though the main story of the game is rather short (most people will probably finish in about 20 or so hours), there is a substantial amount of bonus material that can keep you playing for dozens more hours.Since this game is really different than any other RPG on the market, there will undoubtedly be some people who find this game off-putting.  In lesser hands, all the strange features could have made this game a disaster, but the design is so strong that everything works well.  If you're interested in a novel experience for the Nintendo DS, look no further than this game.  If you really are unsure about whether or not you want this game, even after reading reviews online, looking at screenshots, and watching videos, see if you can find a friend who has it and test it out.  I know that I had a blast playing this game, and a lot of admiration for the team that created it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Ben Lehbert","summary":"Great system for kids 6-12.","reviewText":"This was my first system and I had great fun with it.

More specifically, it CAN be hard. Most enemy encounters are simple, some are easy once you know what to do, and with others you hope for the best. The platforming aspect offers some challenge as well, but it doesn't take too long to get a good grasp one what you need to do and how to use a certain magnet-like glyph effectively.In regards to the boss battles, they are quite varied. You may die once or twice, but in doing so you will learn how to dodge certain attacks, which glyphs are best, and potentially how to get through a fight without taking any damage. The only boss battle I had some difficulty with is relatively early in the game and requires some mastery of platforming. The real challenge was that that boss, along with a much simpler one later in the game, isn't meant to be defeated with glyphs. Other than that, you just need to learn how to dodge and use some common sense (a rapier won't do as well as a hammer against a giant skeleton for example). One minor complaint I have is that some bosses have a huge build up to the fight, and they crumple like they were made of styrofoam while the relatively unexpected bosses (they are marked by blue doors, so you expect something...) were a huge pain and some of the most difficult.The graphics are lovely, nobody can deny that. Each environment has a bit of a personal touch to set it apart from the others. The enemies are very detailed as well. Some, such as bats, blend in to the background until they are in flight even. Annoying, but it teaches you how to be patient and cautious. Other reviews are mixed about the music, but I enjoyed it. It felt appropriate in some areas, and in others it was slightly upbeat to help you get through and not be overwhelmed.Overall, if you like a bit of a challenge and pleasant artwork, get this game. I promise you won't regret it. If you seem a little daunted by my short little review, perhaps this game wouldn't be for you. Even though it starts difficult, you learn fast. Or die trying.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00001XDUB","reviewerName":"Axel Law \"The Happy Seizure Kid\"","summary":"Fine Survival Horror","reviewText":"While &quot;Resident Evil&quot; was widely popular as a survival horror series, Konami decided to take advantage of this genre and along came &quot;Silent Hill.&quot;  You played the role of Harry Mason, who was going to take a vacation in the remote town of Silent Hill with his adopted daughter Cheryl, whom he found on the side of the road and no one had knowledge of her.  Once entering the town, he loses Cheryl and yearns to find her... only to find the town is covered in fog and strange things are afoot.  An extremely enthralling and creepy game... read on if you dare:THE GOODThe storyline has more plot twists than a pretzel.  You'll get lost in it several times and some of it doesn't really make sense... but it keeps you hooked.  Hooked as if your sensitive areas were going to explode if you stopped playing.  This game is dated by today because of the second and third Silent Hill's, but I still find this game to be creepy today.  To tell you the truth, while I hate comparing games, I do find this game to be scarier than &quot;Resident Evil.&quot;  While both game series are fun, this one has that series beaten in the &quot;creepy&quot; department; evil nurses and demon children will attack you when you least expect it, even with your radio blaring out static.  In fact, you'll hear crazy sounds while you're playing it, and you'll be scared EVEN when your radio is not on (which by the way, the radio tells you if enemies are nearby.  If it's not blaring out static, no monsters are near you).  The environments, especially in the nightmare world LIKE THE FRIKKEN HOSPITAL, are downright scary and provide an atmosphere that's incredibly attacking your senses.  There are three endings and one alternate &quot;funny&quot; ending involving aliens, which makes the game more interesting.  The game is reasonably hard with its downright mindboggling puzzles and religious symbolism, but with a strategy guide (or a friend who knows what he/she is doing), this game actually isn't all that difficult.  What MAKES it difficult is whether or not you can sit through this terrifying game all the way through it.  ;)My favorite scary bit... funny in a freaky way: When you're in the school, you find a locker with something inside budging it.  You open it and a cat runs out.  The cat runs out the door and you hear a crunch sound as if it was eaten.  When you enter the NIGHTMARE school, you find that same locker, only with NOTHING in it except a pool of blood.  Konami was on drugs when they made this game.THE BADNothing bad I can think of.  I was going to order you to consult your physician before playing this game like I normally do... but then again, you might consult a psychiatrist once you start playing because it's just THAT creepy.OVERALLIf you want a game that'll scare the piss out of you, this is the game for you.  With scary environments and monsters, creepy characters, and a storyline that will mess with your brain to no avail, this game hooks your attention like no other game can.  You'll want to beat this game and then breathe a sigh of relief once it's over... then you got two more games which are ten times scarier than this one!  A must-have for Playstation fans.  In fact, one of the reasons to own a Playstation, period.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2004"}

T.","summary":"Repetitive Gameplay kills the entire game","reviewText":"Lost Odyssey has great visuals, especially in the many (and I mean many) movie sequences. In the end however the gameplay is repetitive and you are dragged by the nose the entire story line.  The storyline is one big clich&eacute; around the central theme of immortal characters, the other themes are the same from every Final Fantasy game from which it borrows the feel and turn based combat style.Due to the very high quantity of videos it feels like something you are watching rather than playing, and occasionally the game allows you to play through a couple of combats to give you an illusion of interaction. The voice acting (in English at least) is absurdly bad and cheesy, soap opera style, the script of the story doesn't help and the actors must have felt somewhat helpless with the lines they were given (specially the interactions involving the protagonist, who is trying to be far more serious than the rest of the project).  The only truly artistic part can be seen in the poems that appear in the form of dreams, although completely devoid of any gaming element they are (some of them) truly well made.Without spoilers one can only wonder what they were expecting placing characters like the grandchildren in the game. I honestly felt silly through major portions of the story for playing this. The lack of control over saving also makes this a difficult game for the busier player since you cannot be assured that you can play \"just another 10 minutes and save\".  You save when they let you save, you play when the movie is done, and you fight at every six steps. The combat system is the FF turn based we all know but with a timing mechanism of two rings (to create SOME sort of interaction by the player) that while it seems like a good idea it gets boring as hell.As a final note the steady progression of the opponents makes no sense, at some point you are battling regular soldiers who are still a match to your characters despite the fact that you are 20-30 levels higher since the last time you faced them.In the end I felt the Lost Odyssey is a childish game they purred a lot of resources in.

Lucas has been taught the art of combat in the ancient and deadly style of the Legion. Lucas is a skilled swordsman, and a master of two combat stances. He can fight with a sword and shield, which allows him to attack quickly, deal heavy damage, and interrupt and stun single targets. When outnumbered, he wields a massive two-handed sword. While slower to swing and less practical for one-on-one combat, it can strike multiple foes and knock them back, making it an ideal weapon for crowd control.AnjaliAnjali is an archon - a legend, come to life.

But Anjali was raised by friends of the Legion, and she does not know how she came to this world, or what happened to the others of her kind.Anjali can shift freely between her human form and an incarnation of elemental fire. In human form, she fights with a staff or a spear, allowing her to fend off multiple attackers while leaping in and out of the fray.

They've changed so much that it's basically just a completely different entity with the Dungeon Siege name stuck on the front. If you want to experience what this franchise really has to offer then you'd better stick withDungeon Siegeand its expansion.The Kingdom of Ehb is being oppressed by yet another tyrant (the amazingly-named Jeyne Kassynder) and you must trot your way through various lands and side-quests before taking her down. Sounds familiar, but in the translation from PC controls to PS3 controller the spirit is lost. Not only do you NOT get to create your own character (you must choose between a whopping range of 4) but the immersive, visionary score and themes by Jeremy Soule are out the window, replaced with more generic cues by a couple of nobodies. I only ever got to partner with one other warrior in the whole quest (I played as Katarina and partnered with Anjali), which is much less satisfying than attacking in huge packs as with the first 2 games. There are no inns either. There are lots of buildings but you cannot enter most of them to meet people. The spell and melee operation is totally different too, simplified to the point where it almost doesn't exist. All you'll do is trot around and shoot. Katarina's rifle handling is terrible, and she'll frequently aim far wide of what you wish to aim for. Plain and simple, this kind of game does not belong on a console.There are 55 trophies available (including the 10 from the DLC), but they REALLY make you work hard for them. You will spend literally hours with nothing being rewarded for your effort. Many of the trophies, including the Platinum are dependent on online play, which I don't agree with, and some of them are even glitched so you will not be rewarded despite meeting the requirements.A poor effort, and a pale imitation of what this series should be.Graphics BSound B-Gameplay CLasting Appeal C","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2012"}

Hot dog!","reviewText":"You know everyone seems to be getting into the rehashing and rereleasing of old games on new systems.  Asteriods, Centipede, even Frogger have been updated.  Well here are two games that haven't.  They are the same as when they were released on the Super Nintendo or Super Famicom.  Although they have been added to.  Beautiful CG animations have been added to the beginning of both games.  The only beef I have is that the characters in the CG look really, really pale.  I mean ghostly pale.  The music CD that they added was also very poorly planned.  They slapped on music from FF5 and the beginning of the second disk of FF6's soundtrack.  Why didn't they take the themes of the characters?  Those were the good songs from FF6 not &quot;The Magic House&quot; or &quot;Dark World.&quot;  Now to do the games themselves.  FF5: A solid game.  Those players that played FF Tactics will find that there is a job system in this game as well (jobs originated in FF3 for those who care).  After you find one of the four crystals you have the ability to have more jobs come availible to you.  There are 21 different jobs to have from Ninja to Hunter to the trusty Red Mage.  Some of the jobs are really good, others are really bad.  They aren't very well balanced unfortunetly.  As you fight battles you can Points, kinda like Job Points in Tactics.  After you get enough you can a level in that job and get another ability related to that job.  The music hasn't been updated at all.  It is the original Super Nintendo MIDI sounds.  I hate MIDI sounds.  Especially when it sounds MIDI.  The graphics are old school( they will remind you of the block backgrounds in the old RPGs.  Gameplay is very good.  The bosses are very challenging (although there are some that are pushovers).  There are three worlds to explore as well.  It's a fun game and will bring back a lot of nostalgia to those you remember Super Nintendo.  FF6:  The best of the Final Fantasies.  Anyone who says any differently is a fool (I'm sorry if this offends anyone.)  The music is absolutely beautiful.  It may of come from a 16-bit system but it still is the best I've heard.  In Final Fantasy 6 you must face the evil Empire who is bent on using magic to take over the world.  It's your typical RPG from the Super Nintendo era.  There are 12 characters plus two bonus characters that have their own unique abilities.  It's kinda like the job system only without a lot of freedom in who learns what.  Examples the thief Locke can steal, the Magic Soldier Celes can absorb magic and add the MP cost to her own MP.  There are many branches and many plot twists.  There also battles where you actually act out a military campaign.  These are really hard though.  Magic is learned through beings called Espers (the beginning of materia and GFs) and this could be cool but too many Espers have the same spells and too many only give you one and they are the only one that give you it.  Example Crusader with Merton.  Gameplay is standard Final Fantasy.  No surprises there.  All in all.  Final Fantasy Anthology is a must have game for all SquareSoft fans.  If you want to get on the RPG scene I also recommend this game.  It isn't as hungup on graphics and all these special fetures like the newer games are.  It is story and gameplay.  The two most important things in an RPG.  These are the games that will get you started on RPGs.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2001"}

It might be best described as a life simulation. The object is to successfully save the village from turning into a resort. Construction begins in a year, so you must find a way to rescue your homeland within that time frame.Harvest Moon: Save the Homelandwill offer nine unique ways in which to complete your task, and focuses more attention on relationships over profit. Befriending the people in town is the key to successfully completing your task. This is the first Harvest Moon title to be in a true 3-D environment. It looks much more realistic without losing the cute animation style for which the series is known.There are 20 new characters--each with his or her own unique personality--richly detailed 3-D environments, and enhanced interaction with animals, including dog training and horse racing. Other compelling details include the ability to collect and cook recipes, real-time character movement, and the capacity to obtain helpful objects by doing part-time jobs.","reviewerName":"Joe Sherry","summary":"absolutely love this game!!","reviewText":"My girlfriend and I had been looking for a game that we can play together.  I love video games, and she likes them, but she doesn't like to play a lot of the games that I do.  After some thinking, I proposed the idea of Harvest Moon: a fun little game about farming.  Surprisingly enough, she agreed to give it a try.  This was a great purchase; we both absolutely love the game and really enjoy playing it together.The premise of the game is that your grandfather recently passed away and left you his farm.  You take over the farm, but the village is in trouble.  If you can't find a way to save the village in one year, the village will be destroyed.  There are nine possible endings, each one saving the village.  While farming is important, it is the interactions and relationships with the other characters that are stressed.It is up to you to do the day to day tasks of watering your crops, feeding the animals, brushing them, milking them, gathering eggs, and interacting with your neighbors.  If at the end of the year you have failed to accomplish an ending (I was so close!), you have to start the game over, but you get to keep all of your possessions, animals, and money.  You do have to start all over as far as the relationships go, but this is the same as if you got an ending.  With 9 endings in all, you can keep playing and focusing on different people and different things.This is a true family game and is a lot of fun to play.  I'm really glad that I found a game I can play with my girlfriend and we both can enjoy it.  I'm surprised that a farming game is this much fun!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2003"}

I didn't have a way to play it then, but I do now, so even if this review isn't terribly timely, I hope you'll find it helpful.The game takes place in the world of Albion, a beautiful, lovely world somewhere between the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. In that it quickly differentiates itself from most fantasy worlds.You play the Hero. You don't get a name, but you can get titles (like Lionheart, Executioner or the NAMBLA-friendly, Chicken Chaser). You can be male or female, good or evil. You can marry the opposite sex or the same sex. You can customize your looks with new hair styles, tattoos, facial hair and hair dye. You get all sorts of different clothes to pick from, and get scars when you die. You also age.In addition, you get a whole slew of skills. You can learn how to chop wood, for example. If that's not exciting enough, you can also tend bar! Blacksmithing, bounty hunting and a couple other jobs round things out.If jobs aren't your thing, you can go on a whole series of quests, though not very many. During these quests, you can earn gold which you can use to buy all the usual stuff, plus real estate. Yes, if you want you can become the next Donald Trump! One of my friends has done this and basically owns every bit of property that can be owned.This is an action RPG, which is different from regular RPGs in that you don't select options from a menu screen. No, instead you bash, smash and crush your enemies by repeated button-mashing. Think of the Zelda games. You have both melee weapons and ranged weapons as well as a series of spells, some of which can be lots of fun!Along the way, you have a dog acting as your faithful companion. Allegedly he helps in fights, but not so you'd notice. What he mostly does is sniff out treasure, and that's a damn nice thing, given how well-hidden some of the treasure chests are.Graphics wise, this is one of the most beautiful games on any system. Everything looks gorgeous, even the darker and more unpleasant spots.If it seems like I'm focusing overly much on the non-story aspects of the game, it's cause the story, well, kind of falls short. It's the usual \"fight against someone who killed your sister\" kind of plot. Nothing memorable. It's also rather brief. There's nothing wrong with it, per se, but it's not very original.Still, the joy is in the journey, and this is one of the best games of its kind out there. Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2009"}

That being said, Spirit Tracks fixes one of the major problems I had with the first one, which is the tower you must visit after each temple. The first featured a timed game, stealth, and recurrence all in one. I simply cannot stand timed games, it makes me feel hurried. The only way I was able to tolerate Majora's Mask and the 3 day limit was that I could either slow down time, or reset it after I was done with a temple. The Spirit Tower in Spirit Tracks is very challenging, yet it isn't timed. Not only that, but you don't have to visit floors already visited.Another thing vastly improved from Phantom Hourglass is the transportation. Instead of a boring ship, there's now a train. It adds some skill since there are other trains on the track as well. Although, it is a bit weird that Link is an engineer, but I digress.The music is simply fantastic. I loved the Ocarina in OOT and MM, and was disappointed that PH didn't have an instrument. Well my friends, the Spirit Flute functions just like the Ocarina! Even after you play, it goes to a cut-scene of Link playing with the harmony, just like MM! At first, I thought using the DS microphone would be insanely stupid and gimmicky. But after using it, I am singing a different tune (pun not intended.) The on-board mic is incredibly accurate, and it doesn't look as weird in public as I thought it would.You will not be disappointed with this game. I mean come on, it's a Zelda game, which means instant purchase for us Zelda nerds. It's no OOT, but then again, what game is? Maybe if Nintendo put more effort into awesome games instead of the shovelware of lately, then we would see another OOT; Wii Zelda not withstanding, but I digress again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2009"}

You'll be wishing for the usual Resident Evil zombies!","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Judge the game on the game and you'll find what a game it is","reviewText":"I did play Resident Evil 4 on the GC but I never bought it. Then it got ported to the PS2 so I thought hey why not? The game is good regardless so whether you're playing the GC or this version it's still an awesome game regardless. I wouldn't go as far as saying it's the best game this generation but still.Story: It's a port so it's directly the same but unless you don't know the story I'll fill you in. There's no Umbrella or zombies in this, it's something else entirely. 6 years after Raccoon City got nuked because of the viral outbreak, former rookie officer Leon Kennedy has been assigned a quite important task: protect the President's family. Only Ashley, the daughter, gets kidnapped and spotted in Europe so Leon's on his way only to find that there's something up(of course).Graphics: It's been roughly 9 months since I played the GC version so I can't exactly tell there is a drop but it's not as polished/detailed as the old one but still it's still great graphics. The thing oozes with atmosphere, exploding heads still look great and the back corners of europe look unsettling.Sound/Music: Sound effects and whatnot is excellent. Shotgun blasts definately sound powerful here. Creatures have that unearthly quality while your main enemy here(they're called Ganados but I'm not spoiling what they are) speak spanish and they repeat themselves a bit too much. As for music, it's more ambient than anything, no catchy themes or anything here. But as usual the music really unsettles you to the point where you know something's going to happen but nobody's telling you anything.Gameplay: Nothing's really changed except for 2 new weapons, a new mode featuring, umm, a RE veteran. Detractors of previous RE's(such as myself) couldn't get past one thing: the control scheme. Essentially it was like you drove a tank, regardless of where you were pointing, up was always forward rather than it being 3D controls. This made precious ammo wasted since you couldn't see if you were actually getting anywhere. Well first there's several overhauls: camera is now Splinter Cell-like with a not-quite third person camera. This makes maneuvering and aiming a hell of a lot better. The control setup is still the same but because of the camera perspective it's not as bothersome.There's also plenty of ammo so you're not blindly firing shots. Some might find there's too much ammo actually. I literally had to rearrange my inventory to make it fit. The other overhaul is that in previous RE's, you needed an ink ribbon to save so no ink ribbon, no save. This was quite a problem when you went an hour without saving then bleeh, dead. Another overhaul is that in the old ones, there was a magic box where you stored weapons, ribbons, ammo and such. This connected to others so you never had to go to one such box to get one ammo, a box right next to you would have it. Well not so here because Leon carries an attache case so you get a portable briefcase with customization for it to fit more stuff since guns tend to take up space(with a rocket launcher taking up a good 20 spaces or so.If there's one thing that hasn't changed is the dialogue/voice overs. There just as B-movie as ever. It's hard not to cringe/laugh at lines like \"you're right hand comes off?\" when he meant a villain's sidekick is rather sad. Voice acting also isn't the best. Hearing Ashley go \"Leon!\" several times isn't that good for sanity. However it's Resident Evil and you don't play it for Metal Gear Solid voice caliber.The big attraction is Separate Ways, where you play Ada Wong for 5 chapters with a certain goal. They're really quick and I beat all 5 in about 2 and a half hours but mainly it's for fun. For example, why did the church bell ring in the prologue? Or how Ada managed to save Leon from a certain death? It's all here. One thing that sucked is the inventory was extremely limited to at least 4 guns or so and you couldn't even upgrade the stupid things.You should judge the game on the game itself rather than what Capcom did wrong going from Gamecube to PS2 so if you don't judge it, you'll find an excellent game underneath.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2005"}

So close. But despite the 4, it is the best Fable of the 3, I love this game. I don't particularly like the end and there are some bugs here and there, but only barely enough to edge this into a 4. If there was the ability to award half stars I would have gone with 4.5 on this. Albion is as great to trip around as ever, and there are some good new mechanics in this that help with the immersion factor, such as the lack of any HUD (but you can still access all of the info you need to at any time in a VERY inventive way). There is some good humor in this, as expected, and the game was just smashing overall. I will be playing this again, and soon! If you haven't played the first 2 games, play them first.

Edwards!","summary":"Get it cheap and be mildly happy...","reviewText":"This game is pretty standard issue story wise.  You play hero X, get involved with a grand malevolent scheme, thwart evil plans... blah blah blah.  The story takes a huge back seat in this game, moving on.The combat is the highlight of this game I believe, as should be expected of the makers of the Star Ocean series.  You have your choice from a few different weapons each having unique attacks that you earn through use.  You can combine up to 5 of these standard attacks to form your combo any way you see fit.  You eventually learn one power attack (Volty Attack) for each weapon.  I pretty much hack and slashed my way through every battle even though you can block and counter.  I found that after you had attacks that could break the enemies guard you had basically won the fight.  You can also call on your partners to use their various attacks once you get to a point in the story.  Finally you can change formations on the fly which allow you to surround enemies and pound them or do flanking formations and other such things.  The only thing that sucks about all of this is that you gradually open these features with the story so you're forced to wait quite a while before combat gets even remotely interesting.Combat aside, this game is basically one big distraction of collecting friends Suikoden style.  The crappy part is you don't get a castle/stronghold like in Suikoden, you simply collect 100+ equally worthless allies (Because your main character is all that really matters) while you wait for something to happen in the story.  This drove me completely bonkers.  I was so bored sometimes in this game I would repeatedly have to sleep or leave my game running just to get the story to advance because quite frankly I didn't care to collect every character after a while.  In Suikoden you felt compelled to collect everybody because every now and again they acutally did something additional for you like sell you stuff or teleport you, not the case in Radiata Stories.In summary, this is a collection game.  The story is superficial and cliche, the combat is fun but one dimensional, and everything takes a side note to making friends.  It's really a shame because the game looks and sounds good but it's can be a terrible bore to play at times.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000BGPGU2","description":"","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"How do you review a game like this?","reviewText":"I mean, honestly. This game is so huge and vast that if someone were to sit down, play it, \"beat it,\" and then go, gee I should review it, it would be time for the next one to come out. Instead, I'll write a review that I will hopefully update as I progress incase my opinion on the game changes. I've logged a few hours into it so far and right off the bat I know I'll like it.To break it down succinctly before I ramble, if you've played Morrowind and enjoyed it, even a little, you are doing yourself a great disservice by not picking this up right now. If you were disappointed at Morrowind because it was too big that you felt listless and didn't know what to do, pick this game up. If you loved how open and free Morrowind was, pick it up right now. If you've never played Morrowind, well, read on.Right away, most of the complaints of Morrowind are addressed. After spending a couple hours in the first dungeon/jail escape, you finally see the light of day and let me tell you, from then on, awe and excitement are around every corner. But, unlike Morrowind, in controlled and, if you want them to be, small pieces. Generally, there were two camps of people who played Morrowind: they loved it because it was so open/free that they could do anything they wanted; or, they hated it because they didn't know what to do because it was so open/free.Oblivion takes the best of Morrowind (the openness) and makes it more accessible. If you want to focus on the main quest, right as soon as you leave the dungeon there's a red flag on your compass and on your map showing where you need to go. In fact, you can click on that town and instantly warp there, should you want to. In Morrowind, it took a bit for the main story to actually appear. In Oblivion you are thrust into the main story right from the beginning. And, if you want, the story can be started right away and has some pretty exciting moments right away.If you want to, instead, explore the world a bit, well go right ahead. I did the second option, exploring a nearby fort that had catacombs filled with traps, skeletons and a ghost. Tried my hand at pick-pocketing sleeping guards with unfortunate success. Stumbled upon a bandit camp that didn't like me interrupting their probably nefarious deeds.It's setup so that if you want to, you can very easily pursue the main quest, never get lost and know what you're doing. However, you can also just set out on your own, kingdom be damned and spend the next 100 hours seeing the sights, exploring the 200+ dungeons, and scaling all 17 or so square miles of the land. As an example, one of my friends immediately began the main quest. He's now a good chunk of quests ahead of me in the quests. I took the explorer route and spent the time looking around, finding the ruins and dungeons, joining the guilds etc. Two totally different approaches, both easy to get into and fun to mess around with.Character creation is similar to Morrowind. There are a ton of races to choose from, about 21 classes (or you can create your own), 21 skill categories and a large handful of astral signs that give you bonuses. For those who've played Morrowind, there's not much difference here. Its all about choice. How do you want to play. Also included is a fantastic character editor where you can change different facets of your character to fit your desire. Really cool.Choosing your \"class\" is important in that it will define how you want to play your character. You have 7 major skills that you can assign any of the 21 skills to. Each \"kind\" of character (melee, stealth, magic) have 7 skills to choose from. Whatever you put in your major skills determines your \"class\" and how you level, while the remaining 14 become minor skills that can be leveled up (at a slower rate) and don't contribute to your leveling. Races give bonuses to skills and attributes as does the sign you end up choosing.As you can tell, the game is about openness. Do you want, be what you want. To a lesser extent, Fable tried this with mixed results. But not until this game have I seen so much openness and ability to do practically what you want.NPCs are on a 24/7 clock. Each one of the 1,000 NPCs in the game have varying levels of needs, desires and goals. They will carry these out without regard to you. Guards will catch NPC criminals, people will go out and hunt. I've seen a guard attack a wolf that was bothering a passerby. It all feels natural and as realistic as any game right now. Mostly. There are some sore spots. The combat AI for any partners you have can be a joke. Sometimes, they will just barrel forward without regard for the other monsters around you. That can lead to very difficult situations as the AI guards round up more than they can handle, die, and then you have a messy situation on your hands.Other sore spots include guards with ESP. Apparently, if a person wakes up while being killed or isn't killed in one hit, the guard seemingly knows that murder is being committed. And will rush right to where you are. This has caused me a lot of consternation when I'm trying to finish a quest with guards who know not only that I'm a murderer but also exactly where I am. And will continue to chase you forever.The interface has been retooled. The journal and your inventory is now much much more user-friendly. Quests show up in a log and you can easily select which quest you want as your active quest. Doing so immediately pops up a red marker where you need to go. You won't get lost. I will say its sometimes a little disappointing when an arrow appears over a ruin that the quest says you need to find. Instead of following general directions, I know exactly where to find it. That's a bit disappointing in that it takes away from the exploring portion of it. Minor gripe, though.The graphics also help promote this world. Terrific, they really make Oblivion come to life. From the trees in the background, to the tall weeds you pass through, everything is animated and created painstakingly beautifully. Its a real world come to life in virtual form. The physics are pretty decent. I've caused skeletons to explode, people flying backwards with a well cast fireball, rolling down hills. Sometimes, the close-ups of people are a little jarring because they don't look so realistic when you get up close and a lot of them look like they have uber-wrinkles or a skin problem. Aliasing is practically non-existent. When you get a horse, the very very very brief pauses in between loading the outworld area becomes a bit more noticeable because it seems to happen a bit more often. Its still not in anyway shape or form to the detriment of the game and is completely understandable given that the world is so huge, but its there and noticeable.The sound is also terrific. The voice actors are pretty decent, the sound effects awesome and the music really well done. Traveling through a thunderstorm really makes you feel like its raining, lightning and thundering. The clash of steel on steel is exciting, sparks fly.The game does stutter at times. In the first dungeon, when I brought out a torch, the game paused briefly as it changed the light levels. Not a huge problem by any means. Placing spells on your directional pad hotkey can become a pain as you ready each spell. Though, I love the fact I can wield a sword and a torch/shield AND cast spells at the same time. Love it. I guess there's some framerate issues, but I have barely noticed them at all. There are some pop-ups with the shrubs etc in the distance but really when the game is generating all of this on the fly, I can forgive some very very very minor quibbles.Overall, if you are a fan of RPGs, I don't know why you wouldn't like this game. Whatever you bring to the table, it will match you. Whether you want to get lost in a virtual world, discover catacombs that really feel like they've never been found before, just go after the main quest, buy and sell houses, try and become a mercantile genius or even become a vampire, everything is up to you. You can do it all, or none of it.I will say it's hard to be objective with a game that was seemingly crafted just for me. I am usually willing to overlook minor faults etc when the end product is amazing. Such is the case with Oblivion. Everything about it are things I love. I love the openness that is controlled in that I will never get lost. I can't think of many games that give you so much freedom, but in such a way that you won't lose your way. Absolutely terrific, there's nothing here that makes me not recommend it fully-heartedly for RPGers.The Collector's Edition (which I have) includes a replica of the Septim coin, a map of Cyrodil, a faux-leather covered book containing the history of the land and a making of DVD.  All of this in a really awesome, two disk case.  Its definitely worth the extra $10 in my opinion.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2006"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYZS0","description":"","reviewerName":"F. Jury \"dsunglasses\"","summary":"Ending = Kick in the nuts","reviewText":"*Spoilers*I didn't think it possible for Bioware to screw up the ending this badly. I mean to many, Mass Effect was the premier example of a game providing excellent story telling, combined with superior character development. The story Mass Effect told was so good and engaging the whole way, Its unthinkable to me that they could butcher the ending the way they did.The game is quite similar to ME2 in play style. You have less party characters, then ME2, but slightly more then ME1. The game thankfully gets rid of the annoying planet searching for minerals, from ME2. And you have more weapon, options and upgrades then you did in ME2, but you are still unable to choose armor for your squad mates, just change their colors. The gameplay itself is probably slightly more refined from ME2, dialogue choices however, are diminished even further. Paragon or Renegade choices every time, and very few of the quick action decisions introduced in ME2The game overall was quite good and I cant bring myself to give it less then four stars, despite the much hated ending. The collectors edition comes with a patch, a comic book, a tin case, and some add on downloadable content. All together its probably not worth the extra $20 over the regular version.The game had a number of plot holes and things that didn't work besides the ending. First of all, the annoying focus on the kid, was a complete waste of time. The scenes were short, so I was willing to overlook it, but they only took away from the game. The slow motion May Payne like dreams sequences where you chase the kid around, were boring and meaningless. I was afraid while watching them, that they were going to be tied into some lame plot twist and that's exactly what happened, with the ending.I liked that they tied up the story lines with the Krogan and Geth, and these were some of the best parts of the game. I also like that they tied up the story with Cerberus, but they made it and the Illusive Man way to big a part of this game. This final chapter was supposed to be about the reapers, Cerberus could have been destroyed or joined the fight, but it was a mistake to make some stupid terrorist organization so heavily tied to the ending.The crucible plot point was also, weak. I liked the idea that we were gathering resources and allies for war, building up to the final conflict, but then of course the ending makes it all pointless. The crucible, seemed unnecessary. How did sophisticated plans survive numerous cycles for a giant, device, that was never built or used and nobody know what it does, yet, they put all their hope on this.Here are some things we should have had that would have made this game truly epic.1. We spend the game acquiring resources and allies, and make difficult RPG decisions, concerning, where to send people and resources. which planets or systems to defend? Which to abandon? Who can we get to join the fight? We make difficult gray area decisions, about where to send squadmates, people die some heroically, some cowardly. There was none of that.2. The Reapers are invading, and indoctrination is rampant across the galaxy. Who to trust? Who is trying to sabotage or thwart us? Can we trust ourselves or our squadmates? This are was largely ignored.3. We could have had some epic tank/vehicle battles, or space battles, yet the game gave us none of that and remained solely a first person shooter.4. Towards the end we should have had numerous choices about where to apply resources and units, and what to attack, and who was to go where and do what. None of that, no choices whatsoever. We Don't see any of our squadmates, do anything or fight in anyway. No heroic, cut scenes of teammates fighting to the death against the reapers, or kicking ass.5. Here's what the ending of the game should have been. The ending(s) that would have made most everyone happy. We should have squared off against the reapers. the choices you've made throughout the three games come home to roost, and you see their effects in action. people you saved, or didn't, people, you killed or didn't, resources you acquired or didn't, people that liked you or didn't, all of these things should have mattered and been given some weight, in how the ending played out. There could have been two primary endings with many variations. The galaxy united fights off the reapers, and  for the first time, a cycle survives, We see galactic celebrations, and followup on the surviving characters. We got none of that. Or an ending where the reapers are just to much and defeat is inevitable as hinted at in the first game. We see Sheppard and our various characters gong down heroically one by one, giving it their all. The reapers are given pause, but ultimately win and the cycle repeats. We didn't get that either.Instead what we do get is some slow motion moving around, no epic battles, no boss fight, no character finales, a truly lame plot twist, where the reapers, are being  controlled by some unexplained ghost boy, and three ridiculous choices, that are completely idiotic, and render all the three games build up and choices meaningless. You got that Bioware? That's why people are pissed.How about truly long ending, that's worth all the effort we put in? One that makes us feel like our choices mattered. One that gives us some closure on Shepard and the other characters we cared about?That's all we wanted.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"Bradley Corwin","summary":"The PS4 has Launched","reviewText":"Console:  The console itself looks great.  I'm not a fan of the shiny black part of it.  I wish it was all matte black but I'll get over it.  It took me a little bit to find the power and eject buttons simply because I did not know they were in the crack of the front.  They are touch buttons and are responsive.  There are two USB ports on the front but I wish there were some on the back.  The console is super quiet, the only time there is any noise is when the game spins up and you barely notice it.Software: The software seems pretty fast most of the time.  You can bounce between the games and your menu fairly quickly.  I don't like how every single thing you download goes into a long list of applications.  I like how the PS3 separated them.  Bluetooth is not supported yet which is annoying.  Every once in awhile my menu will lag for no reason and the system has completely frozen once.Controller: The new controller feels great in the hand.  At first I didn't know if I'd like the removal of the Start and Select button but you get used to it.  The battery life seems okay so far.  The light bar on the controller can be bright if you are looking at it but most of the time I don't notice it.  I haven't had much use of the touchpad part on the controller yet.  The speaker is awesome and I really like how you can add any headset that you want to the controller.  The controller can charge while the system is in standby.PlayStation Network: I downloaded the 1.5 update beforehand so I did not have to wait to play.  Unfortunately the PSN was \"undergoing maintenance\"  which prevented me from signing into my account for awhile.  The PSN still seems a little slow when I'm accessing the store or downloading content but I'm sure that's just from the mass of people playing the new system.  The new chat system works fairly well but I get a lot of echo on my headset.  I'm not sure who's side it's on but I've tried multiple headsets with the same results.  The included headset is alright and will get you by but the ear bud is quite large and I have problems with it staying in my ear.  It's also annoying activating your PS+ membership or a trial to the Unlimited Music turns on automatic renewal.  You have to dig through menus to find it and turn it off, I think it should just ask you up front.Games: I'm a little disappointed that quite a few games I want to play are not out yet or were delayed.  I did get Call of Duty: Ghosts, Knack, and Killzone: Shadow Fall.  All of these games look really good and I can't wait to see what is to come.  If you are interested in these games check out my reviews on them.  A PS+ membership is now required to play online.  There are a few free games on the PlayStation store and there are bonus' for PS+ members.  PS+ membership seems to be more rewarding than Xbox Live.Camera (Additional Purchase): I bought the camera to go with the PS4.  It has an interface that you can say PlayStation and then a few other commands.  These are pretty basic right now but hopefully they will get better with updates.  The face sign in has worked pretty well when the room is well lit.  Otherwise it doesn't seem to work, which isn't a big deal.  There is a PlayRoom app that you can use to use the camera and play with a little robot.  It's fun for a little bit but doesn't last long until you are bored.Conclusion: So far the PS4 is a great console that will get a lot better with software updates.  I can't wait for more games to come out!If I notice anything new or different as I use the console I'll update the review.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00D7NQP9M","reviewerName":"Evildead11","summary":"Nice RPG","reviewText":"Diablo 3 is a game that's pretty addicting.  Each time I turn it on, I end up losing track of time and when I turn it off I realize I've been playing it for hours.  The story is ok, but the gameplay is what shines.  If you're an RPG enthusiast, you'll find some real value here.  It looks great - the environments are well done and the characters and enemies, while a little small on-screen, look nice.  I played the game on a 70&#34; TV, so my opinion may be skewed in that regard.  On a smaller screen, the characters would be a little difficult to see in terms of great detail.  The controls are also well done.  Your character's powers are mapped to various buttons and it works well.  I will say that it can get a little too &#34;hack and slash&#34; at times, depending on the character you pick.  Which is another gripe I have.  There is a VERY limited character selection (Barbarian, Demon Hunter, Monk and Wizard).  Although you can choose the gender of each character class, I thought only having 4 classes was a little weak.  Now, you can unlock more classes as you progress, but I think they should be available from the start.  I recommend playing the game for about 30 minutes for each class to see which one fits your game style best.  I started with a Demon Hunter - who is a long range specialist - which is great and all, until you are surrounded by a hoarde of enemies and you're getting pummeled because you have ZERO melee option.There is lots of looting, lots of killing, cool bosses, great sound, great graphics, and much more to like about this game.  If you're an RPG fan, you should thoroughly enjoy D3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2013"}

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or braving it solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house.Key Game FeaturesHunt Together- In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone. Hunt together with up to 4 players online or take on arena quests with 2-player split-screen action. In single player mode, you even have the ability to hunt with AI-controlled characters named ChaCha.Communicate Online- Because communication is key in coordinated huntsMonster Hunter Trisupports Wii Speak and text chat.Monsters with Unique Abilities and Attacks- Monsters have unique and dynamic personalities, abilities and defenses, increasing in complexity as the player progresses. They camouflage themselves to ambush hunters, but will flee or call for help if outmatched.Immense Living, Breathing World with Ecosystem- Monsters interact amongst each other in a living breathing ecosystem, complete with food chain. Monsters have stamina, migrate and even attack one another, the strong feeding on the weak.New Underwater Maps- For the first time ever in anyMonster Huntergame, you will be able explore land and sea and hunt monsters of the deep.Fully Customizable Equipment- With ten weapon categories &ndash; including the all-new Switch Axe &ndash; and new armor and weaponry created from the remains of slain monsters, there are almost limitless opportunities for equipment customization.Choice of Controls- Play with either the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, with the Classic Controller or Classic Controller Pro.Take Your Character with You- The ability to save your character to your Wii Remote lets you engage in multiplayer hunts anytime on a friend's console.","reviewerName":"Spunkus Maximus","summary":"Cool Grind","reviewText":"This game is great!

It's just simple fun- nothing too complex, just bright, colorful, engaging fun that anyone of any age can enjoy. It's a gorgeous game for the 3ds as well, and the 3d effects are put to use in a way that actually works with the gameplay, it's not just a cosmetic effect. Kirby is only the second 3DS game that runs at 60fps while 3d is on, and it looks really great/polished because of it. Not to mention the controls are spot on as well. So it's just another AAA release from Nintendo all around.

{"product_name":"B00004SVXQ","description":"This classic console fantasy RPG spawned an unstoppable series of great games. The graphics and sound are shadows of its descendents, but the gameplay is addictive and the story is stunningly rich and thoughtful. Players guide parties of four characters on a series of quests to defeat four ancient demons and save the world--which is also stuck in a time loop!","reviewerName":"drqshadow","summary":"The Years Have Been Kind","reviewText":"It's difficult to recall when, exactly, I became so enamored with the Final Fantasy series. I'm what you'd call a maniacal RPG freak.. not so much in the pencil and paper AD&D; sense as the turn-based console sense.. but it wasn't always that way. I think it was my elementary-school buddy Richard who first introduced me to the original Final Fantasy, addicted me to it, and made sure I stayed on the right path when FF IV came to America as the Super NES title \"Final Fantasy II.\"So, when I sat down this past month to give the old cart another go-around, it was with plenty of fond memories tucked under my arm. A lot had changed in the thirteen years since I first played this classic, but once I'd adjusted to the transition from PS2 to NES, in many ways it was like I was back in 1990 all over again.It's the premise that launched a million clones; you take control of a party of wanderers, customizing them from the very get-go. Your group can contain any combination of Fighters, Thieves, Black Belts, White, Red or Black Mages. You're given the chance to name each one of them, though in true 8-bit fashion, your writing can't go any longer than four letters per warrior. Each different class its own has unique strengths and limitations, and a good strategist will have no problem balancing things out. It's a simple system, which remains full of possibilities even today.The graphics for this title aren't as polished as the later titles in the NES collection. The bright blue backdrops of the introductory screen, as well as the status screens, are almost painful to stare at. Likewise, each battle takes place on a flat, boring black field. Your only hint as to the location of the fight comes in the form of a small, panoramic illustration that runs along the upper quarter of the screen. What we're looking at is very dated, no question, but even within the limitations of the old NES, they could still be better.While this standard gameplay system may have set the table for hundreds of games to follow, there remain dozens of major unresolved problems. This title wasn't completely ironed out by the time it was released, and often steps over the line between being challenging and downright annoying. Whenever any member of your party is the victim of a lasting status effect (poisoning and stoning are the most common), they're immediately moved to the bottom of the assault formation, where they're much less likely to take any additional damage. While this may seem like a helpful feature, its actual implementation is a major burden. If the strongest member of your party is poisoned, the weakest member of the party steps forward to fill his shoes. In effect, it does the last thing you'd ever want it to do, and if you're not paying attention it's very easy to get caught with your pants down.The musical composition employed by this first double-F is one of the all time classics. It's the stuff of legend, still used in today's newest releases. The dozens of original songs within this title perfectly fit their surroundings, and couldn't have been any more flawlessly assembled. Unfortunately, the actual performance is beyond abysmal. The screeches and roars of that old sound card have never been so irritating. After a couple hours, you'll mute the television and put in a CD, or at least turn the volume way down. My cats are scared of the television set when I'm playing this game, due to the horrible sound it emits.As with any RPG, if you'd like to get anywhere in Final Fantasy, you'll need to talk to some non-playable characters. They're sprawled generously across every town and castle, though most have nothing of value to tell your party. Almost every individual roams the overhead map with no specific destination in mind. Amusing as this may be, it quickly grows old as they meander their way directly into your path time and time again, blocking the narrow hallways and caves .... It's like they'll go out of their way to get into yours, and then.... slowwwly.... wander..... away. Even the dungeons suffer from this problem, as bats float their way around the rooms with no particular place to go.If you've heard the term \"random encounters,\" you pretty much know the big story behind Final Fantasy. Everything in the game is built around a simple formula of \"wander countryside, meet random enemy, defeat said enemy, repeat.\" Each 'chapter' of the game brings with it a whole new tier of difficult enemies to strike down. This is not a game for those unprepared to invest hours upon hours of their life to aimless wandering. If you want to survive, you'll have to do a TON of experience gathering, which basically means you'll run around the map killing stuff.Despite my numerous gripes; the horribly dated graphics, the horrific squeal of the music and the endless level-ups, there's something about this game. Something that drives you to keep coming back, to gain that extra level, to see if maybe this time you can take down that boss. It's a trend I've noticed more and more as I've started to play some of the older classics, something that's missing from the majority of today's polished row of hip titles. Though the visuals and the audibles may be nowhere close to what we can get with today's advanced processors, there's an innocence that's rarely matched. There's a reason Chess and Checkers have been played for centuries without modification, and that same reasoning applies here to Final Fantasy I.Once you've picked this game up, you won't want to put it down until you're through. If you've forgotten just how appealing the Gamecube's great-grandfather truly was, as I had, you're gonna want to take another look at this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2003"}
{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Andreas Born","summary":"playstation PSP","reviewText":"I cant stop playing around with this one. i found out how to easy copie movies on the memory card.This is so cool.

I decided to go for something a little different, and so I jumped on the new PSP-2000.A little background: I had a launch PSP back when they first came out. I liked it then, but it was very limited by a lack of software and support.Fast-forward to today: I'm quite happy with the PSP-2000 as a media device. It's lightweight, slim, and doesn't take up much more space than an iPod touch. It has user-replaceable battery packs, and you can upgrade the memory as you see fit. I grabbed an 8GB Memory Stick at a bargain price, and I'm happy with the amount of data I can store on it.Other bonuses versus an iPod touch:* Controls for games.* Built-in stereo speakers.* WiFi switch allows you to turn off WiFi when you're not using it.* Bigger screen.* Extended battery available.* Comes with wall charger, but can be charged via USB just like the iPod.* Costs MUCH less than iPOd touch.* Web browser has limited support for Shockwave Flash (iPod doesn't).* Supports more media formats.All in all, the PSP is a great choice. It's too bad Sony is still marketing it as a gaming console, instead of aiming it at the adult crowd looking for a media device. On the gaming side, however, I'm having a blast playing PSOne games that I downloaded from the Sony Store. The iPod touch can't play Castlevania Symphony of the Night, can it?Yep.

The description box at the side of Heroic says something like \"survival isn't garaunteed, well that's if you first start on that mode on your first ever go on this game. On legendary it says \"enemies never known defeat and they laugh at your efforts\", yep that's tru when there're are more of them and those elites(big alians)use plasma auto rifels(alien's machine guns) your health goes down awfully fast and more enemies come to take you down but they don't respawn. After owning this game for 2 years legendary is easy now I'm experienced. This is where replay value comes in because you'll want to complete all 10 levels on different difficulties and when you're on level select it shows symbols of which difficulties you've done it on.The first thing you'll notice are great graphics but not as good as the new Ninja Gaidan but this game was made 2 -3 years ago(check out HALO 2 screen shots on Gamespot). There're are snowy effects, exsplosians, rain effects. Heck when shining your flashlight on your gun at the wall in the dark it reflects like in real life. The frame rate is something like 30 not 60 but I never noticed until I read reviews from people who dissed this game. This has great music when playing and it fits perfectly with the game. Each enemy has their own music(ELITES, HUNTERS and THE FLOOD and probably more). Even when Elites are flying BANSHEES music plays for it.Loading and saving is the best I've seen on a video game. It takes about 15 secs to load the start of a huge level then afterwards when you progress through it takes 1 second to load as it auto saves or it's called a checkpoint so when you die you end up there and you have to go on save and quit to save..The good thing about this is it doesn't feel too unrealistic when taking so many gun shots, you don't die because you're MASTER CHIEF in a protective cool suit, there are batteries in your suit that charges up your health once you take cover. In Medal of honour it's redicules when taking 100 shots and not dying.The weapons are great as they each have a strength on each enemy.PISTOLThis is in my opinion the best gun. This has a 2 * 2 scope, it holds 120 ammo and it has powerful bullets. They're good to use against anything apart from shooting vehicals.ASSUALT RIFELpeople are saying this is inaccurate but they're wrong because when enemies are a couple of feet away you don't just hold the right trigor, you have to push it repeatedly to make it more accurate. There should have been an option for controlled burst. This is good used for close up encounters like shooting elites then melee attacking them with the butt of rifel. This is strongest to use against the FLOOD.SHOTGUNThis is powerful and takes down the flood in 1 hit depending on how close you are. This is best used in narrow corridors because this won't do as well out side. Best used against flood and Elites.SNIPER RIFELThis has a 2 * 2 zoom and a whopping 10 * 10 zoom. This is powerful and is best use against the covenant(ALIANS)and not the FLOOD because it won't harm them. Best used in out door areas or spacious insides.ROCKET LAUNCHERThis is powerful and has a useful full 2 * 2 zoom. This is best used for groups of enemies, vehicals, hitting weak point of hunters(big aliens with armour) and elites. Remember to shoot the ground so the impact hits the enemy because you'll miss when shooting directly at the body.PLASMA PISTOLPush the right trigger repeatedly and it'll fire like a pistol and when holding it and then releasing a powerful bolt is released and takes away a JACKELS(alian)shield if you fire at them.PLASMA RIFELThis is the alien's machine gun and it's all rapid fire but when holding the fire button for too long it over heats and burns your hand, you don't loose health of it though. This is good for charging at any enemy except for HUNTERS and vehicles.NEEDLERThis is cool because when you fire it it homes in on the unlucky victim. When the ELITES use thier great AI buy jumping for cover behind rocks you fire this and when it sticks onto them it exsplodes. This is bad to use with anything to do with armour ie Jackel cause it'll bounce rite of.There's also FRAG GRENADE and PLASMA GRENADES. Frag is great for quick exsplosians and PLASMA is great to stick onto someone, like a GRUNT(small aliens)so when they run of to the bigger alians for help it'll result in more deaths.Ther're great vehicles such as WARTHOG(jeep with chaingun on back), SCORPIAN TANK(were up to 4 soldiers can sit on the side), GHOSTS(floating vehicle) and flying BANSHEES(your jaw will drop when flying in the snow and when it's a bit dark).This game never gets old and it's like listening to good music when it gets better every time. You'll appreciate when enemies die differently, the suroundings and when driving on the mud or sand it comes of the wheels realisticly. Thier AI is the best in a FPS. Multiplayer is great and rivals TIME SPLITTERS 2. There's an edit mode where you can change control settings and multiplayer modes.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2004"}

Driving the vehicles and running your friends over and taking up a sniper position in Blood Gulch to pick them off in the same game is extremely gratifying.  Linking up XBOXes is a party in itself with this game.  However [strange] that sounds, it's true.  My fianc&eacute;e, who is a model/actress, was joining in on the taunts; I guess if it's a geek thing, then we all are.HALO has the slug COMBAT EVOLVED for a reason:  it dispenses with the DOOM-era need for finding the switch, opening the door, putting the blue statue on the blue pedestal, and all that jazz.  It focuses on defeating your enemy through military tactics and quick-reloading trigger fingers.  The AI in this game is fantastic ; alternately attacking and retreating.  To progress through the game, you have to think about surviving the hundreds of battles you'll encounter.  The superb and grandiose level design further assists this model.The game's story is alternately sci-fi intense, horrific, and tongue-in-cheek.  It's a rollercoaster ride all the way.  You'll find yourself saying, \"What the hell will they throw at me next?\" and you'll never be disappointed with the deliver when it comes.And so is HALO...greatest game ever.

{"product_name":"B000AB603U","description":"It's the dawn of a new age in real-time strategy (RTS) games. A brave New World is rising--a hostile yet beautiful world, filled with innovative gameplay, new strategic scenarios, eye-searing graphics and much more. Welcome to a world calledAge of Empires III.CampaignIn this action adventure tale of historical fiction, players take on the role of Morgan Black and his family, struggling against the hostile wilderness and a mysterious cult that's crept in from Europe.In a series of 24 scenarios divided into three acts, Morgan Black and his descendants help the Aztecs resist conquest by Spanish conquistadors, pit the French against the British in the French and Indian War and help Simon Bolivar lead revolutions in South America.MultiplayerWhether you're searching for a quick game or hoping to talk strategy with friends online,Age of Empires III's Multiplayer site is your community destination.Here, you can play with persistent Home Cities that gain power and strategic options the more games you play, compete for a spot on dozens of ladders, help organize your clan or chat after a game -- all without leaving the multiplayer portal.Fans ofAge of Mythology's Quick Search can still look for games swiftly, while players looking for something specific can browse game lists to find the set of options that matches their tastes.New Feature--Home CitiesThis revolutionary new feature to the RTS landscape is incorporated into all aspects ofAge of Empires III-- from Campaign to Multiplayer -- and is unlike anything you've experienced before.Much like the persistent character from a role-playing game that encourages you to keep playing, your Home City is an important support system to your efforts in the New World. During a game, your Home City can regularly send you supplies or military reinforcements.You are the leader of your colony, but your success brings glory back to Mother Europe. The more games you play, and the better you do, the more powerful your Home City will become. Every few games, you gain the ability to both upgrade and customize your Home City:Upgrade your city by unlocking new types of soldiers or buildings, or improving those you already have.Broaden your tech tree in whatever direction most fits your play style--invest in warships, native alliances, cavalry, artillery or economy.Customize your Home City by changing the appearance of buildings, the weather or even the types of people who walk, work and perform in its streets.Throughout a game, as well as in between games, you can visit your Home City to watch its citizens go about their lives, get an opinion on how you're doing, plot your next move or just marvel at the beautiful sunset.Full 3-D Graphics, Destructible Environments and MoreWe first set out to reproduce the rich detail ofAge of Empires II: Age of Kings. As we strove to make the fascinatingAge of Empires IIItime period come alive, that goal quickly evolved: We at Ensemble Studios wanted to create the best-looking game ever. From the stunning water effects to the hundreds of units battling on-screen, you'll feel like you're a part of the action in the New World.Tone mapping--This photo imaging technique balances the colors in a scene on the fly. The end result is a rich, warm game where bright colors are vibrantly rendered alongside darker counterparts, such as shadows.Lighting and shadows--The sun is always shining inAge of Empires, so it's important that lighting and shadows be an awe-inspiring experience. Units and buildings cast shadows according to a real sun position, and even cast shadows on each other. High Dynamic Range rendering allows us to represent the shiny glints of sunlight that bounce off highly reflective surfaces.Bump and specular mapping--Water glistens like water. Metal shines like metal. These advanced techniques serve to provide an extra level of rendering detail heretofore unseen in real-time strategy (RTS) gaming.Water--We felt that portraying stunning, realistic water effects in the game was so important that we devoted a programmer to it full-time. You'll find the water rich with details like foam near the shore, accurately modeled water motion, flotsam in rivers and realistic water colors. Plus, reflections change with the viewing angle, the angle of sunlight and the motion of the water. The overall effect is breathtaking.Cliffs and Riverbeds--Instead of just stretching terrain, we built a system to attach geometry to the terrain map to allow for realistic overhangs and steep cliffs, from areas like the American Southwest. This effect is supported on random maps too.CivilizationsBritishQuick access to Settlers gives the British one of the strongest economies in the game. The ability to upgrade two key units -- the Musketeer and Hussar -- make the British military formidable in the late game. The British Home City emphasizes improvements to technology and naval warfare.DutchAlthough Dutch Settlers are limited and costly, their civilization makes up for this economic disadvantage by building Banks and generating coin automatically. The Dutch Home City emphasizes upgrades to defense and economy.FrenchAlthough the French economy starts slowly, the Coureur unit, a Villager with strong fighting skills, makes the French difficult to attack early. The French also have the strongest cavalry unit in the game -- the Cuirassier. Plus, the French are experts at allying with the Native Americans.GermanThe Germans have fewer Settlers and therefore a slower economy. Fortunately, both the Settler Wagon and Uhlan cavalry spawn for free from the German Town Center. Plus, the Germans start with the ability to send Mercenaries from their Home City (long before other civilizations can).Native AmericanEuropean civilizations can learn new technologies and gain troops by forging alliances with the Native Americans. A British player who allies with the Iroquois is essentially playing as two civilizations: the British and the Iroquois.OttomanFor the Ottomans, Settlers spawn automatically from the Town Center. Building a Mosque and conducting research help keep that Settler production steady. Befitting their position straddling Europe and Asia, the Ottomans have more unique units than any other civilization.PortugueseStarting the game with two Town Centers, the Portuguese can quickly produce Settlers, control territory or support their allies. The Spyglass ability allows the Portuguese to easily spy on the enemy. The Portuguese also have a strong navy, strong light infantry and the best Dragoons in the game.RussianStarting the game with extra resources but fewer Settlers gives the Russians the flexibility of focusing on economy or an early raid. Russian infantry, individually weak, are trained in blocks at a faster rate, providing the Russians with the opportunity to overwhelm their enemy with greater numbers.SpanishThe Spanish have a strong military, with both hand infantry and cavalry. Flexibility in early shipments from the Home City give the Spanish the option to attack early or set up for a strong, late economy. Spanish Home City improvements benefit soldiers, buildings and naval units.&nbsp;CombatAge of Empires IIIgives players an amazing amount of control over their side of the battlefield.More to command -- Not only are you in command of large and diverse armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery, but also Native American warriors, mercenaries and tall ships.Multiple formations -- You can assign different formations to your army for different strengths and weaknesses, or have the game automatically choose the most appropriate formation. Examples include:Volley -- ranged infantry, like musketeers, take turns firing at enemies ahead of them.Charge -- your soldiers walk, then run into combat. Cavalry wield sabers, and musketeers fix bayonets. This formation does tremendous damage but makes your soldiers more prone to injury.Bombard -- your soldiers protect the cannons, while the cannons shell enemy ranks. Available only when you have artillery in your army.Battles are easier to follow -- You can still command individual units. But when the units fight in formation, you'll be able to tell exactly who is winning the fight.Real-time physics -- Infantry struck by cannon fire will be thrown like rag dolls, perhaps even over a cliff and into the water. Cannonballs bounce and ricochet.Detailed destructions -- Shingles, shutters and whole towers may fly off a building and interact with the terrain, such as crashing into nearby water. This next generation effect is done on the fly so that each building always has a unique destruction, no matter how many times you see it.Unique animations -- With hundreds of unique combat animations, you'll never see the same battle twice.","reviewerName":"Stephen Schultz \"S. S.\"","summary":"Lives up to the expectation!!","reviewText":"Age of Empires 3 is the sequel to the award winning Age of Empires 2. Number 2 was set in the middle ages and number 3 is set in colonial times. Both are extremely fun to play, however the publishers left out a couple things that are in the second game.First of ,when your villagers are gathering supplies, they don't need a lumber camp or mining camp to collect it. They just keep chopping or keep mining until the source is gone then they go to find another. it's like they have a black hole in their bag. This is good as well as bad. It is good because it makes it easier to get supplies. It is bad because it makes it less realistic. Secondly, when the men stand on the tracks of the caravans on the trade routes, the trains or buggies run right over them but don't hurt them a bit. Deffinatly unrealistic, but hey it's still a fun game.Other than that I thought it was top notch. There are a lot of different things in this version and instead of explaining them all to you I'll let you find out for yourself. Go download the demo for Age of Empires 3 from Microsoft's internet page (it's free). That's what I did first off. It gave me a great feel for what the game feels like. I can almost promise you that you will love it right from the start if you like RTS games.It has single player campaigns and random maps, it has multiplayer and it has a map builder where you can build your own maps. Everything from the previous ones and more!! Hurry out and buy it after you've tried the demo, just to be sure. I give it 5 stars and I hear rumors that they're making a fourth one.

{"product_name":"B00002STEZ","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"A great game, but sometimes less is more.","reviewText":"For fans of the original 16-bit SNES games, you couldn't ask for a better game. The once 2-D platform scrolling of \"Donkey Kong Country\" is now juiced up into a 3-D, free-roaming adventure. The levels are new and exciting, and offer a wicked challenge. But sometimes, the challenge is too much.The story is familiar enough. Donkey Kong, with the help of his friends, goes after the evil reptiles that stole his banana hoard.  Cranky Kong, who is the original Arcade DK, offers greater help this time around, giving you new abilities and objectives as you complete old ones. His sarcastic \"In my day...\" remarks add some nice comic relief. The graphics, with the aid of the requisite Expansion pak, are amazing, rich and colorful. The movements of the characters are smooth, and the worlds are gigantic, allowing for lots of exploration and hidden levels.The flaws in this game are relative to the player. I find that the sheer volume of items you need to obtain, and all the side levels, can be unbelieveable. You spend more time looking for items than you do looking for reptiles. Much of your time is also dedicated to finding hidden levels, which adds a lot of replay value, but causes you to get stuck at certain points. For some, this is a definite plus, and I am not saying that it is a big downer, but sometimes you feel bogged down with things to do.Another problem that needs addressing is the camera. They should have focused as much on responsive camera movements as they did with the graphics. It often shifts when you don't want it to, and it is a bugger to get a strait focus. This also brings up the issue of the controls, which are harder to master than a new language. Getting Donkey Kong to dive properly underwater is enough to send your remote flying across the room.But all these are minor flaws in an otherwise great game. When you play it you will see how they took full advantage of the Nintendo 64's abilities. It is not for everybody, and will definitely frustrate some, but it is worth every bit of effort.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2002"}

Molina \"Superior Combatant\"","summary":"How I Lost My Love For God of War....","reviewText":"I have been a hardcore God of War fanatic since playing the original back in 2005. It was what brought me back to gaming from a 6 year haitus. With every release I started to get more pumped and excited for more adventures with Kratos. When I played God of War 3 I noticed a trend, the emphasis on story was declining and the gore was increasing. The Original Trilogy was epic nevertheless. Then came the prequels....Although entertaining, they just felt like unnecessary stories to sell the PSP. And then came the game that has officially ended my honeymoon with the franchise: God of War-Ascension!!This is the first GoW game I didn't buy on launch because of being skeptical. I read the negative reviews but didn't believe it. Here is my quick opinion on why I think the series should die;1 - The camera is broken, I kept constantly getting motion sick. There are times when there are hordes of baddies and the camera is all over the place or panned out that you can't even tell what your doing. The other camera issue is when you enter a room, it feels like it zooms out and shows you everything for every room. This was not the case with previous installments.2 - The Baddies are ridiculous in this game. Everytime I enter a room  there are hordes of goatmen, then more goatmen.The difficulty is also unbalanced. On numerous occasions my health bar has been left with 1 hit away from death.3 - The gore is just ridiculous. With each game they have amped up the gore, but it was tolerable. There are parts were both myself and my wife feel like it was unnecessary to take it to that level.4 - The scenary and puzzles are boring. For the exception of some parts, the levels feel like they were the draft copies for the other games. The puzzles were tedious and had me searching GameFaqs so I could get that S*** over with, something I HAVE NEVER DONE IN A GOD OF WAR GAME!!!!5 - Finally, the story. Oh how the mighty have fallen. I didn't expect epic boss battles, but at least a more cohesive story about Kratos past. What I get is something I already saw in God of War 1, and not in a good way. There was 0 charcter development for the main antagonist \"The Furies\". I played the game for 4 hours on my first playthrough and just kept yelling to my wife, \"WTF am I doing!?\" It seems like I saw a brief CG of story and then I ran in a hollow world for 3:50 hours. Nothing happened....at all....at all. Does this game take place before Chains of Olympus or After? Thats how confusing, boring, and uninspired the story arc is.Verdict: 3 out of 5 for the reason that Santa Monica should have put their resources in moving the series forward. This is the first God of War game I don't feel like replaying let alone completing. The multiplayer is forgettable and nothing like the challenges from previous God of War games. Its a sad day for Sony fans.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2013"}

I liked Phantom Brave's story more, La Pucelle's character design is better, and Makai Kingdom's levelling system is better.That said, it's an awesome game.  Out of all the Nippon Ichi games, you can play this one the longest.  Your characters will be challenged way up to about level 5000 (more if you count resurrections).  I finished La Pucelle at lvl 800, Phantom Brave at lvl 2000ish, and Makai Kingdom at lvl 1700ish.  You can literally play this game for hundreds of hours filled with obsessive enjoyment.It made me laugh, and the anime parodies are awesome.  Characters may be pretty lame (Gordon), but you can use all original chars if you want.  The same music all the time in the Item Worlds drove me nuts for a while.  Compared to the overall entertainment value, those complaints are small.  You can turn the volume off and play your music, and you can skip story parts if you've already seen them.  (Multiple endings.)If you are looking for a video game to play for an hour each day for a year. This is it!  Fifty dollars might seem like a lot, but  you'll be getting more playtime per penny than most ten dollar games.I can't give this one five stars because I've played other Nippon Ichi games where they do better in some areas.

With the exception of Hot Pursuit 2, it just wasn't my cup of tea. Yet, Need For Speed Underground grabbed me by the short and curlies-from the get-go- and wouldn't let go. Sadly, it wasn't the sense of speed that drawed me or the tuned-up autos from manufacturers such as Honda, Toyota, Mitsubishi, Suburu or Dodge. It was the attention to car detail that drawed me. You can customize your car just about anyway you'd like with parts such as Neon lights, Hood/Rear Covers, and rims &amp; more. That adds a whole new level to things and is what makes this an incredibly deep racer. Another thing that adds to an already stellar presentation is all the racing modes you have in the game(Drag, Drift,Quick Race, Circuit) to give it more of a true life 'street racing' feel. Visually, it's absolutely stunning(you can actually see the slick wet streets of the night). Quite possibly, the best-looking racer I've seen on the PS2 yet. One last thing that should be mentioned is its' online play. That's the one thing that separates it from the other console versions(and, boy, is it sweet). This is the only street racing game I know, right now, that gives Midnight Club II some serious competition. Definitely one I'd recommend to racing fans.Although, it isn't without its' flaws. Single-player wise, it's pretty awesome as you progress through over 100 grueling race competitions. Yet, multiplayer wise, it seems average to me. It coulda' used alot more shortcuts(like in Midnight Club 2) to make things more interesting between racers. It would've been nice to be able to customize decals and such from scratch for your car and modify individual parts(instead of getting leveled kits) to further make your car the ultimate ride. But, all this in itself, is nitpicking.Admittedly, I'm a big Midnight Club II fan but I can find a place on my shelf to include NFS Underground.Overall, Need for Speed Underground is a worthy addition to any street racing fans' library. It's a solid game that will definitely get your adrenaline pumping.  I hope we see another game in this new series...it definitely calls for one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2004"}

Claw your way up through the amateur ranks to prove yourself in the professional world of skateboarding.","reviewerName":"Nick Watkins \"Nick Watkins\"","summary":"Best Yet!","reviewText":"This Winter, two games were released I had been looking forward to; Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (of course), and this, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4. After playing Tony Hawk 3 over and over and over again on Free Skate (I had beaten everything on Career), I was getting pretty sick of the same levels. FINALLY, number 4 has come.The second release of this series for the \"new generation\" systems, Tony Hawk 4 once again expands itself seemingly as far as it can go; at least until 5 will arrive. A few minor additions have been made; stiching cars, busses, ect, massive, literally massive levels, new secret characters (such as Iron Maiden's Eddie and a \"hot chick\"), a few new moves, and more. The most noticable change, however, is on Career mode, and I'm sure you've already heard about it. NO MORE TIME LIMITS. You now have to go and find people and they will give you missions to do, and you are usaully timed on just those mission in particular. And another thing: once you have 90 Pro Points, you have a Pro Challenge to complete. I have reached mine with Bam Margera, and on his you have to skate down Alcatraz Island in a shopping cart. Sounds easy? It's not. Hard. Frustrating. Tiring. Good words to describe it. Anyway, moving on...The game's system is like the second game; you get cash and spend it at the skate shop. You can buy hidden players for 9,000, secret levels for 1,200, boards for 400, movies for 400, and so on. Once you have gotten every piece of cash and completed every single objective, you have enough money to unlock the \"hot chick\". I'm pretty far from that.The levels are:1. College-FUN FACTOR-5/52. San Francisco-5/53. Alcatraz-3/54. Kona-5/56. Shipyard-1/57. London-5/58. Zoo-5/59. Chicago*10.

Iron maiden: \"The Number of the Beast\"2. The Offspring: \"Blackball\"3. Sex Pistols: \"Anarchy in the UK\"4. Run DMC: \"My ADIDAS\"5. NWA: \"Express Yourself\"6.

{"product_name":"B001BX6JUA","reviewerName":"Timothy Lovett","summary":"Rockband 2 - Vastly Better than Original","reviewText":"After playing through Rockband 2 with my flatmates for awhile and going through the functionality that has changed since the original I'd have to say this game lives up to the hype.Songs:You're able to use any of your downloaded content for Rockband 1 within Rockband 2. It's unfortunate that the base songs from Rockband 1 aren't able to be used given I don't like having to switch disks to hear specific music but given it would be hard to prove I owned the original and didn't just borrow it to get the songs if they had that functionality. As for the included songs... it's a vast selection of music that would appeal to many audiences and you're given 20 free song downloads as part of the purchase so you can expand that library further from your own favorites. I like the music but have to admit, for many of the songs I usually know the artists but never have heard of the songs.Mutliplayer:One of the biggest flaws of the original Rockband was that you could not play on XBox Live with your friends in anything besides quickplay. What this meant was that you'd have to coordinate with friends across the states to play one or two songs but never be able to actually sit back and play through the adventure aspect of the series. This has been added in the sequel.Local Multiplayer / Solo Mode:Another huge improvement to the game is the ability to play through as a band without needing all members of the band present. So if my flatmate is out of the apartment and I want to advance our band I can start up my solo career as the singer in the band and do a few of the songs. If he's there later I can join with him again with all the progress I made as well. The real benefit to this is that honestly many people, especially when you have friends over, want to play the game but aren't willing to make a band just to setup each scenario of whether anyone wants to play a particular instrument or not. With the system like this anyone can pick up an instrument and join the band without having to worry about this.In general the game finally has a pretty strong core engine for multiplayer online and locally which vastly improves on the original. Improves to the game could include a stronger avatar customization option for users who would like to put the time into designing their characters, a better library of songs, and the ability to port over music from Rockband 1 given no one likes switching over disks to play certain tracks. Even without these changes though the game is solid.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2008"}

The only things I disliked were the overly long dialogues. I appreciate a good story in a game, but this one is just over the top. I find myself trying to pick out only important things people say and hurry through the rest of it. Occasionally voices would cut out from dialogues and be back the next sentence.Loading times are also very long. I loaded a save file and it was taking 3-5 minutes which felt like a PS1 game. Many times you walk out a portal into an open area again, and the game auto-saves which is annoying (and long) when I had saved 2 seconds prior. I'm not sure if it's just my experience but there were instances when the game's frame-rate crawls to a very slow pace, mostly during a crowded battle. The game literally stopped moving except for the part where it says \"attacking, moving\" etc next to your party members' names. I was basically just pushing buttons fighting blind and hoping it was doing something even though I couldn't see it. I have one of the new slim PS3s that I just bought last year, so I doubt it's my console but who knows.Combat system seemed kind of all over the place to me but not really exciting, except for the chaos of people running around. You can only set up a few guidelines your party members will follow, and outside of that you pretty much only have time to control 1 and watch everyone's HP.Overall from the amount of hours you will spend playing this game, it's worth the money.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2011"}

All three zones are connected via bridges and wires, and all - once you complete certain chronological events - are accessible at the same time. \"Infamous\" makes its first great impression in the sheer level of detail contained in Empire City - the zones are distinct and individual, with separate and defined architectural styles, beautiful lighting and water effects, and an extremely impressive amount of action to look at. Where \"Infamous\" falls down, understandably, is in the repetitive design of the city dwellers and enemies (there's probably only ten or twelve citizen designs, fewer for the enemies) - but since the action is breakneck you won't really notice this criticism affecting your enjoyment of the gameplay.SOUND: 3/5Average, but good average. Cole is voiced by a fairly bog-standard David Hayter/Wolverine type, and his best pal Zeke sounds like something from an Eighties college movie, but the voice acting is well-done. Music is present but not really highlighted. \"Infamous\" does use sound to create an excellent sense of Metropolis, though, and so for that it must be praised: the use of silence, volume drop-off and ambient noise is excellent, and definitely furthers the atmosphere.PLAYABILITY: 5/5Like I mentioned before, where \"Infamous\" really shines is in its extreme playability. This is a highly addictive free-roaming game, where most missions and side-quests are begun at your discretion. There's tons to see and do in Empire City, and Sucker Punch productions have designed a near-flawless control system with which to complete your trip.You can be good, or evil: based on the in-game choices you make (do you heal or kill pedestrians? Do you care if they get in the way of your electric powers? Do you save yourself or work to save others? And so on...) Cole's appearance will change, as will the reaction of the general populace to his presence, and the kinds of missions you can complete. Longevity is sorted out here: \"Infamous\" is a large game to complete once, but the impetus is definitely there to complete it twice, just to see Cole's story from both sides of the coin.Running, jumping, climbing and combat are beautifully simplistic, and there's an RPG-element here too, as you can choose what you upgrade with the EXP points you earn, adding a strategic dimension to the action. Both Cole and the camera control brilliantly (seriously: it's smooth and responsive, and is sort of a How-To in getting this right in videogames) and slowdown is a very rare nuisance.The various lightning-based powers you unlock add huge amounts of depth to the gameplay: you can take any enemy down with any power, and it's your choice to come up with the best combination that works for you. My only criticism here is that some powers (lightning storm and shield ability) unlock too late in the game to fully utilize them, but hey - challenge is good, right?LASTIBILITY: 5/5I've completed this game four times already and am considering a fifth. You'll definitely want to do it twice, adding up to approximately twenty hours play time. The beauty of \"Infamous\" lies in its simplicity and elegance, and the real joy of this game is knowing you can pick it up and play. The sense of free roaming around a living city that \"Infamous\" delivers is second to none, and overall, this is a game you will come back to again and again without ever once getting bored.Recommended for immediate purchase!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2009"}

The game is a technical masterpiece and everything looks impressive, but i personally dont like the level progression and the levels are not impressive nor amusing.  If you played the GoW Collection then you know what to expect from GoW3, what i did not expect was the lack of interest i had on seeing how all unfolds, something that never happened on my multiple playthroughs of GoW 1 and 2 since the PS2 days.  I wish i had rent it first, because i would see that this game is better to rent it, finish it and return for a fraction of the retail cost.  Also all the talk about scale and the titans, well most of the game takes place in small areas and even the boss fights are restricted to small arenas.

Very rarely has a game provided such an intense workout that just after a few minutes of playing with it, I'm covered with perspiration and my muscles feel tighter. It happened with this one.It takes a while for you to get started with this game. When you pop the disc into your PS3, you need to wait a few minutes while the game data installs. You're instantly introduced to \"Duke\", your virtual trainer who looks like he's been in a couple fights himself in his day (the graphics are so detailed it's hard to tell if he's a real person or a computer-generated image).You start out by entering your weight, height, and age. Your BMI is calculated for you.You can then choose a look for your fighter. You select from a variety of faces, beards, hair colors, and hair styles. Chances are you can get someone approximating your look.In the next step, you divide 60 \"ability points\" into various categories: strength, speed, stamina, chin (your charater's ability to take a punch), heart (your character's resolve in staying up despite taking a beating), and technique. In the course of the game, you can win more \"ability points\" to further strengthen your character.In the next step, you calibrate your Move controllers (you need two of them). The process is a bit more involved than usual. You need to center yourself in the camera, stretch your arms straight out, and then move your remotes back and forth. You can also take a picture of the background without you in it to enable head tracking, which will supposedly track your head movements just like a Kinect (I couldn't get it to work on mine, possibly because I had objects in the background).Duke will go on to tell you how to play the game. You'll need to keep your feet in place when boxing. You press the Move button and flick the controller to dodge and jump.You'll also learn how to read the various elements in the game which represent your character's well-being. There's a health meter and a stamina meter, neither of which you want to run out. There's also a rage meter, which goes up each time you get hit and adds fuel for \"dirty moves\". A diagram of a skeleton will tell you if any part of your fighter is injured and needs to be patched up.Once you finished the tutorial, you'll see four menu options:Events: Takes you through different fights of increasing difficulty. With each fight, you'll earn money, reputation points, and new moves.Training: Will let you re-do the tutorial or take new tutorials on sparring, heavy bag, speed bag, target practice, and endurance sparring.Fitness: Shows you how many calories you burn while playing.Fighter: Lets you adjust your character's appearance, assign new \"ability points\" you earn, heal from injuries, and apply \"boosters\" which you earn during your fights. You can also download cheats online (which, of course, come at an extra price).As for the actual fighting, it is by far the best fight experience I've had in a video game. Your onscreen character reflect your motions almost perfectly--and even mimics hooks, jabs, and uppercuts pretty well. It does take a little while to get used to fighting on a two-dimensional screen--it's hard to gauge depth and so often you may be swinging and missing at your opponent (the game does work with 3D, so I suppose with a 3D television this issue would be solved). You can also switch camera angles, which helps. Other than that, it's a remarkable simulation of actual fighting.After each fight, you can view the calories you burned as well as statistics (punches thrown, punches connected, \"dirty moves\", and punch accuracy). You can even view a video replay of your fight.Like I said, after about 5 rounds I was breathing hard and felt my muscles tight. What's great is that I didn't want to stop--I just wanted to keep pounding the tar out of my opponents. I have a feeling that of all the games I have to get in shape, this is going to be the one I go back to most often. This is motion gaming to the extreme, and a great title which showcases the capabilities of the Move.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2010"}

The 8 MB Memory Card uses Flash Memory, the storage technology that's revolutionizing handheld computers, digital cameras, and MP3 players.

{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

You can also play GBC games on it (and I think the original Game Boy games, too), and when playing the older games, you can either have the screen the original size, or you can press a button to make it fill the screen, but this will stretch the images.

I'm not a real drummer so I can't speak to how well this kit compares to real professional drum kits, but I have owned both the Rock Band 1 and Rock Band 2 drum kits and I've used them quite extensively.  I've burned through 2 foot pedals and 2 sets of drum pads so I play pretty hard.  This drum kit blows away the Rock Band drum kits with regard to durability.  I find it more fun to use as well.Rock Band Compatibility:I was apprehensive toward how this would work in Rock Band.  But Harmonix did a decent job to make sure the Guitar Hero kit would work in their game.  This kit has 6 buttons (Red, Yellow cymbal, Blue, Orange cymbal, Green, Purple pedal) while the Rock Band kit only has 5 (Red, Yellow, Blue, Green, Orange pedal).  The way it works is that the Orange cymbal on the GH kit does nothing in RB and the purple foot pedal registers as it should.  Now that RB2 supports cymbals, the yellow cymbal actually makes a high-hat sound in free-play/drum fills.  The only other thing I noticed was that the foot pedal no longer works for quick searching in the song selection page.  When you press it, it jumps to the next category just like the RB kit, but when you hold it, it doesn't bring up the list.  Not a deal-breaker at all.Comfort:This kit is pretty much fully customizable from the basic height to the angle and depth of the pads, to the height and angle of the cymbals.  Even underneath the foot pedal is adjustment for tension.  The foot pedal itself is not the most foot-friendly pedal.  I guess they expect you to wear shoes, but I don't wear shoes in my living room.  There's a big, ugly and uncomfortable Guitar Hero logo on the pedal and the plastic grips stick out a little far.  A nice slick pedal would have done just fine.  I tried plugging in my RB2 drumkit pedal but it doesn't register at all.Quality/Design:This thing looks like a professional kit even though it's not.  The pads are large and solid.  They're also sensitive.  I hit pretty hard sometimes, but they still register all the hits just fine -- even light taps.  One concern I have is for the cymbals.  If you don't have them configured like the picture, with the bar on an angle, then they will likely shift and turn on you while you're playing.  It's quite annoying.  But putting the bar on an angle helps with that issue.  The other concern is for the pedal.  It doesn't stay put on a carpet and it's not anchored to anything.  They give you a piece of velcro, but it does little good.  I have to put weights in front of the pedal to keep it stable.  So boo to Logitech for not figuring out a better solution to that issue.  All in all though, it is definitely a quality kit.  Everything but the pedal blows the Rock Band kits away.Price:Considering that an actual, professional drumkit costs around $500 and entry level ones run around $100 to $300, I think this kit is in the right price range.  It is built to last, unlike the Rock Band kits which show wear after only a month or 2 of use.  It definitely is a steep price for what boils down to a game controller, so you really have to be a fan of Rock Band or at least have a lot of disposable income.  But if you're in the market for a new drumkit because your old one broke, it may be the best choice since this one can really take a beating.Learning curve for Rock Band:If you're a Rock Band drummer and not used to playing with the cymbals, don't worry.  You'll get the hang of it pretty quickly and the rest of your skills will transfer over no problem.  In the end it actually feels more like you're an actual drummer rather than just one in a video game.Summary:The good:- Quality build- Fun to use- Highly customizable- Wireless- Works with Rock BandThe bad:- Foot pedal needs improvement- Some compatibility quirks in RB menus- PriceyOverall, I would definitely recommend if you've got the cash to burn.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2009"}

{"product_name":"B004FYJFNA","description":"","reviewerName":"Peter Faden \"robilar5500\"","summary":"A really fun game and interesting conclusion to the series....well, potentially.the conclusion.","reviewText":"Alright, i have finished my first playthrough using my exported Shep from ME2. Here are my impressions of the game presently (i will probably play it again in a few months, after whatever DLC that will come out is available).Graphics: I felt like these were pretty top notch. The in game graphics were very well defined and pretty crisp overall. You really can see the emotions coming off of the various characters in the game, such as happy, sad, angry, bored, humored, and so on...The cut scene graphics are pretty amazing. The whole package overall is vibrant, lush, and super detailed. You will even notice little nuances like smoke from a cigarette or steam from a hot cup of coffee.Gameplay: There were a few minor issues here. The pace itself is much faster overall than the previous games, at least as pertaining to battles. You cant really just hang out and snipe people...well, you can, but your enemies will employ flanking tactics and coordinated attacks, not to mention, they like to throw grenades and shoot rockets. So, you are forced to make decisions more quickly, and sometimes, by the end of a battle, you feel like you were just barely hanging on by the proverbial thread. That intensity was great. The issues were more with a touch of glitchy-ness. The game only froze on me once, but there were plenty of times where drag was definitely noticeable. Minor, like i said, but you will be aware of them when you play for any length of time most likely. Bioware did away with mining, and planet surveying has been simplified to the extent that you dont spend hours sifting through the various planets just to stock up or find an anomaly. However, the caveat is that while the process of discovery is simplified, it also carries an element of danger, as the more time you spend looking for stuff, the more likely you are to draw attention from the Reapers. That will make more sense when you play the game of course.The other stuff: The quest system has been dumbed down a bit, but it isnt really a big deal, since all the primary quests are lit up on your galaxy map. The Normandy is a bit more expansive than it was in ME2. You still have a fish tank in your cabin, but no space hamster, lol. Also, your fish dont die if you forget to visit your cabin. The ending presents you with what might be the ultimate morality challenge. I have only played through once, but it seems like there are three distinct endings to the game. The sense of urgency throughout the game is top notch. You really feel like the universe as we know it is about to come to an end. Pretty much all the main characters from ME1 and 2 reappear here in some capacity. In most cases, it is simply for closure, but as has been already reported widely, Garrus, Liara, and Tali rejoin your crew, along with a surprise character, and a super, not so secret surprise, a Prothean crew member later on (if you download 'From the Ashes'). Although there is closure in this game, there is also soething of a cliffhanger at the very, very end after the credits that makes you wonder if they have more planned for the Mass Effect universe in the future. Also, there are loads of different weapons and upgrades, which is fun from both a versatility and strategic standpoint.If you have any other questions regarding this game, i will be happy to answer them. I personally had a great time playing, but a few technical issues, and a surprisingly large amount of cut scenes that sometimes drag things out a little too much (even though they are still pretty awesome) make this a four star effort IMO. Loads of fun, but maybe not quite as good as it could have been overall.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2012"}

Tse \"mitchelltse\"","summary":"Excellent split-screen co-op game!","reviewText":"As a split-screen co-op campaign TPS, there really is no other game like it!  (Okay, Resistance is close, but that's an excellent game as well).  Having a choice of primary and secondary weapons (and any game that lets you choose a fully automatic P90 as a \"secondary\" weapon is definitely giving you a great choice of arsenal!), as well as grenades and special weapons (sniper rifle or RPG as examples), as well as the ability to customize weapons (adding scopes, switching barrels, stocks, ammo clips, adding a grenade launcher as examples), you really do have an excellent range of weapon customizations.One great aspect of the PS3 version is the use of the Sixaxis controller for the tandem paragliding segments.  There are parts of some missions where you're doing tandem paragliding, with one person controlling the parachute using the Sixaxis controller (and here's a problem, the manual never tells you that you're supposed to use the Sixaxis controller's tilt function to control movement, so we smacked the mountain a few times till we figured it out!) and the other person shooting, that's pretty unique to this game (and they recommend using a sniper rifle for that segment, but it's so much more fun using a SAW or AUG on full auto to mow down baddies while you're gliding...)I'm giving this game 4 stars, because the single player buddie AI can use an improvement (patch?) but as a co-op on the splitscreen, this is a great game for me.Several other reviewers say that enemy AI is stupid, that they just run up to you.  I don't know if they're playing it at easy difficulty, but enemies run up to me as well, but they run shooting and swinging!There is one departure from realism that I'd like to point out, and I'm actually glad they did it this way:  You have a primary weapon, a secondary weapon, a grenade, and a special weapon, and you can pick up ammo, as a primary weapon and as a secondary weapon, as opposed to finding M16 ammo, or AK47 ammo, or P90 ammo, or a S&W; ammo, or a M134 minigun ammo, etc.  This is a needed abstraction, since there are about a dozen each primary, secondary, and special weapons, and if you were to stick to realism, you'd never find the right ammo on the ground for your equipped weapons (needler ammo, anyone?)Another thing that may be important to you is that the primary protagonists in the game, Rios and Salem, are mercenaries, and will act like mercenaries.  There's a bit of swearing, and there's some other guy out there who's more of a wild-dog than Rios and Salem, with a scene where he gouges someone's eyes and beats their head into the ground.  Yes, this game is rated M, just like Halo is, but there's definitely more violence and profanity in Ao2 than Halo, for example.  So if you want to play this game as a father/son combo, make sure you debrief them afterwards (it's just a game, you can't shoot your classmates in the back, etc)...Highly recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00004U1R1","description":"Made in Japan. For this game pak to operate, you must have an N64 expansion pak(sold separately installed in Your N64).","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"The darkest in the Zelda catalogue","reviewText":"If only that damn site IGN didn't take my idea first. They described this game as the Empire Strikes Back in Zelda and it's true. It's more darker, more gloomy and at times it can even be depressing. Unlike Ocarina of Time which oozed coolness and wonderment or Wind Waker which was cheery and uplifting due to its look, Majora's Mask is quite different than other installments but in no way is it bad, it's just different.Story: I always considered this game more like an epilogue to Ocarina of Time rather than a full sequel. At the start of the game directly taking place after Ocarina, Link is in a forest and gets ambushed by Skull Kid and is turned into a Deku(they look like tiny trees with a long mouth) and enters a portal. From here Link finds himself in Termina, a land that is gonna be destroyed by a falling moon in 3 days. So it's up to Link once again to save the day using the powers of time and this weird masks.Graphics: Reviewing this game in 2005 with such games as Metroid Prime, Halo and Metal Gear Solid 3 of course puts Majora to shame but remembering the graphics at that time, it's more of an extension of Ocarina only darker and not as vibrant. Due to maybe the Expansion Pak or just the game itself, the game does have framerate issues and some rough textures. Beware that the Gamecube re-release on the Collector's Edition sometimes freezes the game.Gameplay: All Zelda games pretty much to this day revolved around some kind of \"gimmick\": in Ocarina it was time travelling, Wind Waker was controlling the wind, Minish Cap was the ability to shrink to thumbnail size and the Oracle series revolved around time travelling and season changing. Majora's Mask revolves around, yep you guessed it, masks. Link with the benefit of 24 masks(25 if you get all 24), Link can turn into different characters such as the Deku race, Goron race(big tough creatures with a taste for rocks) and the Zora race(fish people roughly). Or there's different masks like Postman, Ghost, or Bunny mask which makes him run faster.The other aspect for the 3rd time in Zelda's history revolves around time travelling, once in Ocarina and the other in Oracle of Ages. Only this time it's different. You see the game's clock makes 3 days take about roughly 50 minutes before the moon crashes so with the Ocarina you can go back to Day 1 and start over, even make the time go slower so you have more time. This is quite annoying to say the least since your funds, arrows and bombs revert to zero if you go back to Day 1, your items are intact, your extra stuff isn't. And also you could be in the middle of a dungeon to be really close only to be on the final day and have to reset to Day 1, which incidentally cancels any progress you made in the dungeon.Not to say the game is bad(it's just slightly hard) but it's quite enjoyable to go through, if you don't mind it's tone anyway.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2005"}

{"product_name":"B001IK1BWC","reviewerName":"M. Daneker","summary":"The best RPG this year.","reviewText":"Dragon Age: Origins could nearly be considered two games, the one for the PC and the one for the Xbox / PS3. Unlike other titles such as Mass Effect, Bioshock or Halo, the computer version of Dragon Age offers a unique and different experience than the consoles. Either version is likely to be considered one of the top ten games of the year as this RPG is more accessible to the masses than titles like Oblivion or Fallout 3 but just as rewarding and challenging to the hard-core RPG player.On the PC Dragon Age can look and feel similar to Diablo or Neverwinter Knights, but the structure more Mass Effect (another Bioware title) in fact, players of Mass Effect will find that this is very much that game set in a time a 1000 years earlier. The movement for example, for fans of games such as Final Fantasy or The Witcher, it may be off-putting to not have a world to wonder freely, for this game, like Mass Effect, gives you destinations on a map which you travel to while the area is loading, but you can't simply go walking about outside of each area. But, don't let that get you down, because each area will cost you plenty of hours, and hours, and hours. This game is huge.The PC version gives you the option of a top-down view, the characters become very small and graphically it now looks like Diablo, you have hordes swarming you, you can pause, direct your four players one command at a time and then watch them carry it out. Although some crave this level of control and strategy, others of us who want to finish the 100+ hours of exploring and side quest can find it daunting. The PC does offer an \"easy\" level for those of us who do our battling in real time, but be warned, only the strong survive and easy is not so easy.PC or Console, Dragon Age will force you to talk to everyone and finish a vast amount of side quest or suffer defeat after defeat after defeat in battle. Why? Because there's no world map to go out and level-up on! You have to get levels up completing side quest and get better weapons and armor through exploration and selling-off what you find but don't want. You'll also find that you have to talk people into joining the battle or when attacks come your small team will have not-enough-help and little things like clicking on some barrels to find out there's oil in them can later translate into a knight on the battle field you tell about the oil creating a massive fire barrier the enemy has to get through to attack. That's how this game works.Dragon age also gives you 6 possible origin stories depending on who you play as and how you customize them. The origin stories give you about two hours of different locations and plots before the game congeals into the basic monster that it is. Eventually who you are and where you came from are not that important, you're a Gray Warden and that's that, but early on it does make a difference. Now, just like in The Witcher, what you say and if you can convince people of certain things drastically changes outcomes. You want to save before important conversations as you may need to try over and over until you get the outcome you want. It also changes the way your party sees you, loyalties may falter, comrades may just leave if they don't like you, since some are honest and forthright, others are thieves or murders you've recruited -- and it is possible to completely miss party members along the way and never recruit them!  -- so you really need to take a middle-of-the road approach keeping everyone happy some of the time if you want them to all stay.So PC Vs Console? Well, both if you can. The PC has superior graphics. The XBOX is grainy and weak, the PS3 better but the PC is awesome -- if yours can handle it. My rig is an Asus M3N-HT-Delux Mobo with a AMD Phenom Quad Core CPU @ 2.5 GHZ per core, 8 Gig DDR3 1066 SLI Ram, 2 Nvidia GTX250 SLI cards in 16X each PCI-E Slots (yes, my mobo allows true SLI at twin 16X speeds) and I run the game at 100% graphics at 1400X900 16:10 resolution with 60fps and no drops. The graphics are full, lush and you never see them render, it gives me full distance at full quality all the time.My PS3 looks like the PC graphics set at all Medium Quality. Grass is constantly growing before me as I move, the images are sharp and a little flat, not natural and well shaded like the PC, the distance view is never any further than your feet. Considering how amazing Final Fantasy XIII looks, this is a major let-down.However, playing on a console does have its advantages. Unlike the PC version, the console has no-drop-down view so tactical pausing isn't really desirable, though you can do it. However, it compensates with auto-targeting allowing a faster, if more hack-and-slash, playing model.In Conclusion, if you are playing more for story and exploration and want battles a bit simplified and less daunting, then the PS3 version is the best, and easiest way to view on a large screen as well. However, the PC offers vastly improved graphics (for the mid to high-end PC -- see my specs above) and a top-down view that pause-and-play gamers will want. There's also the option, if you can afford it, of doing both, I'm playing a game simultaneously on PC and PS3 and the experience is varied enough that I enjoy both -- though I only paid for the PS3 add-ons.Dragon Age: Origins is a MUST HAVE for RPG gamers, this is up there with the best Final Fantasy, The Witcher, Mass Effect, and for those of us who still remember the NES games, this is like those, on steroids.Updated:Just a few comments. Both the PC and especially the PS3 have unreasonable loading times. Some areas on the PS3 stop and load at every door. On the PC, with 8 gigs of ram, 2 gigs of video ram and a quad-core processor there shouldn't be so much loading either.I also recomend turning off \"persistant gore\" as the game is just as violent, except every battle doesn't leave everyone covered in unreasonable splatter until the next battle.On the PC the camera control is annoying. You can't use the mouse for it, you have to use the keyboard. So, if like me you are used to WASD and look-with-mouse, the option is not there. The PS3 / XBox version gives you camera on right stick, movement on left but no \"top down\" tactical veiw -- however it's more automated and fighting can be made far simpler on the console.I've also noticed some frame drop and screen split on the PS3 and I get none of this on PC.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2009"}

I've heard one of my friends cousin his XBox360 overheated and melted the CD inside and the plastic case exterior. Another friend says it glitches and locked up. Many reports I've read were the same about lock ups, screen glitches, overheating, etc. I was surprised that these reports came outta something Microsoft made. I mean did someone fall asleep at the assembly line or something. Did they not think of putting in a cooling fan ? I mean even PS2 has a cooling fan in it. All major gaming systems got one. I think even GameCube. And to cover up their error they raised the price to cover the new parts and stuff installed into the XBox360s to prevent any reoccurring error.

{"product_name":"B002ELCUUG","reviewerName":"Caraculiambro","summary":"an evil, crappy game","reviewText":"I've never been so disappointed in any game for the PS3 as much as I have been disappointed in Media Molecule's \"Little Big Planet.\"  This was one of the worst video game experiences I've ever had in my life.Initially I thought I was going to love it because of the cool graphics.Unfortunately, they made it too hard.  One of those British idiots decided to only allot you 4 lives per section. But some of the sections are infuriatingly difficult, so when you fail them, you have to go back to the entire beginning of the level.  Why couldn't they have just given you infinite lives?  That way, the game would have been fun to explore and savor.  As it is, you don't want to bother collecting anything (e.g., the stickers) because there's no guarantee you'll survive the level, and if you don't, all your work will have been for nothing.And when you are bounced back to the beginning of the level, you won't think the graphics are so fun anymore.  In fact, this entire game has overtones of punishment.  The sad part is, this could have been easily fixed:  they could have either:1. given you infinite lives;2. given you infinite jump ability;3. made it so that your character can grab on to ledges and pull himself up;4. or at least allowed you to save and load from your last checkpoint, so that you can practice only the part you're not getting.5. allowed to you pay your unused lives forward;6. or at least had different difficulty settingsor something.But making you go all the way back to the beginning of each level was pure viciousness.  It's just torture with a cutesy face!  I'd like to meet the gamer who is agile enough to make it through the \"Wheel of Death\" in the \"Bunker\" level, yet who is excited about earning a \"flower print dress\" at the end.I don't mind games being difficult.  Lord knows I've made it through some pretty hard video games.  What I do mind is all your work being incinerated and not counting for anything and having to do it all over again.  Again and again.I suspect the reason Media Molecule set it up this way is that if they hadn't, you'd be able to finish this game in about 3 hours, so little content is there.  But making it so that if you die 4 times in any one section you have to repeat the entire level, this was a way, I suspect, of making the game last at least 2 or 3 days.And most of the time you die, it's not even your fault.  See, this game isn't 2D.  It's not 3D.  It's somewhere in the middle (I believe programmers call this \"2.5D\").  It looks like a 2D platformer, but there are actually three lanes you can be in:  the foreground, the middleground, and the background.  The problem is that, not only is it hard to tell what lane you're in in any given moment (you're not allowed to pan the camera about), but the game thinks nothing of bouncing you back and forth between these lanes without your having requested this, such as when you bump in to a wall or when you land from a jump.  So you'll keep dying on a lot of the jumping challenges because you can't make out where on the Z axis your character is exactly, or which lane your target spot is in.When I first saw this in the store and fired it up, I thought it was some sort of science game.  The kind where kids would play a cute character and learn about gravity, friction, temperature, whatever.  Actually, it's the complete opposite of a science game:  it teaches kids not to explore . . . exploring is not worth the risk, because likely you'll wind up getting electrocuted and have to start the stupid maze all over from the beginning.And here's the final insult:  the game claims that it saves your data \"automatically,\" except that it doesn't, or at least it doesn't do it predictably.  I had serious problems with this.The day I finished this game, I had played it for about 12 hours straight:  straight from, I think, the Serpent Shrine all the way up to the Collector, whom I finally defeated at about 3:00 in the morning.  My games were not saved, even though I went back to the \"Pod\" several times during the course of the day.  After finally defeating the final boss, my save game only showed that I had made it up to the \"Endurance Dojo.\"  Why did it save up to that point but no further?This was definitely not on account of my having shut my PS3 off at the wrong moment:  having experienced this before and having assumed it was owing to some fault of mine, I, after finishing, took great pains to exit using the circle button to get all the way back to your spaceship where it says \"Use Pod Computer\" so that it would definitely save the fact that I had finished the game.But even that wasn't enough to get it to save my game.  There's no way to force a manual save, either.  In short, the creators of this game owe me a completed game file, because I'm sure as heck not going to go through those levels again!  And I need hardly mention that the wankers at Media Molecule won't permit you to use another user's savedata file.  (I currently believe you have to exit to the PS3 and choose \"Quit Game\" for your data to be saved . . . still not sure, though.)Truly the worst game I know of for the Playstation 3.  I didn't have a minute of fun with it.  I regret every moment I spent with it.  I thought I was going to be treated to all sorts of eye candy but was just in a rage the entire time I was playing it.  My poor wife.Lesson learned:  avoid all titles by Media Molecule, or titles for which you can discern that Mark Healey or Alex Evans had a hand in making.  They make games evil on purpose and then market them as though they're for kids.Here's hoping Media Molecule soon goes out of business!  And may 10,000 camels poop on the graves of its programmers!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005AV8W","description":"A dark shadow is spreading over the N64. Count Dracula has once again weakened the seals of his tomb, and the Belmont family is getting anxious.In the latest crusade against the forces of evil, players can choose between two brave vampire-slaying characters. Young Reinhardt Schneider, like his predecessors in the celebrated vampire-hunting Belmont family, will rely primarily on his whip. The other character is Carrie Fernandez, a young woman skilled in the ways of magic and spell-casting. Both are on the hunt for the dreaded Dracula and his devoted legions of vampires. You play a game all the way through with the character you've chosen, concluding with his or her own ending. Each character has an individual route to travel, and to see all of the areas you will have to complete the game using both characters.The passage of time and, especially, the fall of night, play a prominent role in the game. Players will have to search castles filled with dark corners, winding staircases, and other gloomy places. Daytime is the right time for exploring, but be on the lookout for vampires lurking in the shadows.Once the sun goes down, though, you should exercise extreme caution. When night falls, more creatures come out to play, and they become more aggressive as well. Some tasks are impossible to perform unless it is the correct time of day. A clock will allow players to calculate the time and plan their explorations accordingly.Konami has planted many cinematic sequences throughout the game. These scenes are surprisingly creepy, and may make you decide not to pick up your controller at night. Enemy characters are designed to terrify, ranging from the traditional horde of skeletons to half-woman, half-spider mutants. There are some gruesome bosses lurking in the darkness, as well. You will have to defeat Dracula in three different time periods, but don't expect the passage of time to improve his disposition.Reinhardt and Carrie will both have analog control, with different animation sequences for walking, jogging, and running. Reinhardt's whip works on a targeting system. When gruesome enemies are threatening, a green crosshair appears on the screen. If an enemy crawls, slithers, or slides within range of the whip, the target lets you know by turning red. The target automatically hovers over nearby enemies, so once it turns red you are guaranteed of a successful strike.Castlevaniahas 28 different areas to explore and four different special items at your disposal to fight the forces of evil. An eerie soundtrack tops off the package, creating a satisfying game that takes you on a unique adventure through spooky surroundings.","reviewerName":"Soulchild'sA'Comin'","summary":"Spine Chillin' Classic Fun!","reviewText":"The original Castlevania game is one of Konami's cult classics.  Only good Ol' Simon Belmont, the original Vampire Slayer can kick so much monster butt with his trusty whip.  Its also considered Konami's horror answer to The Legend of Zelda, but only on a linear platform.  The immpecable gameplay, superior graphics, fluent controls, and kick-butt Konami soundtrack makes me wonder why I did'nt first play this game when I was younger (oh yeah, because the local Video Store never had it and we could'nt afford to buy every NES title back in the late 80s).  After so many recommendations, I had to get it for myself, but my brother bought it for me before I had the chance to order it.  For those that never played this horror adventure game, let me warn you that its hard.  I never even made it up to Dracula myself (close, but no cigar), but thats why we have unlimited continues.  You really have to strategize and maintain alot of patience as you progress and that strongly applies near the end of the fifth level and all of the sixth level (before you face Dracula).  When you're playing this game, you gotta practice and practice.  I do have 3 main complaints about this game.  I hate it when you get knocked back dramatically each time you get hit, resulting in alot of cheap deaths (this will be a common problem in the future games as well).  Being defenseless on the stairs really sucks too (you can't use your whip while walking up and down).  Those relentless Medusa heads near the end of the fifth level are super annoying and so are their wavy patterns of attack (you're constantly warding them off as you are attacking these bulky knights throwing millions of axes in two directions.  Other than that, its an exciting game and a good challenge (thats why its was rated the 22nd best game made on a Nintendo System).  Don't let my complaints throw you off because I am telling you what to expect before trying this classic out.  Its playable so add it to your NES library if you don't have it.  Its not expensive at all.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00009ZVHR","description":"As action-reporter Jade, use your camera and Dai-Jo staff to capture truth from a deceptive government, and restore freedom from an alien invasion.","reviewerName":"Matthew Warner","summary":"Beyond Good","reviewText":"Remember the first time you saw the movie \"The Fifth Element\"? Remember how cool it was to see what looked like a really entertaining dream you might have had, only it was a film? It's not that there's any one particular part that sticks out and makes it great, but just this almost implacable warmth and giddy sense of fun that flickered across every frame. It seemed like creator Luc Besson was just having fun with it, and it showed up in a way that you simply can't fake.I use that as an example because it's the only way I can really describe the feeling that comes from Beyond Good and Evil: It's the exact same sense of warmth, and it makes you smile just watching this game unfold, even as you're at a loss for words to really describe it. Probably the closest you can come without resorting to obscure comparisons is to say \"This game is really, really cool\" while grinning ear to ear.We just don't have a word for it in English, but maybe the French do. Just like the aforementioned filmmaker, the creator of BG&amp;E (and also the first two \"Rayman\" games) is a Frenchie, Michael Ancel. Whatever cultural viewpoint his place of origin may have lent him, I wish they could bottle it and ship it to U.S. and Japanese game designers, because you just don't see this kind of stuff in other games.This aspect comes through in almost every part of the game. The graphics are excellent and have such a vibrant use of color that it makes almost everything else on the market look bland. Amusingly, the entire game is also letterboxed. Not sure why, but it works.The music is instantly affecting and suits the game perfectly, though the title score does sound an awful lot like the music to \"Princess Mononoke\". No matter, it fits like a glove.Far and away the best aspect to this game, however, is the characters. The characters in BG&amp;E are funny, memorable, and at just the right level of realism to allow you to get attached to them without thinking about it, and this goes from the lead character Jade all the way down the line to the smallest of bit characters. This is so rare in a videogame that I can't stress it enough. The characters don't resort to artificial means of forcing the player to care about them via troubled pasts or secret phobias or the tendency to slip into a blinding rage or anything like that. They just come across as likeably human...Which is sort of remarkable when you factor in that one of them is a talking pig.Yep, in BG&amp;E, there are as many animal people as human people, and you know what? It doesn't detract from the believability of the game in the slightest, in the same way that the fish in \"Finding Nemo\" were able to nab just as much, if not more, emotional attachment than if had they been human. When a created world takes itself seriously, the fact that it doesn't synch up to the real world becomes a benefit; you're even more able to immerse yourself in it, and it becomes that much more entertaining.Here's an example: About 1/6 of the way into the game, the main character, Jade, and her porcine \"uncle\" Pey'j (pronounce it \"page\") come across a boss character and fight it. When Jade wins, the first thing she does is run over to Pey'j and give him a hug, and we're talking a running-leap-into-her-uncle's-arms-cheering hug. It might sound corny, but when you see it, it seems perfectly natural and honestly heartwarming. Most of the time, when something like this is tried in a videogame, it comes across as horribly forced. Not here.However, with all this Good comes a little bit of Evil, and that happens when we address the game itself. Now, don't get me wrong: There's absolutely nothing wrong with the game mechanics. In fact, it plays exactly like a modern-day Zelda game. Where it stumbles is in that there's simply not enough of it to elevate the game from \"excellent\" to \"truly great\".As superb as everything is, the entire game can be finished in under a week, and it's very easy to do everything your first time through. There are 56 animals to take pictures of and 88 pearls (read: item tokens) to get, and I got them all without too much effort my first time through the game. 88 sounds like a lot, and indeed, at first you're only getting one or two at a time, but near the end of the game they start to come in clumps of ten or more, and several of them are awarded as part of the main plot. Likewise with the animals, who have a few parts in the game where they're tricky to find, but nowhere near as involved as similar optional quests from the Zelda games, or even other similar entries in the game genre. Also, beyond the pearl gathering and animal photography, the only other thing to do besides the main plot is a fairly simple (and sort of boring) racing game, which gives you no real rewards beyond the pearls you get as a prize. It doesn't help that the reward you get for getting all the pearls and finding all the animals is pretty lame - a small, tricky mini-game and a very basic catalogue of all the animals you've taken photos of.This, combined with the single, disappointingly vague ending hold the game back from a perfect score - there's next to no replay value, even though the game leaves you wanting so much more.Still, the merits far, far outweigh the problems, which aren't even really problems so much as a lack of more merits that you wish were there. Grab this while you can.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2004"}

The plot is riveting, and some of the maps/actions were taken directly from movies. Like the green flares used to signal that the area was secured and to call off the airstrike (The Rock), or the Russian airborne units infiltrating CONUS (Red Dawn). That is not to say the game was boring or contrived, it was actually very fast paced.The new Special Ops mode increases the replay value, although two players are recommended. The single-player missions were fairly short, but the frame rates were smooth. The overall game felt very polished and refined. The available weapons also increased the fun factor, because there are a lot of new/modern weapons and some oldies.The voice acting was well done, and the cut scenes greatly contributed to the flow of the plot and game. The theme music / background music was appropriate and contributed to a good gaming experience.The modern weapons also augmented the gaming experience, and the plot makes more sense than Black Ops. I felt CoD MW2 was better than Black Ops overall!Realism is not something I'd even consider to describe CoD MW2. It's more of a fun run and gun game. For instance, when the EMP is set off in the game, the electronic red dot sights no longer function (Aimpoint, EOTech, Kobra, etc...) however, the illuminated portion of the Trijicon ACOG no longer lights up. The problem is that in real life, the ACOG TA01 relies on Tritium for the illumination, while the newer issued TA31 utilizes Tritium and a fiber optic collector. In other words, EMP won't have an effect on the ACOG - at all.But overall, CoD MW2 is really good and in my humblest opinion, much better than Black Ops.\"Ramirez, defend Burgertown!\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2010"}

Can't they just slap the same crowd after perfecting it once ?  Sure most of the game is pretty but NBA2K has nearly perfected this by now, not sure why The Show is getting worse with a simple detail like crowd or surrounding stadium area. Played at AT&T; Park a yaught was drawn by crayon, with whitewash over it. A stadium is a still right so why not polish that ONCE in how ever many years this game has been released, I don't get that.There is also not sure what it's called not a smooth flow pitchers arm stops and delayed pitch due to freeze prior to throw for a sec, same with an a cut scene jitterbug with players running by time release.  Before I noticed all this I had to boot up game and delete the files three times, kept freezing, and loading for an eternity.  2 hours later I was able to play my first game.  With all these negatives, the rest of the game is brilliant.The package this game delivers is obnoxious, there is so much to do, as long as you are a baseball fan, preferrably a baseball fan that is also a cool nerd there is so much contant you may never leave the house.  \"Mom, can you bring me a sandwich! I'm in the 7th inning and warming up pitchers no time to go downstairs !\"I've never seen a sports game with this many settings and sliders to adjust if you'd like,you can make this game do what ever you want it to for you.  A baseball junkies favorite toy.  Enjoy.I'd rate it a 8.5, Go Giants !","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}

Mario is associated with quality and New Super Mario Bros. 2 is no different. Does it do anything new? Not really. But what it does do, it does particularly well. Pay no mind to the reviews saying this game deserves 1 star. In no way, shape, or form is this a 1 star game. Even though it's more of the same, quite frankly, it's still a very polished and good playing Mario game. You don't have to excuse Nintendo for its resistance to change, but at least give an honest summation of the game and leave out the hyperbolist drivel.There's not a whole lot to say about New Super Mario Bros. 2 since it's exactly what one would expect from a 2D Mario game. It offers the grassy world, the desert world, etc., while having you collect coins, which brings me to this game's one slight difference from previous Mario's. New Super Mario Bros. 2 puts a very heavy emphasis on coin collecting. On the back of the box it says, \"Can you collect a million coins\", and it means it. Tracking your overall coin total, adding it to a global total of coins collected worldwide, your duty is to get as much gold as possible, which isn't a difficult task given how much you can collect in any given level. For example, I had well over 3,000 coins in under 20 minutes of play, so it's entirely possible to get to a million by playing the entire game, replaying levels, etc.Whether you like the old school Mario ingredients or not, it's irrefutable that this game has the ingredients it takes to make a fun Mario game. Unless you're one who's hell-bent on innovation and can't enjoy the classic plumber's latest platforming adventure, I'd say to jump right in and get to the coin collecting.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2012"}

I finally did and I have to say I don't love them.  I've been trying to really pinpoint why.  I think it's because I liked the story and characters much better in those other games I mentioned but also because so many people have been touting this trilogy as the best RPGs this gen and I thought yeah why not, BioWare RPGs are awesome.  But Mass Effect doesn't really feel like a next gen game to me.  The formula really hasn't evolved much from BioWare's earlier outings.  It feels like more of the same.The original XBox didn't sell that well and I can only assume that a lot of gamers this gen haven't played KOTOR or Jade Empire and that's why they're as impressed with Mass Effect as they are.  Or maybe they did play those old Xbox games and all they really wanted this gen was a graphics bump.  I wanted more.*For those concerned with performance I should mention that Mass Effect on the PS3 skips and stutters like mad.  I wonder if I would of had those same performance issues if I'd gotten it digitally instead.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2014"}

It's a two sided coin, where one side is a sweeping epic adventure where your actions shape the world around you, and the other side is a buggy piece of crap.  You can enjoy this game if you save often in different save slots and try to ignore the characters that get stuck in walls or the occasional quests that can't be completed.  If that's a deal breaker, then you can gladly skip this game.Story:  9/10You're a courier who gets hired to deliver a mysterious package to a big shot in New Vegas.  Unfortunately for you, you get gunned down and left for dead before you can deliver the package.  But in Vegas, fortunes can change in an instant and you're rescued... after they put your face back together.  Once you're revived, you can explore the wasteland.  It's a great blend of the fallout universe and the old west.  There are rival factions, gangs, a host of NPC's fit to compliment every play style, farms, ruins, Las Vegas, and your decisions affect the outcome of just about everyone.You affect the world by taking on quests, and just about all of them force you to make critical decisions about who you will help and who you will betray.  As you play, you'll meet a bunch of interesting characters who can travel with you as companions.  You can have 1 robot and 1 living humanoid with you at all times.  They all have their own back stories and quests as well.Your Character:  9/10When the game begins, you can customize the look and basic skill set of your character.  These skills compliment your play style.  If you want to be stealthy, you can focus on Sneak, Lock Picking, Hacking...  If you want to be persuasive, you can develop your Barter and Speech Skills.  If you want to focus on defense, there are Medical and Survival Skills which give you more health points from using medicine and food.  And of course there are different types of combat:  Guns, Energy Weapons, Explosives, Melee, and Unarmed Combat.  These skills enable you to get through the game just about any way that you want.If you need to kill 2 guys, you can blow them up, shoot them, stab them, convince them to fight each other, poison them, trick them into surrendering...  The choices are yours to make.Whenever you complete a quest, kill a guy, pick a lock, hack a computer, etc... You gain XP.  When you gain enough XP, you go up in level.  Here, you can add skill points to improve your skills and every other level you can add a Perk.  Perks are set skills that help you.  Better Critical Hits, Heal in Sunlight, Carry More Items, Take Less Damage from Radiation, Have a Mysterious Stranger Randomly Help You...The character progression system really allows you to improve your character in every way possible and there are no skill trees, so you don't have to worry about making mistakes.  Once you get a Perk, it is always active.Gameplay:  7/10The gameplay is pretty solid.  You travel, make dialogue decisions, and accomplish mission objectives.  You can do this by shooting, blowing things up, stealth, trickery, or forming alliances with important people.  Once you discover a new area, you can fast travel to it at any time, using your mini-map.Whenever you talk to someone, you get options based on your skills.  So, if some rifraff tries to BS you, you can call them on it.  The more skilled you are, the more dialogue options appear.  For example:  If you have a high Explosives Skill and you're talking to a bomb expert, you can relate to him through your knowledge of explosives and win them over.Combat:  7/10There are many ways to kill your enemies.  If you use guns, you can shoot them in real time.  You can also use the VATS system, which pauses the game and gives you action points and allows you to aim at a body part or weapon of an enemy with strategic benefits.  If someone is running away, you can shoot them in the leg to slow them down.  If you are fighting a giant insect, shooting their antennae confuse them and they attack their allies.  If an enemy is holding a grenade, you can shoot it to blow him up.You can also use grenades, land mines, melee weapons, your fists, and stealth.  You get major bonus damage for attacking an enemy while you are hiding.  You can also reverse pickpocket someone and put a grenade in their pocket.  A few seconds later, they explode.There are two basic kinds of enemies in the game.  Melee enemies who charge you, and missile enemies you shoot at you.  There are also a ton of different damage types.  Energy weapons work well against machines and will occasionally vaporize enemies.  Guns have hollow point ammo for unarmored enemies and armor piercing bullets for armored ones.  Explosives are great at breaking limbs.  Hand to Hand combat is good at knocking enemies down, disarming them, killing them, or crushing their limbs.  In just about every encounter, you'll be making some critical decisions.Hardcore Mode!This makes the game much tougher.  Your health items only give back health over time.  So instead of getting an instant 100HP back, you might get 5HP over 10 seconds, which makes you vulnerable.  You also have to eat, drink, and sleep or suffer stat penalties.  If your companions get killed, they stay dead.  This is pretty rough, but it does make the game feel a bit more realistic.  This can be turned on or off at any time.World:  8/10The world is full of rival factions, mutants, ghouls, military, robots, and people just trying to survive.  Some of the quests are tragic, some are hilarious, some are epic, and some make you think.  And of course, you could just wander around for hours and see what kind of trouble you can get yourself into.Graphics:  8/10The graphics are pretty good for a huge big world type of game.  The art direction blends the 1950's and ruins quite nicely and New Vegas is well done.  The characters look OK, but their animations are a little stiff.Sound:  8/10The soundtrack is pretty good and features Frank Sinatra, epic music, exploration music, etc...  They all set the scene quite nicely.  The sound effects are good and help round out the action.  The dialogue is pretty flat.Bugs:  10/10I had the game crash on a load screen and it wiped out my auto save.  I lost 6 hours of gameplay.  How does this happen in 2010?  The game frequently crashes about every 2-4 hours, so save often and have multiple saves.  You and other characters get stuck on trees, cars, walls, buildings, rocks, etc...  You may be able to \"fast travel\" with your automap if you get stuck outside.  If this happens when you are indoors, you have to restart.  Enemies sometimes turn into a blob of polygons and some quests are broken.  This is the buggiest 360 game that I've played.Replay Value:  10/10There is no multiplayer, but the game is about 60 hours long and there are multiple endings.  You can start over with a new character and play the game over in a whole new way and get different endings.Maturity:  MThere is swearing, sexual situations involving people, ghouls, robots...  gambling, decapitations, dismemberment, blood, etc...  This game is about as wholesome as a trip to Vegas with the Mafia.Overall:  6/10This could have been an 80 hour epic adventure where you control the fate of the world, playing any way you wanted to...  Instead, this is a game where the immersion constantly breaks down as you try to navigate around a minefield of bugs.  For most people, it isn't worth the trouble.Buy it cheap if you like Bethesda Games like Oblivion, Fallout 3, or Skyrim.Buy it cheap if you like the old west feel of Red Dead Redemption.Buy it cheap if you like games that allow you to play creatively.Rent it if you have 60 hours to blow through it... err... you're better off buying it cheap.Avoid this game if you hate crash bugs.Avoid this game if like linear games.Avoid this game if you need good acting.If you liked the shooting, tactical aspects of this game, I recommend Deus Ex.If you liked the open world, I recommend Skyrim, Fallout 3, Red Dead Redemption, and Oblivion.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2012"}

However, after lackluster reviews I opted to wait until I picked it up. Unfortunately, it took this long to finally do so.The gameplay consists of combat and exploration, and I found both to be rather satisfying. The former does allow you to get by in normal difficulty without too much strategy, which in this case I liked perfectly fine since I was playing it mostly for the story.The exploration is extremely fluid, allowing you to quickly and easily move around, as opposed to having to move to just the right spot, or hold the left stick in just the right way.But what I really enjoyed from the game was the story. I had no intention of finishing the game as quickly as I did (over the course of two days, maybe hitting double digit hours), but I had a very hard time putting the game down after completing a chapter. In fact, the only time I was disappointed with the story was at the very end, since I felt the ending was far too abrupt, and expected for there to be an extrended, or true ending if the game was completed on hard (which doesn't appear to be the case).Each of the main characters has personality, something I also got from Heavenly Sword, and by the end of the journey, despite it being so short, I actually felt I had some understanding of each of the characters.In regards to length, while it's true the game is short, it doesn't feel rushed, and there's enough to keep you playing for a little while longer, such as finding collectibles or purchasing the DLC, if you so choose.If you enjoyed the experience that was Heavenly Sword I believe you'd enjoy this experience as well. If the combat appeals to you, I'd also recommend picking up a copy. The climbing/exploration is fairly simple, so if you'd like a complex experience in that regard, or if you want a complex combat system, you'll want to look elsewhere.Overall, I give Enslaved: Odyssey to the West 4 of 5 stars, and I will be going through the game at least one more time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003L51GW2","description":"","reviewerName":"Gordon \"PS3/PC Gamer!\"","summary":"HONEST NO STORY SPOILERS REVIEW","reviewText":"Honestly, I am not sure how to review this game. I'd like to review it upon its own merit, but its a prequel, so comparisons to the other games in the series (most notably Chains of Olympus) are inevitable. We are all PSP owners who most likely have played every game in the excellent series. I scoured the internet and looked up every written review of this game known to man as I desperately waited for my preordered copy to arrive. I was VERY surprised to see that some websites gave this game a 7 out of ten, and I dismissed these sites as the ones who just said \"its the same blades again.\" After finishing the game a mere 4 hours ago, I'll tell you why those scores are justified.To begin, the environments in this game suffer from the same problems as God of War 3 and Killzone 2. They are dull, grey, and dark for the most part. I played through the game just hoping, just waiting for a new environment to dazzle me, but it never really happened. Rocky cliffsides, deserted temples, and firey hell (hades has made an appearance in every game) are everything the environment has to offer. While I don't mind the dullness, its the cramped feel of the entire game that bothers me. I felt like instead of playing through different environments, I was playing from path to path. The problem is, this game was directed by a former lead level designer. I'd expect the level design to be the highlight of the game, but its one of the main problems. The game feels small, cramped and lifeless. There is no \"building in the distance you'll get to later.\" Its a myraid of pathways.As for the magic abilities and weapons, sadly I didn't like any of the new additions. Some if it has to do with the fact that you must press the d-pad to initiate an attack, which may be hard for a split second decision. All of the abilities seem underpowered and lack creativity. I found myself NEVER using magic. I was left with the blades. The same good old blades.....the same blades. In addition, you get a spear and shield combination, which is actually kinda cool. You can block while moving like a true Spartan warrior and throw your spear. Its fun to use against one or two enemies, but against 5 or 6, the blades are much more reliable. One again, I found myself never using the ability unless I was forced to throw my spear at an unreachable enemy or obstruction. The shield was only used in 2 instances against the natural environment. Long story short, this game has the worst magic abilities of any God of War, and the spear was used about as much by me as the spear in God of War 2 was. Almost never.Reguarding the enemies and boss battles, there was some creativity. A new ability giving you the power to ignite your blades is essential against some enemies and obstacles, thus offering a new level of strategy to the fight. Boss battles are few and far between. Of the few, the final battle is the most memorable (obviously), but mainly by default. The final 20 mins of the game are great, and since I was only at the 6 hour mark (10 hours were promised) I was beginning to feel like the story, as well as Kratos' emotions were about to show something completely new, but it all ended 15 minutes later. I won't spoil it, but the final battle brings something new to the series we have never seen, although it was oddly executed. If you know the original, intended ending to God of War 3 (Stig's ending).....then you get the idea. The battle itself was underwhelming as a FINAL battle, but the emotional changes Kratos revealed overshadowed it completely. The other boss battles were completely forgettable.While the series' story is no Metal Gear Solid, Kratos is an angry man on a quest to find his brother. After finding out why he is so angry, you see why he's so angry. Chains of Olympus really helped with that more than the console versions. This game, although it has been renowned for its great story in the reviews, is not much different from the console versions. Its simple and to the point. The bad thing about Ghost of Sparta is that there is little motivation to continue onward, besides knowing that Deimos is still alive. The story is almost too concise and to the point like God of War 2, but as opposed to God of War 2, there aren't tons of environments, boss fights, and cool abilities and magic to discover.The God of War series is absolutely legendary in the gaming world. Its practically synonymous with the Sony PlayStation as a company and is the leader of its genre. This title is a lukewarm effort by Ready At Dawn in my opinion, given their impressive track record. I finished the game in 6 hrs, 20 mins; roughly the same play time as Chains of Olympus for me. Part of me believes that this game was made to fill in a few quick plot holes before ending the series, and another part of me feels like its a final effort to revive the dying PSP. I have no doubt in my mind when I say that this is THE WORST in the series. Chains of Olympus is superior in almost EVERY conceivable way. Ru Weerasuriya should have remained the director after his flawless work on Chains of Olympus.This game is to God of War what Portable Ops was to Metal Gear Solid.I will not just drop 3 stars and leave. I want to be as honest and as helpful as possible. Yes, I see that the 5 other reviewers have 100% helpful reviews and realize that I'm sacrificing my 90% helpful score by going against the norm. I'm here to answer any questions you may have about the game. ANYTHING. Thank you for reading with an open mind and hearing me out.PSN: I-Am-theIRONMANUPDATE NOVEMBER 20th, 2010I finished the game in 3 days, 2 weeks ago. All the challenges, unlocked the vids, costume, EVERYTHING. There are NO incentives to playing the challenges or playing on a harder difficulty because you win nothing for either. If you are a fan like me, you'll play them for the entertainment. Unfortunately, the challenges are so easy its insulting. No need to look at youtube walkthroughs this time around lol, but WARNING: for some reason, whatever setting you have the difficulty on in the combat arena, it will be the difficulty of the challenges. Set combat arena to normal if you wanna breeze through them. The only difficult challenge is the one where you can't get hit once. Those spider things spray green goo at you and kill you instantly!Another disappointment is the lack of any type of Making of featurette. As a matter of fact, there is no videos of Ready At Dawn at all. The game directors live (with preorder) more than makes up for it though. Also, the videos that you purchase with the orbs in the temple of Zeus add NOTHING to the game. In fact, 2 of the 3 reiterate things that were already in the story! In short, those extra videos sucked.For the cheaters, if you want to get a million orbs in 15 minutes, go to the combat arena, select infinite magic and life, and choose 2 minotaurs and a cyclops to fight. Set their attack to off, and MAKE SURE YOU ALLOW THEM TO HAVE INFINITE LIFE AS WELL. When you get to the arena spam the attack you get from Thanatos' daughter. In 15 mins, if you continually hit the left directional button, you'll have a million orbs.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001ABK1LQ","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Playability and Instrument Issues","reviewText":"We have all the iterations of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, as well as some karaoke games. We are both musicians. Here's our review of World Tour after playing it for four months and giving it a thorough workout.First, I'll note that I am reviewing the equipment SEPARATELY since many people are using this game with equipment they already have. With that comment, I'll caveat that part of why we waited 4 months to do a review is because of HORRENDOUS repeated problems with the drums.So, on to the game. The makers of Rock Band and Guitar Hero are in essence \"dueling\" and each coming out with a new game one after the other, borrowing improvements from each other. This latest version of Guitar Hero improves the facial graphics a bit, lets you play stars for star power even if you're already activated, has the audience singing along with you, and has a HUGE amount of character customization available.The game is organized in locations, represented by walls with posters of set-lists on them. If you play all of the posters on a given wall, you unlock special goodies. Some of the gigs require a cash deposit, encouraging you to play other songs to rack up your bank account.There are some simple tutorials, a custom song-making utility, and the usual combination of quick-play and career mode.I always enter each new game with an open mind, and part of why we play these for so long before reviewing them is to ensure we don't down-rate one game just because we'd been playing the other one non-stop for 8 weeks straight previously. Still, here it really did not help.While I like the bonuses for group effort, the whole setup for group play really bothers us. Star power only applies to the person who activates it. This means one person can \"steal\" all the star power, which does not make for band harmony. Also, it means one person can't \"save\" another person! If the drummer is having all sorts of trouble, HE has to somehow manage to hit the combo to activate star power to save himself. If he's in that much trouble, usually the effort will sink him into death. Also, star power keeps draining even if there are long, empty stretches without notes.Some of their \"performance bonuses\" are questionable. As a guitarist I once got a Hot Start bonus (for doing well at the beginning of a song) for hitting just one note.I still lobby for a length bar for the song, so you know how close to the end of it you are. It would be very helpful for songs you're new to.Also, the display for how the group is doing is really awful. It is nearly impossible to look over there and see how your teammates are doing, how the group as a whole is doing, how much star power remains, or anything.I do like the purple lines that connect sequences of notes, encouraging you to hit them all in a row. But to me that's not enough to make up for the other problems.I'm not saying the game is awful - but I'm saying that right now on the market are two competing games - Guitar Hero World Tour and Rock Band 2. Both offer microphone, guitars and drums. Both were \"launched\" by the original Rock Band which was the first game to offer the guitars / singing / drums combo and break that ice. While I think Guitar Hero's franchise has made a valiant effort to enter the arena and ramp up their game to include the other instruments, I still find Rock Band 2 to be far superior in playability.As if to solidify this, we have friends come over occasionally to play with us and usually we pull out Rock Band 1 / 2. This last time someone came over, we pulled out Guitar Hero World Tour for them to play with. Both were musicians who weren't gamers. They had an AWFUL time with this game.If you're new to the music-gaming world, I would recommend going with Rock Band 2 over this game. Between the instrument issues and the gameplay issues, it's simply the better choice.Rating: 3/5","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2009"}

{"product_name":"B002MWSY3O","reviewerName":"Shannon B Davis \"Nepenthe\"","summary":"as a hobbyist dance enthusiast, I love this game.","reviewText":"I am a hobbyist dancer and I LOVE this game.  Now, there's not a lot to it and if they don't have additional songpacks, I'm not sure how long it will hold my attention.  But right now, the time speeds by as I somehow have gotten a real cardio workout in without once checking the clock.  That said, I can see that it's a limited game with a small number of songs, and the price point is about right, lower than most other games.  Overall, I have to encourage game developers to make more games like this, and I am sure that \"Just Dance II\" will have some better features, like the ability to create your own dancer and dress her up.  Basically, if they took some of the ideas from Rock Band, as well as had downloadable content (more songs), the game would be amazing. As it is, it's really fun and I haven't played a dance game before that really just let me dance.  With DDR, it's more like playing Simon with your feet.  In Just Dance, I can bop along, shake my hips, add my own flavor to the moves if I like - and it doesn't get in the way of playing the game.It's a very simple game, in the same vein as Rock Band or Karaoke Revolution, where you can play against yourself or your friends, in challenges with groups of songs, or a quick play with just one. There is a tutorial, but you won't really need it.  The game also has a few variations like \"strike a pose\" (Red Light Green Light).Each song is led by a dancer, appropriate to the style of the music.  The dancer shows how the move is executed, including the flourishes you can choose to add or not.  As the controller can only follow what your hands are doing, you COULD theoretically just move your arms.  However, it's a lot more fun if you wiggle your hips too!  There are also pictograms that show the dance moves.  The pictograms are not good at TEACHING the dance move, but they do serve as a reference to what's coming up next.  A bar representing how many times you were on the beat fills up and keeps track of your score.  If you play multi-player, up to 4 bars fill up.  Each move can be X (the wii didn't pick it up or you missed it), OK (meaning you did it) and GREAT (which seems to mean that you did it with a lot of energy or exactly on the beat.)It isn't clear to me but you may be able to unlock songs.What I really like about it:The game is easy to play.  The game does rate how well you execute the moves, but it doesn't seem to fail you out if you make too many mistakes.  I can't quite figure out how the engine works, how the controller has to be positioned to make a move show up.  My advice is to \"just dance\" - don't let the mechanics stop you from working up a sweat and having a great time.The music is fantastic.  It's a wide range from 80s, hip hop, dancehall, dance, pop and disco.  I recognized most of the songs.  The variety of songs makes it a good family game, linking generations.What I don't like:It's a stretch to say I don't like this but I would love it if there was a true tutorial showing/explaining some of the movements.  Between the pictograms and the animated person, it can be difficult to see the moves.  Likewise, being able to see the dancer from different angles would be great.Overall, I don't like that I don't understand what I need to do to score, why the same movement is sometimes \"GREAT\" and sometimes \"X\".  But the game doesn't penalize you very much for failing, so I don't really let it get in the way of my fun when I make a lot of mistakes.  There isn't a lot of feedback on what you did wrong.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Jarrett P. Suhr \"naraku junior\"","summary":"A fun game and challeging how to beat it","reviewText":"It me again Slagar the cruel. I thought I would give some pointers on how to beat bosses of kingdoom of heartrs II faster and more efficiently. I love this game when it came out 2 or so years ago. For those of you bold enough to try this game on proud mode or any other difficult setting which I guess is an easter egg unlocked my doing normal or hard mode. Here is some tips for killed that annoying boss from the second act (second trip) to Point royal. As long as the boss is hold or touching any of the cursed medalions he is invulerable and blows won't hurt him. The best way to get him to drop coins is to either hit him with his own lance like weapons or blast him with what ever current form of the lightning spell you have. Pick up the coins and return them to the chest. If you are doing this one Proud mode or just wanting a fast battle this helps alot. I also recommend you use the Trinity limit attack as much as possible when at close enough rage and boss coin display reads zero. Depending on what version of the staff donald weaponj is using (shield for goffy) may determine the effectiveness of the attack combo. Also some times its better to over heal rather than to risk having to due the fight over again I suggest you do it when at half health or less. You gain the trinity limit by either leavel up goofy or donald or it is one of the abilities gained from defeating one of the previous bosses. (I will double check on that later) I an not sure about Donald but the guy changed out goffies default shield with on of his stronger ones before coming back I belive it was called likee the guard shield or the save the Queen Shield. (I'm not sure if you can get this super strong shield for Gof at this point in the game).  The shield that was used lies in one of chests in Mulan's world. You can get it out of a chest in the Emperor's throne room after defeating the dragon heartless on the second visit to Mulan's world. Use Goffy trinty attack combine with your own weapons and less than about 50 hits will bring done this boss I belive I was about 35 hits was the bosses resistance with the trinity limit. I did not include magic attacks used to make to monster drop the coins those I did not count because they don't deplete the health bars until he's vulerable again. Trinties are multy hit attacks they can do massive to decent damage if used right to each bar of health.  When you have a boss like in this game that has 1 to 9 bars of healthy depending on how far your are it makes it easier on you. I know that does not sound that efifcetive but it is. This boss is called the Grim Reaper Heartless. He has 790 hights points when you fight him the second time. You have to fight him also about midway way through the game but he only has about 1/5 to 1/2 That a lot of health for a boss that about 5.2 time what Sarro has in the first game if you do not play the game fairly and use the extend hit points cheats and about double what he had in Chain of Memories which made the game way to easy until you got to Dragon Malificent. I hope this is helpfull sorry if I am miss using your website but I don't have a you tube account so I can't put this information on the actual page which would be  alot more convient.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2008"}

Roman","summary":"Well, it's another Soul Calibur game. Nothing else.","reviewText":"I've played each major console Soul Calibur game to date, and at this point, I'm kinda done with the series. It really feels like I'm playing the same exact game, over and over with a new character here and there, and spruced up graphics as the systems go on. There are just two reasons why I bought this one in the first place- it was cheap, and I wanted to see how nice Ivy looked on a current generation console. Isn't that terrible? Hey, at least I'm being honest here. I've always been more of a Guilty Gear and Street Fighter player. SC never got ahold of me, despite consistently being a gorgeous game series and using weapons instead of hand to hand combat.If you haven't played a SC game before, it's just a 3D weapons-based fighting game. You can move around your opponent, win via Ring Outs and...man, that's really it. For the gameplay, the game is fun if you're playing casually or with a bunch of friends taking turns. SC has never been much of a competitive game, especially considering that most people use the term 'button masher' at some point when describing it. And that's completely true- anyone can beat the game or another person if they just randomly hit buttons. To this day, I don't know how to do Mitsurugi's better moves, but doing standard attacks and grabs seems to get me on to the next round just fine. The characters aren't that balanced either, and you'll rarely see anyone using a good 70% of the roster. And they went and did the tie-in for The Force Unleashed, throwing The Apprentice and Darth Vader in here. Vader is weird to play as, and can use some Force powers, but plays like an SC character. The Apprentice however, is very cheap and definitely overpowered. He could've been the final boss in the main game modes and aside from not fitting in with the SC world, it would've been a good battle.So what's new with SC4? Not much. You can play online- always cool for fighting games, but depending on your connection there could be lag, and that always kills the fun unless you master the timing (yes, some people actually do that). There's a Tower of Souls mode, very similar to the modes in pervious SC games that gets you money to unlock more items and weapons, and offers some real challenge, like beating 3 enemies in a row via Ring Out, or switching to your partner instead of wasting everyone with just one character. The main thing I like is the Create a Character mode. There are tons of clothes, armor, accessories and everything to help make a truly unique character of your own. If you want your guy to wear pants on his head, go for it- you can do it here. There's also downloadable content like Christmas outfits and of course for the ps3 version here- Yoda. You have to pay more than you should for him, and he's such a cheap character that people will just get mad if you use him, but if you want all the characters, you'll need him. Also, you can now break armor and weapons, and get a kind of instant kill attack. Should you keep blocking attacks, your armor will break (not that some characters have much armor to begin with). It's a nice addition but it didn't happen enough when I was playing to affect gameplay. Lastly, I have to give them some credit for the new character that fights with both a spear and a short sword. I love playing as lancers in any game, and it was good to see a lovely lady representing the class finally. 'turns out that she's one of the better characters too.Visually, the SC4 continues the tradition of looking incredible. Animations are smooth and never jerky, and they've gotten better on rendering things like hair and cloth. The music is generic, and I never paid much attention to it, but the voices match their characters well in both Japanese and English, for the most part.Really, most of my negative comments aren't that negative. It's just that the series desperately needs something new. If you haven't played a game in the series, you might like it more than someone like me did. SC4 is great to look at, even with it being an older game now, but if you want a deeper or just plain more memorable fighting experience on the ps3, go for Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo or BlazBlue.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"drqshadow","summary":"A Change is Sometimes for the Best","reviewText":"In some ways, a classic video game series is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, developers are carrying on a tradition, a legacy. They've earned thousands (dare I say millions?) of devoted fans, and their names will almost assuredly be carved deep into the halls of video game history. Their work will go out into a remarkable number of homes, almost immediately after release. But, by that same token, each individual follow-up title is met with ridiculous scrutiny and astronomical expectations. No longer are these developers and programmers merely entertaining the public, they're toying with electronic mythology. It's all black and white, they're either delivering \"the best title since..\" or they're raping their own legacy. Rarely will a highly anticipated sequel be met by a lukewarm response from fans of the series, they'll either love it or they'll hate it. And, for the most part, a major change to the status quo is viewed as a bad thing.So it should come as no surprise that many long time fans of the series were immediately turned off when early screens of Link on the GameCube, digitally rendered in all his glory, were replaced by a childlike, cartoony new appearance. When Miyamoto and the rest of the team trashed those old renders and went in an entirely new direction, fans felt alienated. Betrayed. I should know, I counted myself among them.Within the first three minutes, my worries were washed aside. Graphically, this is as much of a leap forward from \"The Ocarina of Time\" and \"Majora's Mask\" as those revolutionary titles were from \"A Link to the Past.\" It's still filled with the same great gameplay experience you grew to love on the NES, SNES and N64, yet it's pleasantly a beast unto itself. Truly, this was the right step for the masters behind the Zelda series to have taken.The gameplay is a near-flawless translation of the system broken in by the N64 titles, at the same time benefiting from the modifications made to the GameCube's controller. Where the N64 controller offered four directional \"C\" buttons (which were used to activate items in your inventory), the GameCube offers a second analog stick, labeled the \"C stick\", which is used to control the camera angle. Items are now activated through the use of the X, Y and Z buttons, a layout which requires some minor adjustment due to the \"Z\" button's location, away from the other two. Assaults are performed with the \"B\" button, and various actions are all done with \"A\". Players may lock onto enemies with \"L\", and the \"R\" buttons gets Link down on his belly and enables him to parry attacks with his shield.Though the system remains magnificent, there remain two fairly glaring problems with this layout. For one, the player still cannot control if and when Link jumps or climbs. This particular flaw becomes critical when navigating small ledges or attempting to scale relatively short walls, as the little man on the screen will occasionally choose to plummet to his doom without a moment's notice. I've nearly lost my mind, standing in front of a three foot wall that my character simply refused to climb. The second problem I had was with the camera control. In \"The Wind Waker,\" pulling back the camera also lifts it skyward. So, if I want a wider view of my surroundings, I also lose a lot of my range of vision and must maneuver Link from above. Needless to say, this is not ideal.My largest gripe with this new Zelda lies in its sound. As a next-gen system running custom DVDs, the GameCube has more than enough room to allow for high quality, dolby-style audio tracks. This system should be pumping out better sounding tracks than your average CD, as evidenced by the tight ambient soundtrack of Metroid Prime. Instead, Zelda falls back on the same old MIDI-sounding synth score we endured on the N64. Many of the songs are exactly the same as heard on \"Ocarina\", with only a few slight tweaks and modifications, which is an undeniable no-no for a title of this magnitude. Imagine if the Ocarina of Time had shipped with the same screeches and dings heard on the NES original.As far as graphics are concerned... I've seen cel shading done well in the past, but absolutely nothing can hold a torch to what's been accomplished with \"The Wind Waker.\" Everything has been accounted for, from the big picture to the tiny details. Afterthoughts such as the water bursting off the front of your boat and tiny clouds of dust kicking up beneath your feet on a beach are attended to with uncanny attention to detail. When your character climbs from the water, he'll drip dry for the next few minutes. A monstrous enemy resembling a warthog marches through several dungeons on his hind legs. His lower lip juts out, flapping in the wind, and individual bits of saliva sail through the air with his every move. It's incredible. There are more frames of animation in that enemy's lip than in all of the original Zelda. Taking this game in is more than just an experience. It's a revelation.As one package, this is an unbelievable game. If it weren't for the mild, yet necessary tweaks required of the controls and the sore lack of acceptable music and audio, I might be tempted to call this perfect. As is, the remainder of the game is good enough to account for the inexcusable audio and then some. The storyline is utterly enveloping, while the gameplay is everything you'd expect. The Wind Waker is a tremendous step for the GameCube, reaffirming Nintendo's place in the industry and capturing the imaginations of anyone willing to give it a chance. Don't let your preconceived notions about the shift in visual style fool you, this belongs in your collection right alongside the other titles in the legendary series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2003"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J6DC","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Cooper","summary":"Raise that 7.5 to an 8.9! And Let Me Tell You Why....","reviewText":"Not every game can garner a perfect score, and not every game should.  However, when a company like Mercury Steam receives less praise than its efforts demand I am COMPELLED to offset the press. Like a film paying homage to a legendary director, Castlevania strives to create a unique identity by interweaving radically new concepts within the scope of the genre's hardest hitting greats.  Lords of Shadow may not be the Castlevania we expected, but it is undeniably a labor of love.  So raise that 7.5 to an 8.9, and let me tell you why!FIRST...THE NEGATIVES:-Facial Expressions are minimal, lip synch is decent but not perfect.-Chupacabra sections seem forced. Chupacabras remove all powers and artifacts and tell you to find them and recover what you lost.  Seems detrimental to the storyline in that the little bastards can take away all the powers even the Dark Lords cannot.  \"Yoda\" style voicework is annoying at best.-Zobek (Patrick Stewart) narrative sections are necessary within the separate level construct, but seem somewhat overacted.-The character transformation of Gabriel is clearly stated in the scripted text but is not quite believable within the gameplay or video sequences.THE POSITIVES:+Art Direction is Outstanding.  There are LOTS of different enemies, a HUGE assortment of bosses (only one minor boss is repeated), and PHENOMENAL background detail within levels.  It seems to push the PS3 graphics engine to the limit (Not quite as polished/smooth as less detailed levels in games like God of War).+Music is Original, Epic, and Varied.  Always works well within the context of the environment.  Orchestral score easily blends with gothic atmosphere of game.+Combat is Intense and Requires Strategy.  Several reviewers playing on the easiest settings seem to have prematurely dismissed Castlevania:LOS as yet another hack-and-slash. However, upping the difficulty reveals a subtle level of complexity and variety not usually found in the action/adventure genre.  Each battle requires you to carefully execute a combination of DIFFERENT moves without being hit to refill your magic gauge.  Your magic gauge then refills your health IF and only IF you can land successful hits within different combo techniques.  There are rarely any health fountains, and you are forced to regain your own health through combat.  A button masher game???  Maybe if you play on Ninja Dog.  I utilized almost every different combo throughout each fight and had to learn each boss to proceed.  Combat system is almost as rewarding as Demons Souls if you play on a hard enough setting.+Only a few Chupacabra scenes which are over relatively quickly (Mercury Steam- TAKE THEM OUT OF THE SEQUEL!!)+Sound Production/Effects are Top Notch.  Belmont's whip has a truly distinct feel and every magic power/combo feels powerful and unique.+Using the Whip feels remarkably different than any weapon in other action games.  Platforming using the chain whip is a fantastic and surprisingly well-realized combination. (Consider Indiana Jones stuck in a dark fantasy novel)+Quick time events utilizing a dual-overlapping sphere method (press any button when they overlap) is a HUGE improvement over God of War quick time events.  All finisher events can be seen as they are executed.  Player's attention can be focused on the entire screen when executing these buttons.  Reaction time is tested over button familiarity.+Every enemy has a background story that fits within the setting of the story.  Almost all enemies are extremely fun to fight, require different strategies and are interesting to read about.+Extras include a TON of artwork broken down into each level.+Storyline is strong and does not borrow directly from any other games.  Epilogue truly sets apart Castlevania as unique and places the reasons for the story into context.+Physics system is excellent.  Camera is fixed but works very well.  Other press reviews have stated the camera can be problematic.  I found it to be no worse than any other action adventure title out there on par with the fixed camera God of War series.  Fixed camera sections for Titans are a HUGE improvement upon the constantly readjusting camera on Shadow of the Colossus.+Replayability is high due to levels being divided into short stages, and upgrades being scattered similar to Metroid upgrades (must return after gaining new powers).  Each stage offers a specific challenge.+Polished game with little to no bugs+Puzzles never feel forced.  With the exception of magic infused rune puzzles, the majority are very well executed. A few puzzles later in the game are actually quite brilliant!  As a sidenote, the game always lets you choose to purchase the answer to the puzzle with earned experience points.  Why is this a negative on IGN/Gamespot reviews?  If the player ever becomes stuck, you could just look up the answer online anyway.  I don't believe a game should be criticized because it knows that if you aren't smart enough to find the answer you will still want to proceed.  In addition, I never found any puzzle that required me to use a skill I hadn't used in 5 hours (as a review stated).  This is probably because the reviewer was playing on easy and never had to use any other combos like somebody playing on normal or hard settings.So why did this game not achieve a higher score?  I think that in part it has to do with bias towards the shift from a 2d series.  This may not feel like other Castlevania games, but I can tell you that the atmosphere truly carries over even if the gameplay does not.  I believe this game has an identity all its own.  It borrows from other games, but only in an effort to pay homage and to improve upon what is already great.  Mercury Steam truly deserves recognition for the work they put into this title.  The ending sequence for the 2nd Lord of Shadows has more action than a run away mine cart.  (Check out \"the Devil's Mine Ride\" on youtube for my analogy)A few minor issues prevent this game from rising into the elite 9.0+ scoring bracket.  However, compared to the other 7.5 games out there, Castlevania TRULY outshines the competition.  It may not be a 10/10, but decide for yourself if it deserves at least the 8.9 I would give.  Playing a game is supposed to be fun, and that is exactly what this game does right.  (8.9/10)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2010"}

(Edited)","reviewText":"Remember Me is like taking out a very beautiful girl and realizing that's all there is to her.  The music is a triumph... an eclectic fusion of electronica and classical.  The environment of Neo-Paris is gorgeous in its very depressing way... a detailed environment that, despite the spectre of death everywhere, is teeming with life.But the play's the thing.You'll have a hard time finding someone who won't agree that the platforming is oversimplified and there's way too much hand-holding.  Mind you, nothing is less fun in a game than not knowing where you're supposed to go, so I get that.  But the guidance needs to be in the form of hints, not a \"HEY, STUPID!  JUMP OVER HERE!\"The combat system simply isn't much fun.  Yes, it's more complex than a simple button-masher, but... you get right down to it, there's not a whole lot more than button-mashing.  Remember Me fails where games like DMC succeed because DMC had a wide range of weaponry and upgrades to keep things hopping.  Remember Me is dodge, dodge, square square square, dodge, triangle  square square, dodge, dodge.... rinse and repeat until it allows you to leave.  It's like a boring and possessive girlfriend.Finally, and there is NO forgiveness for this, was the glitch.  I encountered a glitch where I could not advance no matter how many different ways I loaded the game.  I wasted 45 minutes replaying (cut-scenes and all) the scenes to try and advance, and it wasn't happening.  At this point in the life of the PS3, there's no excuse for such crummy coding.So, although I probably would have persevered just to look at the pretty graphics and hear the music, I give up.  It's not worth re-downloading it.  Kudos to those who really found something to love in this game, but it was a sub-par experience for me.EDIT: Okay, I bit the bullet, re-downloaded it and finished it.  So, I think I was *sort* of harsh on it overall.  The story was satisfying.  While I stand by my comments about the combat system, I would add that the melee combat is really nothing more than a way of charging up your special abilities, which you need to know because there are some enemies that will only go down if you use a particular one (at the very least, using the special abilities will cut down the amount of combat time).There is also a firearm weapon that adds a bit to it.  Still, I was able to complete the entire game using the same three button combo to keep my health up and charge my weapons, so the combat system is pretty shallow.But all in all, I'm glad I finished and would recommend it if you can get it on the cheap.  It's not the best game out there, but it's got enough that makes it unique to justify one playthrough.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2014"}

{"product_name":"B000R37S78","description":"More Information Coming Soon.","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"A very good SRPG, but lacks depth ~","reviewText":"I feel that it would be unfair to compare this game to Final Fantasy Tactics, mainly because FFT is the better SRPG.  This is mainly due to the deep customization of the various jobs in FFT.  While you do have some customization in Jeanne d'Arc, it is pretty up front and does not allow for the intense tweaking you get in FFT, nor the necessity of hundreds of level grinding optional battles in FFT.This game reminds me a LOT of Vandal Hearts.  Which is a good thing!  There is very little in this game that you don't know before doing.  Let me explain.  You get to see the battle layout before you add your units.  You get to see the hit % and damage # estimate before attacking, as well as the counter hit % and damage # estimate from your opponent as well.  This means very rarely do you take an action without knowing what will happen.  And pretty much everyone (except archers) will counter, very much like Vandal Hearts.  Even the more colorful stage settings remind me of the art in Vandal Hearts.  Just no blood fountains on kills...The game is pretty easy.  Not to say you won't see the game over screen a lot.  But it seems that the AI is rather cheap in this game and when you do end up with a game over, it's not usually a total defeat, but something you failed to accomplish.  For example, in one stage I was fighting some baddies and the terms to lose were if Jeanne died.  So I was careful and was just pounding the baddies into submission.  Then come to find out the cheap enemy commander targeted Jeanne, despite another character with less hp with their back exposed.  Then the two mages moved in and both hit her with a fireball.  Game over.  So next time I just held her a bit further back.  Easy win.A reason this game seems to be easy is that you often seem to be 1 - 4 levels ahead of the enemies.  This is especially true if you like to engage in periodic optional battles.  It's the bonus XP after the battle that really gets everyone leveled quickly.  I found that most characters gained at least one, but often two levels per battle.  And I also found it unnecessary to purchase skills, since they are frequent drops.  I never really lacked gold and found that I could easily upgrade my weapons and armor without breaking the bank.Now onto the good.  This is a gorgeous game.  Absolutely some of the best graphics on a portable I've seen to date.  The CG cutscenes are a nice addition as well.  Voice acting is very good with a lot of forethought.  Actors affect English or French accents very well (who knows, they might actually be French and British!).  I have found only a few other games with superior voice acting in the British style (Dragon Quest 8, FF12).  Though there is not a lot of spoken dialogue, it's nice when it comes across.The game is fun, despite the average difficulty and the sometimes cheap AI.  Even when getting a game over, you don't really find that you have too much to repeat.  There aren't character classes per se, but each character does have a tendency towards a particular style of fighting.  Each character is actually named and has an impact on the story, so no faceless recruits (ala FFT), but this also means that you really don't get to choose who you have in your army.  And most battles max out at 5 heroes for your side.  Each character has a particular weapon they are proficient with and that determines what offensive skills they use.The story is a twist on the Joan of Arc history.  She is going up against the boy King Henry VI and the Duke of Burgundy, but in this alternate history, the King has been possessed and has made a pact with demons.  So you will fight English officers, but also orcs and lizards, and all sorts of weird monsters.Should you buy this game?  Yes.  I think that Final Fantasy Tactics and Disgaea are overall better games, but they are all three among the best PSP isometric Tactical SRPGs.  You could also add Tactics Ogre and Gungnir into the mix as well.  I'm glad I got this game when it hit $9.99 new.  Otherwise I might have been slightly disappointed, since I got Tactics Ogre and FFT for the same price (yes I know they are remakes - but they are great remakes).  For an interesting 15 - 20 hour SRPG this is a worthy purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2012"}

After you are in the mafia, you raise from the ranks to become a feared mafia leader. You start up driving people and, once you go high enough up the ranks, you start stealing cars, eliminating enemy mafias, blowing up cars, and kill gang members.There is a cinematic in the beginning and end of EVERY mission. These cinematics describe the story line that is not shown during gameplay, such as the private lives of the main characters, feelings they have, and the such.The graphics in this game are unbelievable! The game takes on an advanced graphics engine, the freedom to go everywhere and do whatever you want, and even generate random scenes of theft, robbery, and destruction within the world of the character. This brings me to my first downside to the game. BECAUSE the graphics are so good, and BECAUSE the world is so interactive, this game requires a heavy PC. The game recommends 733mhz CPU and 32mb video card, 256mb of ram. I have an 1.1ghz athlon, radeon 8500 64mb, and 256 sdram, and it barely cuts it. I am running at 800X600 and it skips, begins to be choppy, and will even just pause for a matter of minutes until the game revives again.

There are some strange transisions from song to song, but besides that, the music and the sound effects are excellent.The replay value is nice, but then again, there are no alternative endings or paths to take.Another problem is that the game is DIFFICULT. You should expect to be on this game for a long time, for this game has one of the most respectively long and detailed single player games ever, and the missions are hard, and require skill, thinking, and trying over and over again!There will be a patch for multiplayer soon, and that should bring excitement as well! There will be deathmatch, capture the flag, and all sorts of unique games like racing, and other games requiring cars. Expect to see many families (aka CLANS) against one another, and to see real virtual mafia action just like the 30s!This game looks promising.

The characters never impressed.The graphics are great--sometimes too great.  The gore is excessive in some plays, but I guess it's appropriate given that you're mutilating zombies with an array of insane weapons.

It feels and plays more like the jungle level of the new GoldenEye. Between looks, action, guns, and overall feel it more closely resembles a much more expanded  version of that. Which is awesome. On a side note, animal lovers beware: you spend a good portion of the game hunting animals for their skins. Overall I'm enjoying it and am ready to log more hours. Good game, glad I purchased it. Also it has a huge co-op mode and online versus mode so if you're looking for competition it's there as well.Post EditOk so after logging close to 30 hours now I gotta say that I'm hooked. It is definitely not \"Skyrim with guns\". It is reminiscent of the new Goldeneye and GTA. Now after you liberate the islands and decide to go all treasure hunter looking for relics it starts to feel like Pitfall. I haven't even started the mini-games and side missions yet. You do reach a point later in the game which feels vastly different from when you started. At the beginning you get that vulnerable feeling. But later on in the game you unlock the absolute mother of weapon caches and new skills and you're pretty much untouchable. At that point, the islands are your personal playground. Unfortunately the challenge becomes slightly removed at that point but the action doesn't stop. If you don't have this game, get it. You're missing out if you haven't played yet.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2013"}

Slow paced exploration of haunting mansions, plenty of weapon selections, (rpgs + zombies = fun), and ton of levels, great learning curve. Capcom takes you through 3 previous RE games, and if you've never played RE before, they give you a run-through of each game's story.But on the flip side, the missions are so SHORT! On average, each level takes 10-15 minutes to complete, so it's real dumb when there's only 20ish levels.

The Zapper comes withLink's Crossbow Training, which helps to familiarize the player with the Zapper in a shooting gallery style game.Link's Crossbow Trainingcontains three game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger.Features:Target Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.Defender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look.

The 27 levels will go by fast and if you combo your shots you should be medalling fairly quickly which means that it is technically only about an hour and 1/2 of gameplay till the end, but there are boss battles and free roaming sections on the levels that make it feel like more than some software designed to get gamers used to the Zapper and its mechanics.  The instructions are clear and should be read to put it together properly as the cord just fits into the handle, the nunchuck cord does wrap around the handle at the top which will annoy those with BIG hands.  I tried it out with COD 3 and RES EV4 and if you can get your index finger on the A button and shoot with your middle finger both are playable but the vehicle/ combat levels in COD3 make it essentially unplayable with this setup same goes for Metroid 3.  I can't wait to get my hands on copies of MEDAL OF HONOR HEROES 2-GHOST SQUAD-UMBRELLA CHRONICLES to get some shooting action in that is specifically designed for the zapper, until then I will keep shooting up the landscape in Links terrific if somewhat short pack in game and dream about a COD4 zapper adaptation.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2007"}

AndSonic Adventure, with its light-speed gameplay, is sure to wow even the most jaded gamer.It's amazing that such a small machine (it's about the size of your mouse pad) can deliver such incredible performance. Chalk it up to superior engineering. Dreamcast's only downside is that it comes with only one controller and a demo disc. In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit. Getting one or more extra controllers is also a good idea, because some of the best Dreamcast games support up to four players at once.Why it's so cool:Ultramodern components:Custom-made video, audio, and processor technology blows away the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation and puts Dreamcast in the same league as PS2 and XBox.Integrated modem:In another video-game first, Dreamcast comes with a 56K modem. Use your regular Internet service provider and the separately sold keyboard to access e-mail, shopping, and the World Wide Web. Not only can you upload high scores, participate in chat discussions, and download updates and enhancements for your games, but, through a membership to the SegaNet Internet service provider, you can playQuake III Arena,NFL 2K1, and other games against Dreamcast owners over the Internet.The Visual Memory Unit (VMU):More than just a memory card, the VMU is a miniature portable game system that fits inside a controller--so its LCD screen is easily seen by you but hidden from your opponent.All-in-one entertainment:It plays games. It plays audio CDs. It connects to the Internet and lets you browse the Web or e-mail friends.

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind.

They were a little higher priced, but instant satisfaction won out this time).In reality, I'd very much prefer to be using my nice Turtle Beach PX5 headset, but it requires use of a cable that Turtle Beach is currently out of stock on (at the time I'm writing this quick review), and which is not currently available at fine retailers like Amazon :(  Hopefully that cable will be available very soon, and even more hopefully, Sony will get things together and get support for other Bluetooth devices going soon so that I can use that headset without a cable.  Meanwhile, quick researching and comments online from friends let me know that this Turtle Beach headset (the Turtle Beach Ear Force P4C) is available now, and can be used, so off I went to get one.This headset (headphone/microphone set) is nice, but not without a few small annoyances.First up, when you connect this headset to your PS4 controller, it leaves a small bit of the metal connector sticking out (between the controller and the encased in plastic/rubber portion of the cable that connects this communicator to your PS4 controller).  One is left to wonder a bit if the connection has been completed.  That's some what inexcusable to me.  It should seat snugly but not be too difficult to push this connector into place.  The fault for that issue could be entirely Sony's, but it leaves me wondering if perhaps Turtle Beach just skimped a little on the rubber/plastic around the connector.Second, this headset is made primarily of plastic.  I can hear it making it noise because of that when I turn me head a bit as the plastic stresses a little.  It is highly adjustable, and seems comfortable enough, but it is not as solid it appears to be from the picture images.  There's actually a ring around the inside of the rubber &#34;cup&#34; that goes around the area where the speaker (headphone) is.  The headphone portion itself is seemingly about the same caliber that the cheap headphones that used to shipped with Xbox 360 systems is, that is to say it really doesn't seem all that special.  With that ring between the two pieces, it just seems to be yet another area where dust can collect, and with it not covered in fabrics the way that a nice pair of headphones might be, it seems that the exposure to the foam covering over the speaker in the headphone is destined to deteriorate with time and age.This is an adequate solution for now, but one would really hope that over time Sony's support of what myself and others might call higher-end third party accessories for the PS4 would improve.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2013"}

Within the first two steps you take with him, his swagger alone tells you, \"This dude is a badass.\" I have to admit that I was skeptical of the character throughout the first few missions. I was afraid he was going to turn into this cliched, bland, brainless, trigger-happy cowboy. But as the story begas to take shape, and more was revealed about Marston's history and motivations, I found (much to my relief) that this was not the case. Marston definitely grew on me, and I became emotionally invested in his character and many of the other characters encountered in the game.The game is huge, and the amount of land to explore can be overwhelming at times. Marston's adventures will take you across many landscapes iconic of the West: deserts, canyons, plains, chaparral, woodland, swamps, and even mountainous alpine forests. Luckily if you need to travel across great distances quickly, the game has convenient ways to do so, such as hiring a stagecoach as a taxi. The environments are some of the most beautiful I have seen in a game, although there are some minor graphical glitches that can sometimes disrupt the feeling of immersion, but overall the visuals are wonderful and breathtaking. It is exciting to just hop on a horse and go explore, but the real meat of the game is in the main story.The main story is quite good and follow John Marston on his path to redemption and quest for a clean slate and a new life, as the title suggests. I will not go into further detail, but will say that the story is exciting, and although cliched at times, is original enough to stand on its own and make a lasting impression.My only real gripes with the game are its occasional glitchiness and the horses. Sometimes there are weird glitches that can cause you to have to restart a mission (ex: once when clearing out a gang hideout, there was an invisible gang member who I could see on the map, but not in person and could not shoot) or may freeze a character (I once lassoed a bounty target who froze in an upright position. I could not pick him up or untie him, so I had to shoot him and take the reduced bounty reward). Luckily, in my experience, the main story was free of any game de-railing glitches. Then there's the horses. First, I should say that the horses are animated beautifully with impressive detail (the muscles are awesome). However, they want to hop fences way too much. It can be difficult to maneuver sometimes around fences, especially on a crowded road or while being attacked by a wolf pack, when your horse keeps trying to hop it. Also, if you leave a horse near a cliff, sometimes it will just walk off and fall to its death when it tries to follow you. Could we have given these horses some better survival instincts? I must say the Red Dead horses are quite disappointing given the standard set by Agro, the horse from Shadow of the Colossus.Despite these issues, Red Dead is still a great game. It is a lot of content packed into one disc - just the online multiplayer functions could have almost stood alone as its own game. John Marston is quite the charmer and will easily win you over, and will stay with you even beyond the shattering conclusion of the story.\"As long as there are guns and money, there won't be no peace.\"-John Marston","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2010"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game.

On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

I am currently playing Mario DS and literally become lost in it when I play.  It is truly the first time I have felt like I am playing a real 3D console video game on the road.That being said, I am stunned that Nintendo would release the first true 3D mobile gaming machine, yet not have an analog controller.  That is like buying an HDTV that is black and white..it makes no sense.  You simply cannot control effectively a character in a 3D environment with a digital control pad.  To their credit, the designers allow you to user a thumb \"mouse\" on the touch screen to move the characters and this does sort of constitute analog movement.  But it still is a bit inexact (yet very fun).  Here are two suggestions to overcome this big issue (and believe me, once more 3D games are released, the lack of an analog stick will be a huge burdon..just try playing your PS2 games with the digital pad)1. Build an add-on analog stick to attach to the digital pad.  The pad has a circle in the middle that could be used as a guide.  This would have to work perfectly or Nintendo would blow any chance of it being accepted.2. Create a \"virtual\" analog stick on the touch screen.  Have it look 3D and move according to your thumb movement.  If calibrated just right, this could be revolutionary.  The entire set-up should be intuitive and would overcome the flatness of the screen.Overall a great system!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2004"}

{"product_name":"B004FUI84G","description":"","reviewerName":"James Donnelly \"Ave Atque Vale\"","summary":"Familiar Gameplay, but Just as Addictive!","reviewText":"I honestly can't remember which came first, the first PROTOTYPE or the first INFAMOUS. The games are similar in nature: The protagonist is the victim of a strange type of biological restructuring that gives them strange new abilities. The advantage of INFAMOUS and its sequel over PROTOTYPE is that you as the player have the ability to influence the actions of the character to be used more for good or ill that will have an effect on certain storylines in the game. The advantage that PROTOTYPE has over INFAMOUS is that it's a much less cartoony and a much more complex and mature story, other than the other obvious advantage of it being available for both major gaming platforms.Now, they say that familiarity breeds contempt, and that might have been the case with PROTOTYPE 2 if the gameplay and the story weren't so darn addictive. In the first game, we had as our anti-hero protagonist and cool-jacket-and-hoodie-wearing Alex Mercer, a scientist for an eeeeevil corporation called GenTek. He looses a virus that turns the majority of Manhattan into mindless mutant killers. His motives seemed pure, but once he becomes a target of the private security/para-military organization Blackwatch, he begins to unleash Hell on the city as his powers grow and he bludgeons, slices, hacks, impales and consumes anyone in his way. Mercer is very much an anti-hero as far as the story is concerned, but your actions usually give him no choice to become a mass murderer.In PROTOTYPE 2, we are introduced to our new anti-hero protagonist, James Heller, an American soldier who lives in New York City with his wife and little girl, but is overseas. Through the cutscene opening, we hear the conversations with Heller and his wife growing more and more panicked as Mercer's infected begin spreading even further. Of course, once he returns home, his wife and child are dead. He enlists in a military operation to hunt down and kill Mercer, but Mercer is too much for him to handle and Mercer, rather than killing Heller, tells him that Blackwatch and GenTek are the real enemies here and gives him the \"gift\" of the same abilities that Mercer himself has. Heller also has an ally in Father Guerra (who reminds me a lot of Cheech Marin's character in MACHETE) who is his parish priest and a member of a resistance network fighting Blackwatch, Gentek, AND Mercer, and apparently Father Guerra threw the \"Thou Shalt Not Kill\" commandment out the window when innocents were getting slaughtered by not only the infected, but Blackwatch soldiers as well. As with the first game as well, as the game progresses, you gain greater, stronger abilities that are increasingly cool, and also in line with the first game, you have a story mired in intrigue, betrayal, revenge and massive bloodletting.Unlike the first game, you have a pretty good skill set right off the bat. Running up walls and gliding are instantaneous once you get Mercer's abilities. Of course claws, tendrils, hammerfists and Devastators come later as you gain XP. Also unlike the first game, you still have to consume certain people for side missions, but the hunting aspect of this game is a lot more interesting than the simple run/glide-and-look and it eliminates the whole \"Web of Truth\" idea from the first game. Of course, that certainly hasn't taken away the hidden side missions, like going in and finding lairs of infected and wiping them out, or collecting audio files that give mostly unrelated but interesting information (kind of like INFAMOUS in that respect), or stopping field ops that are in progress.Traveling long distances is also easier too, by using helicopter \"skybridges\", but that's only if you're going to different areas of NYZ. If you don't feel like running or gliding or jumping around to reach some place that's on the same island, this probably isn't the game for you. And also, once you get (as you did in the first game) the ability to hijack a helicopter, you can have more fun that way too.Now, I'm not the most casual gamer in the world, but I am EXTREMELY casual when it comes to difficulty levels. I have enough frustration in the real world to not want to carry it over to the gaming world. That being said, the Easy setting of difficulty seems a little too easy, but that's preferable to dying every 20 mintues of gameplay. Fortunately also, timed missions do exist, but they're not in heavy supply here.However, going back to the idea that familiarity breeding contempt, the one complaint I do have about the graphics (which are mostly superb, particularly in the cinematic SIN CITY-esque cutscenes, and also gliding high above NYZ) is in the hijacking of armored vehicles. It's literally the same look as it was in the first game. I was a little disappointed in that. However, to be fair, the ease at which you CAN hijack or weaponize an armored vehicle is much better than the first game.Story-wise, this is a much stronger game as well. Heller is a much easier character to get behind than Mercer, because you do have an impetus with the Heller character to do him some justice and not just arbitrarily take innocent lives because your character is hungry, or because it's kinda fun to keep changing identities or to gain health. Mercer was much more of that kind of character, but Heller has a real gravity to his mission, especially at later parts of the game as more mysteries come to light. And Mercer as the villain of this game is a much stronger antagonist as well, since we have now played as both characters and can see both points of view. Mercer's final solution here is pretty shocking and his allies come in all shapes and sizes, making it not only a fight against GenTek/Blackwatch and the infected, but also against Mercer and his Evolved as well.The customization for your character is different in a similar way, though. It's presented differently as to design your character as something more of a singular type of warrior rather than just giving you all the options but the kitchen sink as you gain XP. I know that's something of a selling point of this game, but I don't really see it.Also, this is the Radnet version of PROTOTYPE 2 which gives you access to more online competitive side-missions. They're more complicated and not quite as entertaining as the first game, but it's worth it if you're looking to kick a buddy's rear, score-wise. That was hardly a selling point for me, but more of a fun extra.So...PROS: BETTER STORYBETTER GAMEPLAY MECHANICSBETTER GRAPHICSNEUTRAL: Similar GameplayPower Enhancement isn't really differentRadNet doesn't really do much for meCONS: I MISS BARRY PEPPER AS ALEX MERCERA LITTLE TOO REPETITIVE SOMETIMESPretty much all game sequels, especially from the current generation consoles, aren't terribly different from game to game. We're pretty much in an era of \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" sequel design, with a few exceptions.And PROTOTYPE was very much NOT broken, so PROTOTYPE 2 didn't really need to fix it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2012"}
{"product_name":"B004FYKWZU","description":"","reviewerName":"Flea Returns: FF13","summary":"Best of the series","reviewText":"Overall I believe that this is the best of the Mass Effect Series. Now don't get me wrong, some of this game doesn't hold up to the ones that came before it, but the overall game proves to be the best of the series. As always my reviews are broken down into 3 categories with story getting the most weightStory: 9/10The story of this game is by far the strength of the game. This story has been building up for 3 games now and you finally get to finish it. With each game in this series the story kept improving. Commander Shepard gets his crew and finally takes it to the Reapers. As far as the endings go, yes even with the new endings Bioware put in, the endings does leave you wanting a bit but I think the uproar was vastly blown out of proportion. The endings ended it satisfactorily. Really the only negative to the story was indeed the ending. But with a story building up for so long as this one did, it would have been near impossible to meet the games standards.Characters: 8/10Some of these characters are some of the best in all of video gaming. Tali is beyond cute and hilarious and Wrex is beyond hysterical. I am glad that in the last two entries of this series, they made Shepard less robotic (he was terrible in the first). Ashley grew so much as a character through the series. The first game she was just filler, the little bit in the second she was ok...but man she was one of my favorite characters in this one. Liara was...well just Liara. Didn't really like the character after the first game. Garrus...simply awesome. I hate that Thane wasn't really in this one but I suppose we can't have our cake and eat it too. I guess the knock on this game as far as characters go is just that their relationship with Shepard just didn't seem as deep as they had in previous entries. In the second series, there was just SO much character development and relationship building but this one...not so much. Still good thoughGameplay: 6.5/10This is easily the weakness of this game. I thought that the seconds gameplay was perfect really. The first was too detailed. Too much driving around on random planets...too much time wasted. This one they pretty much dumbed everything down. From choosing your characters based on what strengths they had for each mission to completely dumbing the mining process down. Don't get me wrong, the basic level ups and fighting maneuvers stayed the same..But I thought the second game had more to offer.Overall a solid 8/10. This game is the best of the series. The gameplay and character relations don't quite hold up to the second game but it more than makes up for it with the story and the build up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00CMQTVUA","description":"","reviewerName":"Nasahr","summary":"Love my Xbox One","reviewText":"Update: April 11th, 2014. I now fully love and enjoy my xbox one and am very glad i didn't buy PS4. Anybody who bought PS4 will soon regret their choice because the XBOX one will only get better with time. It's already a far better system than it was at launch and it's been less than a year. Give it a year and the PS4 will be very outdated compared to xb1.The system itself is excellent. But the available games are mediocure so far. There's really only 3 good games out and Gran Turismo is a far better series than Forza. Turn 10 seems to really be taking advantage of it's loyal consumers with microtransations while with Gran Turismo it's a fun non frustrating experience. Honestly though there aren't many reasons why you shouldn't buy this console. Yes you have to have XB live gold to use apps but it's only $10 a month which your gonna be paying for anyway for online gameing.The XB1 really improves television. The voice commands don't work well at all though. You can still use your regular cable box remote with the TV. So it's just like the regular tv but just on your xbox, which means you never miss anything. You can say xbox go home and see whos online, watch netflic, etc then say \"xbox go to tv\" and there you go your watching tv again. Also you can change channels with your voice! For example you can say \"Xbox watch cnn..and it changes to Cnn\" You can say \"XBOX watch bbc america\" and it changes to bbc america! It's the coolest thing ever. This thing really does feel like the future. It makes your life a little easier.The console itself is huge but who cares? It's not like your gonna be carying it around. I love the way the system looks. It has this beutiful, simple, professional, high class look. Some how the glossy finish doesn't attract much dust and the system is always silent, even when you put a disc in it. It makes your living room look better as well. The desighn is excellent. Miles better than the ancient low tech 360.Now the controller. It feels great in your hands and looks way better than 360. It's great. The texture on it is really nice and the thumbsticks are very precise. The bumpers and triggers are better than 360.I will still be getting PS4 as well though but only when the next Gran Turismo comes out. Being that i'm a huge gearhead and Gran turismo is ultimately too much to miss out on. So much so that im willing to buy a $400 console just for the next gen Gran Turismo (PS4 might be cheaper by then). So to all you Forza fans and players FORZA MOTORSPORTS IS NOT REALISTIC. Trust me i was a huge Forza fan myself. I played forza 3, 4, and 5. I now own Gran Turismo 6 and the first time i played GT6 i was absoloutly amazed at the realism of the driving. It really is a challenge to even get around a course in a fast car (just like in real life). The driving in forza 5 is FAR to easy! Before GT i used to think forza was amazingly realistic but after having played GT6 for 2 months Forza ultimatley feels like some cheap arcade game. Yes the sounds are better but the driving is far to easy to even be a challenge or rewarding at all. So for now if you want the ultimate most realistic driving experience, skip forza 5 and get a PS3 and GT6. If you already have a PS3 then your in luck! You won't learn anything from forza, it doesn't make you a better driver it makes driving easier for you. So for you sim racers right now PS4 and Xbox one don't really offer anything (at least PS4 will in the future) but i guess for now you could toy with forza 5 for a bit or if you have PS3 just get GT6!Overall the XBOX one is a must buy. Honestly you might as well by it now because the price isn't going down anytime soon and when it does it'll probably be by only $50 (2 years from now). The XBOX ONE is the future, the PS4 is good for now but has no future or real potential. The xbox one does everything and videogames the PS4 does just videogames. I'm not hating on the PS4 at all, it's a nice system but the XB1 is the better choice. You get far more for your money. You get kinect, a awesome controller, a headseat, a pair of batteries, and of course a full on entertainment system in the xbox one. I now watch TV through my xbox and it's a great experience. You can littereally leave it on ALL day and never worry about it over heating at all. It's a very realiable system.When you purchase a XBOX ONE you are making a investment. For now you might not enjoy it as much as you wish but better and more games and apps will be coming out soon.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2014"}

{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"Derek G","summary":"Not a reinvention, but it shakes up the MMO genre nicely","reviewText":"There are a few things about this game I want to make sure you know upfront before deciding whether to purchase it.  First, the focus of Guild Wars 2 is the experience of leveling up your character, not the endgame content.  Second, the so-called \"holy trinity\" of tank/damage/healer is effectively dead in this game as any character you create can effectively perform one or all of these tasks.  Third, the combat in this game can be as simple or as technical as you wish to make it.First, any MMO veteran who purchases GW2 with the goal of racing to the level cap as quickly as possible is going to find themselves disappointed.  In fact, it's useless to do so since you are automatically transformed to maximum level if you join PvP or WvWvW; even on your first day playing. PvE players will have the opportunity to grind for better looking gear and world-firsts, if that is your desire, however the performance of the gear is purely cosmetic as the stats are identical to other max-level items.  PvE in GW2 is more like your standard single-player RPG with a focus on storytelling and exploration.  In fact, it's one of maybe a handful of MMO's that you can complete without the need for a group or a guild. In addition, the world is so large you could complete another character with very little story overlap until you get toward the ending.  A nice feature considering there is no monthly subscription fee.  Once you buy the game you can play as much or as little as you want without the nagging feeling of having to get your money's worth.So how does character creation and customization work in Guild Wars 2?  You have a choice of five different races to play and each race can choose from eight different professions.  Many of these professions will sound familiar to MMO players (i.e. Warrior, Thief, Ranger, etc.) but GW2 differs in that everyone shares similar talents. In other words, a warrior isn't automatically delegated to \"tank\", ranger a glass cannon \"dps\", a mage as a \"healer\" and so on.  Instead, your various attack skills are determined by the weapon you use, everyone gets the ability to heal, and your character's strengths in battle are determined more by the weapon you use and where you focus your skill points and traits as you level up your character.  Your race and profession make little difference so you can play whoever you want.Arenanet has also taken the time to remove some of the more annoying things we've endured in MMO's.  No more backtracking to turn in a completed quest.  Now your quest rewards are delivered by carrier pigeon and they will find you wherever you are.  In the middle of a dungeon?  They'll find you.  Finish a quest underwater?  They'll dive in and deliver your reward with little air bubbles trailing behind them as they fly away.  What about those rude people who steal your loot or crafting materials?  Or worse, the higher level players who 'gank' you while you're busy fighting something?  No longer an issue.  The beauty of this game is it encourages and rewards cooperation.  For instance, you and another person discover some ore to mine for crafting materials.  No longer is it a race to whoever gets to the ore first.  Both of you can mine and receive the same materials.  Fight the same creature?  Sure, and you're both rewarded with experience points.  You'll even get experience points for reviving other fallen players.  In GW2 it's very rare for people to run by you without lending a helping hand.  It's hard to describe how much this improves the overall community, you'll need to experience it for yourself.Now don't get me wrong, if you want PvP (player vs. player combat) you'll have plenty of opportunity with specially designed maps.  There are even WvWvW servers (world vs. world vs. world) where you can join your entire server in battle against another server in huge maps.Speaking of combat, I wanted to touch on combat in GW2 a little bit because I have noticed some complaints.  First, it takes a little adjustment and practice to figure out the positive and negatives of different weapons.  What separates GW2 from many other MMOs is that your skills and weapons can enhance the skills and weapons of others.  For instance, an elementalist can cast a flame wall that does fire damage to an enemy.  In addition, any ranger shooting arrows through the flame wall gets additional damage as it turns their regular arrows into flaming arrows.  Certain weapons do greater damage when you're close to an enemy, others do greater damage when you're far away.  You may do best with a high damage weapon when you're one on one vs. an enemy but with multiple players fighting with you, you may be a better benefit by stacking boons on players or conditions on enemies to help player attacks.  Sticking with a favorite weapon or rotation isn't an optimal strategy in GW2 as each battle is situational, particularly against champion enemies or bosses.  You will play better when you learn not only your skills but the skills of your companions as well.  That protective bubble being cast by a nearby Guardian may also be able to protect you from damage as long as you're in it.Of course the best part is NO MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION FEE!  Plus, Arenanet continues to add new content and world events regularly.  I have a few gripes such as the odd field of view that ends up with your character filling up a large part of the screen.  Their floating camera combined with the jumping puzzles are an exercise in frustration.  For the most part the game works flawlessly and I'm glad Arenanet took some chances, innovated some features, and removed a lot of annoyances common to the MMO genre.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2012"}

There is so, so, so much to do, from extorting, to payoffs, to missions, side missions, it's all too much. Anyone who is into Mafia movies or games, this is the game for you. The graphics are great, it's an open-ended environment, but yet it still follows the movie closely. I bought the strategy guide, I recommend this.The only thing that annoys me about the game is how much there IS to do. It can be overwhelming at times. Often times there are many objective you need to complete at once. Like I mentioned, the strategy guide is like a novel. One could spend hundreds and hundreds of hours trying to discover everything about the game. Also, you die too easily and the fighting system takes a while to learn.In closing, if you like the GTA games and you like the Mafia, then you will absolutely LOVE this game, no exceptions.

{"product_name":"B000038IFX","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"It's not the best ever but it's sure worth a play","reviewText":"Xenogears is one of those premier titles that for some reason you can't attack. Unlike Final Fantasy VII which has just as much naysayers as it as fanatics, Xenogears is one of those kind of games where any attempt to label it less than a masterpiece is met with \"you just didn't get it\" or \"you don't know good videogames then\". So allow me to be one of the few that will say the game is in the \"gray area\": it's a good, even great game but it's just shy from the awesomeness everyone says it is.Story: Fei lives in Lahan, a quiet pastoral-like village. One night, massive robots called Gears(similar to Evangelion's EVA's) land and Fei jumps in an unoccupied Gear to fight them off. Something is awakened however inside him and he unleashes, which doesn't bode well for his village. Shunned by the villagers, he leaves and finds himself in a massive plot with serious religious overtones.Graphics: It's the Playstation so it does look a bit outdated. However the graphics at times are nice to look at during the cities/locations. The overworld looks awful while battles look pretty decent, especially the Gear battles. The only problem is the camera sometimes. It's 3D so you can rotate the camera but sometimes the camera won't go higher or lower so sometimes it's pretty much guesswork how high something is.Sound/Music: Funny how both opposites these are. First off, the VA during the anime cutscenes are fine but the lip-sync is even worse than old kung fu movie dubs. The music however is excellent and you should definately track down the soundtrack.Gameplay: The battle system is slightly different than that \"tap X\" stuff but not by much. You get 3 moves, Weak, Mid and Strong. Weak takes 1 AP, Mid 2 and Strong takes 3. You have a certain limit of AP that you can use. However, you can decide to \"save\" it and add it to a meter. Save up enough and you can unleash one Deathblow move after another. The only problem is that I couldn't find any indication on what your Deathblow moves were. It's pretty much trial and error trying to figure out what the combos are, or simply research on the internet. I went through a good 5 hours before I realized how to get a Deathblow cause there was no way of knowing what they were, let alone how to get one.The Gear battles are somewhat the same, except each move costs Fuel and you have a preset limit. You can Charge to replenish your Fuel or you can Booster which costs Fuel but your attacking is better. Your Deathblows as a human are important because they carry over to your Gears as well. And they're quite important too. One early battle in my gear I was doing all my best attacks against one boss and I didn't know how to heal Gears yet so he completely beat me before he even got close to dying. Learning deathblows, I quickly beat him afterwards.How's the story? Well it's well-written sure with a lot of religious references and elements. However, the game's so serious that the characters in a way feel like ways to advance the plot without being fleshed out. Also what I call the teaser happens too often. That's the \"wait, this happened, could it be he's...?\" parts and you find out 2 hours later what that is. Questions upon questions get piled up leaving you quite confused until later.It's certainly a recommendable game, it's just not one of those \"best RPG ever\" ones, it's merely one of their better ones.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2006"}

These two games ( in my opinion ) are 2 of the best FPS games out there . Even after all these years you can't go wrong with them if you have never played them.I orriginally picked this game up on midnight release in 2007 and have played the campaign over and over again , and thats not counting the addictive multiplayer my friends and I lost days of our lives to. The game was just a marvel of its time and many game developers have attempted replicate it's success and all have failed . This was the game most talked about at the time and many years to come. Many people including myself still pop this gem in and play the multiplayer together. For a while ( just like World at War ) hackers absolutely ruined the multiplayer experience , but just like the World at War multiplayer , the hackers have seemed to have moved on and we can now enjoy one of the best multiplayer's to ever exist. Just like in World at War you will run into the occasional hacker , but all you have to do is back out of the match and start a new. Its that simple.Not only is the multiplayer great but the campaign is a very enjoyable ride and in my opinion , it's the best in the Modern Warfare series. The other two were decent but didn't reach the greatness of this game. I really didn't care for Modern Warfare 3 , the story was ok but the multiplayer was lacking , again that is just my opinion. I have beaten all of my Call of Duty games on Veteran and achieved all the achievments to be had except for one , and its on this game.. The mile high club achievement is absoultely a hard one to get and one that I gave up on , but I have the rest !!

{"product_name":"B002EE5SAC","reviewerName":"TheRumblePack.com","summary":"A Welcome Change from the Usual World Warriors","reviewText":"I adore the Street Fighter series, and the fourth installment was no exception, but when was the last time a Capcom game really surprised me? Though the company is renowned for its coin-op fighters, it's also infamous for recycled sprites and low-res presentations. After the Fighting Evolution nadir, Street Fighter IV was a return to form, but I was still a little disappointed by how familiar it felt. 3D or not, we've thrown enough hadoukens over the years; SFIV is excellent but very safe. Tatsunoko vs. Capcom on the Wii is anything but. Capcom's taking a huge gamble on Nintendo's family-friendly box here. I don't know if it will pay off financially, but it's a welcome change from the usual World Warriors.When TvC first hit Japanese Wiis, I think it was assumed by many that the game would never reach our shores. While the Tatsunoko licensing was pretty straightforward over there, their distribution rights were held by several different companies stateside. It didn't help matters that characters like Tekkaman and Casshan don't have the built-in fanbase that Wolverine and Spider-man enjoy. It would have been heartbreaking to see the next entry in a beloved fighting series stuck in Japan, but Capcom decided to place its bets on the quality of the fighting engine. Hooray for us!The core premise doesn't stray to far from what we're seen before, but a few tweaks make it more approachable for newcomers. TvC uses a simplified version of the six-button standard control setup. Rather than having three types each of punches and kicks, you now have light, medium and strong attacks. A fourth button calls in an assist attack or tags in your partner. The consolidation was a necessary concession for Wii owners playing with remotes, but most of the depth was retained. Capcom really got as much out of Wii's controllers as it could possibly muster. Special moves are mapped to every possible joystick-button combination. It'll take some adjusting for veterans, but the changes here were for the best.The more significant departure is in the character lineup itself. Both MvC2 and Capcom vs. SNK 2 featured gargantuan rosters, and the balancing and individual personalities of each fighter suffered for it. TvC strikes a much better balance. There are 25 playable characters, and none of them are palette swaps; they're completely unique in both looks and move-sets. In fact, the most exciting thing about the roster is that most of these characters have never set foot in a fighting arena before.More than half of Capcom's side is new to this genre. Some faces may seem familiar, like Megaman Legend's Volnutt, but he plays completely differently from previous Megamen. Newcomers like Saki and Viewtiful Joe fit in perfectly, too (even if the former's relevance is questionable). That said, I had even more fun playing as the Tatsunoko gang. All of the characters, from yo-yo swinging Jun the Swan to Doronjo's three stooges, are colorful and fun to use. Only the experimental giant characters, the Lost Planet mech and Lego-fied Gold Lightan, are clunkers.The long trek to America was entirely worth it, as I couldn't imagine the game without its five secret characters. Zero's a fan favorite and Frank West from Dead Rising can toss out zombies into the playing field at will, creating a unique tactical advantage as long as he doesn't caught in their grasp himself. Tekkaman Blade is the big Tatsunoko standout for me; His...uh...non-Blade counterpart is cool, but the new version fast footwork make him (it?) a lot of fun to use.The extra localization time was also used to add online fighting. The last Wii fighter I played with online multiplayer was Super Smash Bros. Brawl, and I think we all know how that turned out. So does this work better? Yes, definitely. There's still occasional lag and the usual Nintendo gripes - no communication, friend codes - but you also have unlockable ranks, icons and leaderboards. Not great, but it's a welcome addition.While this probably won't gain much traction online - again, it's a Wii title - it could possible become a tournament favorite. There are some minor balancing issues, but nothing that MvC enthusiasts aren't used to by now. Either way, fighting games don't come slicker than Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, and if you've been begging for a hardcore experience for the Wii, it's time to put your quarters where your mouth is.--Reviewed by Justin Hemenway","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005YVTW","description":"You are the vampire Kain, the most evil figure ever to appear in a video game. Cloaked in stealth, you will move unseen through crowds, travel stories above the peasant herds on which you feed--leaping from rooftop to rooftop--and use mind control to overcome vampire-proof inventions. The combat choreography unfolds with dancelike precision as Kain engages armies of demons and humans alike. The comprehensive menu of unstoppable attacks, nimble combos, and special moves are designed to appeal to even the most jaded of fighting-game fans. The world that Kain moves through is a lushly detailed gothic environment that is not only gorgeous to the eye, but also alive with the soon-to-be-dead. The AI behavioral response makes peasants and enemies variously flee, take up arms, or remain unaware as Kain moves through crowds or charges, sword raised, into open areas.","reviewerName":"Sixto Limiac","summary":"Legacy of Kain Series = Excessive Gore","reviewText":"Here ye, here ye, thou`s beloved bloodsucking vampire has awakened, and he wades amongst fiery depths of pure, uncompromising vengeance.After what's been six years, the bona fide sequel of blood-fest Legacy of Kain, has stepped up to the plate.  Now on the PS2, Blood Omen 2 has been developed by the boys from Soul Reaver 2 and published by either hated or respected Edios.  This time, however, a mob of overjoyed gamers should lift those teams off their feet in praise, for Blood Omen 2 bears the grandeur of the PS1 original.400 years have dragged by since the fall of Kain.  Cabal, an organization of vampire resistance, has taken Kain under their care.  Enraged of his fall, Kain must redeem himself and do battle with the Sarafan Knights.  Worse, Kain's most loyal commanders have taken ranks with the menacing Knights to cleanse Nosgoth of vampires. With all this the player must take the role of [] Kain, and let retribution rain!Into the graphical faucets, Blood Omen 2 gleams with red, searing waxes of blood and gore.  The original game was overflowing with all crimson brilliance, but the sequel is just an overkill of it.  I'm surprised that the game nor my television set wasn`t amplified with such cascades of bloody mess.  The world of Nosgoth is ruled with a dark, pessimistic outlook.  Extremely gothic, the atmosphere  leaves a murky expression throughout the game.  Although certainly not eye-candy, the foggy surroundings and sinister atmospheric tones are a nice change over the garishly colorful.Playing in full 3D and Real Time, Kain has never felt so good to sink duty into.  At the beginning of the game, the player is squat on strength and on weaponry.  It's up to the player to hunt down Sarafan Knights, steal their advance weapons, and have Kain be armed to the teeth.  Progressing in the game, means Kain gains a multitude of skills that is related to vampire mythology.  Relying heavily on stealth, the players are usually urged not to be seen in towns, and kill when absolutely necessary.  Equipped with powerful vampire abilities, Kain is to use them intelligently like his Telekinesis ability.  Taking control of humans means easier mobility, such as commanding human folk to activate switches.  Other than that, Kain also has abilities such as bloodsucking, super jumps, roof stalking and several more.On the whole though, Blood Omen 2 is a hack &slash; dungeon crawler.  Though, not as action-oriented as Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, Kain's quest is much slower paced.  Although its not to point at the game and declare that it doesn't have its strong suits.  Blood Omen 2 has an excellent battle system.  Sometimes intense, the combat is a joy to play with the defend system and not to mention the long and challenging boss fights with other vampires.  Kain also accumulates a vast collection of weapons which behave realistically.  Swift daggers, sluggish axes, etc.  The level of depth in the game isn't quite as high as I wished it would be, but it does have its moments.  Completely linear, Blood Omen 2's puzzles, move from point A to point B progression, and hammering wrath on the side of Good, sums up the experience to be had.Of course the reputation of Crystal Dynamic's stunning voice-overs and sounds prove to move into a higher spectrum of glory.  Kain has never sounded so deadly and the voices and sounds is utterly flawless.  The plot and script is written with so much intensity, I wonder why if there could be a Halo book why not a Legacy of Kain one?Blood Omen 2 is nothing new in an overpopulated world of hack & slash games, especially in the PC threshold. Kain's adventure is  well enough to be considered a decent caper.  I must admit playing through the demon-invested Nosgoth was much as an enjoyment as the first Kain game.  Additionally, it's a blessing for players to finally take role of an evil manifestation and spread panic and death throughout the innocent populace.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2002"}

But I don't care about stories in a video game.  I'll concede there are fascinating stories in video games.  I've sat in front of the tv as they were going on but I couldn't tell you what was going on.  I put a game in so I can destroy, pillage, plunder, explore, wander and collect stuff.  That's entertainment enough for me.  Cut scenes and endless dialogue boxes are great moments for me to get on my second screen for a few moments.  Everyone else derides Killzone 2 for a poor story that has some big set pieces.  Bully for the Killzone 2 creators I say.  That's exactly what I want.  On a side note I must add though that trying to kill the Helghan's (or whoever them crazy futuristic Nazi's are) can be a tad bit tricky at times.  The guns all have terrible kickback.  Trying to set the sites on a baddie, then pull the trigger and then see most the bullets go everywhichway can be frustrating and then the baddie runs away.  Sure, it's realistic but sometimes I just want the enemy to sit still, take a bullet to the skull so I can get along on my way.  The mission levels are great-but can go on for quite sometime.  Some levels were 45min (of course my constant dying dragged out the experience) but I wouldn't have minded if they had chopped them up some.  Keep the content in, just cut the missions in half like COD does.  23 min is plenty good time for me.  Fatigue sets in after awhile at times.  I'm not a young man anymore.

Hoover \"chicagojosh\"","summary":"Great Launch Title","reviewText":"I held off on getting this game at launch, preferring to spend my money on Zelda and Rayman. I'm sorry I held off so long. Don't get me wrong, Twilight Princess and Raving Rabbids are both great games which I have no regrets of buying, but I definitely waited far too long to pick up Excite Truck.Strategy plays so much more a part of Excite Truck as opposed to conventional racing games. To pass a level you have to earn enough \"Star Points.\"  You earn points based on what place you finish the race, your air time on jumps, drift length, and crashing into other cars. Heck, you earn a point every time you run into a tree. Your job is find the right balance between racking up points throughout the level while still placing high enough to net you enough points.There is a good balance between the different types of trucks. None of them feel more powerful than another, but there are plenty of times where one type of truck just won't cut it for the type of level.The controls are incredibly intuitive. In other racing games, you might turn the entire remote when you need to take a sharp turn. Now it actually helps. It might take you awhile to get used to not having to press a button to turn, as I found myself on several occasions hitting my turbo boost and wondering why I wasn't turning, but after a few tracks I was more than accustomed to the new control scheme.My only issue with Excite Truck would be the limited tricks. When you're in the air, the only trick you can add to your air time is a spin. I would have loved to have a Tony Hawk-esque list of moves I could pull off while I'm waiting for my truck to touch down.In closing, Excite Truck is definitely a load of fun, with edge of your seat white knuckled fun. To see all of the courses won't take you long, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be buckling down and shooting for 'S' ranks on all of the courses.

{"product_name":"B0038MUCPK","reviewerName":"Ian","summary":"A child's imagination is not all fun and games","reviewText":"Short Review:Toy Story 3 has fantastic production values all around, but the story missions are below average, often leave you in the dark about what to do and where to go, and can be surprisingly difficult.  Toy Box mode is very clever and creative, but sometimes feels more like a chore then a sandbox for your mind to run wild and free.  Overall, I didn't care for it, but I hope others like it more then I did.Full Review:Ah, the magic of childhood, a happy time of carefree playing and scampering about on our knees, enjoying the wonders of nature, setting ants on fire, and stuffing ourselves with chicken nuggets while imagining what sort of foe GI Joe would go up against next. It was a wonderful time, and had a certain joy that grownups often don't seem to have. We aren't encouraged to play and let our imaginations run wild. But with the Toy Story 3 videogame, we're encouraged to do exactly that, to try and experience the spontaneous joy of youth once more. Sadly however, while it's a noble idea, it doesn't leap from nostalgia into the cold, harsh world of reality.Toy Story 3 is the game based on the Pixar movie of the same name, in which you play as Woody, Buzz, and Jessie while romping through an oversized world. The game consists of two basic components: Several missions that follow the movie, and Toy Box mode, which allows you to play around and experiment.The mission based levels of the game, which constitutes half of the overall gameplay experience, has you romping through a very (and I mean very) loose adaptation of the film's plot. Andy is now grown up and about to head off to college. Naturally, this is bad news for all his old toys, who are sitting around in his toy box collecting dust. That's essentially all you're told in the beginning, and you don't get much more information after that.  Most of the story is told to you by Ham as you move about the level select screen, describing events that you don't see or experience.  It's like watching the fellowship of the ring travel towards Moria, only to suddenly cut to them in Lothlorien with Aragorn briefly telling us that some bad stuff happened and now Gandalf is dead. This style of storytelling assumes that you've seen the movie, because it only presents the set pieces that make up the movie. As a result, it feels like we're playing a greatest hits version of the film, with all the main stuff present, but with very little to tie it all together into a coherent story.Gameplay within these missions is done via three way switching of Woody, Buzz, and Jessie. Similar to the old classic, \"The Lost Vikings\", each character has a skill needed to complete the mission (or at least unlock all the bonuses and find all the items). Woody can use his pull string like a whip to swing across gaps, ALA Indiana Jones, Jessie can jump and land on very tiny surfaces, such as darts and paper butterflies, and Buzz can throw the other two the farthest, which gives the impression that he's running around the two at their beck and call, with no other special ability aside from tossing them around. But aside from these little differences, all three characters are essentially identical. All three can jump identically, charge at enemies, and man any drivable vehicle, which means you'll be playing as your favorite character for most of the time until you need to momentarily switch to someone else, which leads to the funny scenario of, say, Woody, running around and doing everything while Buzz and Jessie stand in place like zombies, waiting for something to happen.The levels in story mode are split up into two types: Gathering, and mission based. Gathering has you going through the levels gathering a certain number of items or accomplishing a few different tasks, such as a race or two (or three). Mission based are more streamlined, and typically have you going from point A to point B while playing as a single character. These are the best, most memorable missions in the game, such as the opening level, which has Woody running through the old west, trying to stop a runaway train. It's a fantastic level that has numerous thrills and excitement, such as battling the three eyed aliens while running on the top of said train. Sadly, there are only a few of these levels, but they're fun while they last.At this point, the story missions sound like they should be quite fun, even with the rather loose way they're all connected. However, I have yet to mention why they aren't as much as fun as they should. That single reason is the game's difficulty level. For a game supposedly aimed at young children, at times it can be surprisingly difficult, with several segments challenging even adult gamers. For example, in the train level mentioned above, at one point you have to run across several cars while dodging swinging obstacles, such as sacks, water tank pipes, and railroad crossing barriers. The problem is that they spawn out of nowhere, giving you, at most, about a second and a half to react. It gets even worse when you have to fight off several aliens, dodge around boxes, and avoid giant laser blasts, leading to a sequence that is phenomenally difficult. When I died for the tenth time (there's no penalty for failure in the game, and you can keep trying again as many times as you like), I began to wonder if this really was supposed to be for kids. At another point, I was guiding Woody down some colorful tubes in space, and had to leap between three of them to avoid plunging to my death. Your timing here has to be exact, as a split second in hesitation can lead to a plunge into infinity, and yet another restart that sends you a ridiculously far distance back. Perhaps the worst bit is in a level near the end of the game, where you have to constantly switch back and forth between all three characters to save some others who are trapped and about to be destroyed in all manner of horrible ways. You have a time limit, and the design of the stage is difficult to follow, and there were several points where I had no idea what the hell I was supposed to do, which led to numerous moments of my toy friends getting burned, smashed, and ground into oblivion, and numerous restarts.It's somewhat sad that the game developers seem to realize that the game might be a bit too difficult at times, as they have a hint system that pops up every now and then that allows you to choose whether you want just a hint, or be told the answer as to what you're supposed to do. The problem is that sometimes these hint systems don't pop up when you need them to, and at times, they're still very vague, saying something like, \"You'll need all three toys to shut down this machine!\" To make things even more confusing, the game has a nasty habit of telling you what to do, then leaving you alone. If you're trying to remember what to do at any given moment, or where to go, the game doesn't help, which leads to many instances of you running around with little idea of what to do. It's silly, because some of the stages are amazingly short, often taking place in just one room. Granted, you're a toy, and thus it's bigger, but it's still just one room, which leads to a feeling of claustrophobia in some of the stages.With the story missions out of the way, the game presents it's big selling point, Toy Box mode. Here, you control either Woody, Buzz, or Jessie (minus their unique skills) in the old west, running around a frontier town. The big idea here is that you're essentially inside Andy's mind as he plays with his favorite toys where almost anything is possible. You're free to roam wherever you'd like to go, and do whatever you'd like. Want to kick people around? Chuck them into rivers to watch them drown (non-violently of course), turn all the buildings blue and put flowers on all the porches? You can do so. It's like Grand Theft Auto for kids, minus all the guns, blood, death, corpses, prostitutes, and backstabbing. It's here that Toy Story 3 really shines, because this is a very clever idea for a film based game, and the developers are to be commended for thinking outside the box. The overriding idea here is that the more you play, the more you unlock, and the more goodies you have to play with. You start off with a small town and a ranch to visit, but as you go on, you unlock more buildings, more paint styles, more outfits for your townspeople, and unlock other areas to visit, such as a dam, a haunted house, a space port, and even a fairy tale tree house, complete with rainbow bridges, strawberries, and adorable fuzzy dragons that make cute noises after blasting something with their fire breath. Toys from all three movies make appearances here, from Sarge and his soldiers, to Bo Peep, to even Zurg himself (\"Your presence irritates me!\"). Dig really deep, and you'll find missions within these stages, such as my favorite, where you run and jump about in an asteroid field deep in space, and fighting through one of Zurg's command ships.But while the Toy Box mode is creative, clever, and completely unique in the area of film based games, after a while you begin to notice that it feels less like freeplay, and more like a chore. You're literally bombarded with things to accomplish as you go along, and it isn't uncommon to have six or seven missions going at once. Granted, you can take your time doing them, but it doesn't stop the fact that after a while, you feel like an errand boy at the beck and call of everyone around you. Ham may want you to save a stagecoach under siege while Bo Peep wants you to round up a tardy student, to a random citizen who wants you to dress him up like Zurg, and all the while, robots are rampaging through the town, shooting at everyone at whim. As you unlock even more areas, more and more of these random disasters (\"Fairies/robots/ghosts are attacking the town! You have to stop them!\") occur more and more frequently, and you'll start to wish that the incompetent inhabitants of this world would do something on their own, rather then just call out to you to fix everything. Some of the missions, such as ones that ask you to recreate a picture, are shoved to the wayside because it's too much work to complete them. When I was asked to save someone important from robbers by destroying all their shacks and going to their hideout, I had no idea where the shacks, or the hideout were, because the cutscene showing them was amazingly brief, and gave me little idea on where to go. After a while, I gave up, leaving the captive to remain behind bars forever. One mission asks you to capture three bank robbers and lock them up. But you always get to two robbers before they break out, forcing you to start all over again. You're tasked with locating aliens and people to lock up, but are given no hints whatsoever on where they are, or sometimes, even what they look like. There are driving and racing missions for you to play, but I flat out didn't like these, as the steering and handling on the game's cars is very loose and choppy, making it easy to swerve around and feel like you're going to crash at any second.Aside from the missions and Toy Box mode, Toy Story 3 boasts some really good production values, such as bright, colorful graphics that capture the look and feel of the film. The daycare levels, for example, are a delight to run around in, simply because of how colorful and pretty they are, even at night. But the real star of the show is the audio. Many of the film's cast comes aboard to voice their characters in game, such as Ham, Rex, Slinky, Trixie, Mr. Pricklepants, Sarge, etc. It's a delight to walk around and hear Rex sound exactly like Rex from the film (Not sure if Mr. Hanks and Allan came back, but if they didn't, then the voice actors did a good job intimidating them). It's wonderful to see so many of the film's cast coming on board, and their presence adds a touch of authenticity to the game, along with a musical soundtrack that uses much of the music from the films, including the classic song, \"You've got a friend in me.\" And as an added bonus, the PS3 version of the game comes with the ability to play as Zurg (after unlocking and buying him), but sadly, he doesn't have much to do. He has all of three missions to complete (that I could find), and afterwords, can only shoot and attack people, and drive around in his Zurgmobile (which handles as terribly as all the other cars).Now, I know I've painted a pretty grim picture of the game, and believe me, I don't want to. I wanted Toy Story 3 to be good, clean fun that was enjoyable for everyone. But sadly, it just doesn't work out. Toy Story 3 isn't the worst film based video game, not by a long shot, but it just doesn't do much to climb up and join the best ones ever made. It's short, it's difficult (though to be fair, not all the time), and it often leaves you alone with little idea of what to do. Perhaps I'm not the game's main target audience, which is, presumably, kids. I'm a 24 year old man who's used to gunning down zombies and all manner of vicious monsters in my video games, but despite what this review might have you think, my inner child is not dead. When I look at the sky, my inner child wants to leap into a flaming biplane, head up, and battle a zeppelin commandeered by an evil octopus from Jupiter with chainsaws for hands, and snarling gerbils for minions. I wanted to really enjoy this game, but in the end, I couldn't. I'm actually hoping that this isn't the same for you. I actually want you to go out and rent this game and enjoy it, and have fun with it yourself and your children. Please, do it, because I want to believe that our childhood innocence still exists, and that people can find fun and joy wherever they find it...even if our patience is getting thin at learning that fairies are turning everyone into caterpillars yet again.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001UWGBC8","reviewerName":"James Donnelly \"Ave Atque Vale\"","summary":"Bring on the Bad/Good Guys! It's CIVIL WAR in the Marvel U!","reviewText":"M:UA was one of the greatest games EVER for any fanboy or girl. It built on the great game engine that was used for X-MEN LEGENDS 1 and 2 that allowed you to switch between heroes and fight your way through various pulse-pounding levels and give your heroes enhanced abilities, alternate costumes, and super [...]-kicking super moves. Obviously this was a little limited with just the X-Men to use, but it was still cool, because playing as a superhero, no matter how lame the game can still be fun. M:UA brought that to a new extreme because it gave you several great superheroes and not just confining you to the X-Teams. Cap, Thor, Spidey, The Thing, Iron Man, Moon Knight, Luke Cage... you name it, they were there. And that was just a great (if at times, corny) game. You fought everyone from the undersea dwellers of Atlantis to the majestrix of the Sh'iar empire to Galactus, the Devourer of Worlds! At certain save points in the game, you could change your team to fit the circumstances of the battle ahead as well as upgrading characters' abilities and changing costumes from classic to futuristic to obscure and \"What If?\" costumes. It was marvelous (pun intended)! The best part, however, was not the fighting and the upgrading and the costume changing, but the very end, where Uatu the Watcher would give you an overview of what certain decisions in the game affected the future of the universe for the better, or in some cases, the worse.Now, we have MARVEL: ULTIMATE ALLIANCE 2, which, as opposed to the original game, follows at least two very specific storylines: Brian Michael Bendis' SECRET WAR storyline, which opens up the game, as you and your allies go on what is essentially a Black-Ops mission to fight the new Prime Minister of Latveria who is, according to SHIELD director Nick Fury's intel, selling high-tech arms to terrorists and super-villains. In defiance of the President's order, he enlists Cap, Iron Man, Spidey and Wolverine to go and deal with this impending threat.The other storyline is from the status-quo changing CIVIL WAR event, where not only the after-effects of the SECRET WAR are felt, but a very bad judgment call by The New Warriors (in promotion of their new reality show) take on some Z-List bad guys, but one of them has A-List destructive powers and almost the entire town of Stamford, Connecticut is obliterated, causing over 600 deaths, many of them the town's children. The US Government is quick to respond, saying that ALL superhumans and costumed crimefighters have to register their identites and powers with the Federal Government so that they can be trained and enlisted as duly-appointed paid representatives of the law-enforcement community. This would come to be known as the SuperHuman Registration Act (or SHRA). The big brains of the Marvel U (Tony Stark as the ultimate futurist, and Reed Richards as the number-cruncher and out-of-the-box thinker) support the SHRA initiative, stating that it's the natural evolution of the costumed hero and that it will save them from the \"inevitable\" wars between the Superhero community and the Government.However, Captain America, an already-deputized agent of the US Government, believes that superhumans who fight crime for no reward or pay are the ultimate patriots. And also having seen the corruption that had spread in the government before, he sees how each superhero could potentially be a weapon to be used by the government in whatever way they see fit, regardless of the individual hero's beliefs or morals. To Cap, this is a simple issue of civil rights and superhumans who already risk their lives every day to fight for what's right should not have to sacrifice their anonymity or their personal freedoms. So he is the first to rebel against the SHRA, and the superhero community is split right down the middle. Those most willing to follow orders and believe that with training and a steady paycheck, the SHRA is good, side with Iron Man. Those that believe that this is just another way to reign in those with special abilities or those who are different and use them to serve the ends of whatever direction the political wind blows go underground and side with Cap.Now, the downsides of the game are that there are not many more heroes (or villains, in some cases) to play as. Also, the powers upgrade is not quite as user-friendly as it could be. Also, the game engine and its functionality is very similar to the previous chapter of this series. Not much has really changed. Obviously, the graphics are brilliant, but there's not much different, gameplay-wise.But if it ain't broke, don't fix it!This is still one hell of an entertaining play. The interaction with the other heroes, the choices that you make to register or rebel, the guest appearances, and the general coolness factor of being able to play out two of the key storylines of the last several years of the Marvel Universe is just awesome. The main add-on to this sequel is the \"Fusion\" capability. Basically, you can combine your powers with another hero and create unusual and spectacular combat scenarios. It not only recommends, but when all is said and done, it plain DEMANDS a second play so that you can fight from both sides. Because there doesn't seem to be a right or wrong side when you put the argument under the microscope, but any way you slice it for me, I'm siding with Cap.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2009"}

How do you get past a game that requires you to talk to someone but they refuse to talk to you because you did something that made them decide they didn't like you anymore? I finally got the story moving forward again, after no help anywhere online. I found by using a Joke spell on the NPC you could get the key person that it turns out you need to talk to, to talk to you again. After much laughter, all is well and off we go adventuring again. Really? A Joke spell is what was required after I screwed up somehow? By playing my character the way I wanted to play my character...as a man of honor?Just disappointed.

{"product_name":"B007W8S2MG","reviewerName":"Arch Stanton","summary":"A Worthy Chapter in the Persona Series","reviewText":"My main target in this review is to examine the quality of this game for fans of Persona 3. If you want a basic review that looks at this game in isolation then there are plenty of other impressive reviews on this site. It may seem a little harsh to judge the game in comparison to its predecessor, but these games are so unique I can't think of anything else to compare them with. And Persona 4 doesn't come off at all badly in the comparison. No sir. In many ways this is the superior game.First, a question of gameplay and format. This game is divided between fairly standard dungeon crawling and some innovative social gaming tied around the life of a Japanese high school student. The dungeon crawling is a bit repetitive, hindered further by randomly generated dungeons that all look the same. The social gaming is something else entirely. You spend most of your time dealing with time management, dividing your life between schoolwork/social activities and demon fighting. The chance to live out the life of a Japanese teenager is a lot of fun and may leave you with strong flashbacks. I was surprised at how easily I settled back into life as a teenager. Apart from the obvious feeling of control it is hard to explain why this section is such fun. It just is. it's helped by strong side characters and the opportunity to develop stronger relationships with them. Improving your relationships improves your ability to fuse personas of their arcana. This is the same format followed in Persona 3 and, presumably, the upcoming Persona 5. It's hard to argue with success.After the success of Persona 3 this game tried quite hard to make itself unique rather than just a knockoff sequel. To do so it moved the setting from the city to the small country town of Inaba. Everyone knows each other in a small town and this leads to a lot of social stratification. One of the main themes is the gulf between the local kids and those (including you) who moved in from the city. Also moving in from the city is a shopping mall called Junes, which is taking customers away from smaller local stores and causing a lot of resentment. This sort of social commentary was completely absent in Persona 3. A less successful change is the switch from having monsters show up on a full moon to having them show up on foggy days. This feels a bit forced, and makes me hope that future installments will simply list their boss fights in advance so you can better prepare for them. In the end, you usually have about two weeks to complete a castle, but it'd be nice to just have them say that since you don't dare count on it less you run out of time.In another major change the protagonist and his friends are left to discover their abilities by themselves instead of joining a pre-existing team. This leads to a lot of exposition early on that kind of drags the first part of the game. Unlike Persona 3 which gripped me pretty quickly, it took me about fifteen hours to get really into this game. It took over three hours just for the dungeon-crawling segment to appear. By far the biggest change to the game's format is the inclusion of a mystery at the core. There is a serial killer on the loose, who will murder their classmates through supernatural means unless they can stop him. His identity is a closely guarded secret and provides a continual sense of threat. Another major improvement over the last game is the more psychological approach the game takes to the characters. To gain their ability to use personas characters must confront and accept their inner shadow. This shadow is a mirror of them that reflects their innermost secrets and fears. It is a perfect opportunity to see what truly drives these characters. You get to the heart of them in a way that you couldn't just by talking to them.The best aspect of the characters in this game is that who they appear to be on the surface is usually the exact opposite of who they are underneath. The most obvious example of this is Kanji, who appears to be a hard dude of legendary proportions but is secretly gay and confused about his masculinity. Something I've always appreciated about the Persona series is its realistic depiction of friendships. Your initial impression of someone isn't necessarily telling you all there is to know about them and their behavior is different depending on who they're with. They even remember to have traits known to one character but not others. For example, Chie always knew about Yukiko's odd sense of humor because she had been close to her for longer, but when Yukiko started being more open she got a little embarrassed at hearing it in public. And then there are passing moments when you realize that you don't know a character as well as you thought, like when Chie mentions in passing that Yosuke calls her up at night to tell her dirty jokes. Yikes. It's as if these characters have lives that don't always revolve around you.The gameplay has also been improved. Added is the option to control the actions of other characters, which means no more useless game overs because you get hit by a status effect and your teammates are useless. The game still ends if the protagonist gets knocked out, but at least you can reduce your chances of that. There are a few other tweaks to the combat system as well. Now you have to try each different form of attack in order to find out an enemy's weakness. It always seemed a bit cheap to have Yuuka just tell you. Another improvement is the addition of a Defend option, which is so obvious I can't believe that 3 lacked it. Knocking an opponent down is also less effective than in P3 since once they get up they can immediately attack. Fortunately, this applies to your characters as well.The dungeon crawling is still present in excessive amounts, but instead of just going into different floors on one building (Tartarus) each character you rescue has their own castle. These castles all feature essentially the same thing, but they have at least worked on making each new castle feel unique and structured to that character's personality. For example, Yukiko's is basically a prison shaped like her family's hotel while Kanji's is a sauna. They even change the layout of the rooms to better fit the style. Nice. Another plus is that you no longer have to worry about finding a portal every time you want to escape. Instead you use items called Goho-Ms which take you to the entrance. A major difficulty is that the entrance no longer heals you, and paying the fox to do so is reeaally expensive. So your sessions in the TV realm are quite limited in terms of time.Now come the game's few problems. First off, the characters just aren't as memorable as the ones from Persona 3. I quite like Yosuke, Kanji, and some of the others, but Chie is the most annoying character I've seen in this series. It's not just her dialogue, but her voice. I firmly believe in the importance of actors in conveying the tone of a character. Dialogue alone isn't enough to make them bad. Scraping your fingernails on a chalkboard is very irritating for example, but who doesn't love Quint doing it in Jaws? He was just so cool. Here, Chie is both annoyingly written and has an irritatingly high pitched and whiny voice. Her voice is actually the main thing I remember from watching my roommate play this game on the PS2 as she kept screeching \"We're gonna die\" while I was trying to work. It didn't exactly endear the game to me. Most of the other characters are better, but I just miss being in charge of a super-cool team of demon-fighting heroes.An oddity given the game's plot is that it seems rather lighthearted for the Persona series. The lighting is bright and colorful and while the plot goes to some pretty dark places it always returns to the same cheerful world. It's a little bit incongruous with the moodiness inherent in much of the game. The open and communal SEES dormitory, for example, has been replaced with your uncle's cramped house where it's usually just you and your quiet cousin who sits on the floor watching TV since her dad rarely comes home. It feels very lonely and isolated. But then you hit the menu and everything's golden and fine. :-) This is reflected particularly in the character designs from the main character (absurdly cool instead of wannabe hipster) to Teddie (too darn cute). The mystery-centered plot also seems less epic in scale than the end of the world one in Persona 3. It's more focused in that you know the victims personally, but less widespread in that their number is few. This is a more intimate piece and perhaps this is fitting given the small-town setting.The graphics on Golden are greatly improved, though it's hard to tell unless you do a side-by-side comparison. Some of the backgrounds seem to have been rebuilt from scratch to provide a more detailed or realistic setting. Particularly noticeable are the atmospheric effects which were often surprisingly poor on the original, though it seemed fine at the time. More obvious are the improved polygon count which makes circles look like circles. The only thing that hasn't changed much is the character models. I suspect that the texture maps have been improved, but apart from that they look the same as they did originally. And of course everything has been moved around slightly to accomodate the cinematic ratio. They could have just cropped the scenes at top and bottom to make them fit, but instead they redid it entirely to give you a wider view. Does this add significantly to the playing experience? Not really. but it's sure nice to look at. This game could never compete with other Vita games in terms of realistic graphics (see Uncharted: Golden Abyss), but then the Animeesque graphics are part of the style of the piece. And realistic or not it has never looked nicer than it does here.What has changed between theoriginal PS2 versionand the Vita remake? Not a lot from what I can tell. Admittedly, I've never played the original, but I watched my roommate do it and everything looked much the same. The graphics are slightly better, particularly with textures, but the differences are minimal. The biggest addition that I'm aware of is that you can now call for help from other players over the internet. It is such an inconsequential feature that I never used it. More interesting is that you can now access a series of videos from the main menu. These include previously viewed cutscenes and Japanese trailers for previous Persona games. Rather better are the series of video lectures given by Mr. Edogawa from Persona 3, which explain the Jungian philosophy that the game is so strongly influenced by. I appreciate the ability to carry the game with me wherever I go, but if that's not an issue there's very little reason to upgrade to this version if you have the other. The Vita isn't particularly portable anyway.I think it's pretty much the characters alone that make me prefer Persona 3. On almost every other level this game is the equal or superior of that one. The plot is compelling, the gameplay superior, the town charming. But the parts that are superior aren't THAT superior, while the bits that don't hold up drag it down a lot worse. Given the social nature of the game character forms a big part, and there just aren't as many characters that I'll keep in my memory. Look at me, whining about how this game isn't Persona 3. It doesn't have to be. It would have ruined both. This is a game that stands on its own and does so well. I respect it for continuing the same gameplay as its predecessor while being completely different in plot and setting. It is in every way a success. The mere fact that people can argue about which is the superior game proves that. If you liked Persona 3 try this. You won't be disappointed. If you like JRPGs or the idea of social gaming appeals to you then try this game. It may be a bit slow to take off for plot reasons, but once it does so it is immensely fun and highly addictive.Is this better thanPersona 3? No. Is it better than 99% of everything else on the market? Yes. Try it.The three other Persona games are also available in portable format (Persona,Persona 2: Innocent Sin, andPersona 3), although all for the PSP. I'd recommend downloading them through the PSN instead so you can play them on the Vita. The screen is much better for it and having two analog sticks means you don't have to use the upper bumpers to look around. Only Persona 3 has social gaming. The other two are more typical JRPGs with a lot of dungeon-crawling and plot.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2013"}

Where God of War was the maximalist champion, this is hands down the minimalist champ, and once of the most unique gaming experiences I've had, on any system.The rich, lonely world you are dropped into is amplified by the fact that you are the smallest character roaming the land (except for a few squirrels and lizards), and this puts the size contrast into a whole other scale.  Even games like Devil May Cry, where you battle huge bosses doesnt give you the same kind of feeling that SOTC does, one of partial insignificance, and another part incredible hero.  I mean, you ARE toppling foes hundreds of feet tall, after all.I love basically everything about this game (except the level of difficulty).  The \"look\" (from the muted colored rough Colossus to the bright, green fields you cross on your horse) to the sound (musically, this, again, trumps almost any other game I can think of, and everything from the gods language and voices to the gusty winds around the canyons gives the game depth, depth, DEPTH!) makes this more of an interactive, cinematic experience than anything the preceded it.  Sure, new game consoles are a lot more polished than this pinnacle of the PS2, but rarely do they give you the same type of emotive response that this arty little game does, even with higher pixel and frame rates.For what you can pick a copy up for now, this is hands down in the Top-5 \"Must-Have\" games for the PS2.

Master the moves of each character as they race through each environment on their own specially designed track.","reviewerName":"tdl","summary":"This is junk, get the Playstation port","reviewText":"When I bought Sonic Generations on Playstation 3 it instantly became my favorite game. I almost cried when I saw all of the characters Sonic has encountered throughout his life had joined together to celebrate his birthday. I loved each and every level, even the ones I was not familar with. Even Crisis City was somewhat enjoyable. Then I bought the 3DS port and wondered if it was even the same game. It opened the same way as the Playstation version, with classic Sonic running through Green Hill Zone. Then it switched to modern Sonic's party. It was not much of a party. Instead of everybody being at the party it was only Tails. The Time Eater monster comes and wrecks time, although it was just a pitiful picture with no animation. Act 2 of Green Hill Zone starts. Modern Sonic does not even move in 3D. He is basically classic Sonic with a boost function. The Nintendo 3DS can handle a 3D platformer, so why didn't Sega make modern Sonic's levels in 3D? After Casino Night the levels die out. Mushroom Hill was junk. Emerald Coast was a disgrace to the awesome Sonic Adventure game. Radical Highway's level design was almost unplayable. An enemy sits in the background and shoots at you while you wait for a slow platform to come down. Who finds this fun? The modern era was terrible. Sega focused on levels from handheld games for the modern era. So where is that Sonic Advance level? What about Sonic 4? The entire era was wasted on levels from Sonic Colors. After finding the last level (the resort) completly unplayable I gave up. Story Mode was two levels short and felt rushed out. I tried online play. It was okay. I liked seeing what other people's favorite Sonic game was. Racing online was more of a gimmick. And the game had missions mode where I could unlock music and artwork. The only problem is that to unlock a mission I had to spend 5 playcoins. In the Playstation version music and artwork could be unlocked by (1.) finding a red star in the levels or (2.) entering one of the many doors and completing a special objective. But with the 3DS version missions are purchased with hard earned play coins. Music and artwork were kind of useless. The Playstation let me replace the levels theme with the music I had unlocked. Do you want to fight the Death Egg robot to Palmtree Panic? Do you want Green Hill to play the Toxic Caves theme? Then buy the Playstation port. Do you want full 3D cutscenes? Then buy the Playstation port. Do you want levels that are functioning and playable? Then buy the Playstation port. Do you want junk that only takes 30 minutes to beat and to walk a thousand miles so you can unlock something? Then buy the 3DS port. The 3D is not even that impressive.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2012"}
{"product_name":"B005UDTTQ8","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Hughes","summary":"Transformers answer to Batman","reviewText":"For starters this is clearly a 5 out of 5 game.Unlike war for Cybertron each level seems to be much more distinct. That is there is a Cliff Jumper level where you have a cloak to turn invisible and use stealth to sneak kill Decepticons. There is a Jazz level where you use a grappling hook how to grapple around. Both of those levels feel just like Batman Arkham Asylum. There is also a level where you get to command Metroplex to fire his artillery at hoards of Decepticons, you enter Insecticon hives and get to play as Grimlock and Bruticus. All of those levels are just awesome.The only complaint I have is unlike war for Cybertron when you cannot choose a sublevel. For example on the level where you get to play and Bruticus you must play the first half of the level as  Onslaught. My 4 year old son loves playing as Bruticus but I have to play the first part of the level each time to get into that part.Anyway overall I would say this game is more fun than war for Cybertron. So if you love the 80's cartoon you will absolutely love this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2012"}

S.\"","summary":"Different But Still Thrilling!!","reviewText":"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood picks up exactly where AC: II left off.  Ezio is back for another throat slicing, roof hopping, and horse riding adventure.  This time Ezio explores the ancient and holy city of Rome.  Don't worry about it being too small because it's only one city, it's huge!!  It's easily as big as three Venices from AC: II.  There are many new improvements and additions that give this game a different feel from its predecessor.  The boldest and most interesting addition is the online multiplayer.  AC: Brotherhood will be a game you won't forget.Remember those faces from AC: II?  Well they're back!  Uncle Mario, Leonardo and Claudia are just a few ready to stand behind Ezio.  There are also a few new ones, notably Cesare and Lucrezia Borgia.  Voices and movements are great and the graphics got even better.  I have heard about problems, like glitches but I downloaded an update before I started and I haven't noticed any major ones since.One of Ezio's jobs is to renovate Rome.  You buy landmarks, like the Coliseum, you buy stores, like blacksmith, tailor, and doctor, and you solve more of subject 16's puzzles.  Remember the tombs from AC: II?  Well now they have Lairs belonging to followers of Romulus.  The objective and the way you go about it remain the same.  If you complete all 6 lairs, you get Brutus's armor which is very strong like Altiair's'.  Inside you will do a bunch of free running and climbing, sometimes against the clock, or you might have to fight some Romulus followers.Flags, treasures and feathers are back!  You can purchase maps for them and they will pop up on your mini-map.  They not needed for the story, but if you want to get 100% sync and trophies you'll need them.  Speaking of synchronization, for all missions now there will be a certain objective for you to do.  If you don't do it you only get 50% sync on that mission.  Some of the things they will want you to do are: complete in under 8 minutes, use hidden blade to kill target, don't be detected, or some variation of those.  It can get frustrating at times, but you can always go into you DNA and replay any mission again later.The fighting has changed the most.  Remember in AC: II when you had to wait for your enemy to attack before you could perform a counter kill?  Well now you're rewarded for striking first instead of waiting.  You can perform what's called an execution streak, where you successfully kill a guard and then you can kill all the guards around you in one hit each if you can avoid taking damage.  It is a skill that takes some time to learn, but once you pull it off and kill 10 guards before you can blink, you will become addicted to it.  Travel has also changed; you can ride your horse through the city instead of just the country.  There are also tunnels that you can renovate and then zoom around the city to other tunnel stations for free.  Another new and notable feature is the assassin guild you now command.  What you do is find people who are being attacked by the Borgia and you save them, then they are added to your guild, then you send them on missions to gain experience and make you money or you can call on them in battle.  They will jump out and stab your target or shoot arrows.  Once they reach level 10, they become an assassin where they are sworn in and they become very deadly.  It's a helpful tool, since now you don't have to do all the work yourself.The multiplayer is an interesting addition.  You play as characters from the single player campaign (executioner, doctor, nobleman etc.).  Your job in the multiplayer is to find and kill your target while at the same time avoid being killed yourself.  Essentially you are the hunter and the hunted at the same time.  You get more points for stealthy kills and less for not-so-stealthy ones.  For example, if you killed your target from a hay cart or while blended in a crowd, you would get maybe 500-700 points.  But if you were spotted by your target before you killed him, and had to chase him down and stab him, then you would only get maybe 100 points.  See the difference?  Points are added up after each match and bring you up to the next level.  The higher the level you are the more equipment you have.  For example you can get smoke bombs, the ability to morph into someone else for 15 seconds or a super sprint power.The ending of AC: Brotherhood is very climatic, sort of like the AC: II ending.  I can almost guarantee that they will make another sequel, probably with the good men Ezio and Desmond again.  It will most likely be another extension like AC: Brotherhood was and not a new series.  I wonder what they will do for AC: III??  Over all, if you liked the series, you'll like this.\"Nothing is true, everything is permitted.\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2011"}

In this action-comedy, the full cast of voice actors from the TV show and movie reprise their roles to lend the ultimate in authenticity and realism to the game. In The Simpsons Game, Homer, Marge, Bart, and Lisa use exciting, all-new powers to save the world from rising chaos. To help the Simpsons, gamers at home must journey through all of Springfield (as well as vast worlds beyond!), vanquish an amazing array of villains, and fight their way through parodies of multiple popular games.","reviewerName":"A Hot Whizzer Summer...","summary":"A good simpson's title","reviewText":"Overall, the game was good. It had it's faults as well however.Graphics: The games graphics are intended to place 2 dimensional characters in a 3D world similar to many recent comic book games. It does this very well at times. During cutscenes, however, the artistry is horrible. Occasionally, the cartoon cutscenes are nice enough to come strait from the simpson's movie. Other times, they are not even to par with the original simpsons. The characters occasionally look misshaped and distorted in some of the cutscenes, and it is fairly inconsistent when it is nice or crappy graphics.Story: The story is pretty good. It starts out slow, as you are allowed to learn each of the characters powers. Which is weird that they introduce each characters powers so slowly, then suddenly toss a bunch of extra ones at you later in the game with a 2 second tutorial. The game consists of numerous episodes. The primary idea of the game is similar to that of Conker's Bad Fur Day. It constantly makes fun of videogames, and is actually the center of the whole story. If you enjoyed Conkers, then you could probably enjoy this games as well, as this seems like a franchised attached, slightly kid friendlier version of conkers.Gameplay: As others mentioned, the camera is troublesome. Other than that, I found the gameplay to be genuinely fun. The abilities of each character are incredibly unique. Marge can summon people to join her in her fight, and instruct them to attack for her, lisa can use her Buddhist powers to attack enemies and move objects from above, her saxophone can even stun enemies. Each character has 2-3 unique abilities. Each episode uses 2 of the characters (until the last episode), and each characters abilities are needed to get through that episode. So it does face numerous puzzles, although to keep it easy, they usually strait out tell you what character and what special ability is needed to get to the next area. The game also is incredibly diverse. Rather than simply being restricted to punch and use powers the entire time, there are numerous other different types of \"parady game play\" including a space invaders and even DDR.Setting: Besides taking place in springfield, each level as an incredibly diverse range of locations fought through, from a world of chocolate, to a game making factory, to a fantasy rpg world, to a japanese game world. There are numerous different places the simpson's visit, creating a great deal of diversity in your environment. The entire city of springfield is included as a place to walk through as an inbetween for missions. However, there is not much point to it. Besides being a place needed to walk from point a to point b, there just no reason that springfield had to be included at all. It does not offer anything to the gameplay other than a chance to place more \"hidden items\" needed to be found for a 100% score. All of the springfield people walk around, but most of them only possess one or two  one line quips, that in general were not that funny.The game was pretty fun to play, and enjoyable, especially once the story got rolling. It could be frustrating at times, especially when you couldn't figure out what the place or thing they wanted you to do next was. The game got a 4 in my book because it could have been so much better. Had they done more with springfield, such as add minigames or side quests, had they had you characters had stats (like speed or hit combos) they could increase, or unlockable powers, such as alternate ammo for barts slingshot, or perhaps hit combos so you can alternate between hitting and kicking, the game would have been much better. It was a great game though, I just felt it was lacking. Unless you are obsessed with 100%, just play the story through and through, about 8 hours of game play. It's a rental, and I can't say that anything about it was so incredible that I would be inclined to play it again, or go back and get 100%, however I don't regret playing it one bit.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2009"}

{"product_name":"B004QEV0MI","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Bean","summary":"A wacky (and surprisingly restrained) sequel!","reviewText":"'Saints Row 2' is easily one of my favorite games. Unlike the GTA, it was able to push the envelope of wackiness and customization in a sandbox world. 'Saints Row the Third' is surprisingly more restrained than it's predecessor, favoring accessibility and focus over freedom but still manages to be a crazy good time!'Saints Row The Third' starts off with what's arguably the coolest level of any game this year: as the leader of the Saints, a franchised street gang, you and your crew help a famous actor rob a bank....disguised as yourselves. The job goes wrong (waaaaay wrong) and you find yourself at the mercy of a large criminal syndicate. After escaping you land in the city of Steelport and have to fight your way through rival gangs (of hackers, supercops and professional wrestlers) at a chance for revenge...and a takeover. The previous Saints Row games focused on style over narrative substance but I actually found myself caring about the story and main characters (despite them being mass-murdering sociopaths), though the game never takes itself too seriously.The graphics in 'Saints Row the Third', while not overly impressive are much more appealing than the first two games. There's much more detail to buildings and roads and character animations are very expressive. Each cutscene, while adapting to your character's appearance looks like it was taken from an episode of 'Archer' or 'The Venture Bros.' (and certainly shares the same foul-mouthed humor). Steelport is still not as detailed as GTA or even 'Just Cause 2' but it's a servicable sandbox to play in.The gameplay in 'Saints Row the Third' is more accessible and much more streamlined than previous entries. Vehicles all control more-or-less the same way. Gunfights, while a bit on the sluggish side feel more natural and using the L-trigger to aim (instead of clicking R3) is much more satisfying. You can still customize your character's look, gender and clothes but there's not as many options as there were in 'Saints Row 2'. The side activities (which you use to gain money and XP) also aren't as fun. I still like the insurance-fraud mini-game (and gunning down rioting furries at a costume store is a blast!) but I thought pimping, sniping and escorting were a bore.Thankfully, while the side-activities aren't as fun they're no longer necessary to continue the story of 'Saints Row the Third'. The story-missions are easily my favorite part of the game as they have you trailblazing through cyber-space, fighting hordes of zombies, chainsawing professional wrestlers, fighting off military forces with predator missles and base-jumping onto an enemy strongholds; everything I want to do in a video game I did in 'Saints Row The Third'! The one draw-back is that most of the missions are very linear and play out more like a watered down 'Uncharted' than a sandbox game. While this works against the unrestrained tone of the Saints-series the levels are so well-scripted (with excellent music cues) that I really didn't care.Again, 'Saints Row: the Third' can feel like a step backward from it's predecessor in the sandbox department and isn't quite the gonzo masterpiece I was hoping for. However, by the time I finished the story I started up a new character (with ZOMBIE voice!) and jumped right back into the game. Highly recommended!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2011"}

I really wanted to like this thing.  The screen is beautiful and UMD movies look great on it.  However, none of the games I have purchased (e.g. Socom, Killzone, Wipeout Pure) have been able to keep my interest.  They are simply bland in my opinion.  The array of applications installed on the PSP is impressive, but I find several of them difficult to get going.  I have a Mac and was never able to get an mpeg downloaded to the PSP.  The web browser was impossible (for me) to set up.  I have decided to remain an iPod video geek and stick with that.  It is much easier to manage music, photos, and movies through iTunes.  I never did get any kind of media management software for the PSP, so that's probably why I had so much trouble with it.  However, I think that may be indicative of how unappealing the PSP is and how unmotivated I was to familiarize myself with all of the possibilities.  The other thing I didn't like about the PSP was the feel of it in my hands.  It's not ergonomically sound and can be a real pain (literally) after several minutes of use.  Mind you, I am a Sony fan.

This is easily one of the best games out with taking full advantage of the power of Xbox 360 with expanding on everything that has made the franchise great, adding a wealth of technical and gameplay advancements. The game design has included next-generation, high-definition visuals, enhanced AI, an advanced real-time lighting engine and of course new weapons, characters, and challenges. Halo 3 promised an unparalleled first-person shooter experience and, in the end, we got just that with the most compelling and engrossing story in the franchise's history. Halo 3 also redifines the multiplayer experience by boosting a lot more fun than that of the previous Halos and introducing a mode of character customization. With still being the number one multiplayer online delivering on entertainment.Halo 3 is a phenomenal piece of work and is easily one of the best game available on the 360 with loads of replay ability and plenty of entertainment and a unique multiplayer experience that is highly recommended. If for some reason you haven't played this game yet, I recommend that you do so. A true gem in the gaming industry and is simply breathtaking.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2008"}

Fantatic action? Check. Detachable Warthog guns? Check. Epic ending (be sure and watch after the credits!)? Check.The Elite and humans have joined forces since the Arbiter being cast out in Halo 2. Disgraced and distubed by the truth behind the halos he rallied allies and struck a civil war against the covenant. Master chief is now forced to work with the Arbiter who together are burdened with the task of saving the world from total anihilation. What ensues is the best gaming bliss, movie theater experience that I have ever had the pleasure to endure. I loved Halo, hated Halo 2 and can't say enough about Halo 3.The visuals in Halo 3 are absolutely stunning! Of course I have a 42\" LCD Flatscreen HD TV, but even on my sons regular TV it was purely georgeous. The voice acting and onscreen cinematics will/have set the mark for other games to aspire to. When Microsoft first acquired Bungie after the first Halo, I have to admit that I was a bit concerned about the quality of future games from them, thinking that MS would be about money first and quality second and sad to say, Halo 2 confirmed my worst fears. I was on the wire about Halo 3 and refused to listen to any of the hype surrounding it this time around and I have to say that I have never been happier about being proved wrong. Everything about this game is quality. The co-op (split-screen or multi-link) allows for upto 4 players, each playing as a different character from the game. I'm not an online gammer (sick of getting killed 2 seconds after entering a map by some punk named deathmaster) and I was concerned that Bungie might have focused more on the multi-playing aspect like so many other game makers out there today, but I was extremely pleased by the length and quality and fulfillment of playing Halo 3 solo. I know I'm not the only one that does not enjoy playing online, so if you, like me would rather play solo or you can't live without online multi-player access, then don't be afraid to drop $60 on this game. Like Bioshock, pure fun, pure quality.Just buy it already.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2007"}

Personally I give it a 5/10. Bar none, this game LOOKS amazing. The game plays very well. If you've played Far Cry 3 or Blood Dragon, this is familiar territory for how the game drives. The controls are almost identical.BUT this is the part where I feel the game goes awry: The enemies don't change. There isn't one enemy that is easier or harder to kill than the next. Sure new alien enemies are introduced later in the game and you'll either sneak past them or waste an entire clip on them. The enemy AI is sporadic at best. If you're not cloaked, you're spotted. Period. The enemies are limited in each area so there is a finite amount to take out, but if one sees you they ALL know exactly where you are even if you're cloaked. They are easily set off as well. If you look at one through your scope wrong they all see you. Take one out in a place you thought was hidden and no one would find the body, you're dead wrong.The bow that they give you at the start of the game is fantastic (It quite literally drops anything it hits with one arrow), but you can only carry 9 arrows (plus 3 extra of exploding types each). The exploding arrows are great for making a grenade stick to a wall. Unfortunately once you're spotted, the bow is relatively useless. Could have been a really cool addition to the game. After all, The bow in Far Cry 3 is the best damn weapon in that game. You can't get through any Elder Scrolls without a bow. The list goes on. Also unfortunate: the guns in this game also all feel pretty much the same and work pretty much the same. They're all automatic rifles. They all have the same upgrades: silencer, scope, extended mag. The only differences being how much ammo one holds over the other.One thing that attracted me to the game was that it was advertised as sort of a sandbox/open world environment. It's actually EXTREMELY LINEAR! The only way to progress through the game is move forward, activate switch, move forward, activate switch and so on. As a matter of fact, the suit upgrades are hidden throughout the game (instead of earned), and if you move through an area without unlocking the upgrade in that area you missed out. My biggest beef with the upgrades though is that they don't really change the game at all. As we all know, upgrading your character has become a big part of games, and even more so are those upgrades game changers. Games play differently when certain upgrades become available. This one not so much. So even if you miss an upgrade because they are hidden in linear environment you didn't miss much.You play a character named Prophet, yet he knows absolutely nothing at all about anything. He's mostly a machine with human memories (sounds familiar?). Psycho is a British rebel trying to help you. Surprisingly he knows everything there is to know about the enemies. He knows the lay outs of their bases as well as how to infiltrate new areas (sound familiar?). He's armed with a sniper rifle yet never once shoots it. He hides until you've cleared each area even though he's perched to snipe further proving his uselessness. What makes these two characters worse is that Psycho doesn't stop talking through the whole game and Prophet just keeps asking questions and talking about visions he has even though he's technically a robot. Before Prophet shows up, it's just Psycho and his rebel army. They have all the intel in the world on the enemy and are well armed but for some reason they are waiting on you and your bow.Overall, you can take on the game in a two ways (stealthy, or run and gun) but be prepared for a travel from A to B points drag. Because that's how it feels: like a drag. I was excited for it, but bummed when I played it. The enemies don't change and are frustratingly linked to each other. The character is flat. I couldn't give a damn whether he lives or dies (technically the character isn't really alive or dead or human). Psycho, the other character in the game, is just a tired cliche of side kicks that apparently knows all the ins and outs, and the exact lay outs of all the bases, of the enemy but is powerless to do anything at all except get in the way. There are F**K-TON of cut scenes and they are LONG. Take out the cut scenes and you'll get at least 4 hours of game play before you get bored.What makes the game OK and not much else is that it's beautiful and the controls are familiar territory. The graphics and environment are great. The game plays like previous titles from other developers so you don't feel so lost or like you're trying to button mash your way through things. Successfully taking down an enemy silently or stealthily feels so damn rewarding because it is damn near impossible to do without attracting attention. So my first four hours were OK with this game. Then I put it down. Maybe for good because it's just kind of boring and static. The things you see in the trailer that look like a lot of fun (like leaping from a dam, clicking a remote for explosives to blow said dam and enemy helicopters, and hitching a zip line to safety) are actually cut scenes.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2013"}

So I was super excited when I heard Dark Souls was coming to PC, and though everyone has complained about the PC port, DSFix takes care of most of those problems and missing options. I have a GTX 660, so I can run the game at 60fps (with DSFix), but there are some gameplay issues that occur at 60fps such as collision issues and shortened rolling animations (THIS is my biggest issue with the port- it should have at least been optimized to play at 60fps without gameplay problems). Because of this, I play DS at the locked 30fps, which is much more solid on my pc than the console versions which were notorious for frame rate problems. Also, being able to play the game at true 1080p resolution (again through DSFix) makes a HUGE difference- there are so many details I never could make out before on my Xbox360, it's really a beautiful game. Let me say this game was NEVER INTENDED TO BE PLAYED WITH KB/M. Do yourself a favor and get a Xbox 360 wired controller- you won't regret it. Also be aware it uses Games for Windows Live, which is a terrible service, but that's not DS's fault.The extra content is awesome, 2 big new areas with 4 new bosses and lots of new items, and especially cool new armor sets. Really, I couldn't ask for more- I've spent over 200 hours in the world of Dark Souls- it is probably my favorite game of all time and even though it's not perfect, this is the best version available and should get even better as the mod community continues to work on it. I'd love to get some more DLC, but it's unlikely. I really can't wait to see what FROM has next.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2012"}

In this sequel, World War I has started, and a cult has used the chaos to further their own ambitions. Yuri, the hero of the first game, will explore his new powers as he fights this new evil. An engaging strategy epic where you try to survive battles against secret cults and powerful, mysterious wizards.","reviewerName":"Benjamin S. Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"A classic RPG Fans should appreciate!","reviewText":"As Covenant stands it was at least to me the best in the series. The first game while very good still had dated visuals and the Ring of fate system was not quite so polished. From the new world by comparison did everything awesomely and yet despite that fact it seems shorter with a story line not as well contrived. I still strongly suggest you get every game but if a sadistic leprechaun presented you with the choice to only get one Shadow Hearts title Covenant would be the best route.Some people say Covenant had a weak story and I never understood that argument. Firstly it ties into the previous game perfectly and secondly there were many unexpected twists especially concerning Karin the beautiful and sweet German lieutenant.So who is main hero Yuri? Yuri is a harmonixer, a guy like any other save for the fact he can turn into various monsters. To unlock them he must go to a dismal \"graveyard\" in his own mind to fight each of his odd psyches in order to transform into them. Just by that explanation alone Shadow Hearts seems more original then more than half of the rpgs out there.Yet Yuri is presented with a problem. To save the world the girl he loved had to die and Yuri handles all this like a true human being. He swears, he cries, he drinks alcohol , and to make up for things he considers his fault he helps the people in a small German village survive and avoid the persecution of the military. This my friends is why Yuri is so great. He is a good person but he is not perfect and fake like \"most\" of the Final Fantasy-esque heroes out there swinging around their bus sized swords.So what happens? Karin, a beautiful high ranking female soldier is forced to help a Vatican priest named  Nicholas confront \"the demon\" who so happens to be Yuri. Granted Yuri was just protecting kindly villagers and trying to take a nap but naturally the opposition does not see it that way. Nicholas proves to be a jerk infecting Yuri with a curse and after Karin sees \"altar boy\" is an unscrupulous fanatic that has his thugs torment little girls she dumps him in a heart beat to help the good guys.Already Yuri is teamed up with Gepetto a heavy drinking puppeteer with a doll fetish and Blanca , a wolf who is very intelligent and loyal. Those these characters are \"odd\" they are not entirely unbelievable. Regardless Yuri and company set out to find a way to remove his curse and as expected it gets a lot more complicated.In addition to the aforementioned heroes Yuri is joined by Anastasia the adorable princess of Russia, a voluptuous Fortune teller named Luca, a young bishi-looking Japanese samurai, and a jovial wrestler vigilante vampire named Joachim who can make almost anything into an effective weapon.Though that may seem hard to take in every character does have a good background and there are many side quests to increase their abilities.If you missed a lot of the interesting NPCs from the first game fret not because a good majority of them make cameos in Covenant along with dastardly or kinky villains such as the dark magician Rasputin and the sado masochistic Dominatrix Veronica. Covenant has no shame in portraying its' inhabitants as perverts, odd fetish enthusiasts, gay merchants, or sex crazed desperadoes. Even Yuri is hot blooded. While some conservative gamers might find this odd or deplorable I liked it. In Final fantasy so many scantily clad women run around yet all the guys do is sit around talking about delicious pie or how they will get their \"perfect kiss\". Maybe young girls like their neutered \"perfect prince fantasies\" but once said girls become adults they probably agree that RPGS need to address \"human desires\" more often to create a more believable setting.As you can guess Covenant takes place in the wake of World War 1 spanning across Europe and Japan. The thing I love about Shadow Hearts is it uses our own reality to tell its' tales. This is a very original approach I've not seen in many other Japanese rpgs.So through it all you'll laugh, you'll cry, and be fully satisfied after getting both the good ending and bad ending. There's 60+ hours packed into this beautiful beast and you definitely should explore every nook and cranny before serving up pain to the end boss.Pros+ Great sound track+ Interesting \"fictional tale\" interwoven with real history.+ Lovable characters+ Unexpected twists and turns.+ Finishes the story arch from the first game.+ Ring of fate system makes you pay attention and time your button mashes carefully. Whether its' slaying monsters or bartering with merchants it puts an exciting element over the top of what would normally be a boring turn based experience.Cons- The towns are small- Some of the \"stereotypes\" are a bit too over the top and may offend certain players.-Like almost all J-rpgs you are not presented with many choices on how to do things. The way you answer one question near the end of the game determines what ending you get.  It is usually a point A to point B affair and even the map is set up this way.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2008"}

You must interrupt your flow by selecting new exercises in between each set.==> Weight limit of 330 lbs.  If you are really heavy, regardless of your fitness level, this \"game\" is not for you.==> Uses BMI (Body Mass Index) to evaluate your fitness.  BMI is generally a great indicator of healthy weight except that people with large amounts of muscle mass can be mislabeled as obese, regardless of whether or not you can bench-press a truck and run a marathon before breakfast.  BMI is also not very accurate for a lot of children.==> Wii board width.  I wish they would have made it a little wider.  I'm a moderately built guy and I found the push-up positions to be awkward.  The balance board doesn't really allow for much flexibility in how wide you can place your arms.  I imagine that people with much broader shoulders will find this uncomfortable.==> Minimalist graphics.==> Bland music.Overall, I highly recommend this product as a supplement to your regular exercise routine, especially for days when you can't make it into the gym.

After leaving Starbreeze, these talents started MachineGames to continue their passion of making great games, and if Wolfenstein: The New Order is any indication, this studio has a bright future ahead of them.First and foremost, Wolfenstein: The New Order is a single player game. Is that a negative? Not one bit. There are enough multiplayer games out there if that's what you're into, and only a few of them actually succeed, so it's best to leave multiplayer to the games that have people who want that and not waste resources on it when they could be better spent making a meatier and more satisfying single player game, and that's exactly what MachineGames did with Wolfenstein: The New Order. Depending on your style of play, you can get 20 hours out of this game on one playthrough, which is very long for a first-person shooter. In addition, both running & gunning and stealth are viable options since the level design allows for exploration and planning which is important if you're playing stealthily. This also adds replay since there are two different ways you can play the game. As for the shooting, it's so buttery smooth and packs a punch. I haven't played a shooter in a very long time that felt this good. As for stealth, it's pretty basic but satisfying. It's fun throwing knives at the enemy or using a silenced pistol. :)Onto the graphics, this game is available on Xbox One, PS4, PC, Xbox 360 and PS3, so it's a cross-generational release, which means it won't be the most graphically impressive game you've ever seen. Sometimes it looks outstanding, sometimes it looks okay, and other times you'll notice that some textures aren't as detailed as they could be. With that said, Wolfenstein: The New Order is a rarity on consoles like Xbox One and PS4 since it outputs native 1080p resolution and 60 frames-per-second on both.Now the big surprise for me is the story. Wolfenstein was never known for story, but The New Order changes that. Likable protagonists, despised antagonists, all wonderfully voiced and acted. In addition, the soundtrack is tops.Wolfenstein: The New Order surprised me by how good it is. Probably my favorite FPS since Half-Life 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00006FDLP","reviewerName":"KlownArt","summary":"Average Arcade Fighter","reviewText":"Mortal Kombat- Deadly AllianceMortal Kombat Deadly Alliance is the fifth installment in the main Mortal Kombat series. This would be the first game to appear on the PS2, X-Box, and Gamecube so they needed a bang to ensure the continued success of the series. The game is made as if it was an arcade game, but has so many extras it will blow your mind. I want to say there are over 800 extras to unlock. Still, the game doesn't impress me enough to give it anything but a little above average.Graphics- 8/10This was the first Generation of Mortal Kombat to be on the new line of video game systems. Graphics had to be top notch if they wanted to make a good impression. They did deliver on graphics for the most part. All characters in the game look very good and are nicely designed. Each character has three different facial characteristics that change as you are brutalized during a fight. All of this looks exceptionally well done.Arenas are all well designed. They all have similar boundaries and sizes, but overall they are nice looking. Some levels have traps set up; this is a new feature to the Mortal Kombat series. There are statues that spit acid, or ice sickles that get in your way of battle. These usually don't have any major effect on battles, but are better than a flat landscape.Blood has always been a huge factor in Mortal Kombat. Often times this was the only thing that made Mortal Kombat different than other fighting systems. This game however features way too much blood. It flows like a fountain as you hit your opponent. It is far too unrealistic since the only visible place that the characters have cuts on is their face. The blood is too thick and almost looks cartoony.Story- 5/10Liu Kang, the winner of the original Mortal Kombat and Earth's best fighter, has been killed. Shang Tsung and Quan Chi have teamed up and overthrown Shao Kahn, leader of Outworld. After this they quickly assaulted Liu Kang and violently killed him. They have discovered an undead army and are taking souls rise the army. Raiden has established a team of warriors to stop this evil plot. This is all explained in an opening sequence.Honestly, this games story doesn't even matter. The game is an arcade fighter and it just doesn't matter. Once you beat Arcade mode with a character, you will get an ending for them. For the most part, this is a fairly lack luster reward for beating the game.Sound- 7/10The character's grunts and yells all sound fairly well. It is just what you would expect from an arcade fighting game. The music is a low tone background sound. The music never really adds to the gameplay like it should. Also, the music is fairly repetitious.There is however a added music video on the game by Adema. The song is called \"Immortal\" and was designed especially for this game. If you like Metal then you are going to love this song. If you don't then odds are you are going to not care for this song. I wish the song were implemented into the actual gameplay of the game and not just as a bonus.Gameplay- 6/10The game is designed almost exactly like the previous titles. You pick a fighter, and then you fight a bunch of random fights until you reach the boss. The difficulty steadily climbs as you defeat opponents. Overall this is a poor gameplay mode and any fun from it wears off quickly.They have added a Konquest Mode, which is basically just a tutorial mode. This is nice for anyone that doesn't know how to button mash. You can learn the special moves of the characters and some good combos. It's not really fun to play through and only serves as a tutorial on how to do moves.One thing they did right in this game is adding a surplus of extras. As you play through arcade mode you will earns Koins, which you can use to purchase extras from the Crypt. You do not get to choose what extra it is, it is all concealed from you until you purchase something. The more expensive ones are usually things like characters and arenas. Cheaper ones are usually concept art or concept videos. Some of these are nice and some are just plain filler. Overall it makes you want to play through the game to at least to get the more expensive extras.Gameplay itself is broken up by mini-games every three fights you do. One mini-game consists of you watching cups shift around and you try to guess the one that the Mortal Kombat symbol was under. Another has you button mashing to try to raise a bar so you can break something. These are both fairly fun and help break up the tedious gameplay.At the end of the day this is just a fighting game. The engine itself isn't exactly the quality ofSoul Calibur. The characters moves aren't fluid enough and are often robotic. All the characters have three different fighting styles, which helps change up the gameplay. Still, the game is just a average fighter and you won't play it for more than a few hours before becoming bored.Difficulty- 10/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty)The games progression of difficulty is pretty well done. If the game is too easy for you, you can always choose a higher difficulty. If it is too hard, you can choose an easier difficulty. As you play arcade mode, the game will get harder and harder as you beat more people. If you lose enough though, the game will get easier.Even the mini-games have progression. If you lose one, you will get an easier version next time. If you win the mini-game you will get a harder version. This is all a very nice touch. Anyone can play through the game with whatever type of difficulty suits him or her.Overall- 6/10Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance is just not that impressive of a game. The simply arcade type gameplay just is not fun in this day and age. Even the insane extras cannot save this one. The fifth game in this series is just too much of the same old stuff we've been playing for years. Now you have much better graphics, but at the end of the day that doesn't make any difference to a real gamer.If you are looking for a strong fighting game, then just keep on looking. Combat is robotic and just not fun. The gore is fairly bad. The arenas, despite looking different, all have the same layout as far as spacing goes. The story is not important at all. With a game with very little story and bad gameplay, you are basically left with nothing good in a game at all.I cannot recommend this game for anyone. There are too many fighting games that are much better. If you have to buy this game, I will say that the difficulty progression is very well done. Unless you are a truly horrible gamer though, this won't affect you though. I would suggest checking outSoul Calibur,Tekken, orVirtua Fighterbefore even considering this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2008"}

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"Raqel Redfox","summary":"Wii + Wii Sports = 1 Awesome Combo","reviewText":"As far as revolutionary goes, this is one of those systems that's a revolution in the video game industry with its unique motion feature and cool design. I actually downloaded a Wii for my sims in The Sims 2 because it seemed so exciting. My Playstation 3 just seems so big and bulky compared to the small and sleek design of the Wii. It looks great with any furniture set and it doesn't waste that much room either. It's not even complicated to set up and if you think so, the instruction booklet explains everything you have to do to set up your Wii thoroughly. Now I'll start with explaining the features of the Wii:1)Motion-sensing adds a whole new experience for casual gamers and hardcore gamers alike. You can put your Wii remote in anything-a baseball bat, a golf club, a tennis racket, a steering wheel, a gun, you name it. And if you don't like the feel of moving the Wii remote every which way and you'd rather keep it classic, you can just get the Wii classic controller and a grip so you can play classic games like Super Mario Bros. easily.2) There's a whole new genre of gaming with the Wii with motion and other accessories. In Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10, you can swing the golf club as if you would in real golf. In Punch-Out, you can box by smacking the Wii remote into the air to put some serious blows into your opponent. In Jenga, you actually have to pull the blocks out by moving the Wii remote cautiously as to not knock the tower down. In MarioKart Wii, you steer your Wii remote onto a race track to go for first place. In House of the Dead 2 and 3 Return, aim your Wii remote at the TV and destroy zombies. In The Conduit, you can use Wii Speak to speak to other players during gameplay. There are a bunch of possibilities on the Wii.3) The fact that you can play Gamecube games on the Wii would want to make you sell your Gamecube for some good money and keep the games for entertainment on the Wii. The Gamecube games are played as they would be played on the Gamecube with no special differences. For people who didn't own the Gamecube previously, this is a good chance for you to go out and get some good titles that you missed like Luigi's Mansion, Mario Golf, Chibi-Robo, Zelda Four Swords Adventures, Sonic Adventure 2 Battle, Zelda Wind Waker, Smash Bros. Melee, Double Dash, Paper Mario, Resident Evil 1 and 2, Pikmin, King of Fighters 98, Animal Crossing and many more. All you have to do is plug your Gamecube controllers into the Wii, put in a memory card, put in you Gamecube disc, and start playing!4) Next-generation Nintendo games can not be played on any other system. Play games like Animal Crossing City Folk, Metroid Other M, Harvest Moon Tree of Tranquility, New Super Mario Bros. Wii, and many more.5) The Mii Channel allows you to make and customize people to represent you in games. Some games like Sonic and Mario at the Olympic Games and Mario Super Sluggers allow you to use the Mii's in actual gameplay. And in games like Smackdown vs Raw, the Mii's just represent you. There is no limit to how many you make.6) Wii Shop Channel allow you to get games like Super Mario Bros., Super Mario 64, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Mario Kart 64, Donkey Kong Country, Sonic the Hedgehog, and many other games for people that haven't owned Nintendo 64s, Super Nintendo Entertainment Systems, Nintendo Entertainment Systems, Sega Genesis's and even Sega Game Gears. You can get these games for a decent price without having to pay for shipping. You can also buy new channels like a channel where you can access the Internet at any time.7) Other channels like Forecast Channel and News Channel allow you to do other things. The Photo Channel allows you to view photos. The Check Mii Out Channel allows you to look at other peoples' Miis. The Forecast Channel allows you to see the forecast from all around the world, whether it be the five-day forecast or just the current temperature, you can even see what it's like in Antarctica and Tokyo. The News Channel allows you to see news from all around the world instead of having to tune in to news channels on your TV.8) The Home Brew Channel allows you to do many cheats in games. In Sonic and Mario at the Olympic Games, you can play as a Goomba, Jet the Hawk, Silver the Hedgehog, and other scrapped characters. All you need is Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess and a manual on how to get the Home Brew Channel and you're all set.9) Wi-fi allows you to play your video games with people around the world easily.10) Wii Sports is a fun and enjoyable game for beginners with the Wii. You can play golf, boxing, bowling, baseball, and tennis. It's very entertaining.That's most of the Wii's features. You have to have the Wii-you wouldn't regret buying it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2009"}

I generally tear through games and then sell them because I find replayability to be super low. Bioshock is a game that I have replayed a few times (ok I reread books more than I replay Bioshock) and have gotten more out of it each time.Achievement whoring is a way of life with the XB, but Bioshock makes it worth your while, as you learn more about the game or the mechanics of rapture or the characters as you do things like find all the audio diaries or make all the plasmids.My only real complaint is that I wish there was more interaction with the NPCs as opposed to the story entirely being told through the audio diaries. I mean, I get it as a story telling device, and I understand that it adds to the feeling of isolation and confusion, but sometimes I wish the NPCs that you did interact with were a step above reskinned splicers.But really, that complaint is so minimal compared to the awesome storytelling, astounding visuals, and actual depth this game has.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2010"}

Said dictator is not the most loved ruler to begin with - hence the three existing (and bickering) factions that oppose him. As Rico you will undertake missions of destruction to help these factions. Completing these missions awards Chaos points that advances the story missions and unlocks better equipment.The game is just gorgeous! Set in an endless archipelago world of Panau (actually about 1,000km2 or 400ml2) that spans from tropical jungles to snow-caped mountains and dusty badlands you can roam more or less freely. There are seamless day/night cycles but what are really impressive are the weather effects. Like a postal-office worker not rain or snow or sleet can stop Rico - and his clothes will get wet or dusty accordingly.

I did not notice this until I had already opened the box. I am still a loyal WinXP user at home but, luckily, about two months ago I bought a new laptop and, of course, it came with Win7. I never found gaming to be comfortable on laptops (the keys are closer together and laptop mouses not as ergonomic), but this is besides the point.The point is that there was absolutely no reason for this game to exclude about 40% of gamers that still stick with their WinXP as they are compatible with all of our classic games.Moreover, the game requires STEAM to run which means the copy you pay for will never actually become yours to keep. Whether you find this acceptable or not, you can now make an informed decision.All in all, JUST CAUSE 2 is a game with some flaws but it also offers exhilarating fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2010"}

Because everything that can go wrong eventually will. Unfortunately not just in the game.The game is set in a postapocalyptic Russian cityscape where only the lucky(?) commuters in the famous Moscow underground survived the nuclear blasts - and are now tormented by the cruel conditions they have to face. The underground tunnels belong to surviving humans ranging to both ends of the moral spectrum and various mutant creatures, all trying to make the most of their life.And life is harsh. Ammunition is so scarce it is used as currency. So you have to be very careful with your aim. Having to make every shot count may sound fun but the next time you get caught with an almost empty weapon between nasty mutants and bloodthirsty enemies you may long for a more generous game design.The weapons are not many but they are well designed. Both the pre-war and the improvised ones offer more or less realistic mechanics and satisfying results.Light and shadows play an important role and stealth is something you will be thinking quite a lot - especially if you are low on ammunition. The graphics of the environments are detailed and beautiful whereas the movements seem fluid and natural. The game designers aimed in increasing the immersion factor wherever they could (there is no HUD besides your cross-hairs, you have to hit T to take a look at your watch - very important when venturing into the irradiated cities); however, pop-up messages and stuttering take a big bite out of that.METRO 2033 will inevitably be compared toS.T.A.L.K.E.R.. I found that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is more of an RPG (hence its open sandbox nature) whereas METRO 2033 is more of a shooter with a predestined path to follow.The PC I run this maxed out on was a year old system (WinXP SP3, P7 920 on MSI Eclipse with 3GB of RAM and an ASUS nVIDIA GTX260) and the game showed a proneness to stuttering, especially when enemies swarmed. I guess a future patch could take care of that but I would had preferred to receive a finished game and not one rough around its edges.The retail version of METRO 2033 comes withRed Faction: Guerrillaas a bonus. It is not a bad game and, contrary to METRO 2033, it offers more fun than immersion.Finally, even he retail version of the game will require to be tied to a STEAM account. Yes that means ownership of your game will be stolen back and you will be allowed to play with it but not actually keep it.

I have since sold both the 360 and the game but I was really happy to hear this great game was coming to PC and picked it up. I play only single player and have played this through several times.First of all it is indeed your typical messy console port in terms of compatibility and bugginess. Even to now it never really got Epics/Microsofts full attention like the patches being a relative pain to find.1. I had no problem with WinXP SP2 install but recently I got the SP3 and a new computer and installed this on it. With SP3 it has a bug that basically makes it impossible to install it, fortunately as of about a week ago there is a Live Hotfix that fixed the problem and now I have no problem installing or playing.2. My last computer, a 2 year old AMD X2 3800+, had a real hard time in the cutscenes/post processing with overheating and thus crashing the game. My new Intel E5200 DC runs much cooler and much more stable as well as faster, so older computers and graphics cards will probably run this on medium or even low settings. I'm on all high at 1680x1050, XFX 8800GT, 4GB RAM, with the post-process settings on low for stability.3. You absolutely need at least the first \"title update\" patch from Epic to get a decent non-crashing game. This would routinely crash and at certain times in the game, like the first Berserker encounter, would point the camera straight up and revert to Xbox 360 gamepad on screen keytips. Also even with the patch if you adjust the brightness/contrast settings it doesn't really work until after a couple of play sessions later for some reason. This was true of sound settings as well. Also during particularly heavy battles and cutscenes it would crash. This crash prone aspect is going to be the biggest issue for MANY people playing this game and was a real problem when the PC version first came out. Most drivers associated with gaming need to be up to the release date of this game.4. Typical Windows Live Junk. I sometimes like to use a trainer cheat for particularly difficult parts of the game to cut down on the frustration factor. WL games constantly check for interference from things like trainers and crash the game when they are detected, why they do this is anyone's guess, mine is anti-piracy but how would a trainer be a piracy issue? Also the whole sign in junk is dumb as well as the prompt to opt in to their feedback/monitoring, no thanks and my non-Windows firewall will enforce that too.5. Some of the technology needs to be consistent with the other tech. Battle rifles would have built in 4x or more zoom scopes as well as perhaps being non-powder based projectiles. Reload would be perhaps more sparse or even eliminated with advanced weapons. Lasers or other advanced weapons systems would be in place as well as more non-mechanical interfaces for opening doors and other things in general. More auto features would be there as well, like battle drones as well as maybe active armor systems and during the driving section you would have auto sector scanning and firing on the killer bats. Communications systems would be more advanced and visual rather than the radio based systems in game, see Deadspace. The hammer of dawn satellites would be available most of the time, not some of the time, I can get a GPS reading in doors today. I'm an engineer so I guess I notice this sort of thing more than others would though.That being said this game, once you get it stable, is awesome and has some substantial PC-only add-ons from a single player standpoint.1. Cover combat and camera is awesome. The cover system is really great and the movement is fluid and easy to achieve with the space key. The camera is well done, always moving and giving a real sense of dynamic action and physical exertion of the player. Combat itself feels very fluid and fun to play with not too complicated key setups, other than the reload timing minigame button which is better as the middle mouse/wheel pushdown button, not the default R button. Blood splatter is really cool to look at. Running is really cool tunnel vision crouch looking, but should have included a regular running mode in upright as well, characters do walk pretty slowly but what do you expect with that amount of armor? The chainsaw is just sick to use, very brutal. Again the camera is so well done in this game!2. Graphics are still awesome in 2008 terms. Most of the environment is really top notch in terms of textures and detail. The characters are really nice to look at both in body and face as well as the weapons. For me this is a benchmark for other games in terms of next gen qualifications along with Crysis. Bosses are really amazing to look at while in actual gameplay too. You need a better graphics card as well as at least 2GB RAM to get this in decent settings. A cooler running CPU would be important too. Even with that keep the post-processing as low as possible and the cutscene settings low as well and don't turn on Vsync for your life! You'd probably need one of those psycho gaming 2000+ dollar rigs to get this all on insane levels stably.3. There is a pretty good extra PC only level that is not an afterthought type of thing. This adds value to the single player only people as well as probably the MPs. This gives the feeling to a more complete game to me in comparison to the 360 version. The COG tag finding is a good exploration motivator as well, available on both versions.4. Sound is great overall. The music is immersive and original with parts reminiscent of the Predator movie soundtrack. If you have a decent speaker setup it is really responsive to where the sound is coming from in the game such as enemy banter and fire. Voices are well done, the guy who is bender in Futurama is the main character as well as that guy from Aliens 2 being a character voice.  Weapon fire is pretty good, somewhat generic for some of the standard weapons.This game is definitely recommended a year after pc release because most of the bugs have been worked out by now with patches and the price is outstanding as well as most current systems/graphics cards won't have much of a problem running it either. The story is interesting and is not just dumped on you in whole, clearly worked out for sequels. Too bad we'll have to wait a few months to get GOW2 on PC!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2008"}

The stand never feels good.  It seems like the 3DS is just about to slip off and fall on the floor.  Since you have to use the stand, the problem of height slaps you in the face.

It was not high enough.  Nor did it feel any where near good or comfortable when I was playing.

Within these areas, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Hollywood, Mulholland Drive and Downtown LA, players are free to engage in mission play driving them to attain and customize a wide range of authentic world-class street racing vehicles, or to simply explore the city, taking on all comers in a variety of race types as they wish. Regardless, along the way they will experience not only the visual realism of the iconic boulevards, freeways, and landmarks made famous in TV and movies, but also the realism of the living breathing LA urban experience. Here traffic backs up then clears as people go to and leave work for the day, weather systems come and go and day turns to night, then back again. All the while the race goes on. It's all part of the living, breathing LA. It's all part of theMidnight Club.The CarsMidnight Club: Los Angeleswill feature an astounding selection of vehicles in the Muscle Car, Exotics, Tuners, Motorcycle and Luxury car categories.

From making sure your car is dripping in candy paint, to adding unique body kits and jaw dropping extras, the garage offers practically limitless possibilities to personalize your vehicle with aftermarket accessories and customizable options.Interior- Don't embarrass yourself by pulling up with an outrageously kitted-up car that has a 'me-too' factory interior. Not a good look! You're going to be spending a lot of time behind the wheel, so renovate and make yourself feel comfortable.Beware or Befriend the Local CompetitionThe street racing scene ofMidnight Clubis tough, but tight, meaning that everyone that you meet in expansiveLos Angelescould just as easily be an ally as an enemy. One thing is for certain though, they are all willing to throw down at the drop of a hat.

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists.

The magnetite system (an alternate form of currency used to summon and keep demons) is an interesting incentive to not flee from every battle like you would in any other game. The voice acting is well done, but a little repetitive when in shops (prepare to hear \"What will you do?\" until you puke).

Schultz","summary":"The Fantasy Holds True","reviewText":"First let me start off by saying that this was the first game I played in the Final Fantasy series, so I can not compare it to any of the others.  That is, however, not a bad thing.  It means I'm not a fanboy and can give you an un-biased review, not that FF Fans can't but you see where I'm going with this.I got X shortly after getting a PS2 (I got my PS2 only a year and a half or two years ago) and enjoyed it quite a bit, but somehow lost interest halfway through.  Not sure why.  I was stuck on a boss (first Seymour) and got irritated, but beat him and got to the next save point only to not pick up the game again.  But then I realized \"What's my problem?\" and started over recently.From the start of the new file I couldn't help but wonder why I had ever stopped.  The characters are captiviating and interesting, it's fun to watch them interact, the graphics are (sometimes) stunning and always at least above average.  I love the music from Otherworld to Fight With Seymour.  All the tunes are either emotional or fun or fast or get stuck in your head.  Some of Mister Uematsu's finest.  The storyline starts out simply enough, but eventually develops into more mature and adult themes like religion's conflict with tradition and the modern times, racism, war, etc.  There are enough sidequests and sidebosses to keep you interested long past the main storyline, though not as many as I'd have imagined.  All in all, though, it's really just wonderful.  Some of the acting in the cutscenes is ludicrous (see the infamous \"laughing scene\") but that's not too often.  I also like the Sphere Grid (the system for leveling) and think it's a nice, non-linear alternative to projected paths of what the character turns out like.  Blitzball, however, isn't fun.  Good thing about that is you only HAVE to play it once.Pros.Great graphics, music, characters, storyline, battle system, weapon upgrade system, voice acting, leveling system.Cons.A tad short for an RPG (tad meaning not very much, it's long enough), sometimes laughable acting (you'll know what I'm talking about), and enigmatic ending.When it all comes down to it, though, you're getting a five-star game for $10 used.  And you really can't beat that.  This is an A-grade RPG at a C+ price and you just can't go wrong.

They've earned platinum on that beast. And I would be willing to bet they hate this game. I, on the other hand, could tell you values for bullet damage on every gun in the last 2 CoD entries and right now am plowing through the multiplayer on KZ3, but when I want a change of pace, a game like DAII is just what the doctor ordered.Why? It's easy. Not in a bad way, easy, but easy in the sense that you can navigate where you want to go, upgrades, skill trees, inventory and equipment - all pretty simple. I have yet to have a weapon break or degrade, when I pick up useless junk that is only to be sold for coin, it goes into the junk pile on it's own. Battles are lots of button mashing combined with some skill moves mixed in on a simple timer. It requires some strategy, i.e. take out the healers or larger enemies first, but I don't find myself pausing the game frequently to micromanage every party member's moves. Just do your best not to get into the middle of a circle of bad guys and you should be okay.For the most part the game looks good, definately better than Dragon Age, but still not as good Red Dead Redemption. It follows the - \"it looks good for an RPG\" mantra. Some of the character models are dynamite, some are terrible. The same goes for the environments. Universally, the battles look great, so I still give it a big thumbs up.DAII is buggy, apparently that's par for the course for Bioware though, as Mass Effect 1&2 and Dragon age all had there share of technical hiccups. I've had none of the serious crashing some have had, but I have had a couple hard resets. Fortunately auto saves are so frequent, it didn't really matter. Also, there are a lot of loading screens, Gran Turismo thinks there are too many. It would have been nice if they could have found a way to stream some of the rooms within the city walls.Overall, DAII plays a bit like Fable. Based on past support from Bioware, it's likely that there will be high quality DLC after the game has been completed and it's fun to sit down for a couple hours to play. If you are a hardcore RPG nut, DA is probably 2-3 stars (maybe), but for the casual RPG fan, easily 4 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2011"}

Whether you were exploring an abandoned mansion, an eerie police department, or the streets of Raccoon City, the games had zombies, creatures, and even a huge, 8-foot tall guy in a trench-coat and a rocket launcher. However, ever since RE4, the series has been changing from a survival horror game to an all-out action game. Some people, once loyal fans of the series, have abandoned the series entirely, claiming it no longer had any scares. While this is definitely true, I am not a part of this group. I, as an action fan myself, can safely say that Resident Evil 5 is a fantastic game.The story takes place in Africa. Classic RE character Chris Redfield, and his partner, newcomer Sheva Alomar, are both members of the B.S.A.A., a global organization created to prevent bio-terrorist attacks. Chris and Sheva are there to investigate bio-terrorist activity. As you can imagine, things go horribly wrong. Chris and Sheva are attacked by a new type of creature, the Majini. The duo must figure out what is behind the outbreak, and how to stop them.The story, while pretty good, is a bit lacking compared to other entries in the series. While there are classic characters that return in the game, the games plot is still a bit too simple compared to other entries in the series, where there was a lot of backstory and characters with different agendas. In this game, the story basically boils down to \"go to Africa, stop the outbreak.\"Before I get into the gameplay, it is important to note that this game was designed as a co-op game. You can play this game by yourself, but by doing so, you miss out on a lot of the fun that you get when you play in co-op mode. While the AI partner is okay, she isn't quite intelligent enough to hold her own against a horde of Majini. On top of that, she needs to be revived when downed, you are forced to heal her when she's hurt, and she will waste the precious ammo that you give her. While its not bad, you are doing yourself a disservice by playing by yourself.Any negatives about the game in single-player are completely blown away when you play the game with a friend. This is a game where cooperation and skill are required to survive. The feeling of working together against the enemies you face by cooperating with your partner is incredibly fun, and makes the game an absolute blast to play through.There are many weapons in the game, and all of them can be upgraded with the money you earn. While some upgrades don't really make any sense (you can get a triple-barrel shotgun that has a ten-bullet clip) but they are definitely worth the investment. You can also buy infinite ammo by saving up the points you earn. However, infinite ammo takes away a lot of the tension that makes the game so much fun. The feeling of getting chased down by a Majini with a chainsaw with no ammo left, only to be saved by your buddy is an exhilarating experience. A lot of that tension is lost when you can simply blast away at the chainsaw Majini without any fear of running out of ammo. Luckily, infinite ammo is optional, so I would recommend not buying it.The game is about 7-10 hours long. While this is short compared to the length of RE4, the co-op adds enough replay value to it that I was playing through it many times with my friend just to find every treasure, get every BSAA emblem, and find all of the weapons. There is also the infamous \"Mercenaries\" mode that is unlocked after beating the game. This mode pits you against hordes of Majini in an arcade-style, score-based mini-game. While this mode is mostly just a slight diversion from the main game, there are extra characters to unlock, as well as a slew of maps to play on. The mode also supports co-op.The graphics in RE5 are nothing short of stunning. Amazing lighting effects, detailed environments, and great creature designs are just the tip of the iceberg in the graphics department. The audio is also fantastic, with great voice acting (with the exception of Irving... just wait until you hear his voice), awesome sound effects, as well as great music.Overall, Resident Evil 5 is a fantastic game. With addictive gameplay, stunning graphics and a lot of replay value, the game is nowhere near as bad as people say it is. If you're looking for a Resident Evil game that will scare you like RE1 or RE2, go replay one of those classics, or try out Dead Space, which is an absolutely terrifying game. However, if you want a co-op game that features amazing graphics and fantastic action, Resident Evil 5 is right up your alley.Story: 7.0Graphics: 10.0Audio: 9.0Gameplay: 9.0Replay Value: 8.0Overall Score: 8.5 out of 10-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------DLCWith the Gold Edition, you get all of the DLC for the game along with the game itself. I will go over each of the DLC packs individually.Versus mode is exactly what it sounds like - you have to kill other players, as well as the usual assortment of Majini. I thought this mode would be bland and forgettable, but it is actually quite fun if you get three other friends together. There are two modes - Slayers and Survivors. Slayers is basically four-person competitive Mercenaries. You get points for killing Majini, and while you can still shoot other players, I found this mode more fun when you are working together with your teammates, but still trying to get a better score than them. Survivors is just straight-up deathmatch. You only get points for killing other players, and there are weapons littered around the level to pick up. I found Slayers to be the preferable mode, but Survivors is still fun. There are also team variations of these two modes, but I prefer the free-for-all modes.Lost In Nightmares is, in my opinion, the best DLC the game has to offer. In this DLC, You are in Spencer's estate, which is a mansion modeled after the one in the Arklay Mountains that you explored in the first Resident Evil. This means that the first half of this DLC is extremely familiar. However, the creatures that chase you in the mansion are much more terrifying than any zombie. That's right - this DLC can actually be pretty scary and tense. There are also small little details around the mansion that are references to the first Resident Evil, such as a diary in which a lab worker describes his transformation into a creature (\"itchy and scratchy\") and a segment where Jill must play the Moonlight Sonata to open a door for Chris to enter.However, once you enter the basement of the mansion, things get different. In the last part of the expansion, you and your partner lose all of your weapons, and must use traps to kill the creatures to collect emblems to open a door. The part of the DLC is easily the best, because it forces cooperation between you and your buddy to collect the cranks, lift the spiked ceiling, and have your partner lure the creature to the trap and kill him. Overall, this expansion is the best of the bonus content.*SPOILERS AHEAD*The other major DLC pack is Desperate Escape, where Jill Valentine and Josh Stone must escape the Tricell facility that Chris and Sheva blasted their way through in the main campaign.This DLC, unlike Lost in Nightmares, is action-packed, just like the main campaign. There are explosions, gunfire, hordes Majini - you get the idea. There isn't as much to talk about in this DLC, unlike Lost in Nightmares, so I'll be brief. This DLC is pretty good, but a bit too similar to the main campaign for my tastes. I much preferred the unique feel of Lost in Nightmares. However, it is still pretty fun, but it is nowhere near as solid as the other DLC.Finally, there is Mercenaries Reunion, which is basically Mercenaries mode, but with different characters. It may just be me, but there also seems to be more Majini than there were in the standard Mercenaries mode. Again, it may just be me. All the new characters are awesome, especially characters like Barry Burton, with his sniper rifle, handgun, and revolver, and Chris Redfield's \"warrior\" outfit, which comes packed with a handgun, rifle, and an amazing shotgun. There are no new maps in Mercenaries Reunion, unfortunately, but Mercenaries Reunion is still a great mode that's even better with a friend.Overall, the DLC for the game is extremely fun. Even fans of the older Resident Evil games should try out Lost in Nightmares, as it is extremely fun and terrifying. If you already have RE5, then you should buy the DLC separately. However, if you haven't played RE5, then this is the edition to get.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2013"}

I'm always looking for cheaper alternatives to other products, as long as they work well.  With this Bluetooth headset, you're not getting the feature-rich products of other, much more expensive headsets.  Like most Bluetooth devices, you have to pair this one with your Playstation 3, instead of simply plugging it in.  It paired quickly and effortlessly (it also worked with my cellphone; however, I don't think I'd use it for that).The sound quality is decent.  It's not the best I've used, but you're also looking at a ~$20 headset.  It fit comfortably over my ear, though it seems to be designed for right ear only.  The battery life usually lasts an afternoon of playing and typically took 3 or so hours to charge.Personally, I'd look towards other more expensive headsets in the future; however, for the budget conscious buyer, this is a great headset for the price.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2013"}

The handheld also requires an adapter when connecting with GBA players, since it can't use the old cables.","reviewerName":"Lucas Black","summary":"Could be the perfect handheld game machine","reviewText":"In a world where handheld consoles keep getting more powerful, they sure don't keep getting smaller.  The original Nintendo DS was pretty huge, hardly pocket sized.  And even the DSi which I also own will fill a pocket and create a large, blocky outline.  Sony's PSP offering is thinner but also longer and has that large, easily-scratched screen.  When considering a handheld gaming device, one has to consider portability almost at the top of the list.  The Micro was designed to perfectly fit that task.  Sure, the Gameboy Advance is essentially a dead console considering companies no longer make new games for it, but there's still a trove of gems out there to be bought, and often very cheap on the used market.  That leaves the machine itself.  It's tiny, but still perfectly handy.  Your thumbs might cramp up if you hold it a certain way, but if you keep them straight over the face of the machine it's not an issue.  The screen is small, but the colors are so crisp and the screen so bright (adjustable to be dimmer if playing in a dark room) that you hardly notice unless you play it right next to someone playing a GBA game on a DS.The modular faceplate design is especially smart, because if you get more scratches on the screen than you'd like, simply remove the faceplate and put on another one.  With this ability, your screen can stay essentially perfect indefinitely.  It also lets you change the look of your machine.  Perhaps: silver for dressy occasions, camouflage for outdoor activities and sports, red for playing at home... or just whichever color you like most.The Micro has a headphone jack for headphones (unlike the GBA SP), which is advisable because the tiny speaker holes can be easily covered with your thumb, and the speaker is honestly not very powerful.  The on-off switch is recessed well into the bottom of the machine so as to not be hit accidentally unlike some GBA/DS iterations (I'm looking at you, original DS...) but the volume/brightness control is button-based, rather than operated with a slider, so volume/brightness can't be changed with the unit off.  As for negative aspects of the Micro, the shoulder tabs are operated by buttons hidden underneath that are located closer to the middle of the unit than the corners, so one has to place their index fingers farther over the tops of the corners to reliably actuate them, unlike in units like the DSi where simply tapping on the very corners will suffice.  This will often not be a problem, but it's worth noting.Overall the Gameboy Micro is an excellent choice for a handheld console, even in an age of technically superior ones.  Finally a portable unit that I can actually take everywhere.  If you plan on buying a handheld to be used primarily on-the-go, this might be the best option.  If you almost always play handhelds at home anyway, you may as well go for a DS Lite, DSi XL (and in a few months when mroe games come out, the 3DS) or PSP.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2011"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E5OE","description":"","reviewerName":"DL","summary":"So you probably already read the other reviews","reviewText":"Let me start with a couple pieces of background...I love football, both college and pro. I have been buying and spending many, many hours playing both NCAA and Madden football for 8+ years. Now then...I didn't have much interest in buying Madden 12 due to basically getting the same game year after year. I've grown tired of spending $60 on a game that hasn't been worth $60 in about four years. The only reason I had bought the game the previous four years in a row was for updated rosters, new game modes, and slightly improved player model graphics. For some reason I thought this year would be better. Madden and EA sports are pros when it comes to getting the hype machine running at full steam!Here are some of the highs and lows I have noticed so far.Good-Graphics for players and stadiums are clean and crisp-Franchise and Superstar mode have enough new and improved tweaks to keep you busy-The bidding system is awesome!-Lots of realistic tackling animations-Not every single pass that hits the hands the defense is interceptedBad-Commentary, are you serious? This is beyond a major step back!!!-Loading screens froze on me several times, mostly in Superstar mode-Menus are unresponsive and sluggish at times-Linebackers will knock down every pass you throw that comes within eight yards of them-The intros for each team running onto the field, hard to believe how much they tried to hype that-Common sense?! I won a game today 21-14 and the player of the game was a Cornerback with 0 tackles, 0 interceptions, 0 touchdowns. Where is the common sense?You might be thinking, those things you complained about are not that big of a deal. These are just some of the things that have been annoying me about the game that should have easily been fixed by EA. Will we see DLC to fix any of these problems? NO, not while EA is the only game in town!Madden 12 does not completely live up to the hype. If this is the first Madden game you have ever played then you will probably love it. For the rest of us that have bought it every single year this is by far the most disposable installment in the games history. If you must get your 2012 football fix then I highly suggest buying NCAA 12 over Madden 12. Or simply wait six months and buy Madden 12 for $20-30. 3  stars...if you bought this game for strictly online play or Franchise mode then 4 stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2011"}
