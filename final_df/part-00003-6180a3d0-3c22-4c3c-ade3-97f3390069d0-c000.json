{"product_name":"B00BMFIXT2","description":"","reviewerName":"Son of Tiamat","summary":"A brilliant and addictive experience that likes to troll you","reviewText":"First off, I'm a newcomer to the AC series. I've known about it since it first came out but didn't have a 7th gen console to play the first back in '07. As such, I only followed it from the sidelines, that is until Black Flag was announced. Much as I love this game, there is much that annoys and frustrates me which I will get to after I've addressed all the positives.The main feature of this game, piloting your own ship as you navigate the Caribbean to pillage and plunder, plays better than I had hoped. You really get the feel of controlling the seemingly massive ship as you steer across a constantly shifting landscape of rolling waves. To control a ship from the perspective of the pilot, moving the massive wheel and watching the entire vessel turn slowly, would have been an amazing novelty on its own, but it's the water physics that make this experience shine. Your boat will be tossed and turned by waves, winds and storms as you sail from place to place, making even the mundane task of travel a fun and stimulating exercise. Patrolling the landscape of, say, Skyrim was already fun, but in Black Flag, the landscape is never static and you feel as if the world is interacting with you as much as your are interacting with it. I seriously can't help but smile with childish glee as I watch my ship sail around at Travel Speed, the camera following at a distance while my crew sings Sea Chanties. (I actually love finding new chanties around the game because I can't wait to hear what new song my crew has learned!).The first time I piloted a ship through a fierce storm after escaping from a British ship and saving several others who would become my loyal crew, my jaw dropped in awe. Imagine the gut clenching tension of going up a roller coaster as you feel the world angle upwards, waiting for the inevitable drop with fear and excitement. This was the feeling I got when I sailed into a large wave head on, braving its onslaught to avoid the pummeling it would have given me had I tried to turn away in vain.This is your inception into the world of Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag. It grabs you by the seat of your pants and throws you into the experience, and what an experience it is.The sandbox (or fish tank, as it were) is a world with plenty to do and explore as you travel around collecting treasures and other collectibles both on land and at sea. The main theme of being a pirate is put side to side with that of being an assassin without one overshadowing the other. You will patrol the waves, looking through your spy glass at targets to strike. Once you've taken their load of commercial items, you can sell them for money or use to continually upgrade you ship into a mighty vessel that can stand up to even the most powerful of ships. The weapons at your disposal include cannons fired from the sides of your ship, featuring standard ammunition which is infinite, and heavy shot which packs a punch but has less range. Front cannons fire chain shots which slow down your victim, and mortar fires powerful shots far overhead to strike vessels and forts from a safer distance. The waves move enemy vessels as much as they move you, an element to take advantage of. Angling your shots over a particularly large wave which simultaneously shields you from the enemy's fire is a strategy that works well.Once you've crippled a ship, you can then sail up close to it for the boarding process. These segments are fun, but also one the sources of the game's needless frustrations. Most often, conquering a ship will be as simple as killing a set amount of soldiers and their officers before they surrender. Other times, however, you'll have to kill scouts up in crows nests or, I kid you not, destroy the enemy flag. While these segments show off the mechanics of parkour on a ships rafters they usually amount to tedious tasks that force you to jump around looking for the proper footing while the swords clash below. I can't help by feel like I could be doing something more important, like helping my crew while they're getting killed off, instead of climbing to the top of the ship for a freaking flag. I feel like ship parkour is being forced on me. Yeah, it's cool and all but most of the time it's impractical, so why does it have to make you do it? I need to be fighting with my crew and helping them before they get killed!Which brings me to the combat. It's apparent that Ubisoft was trying to emulate the combat from the Arkham games, what with your character, Edward, being able to fight and parry multiple enemies at once. But whereas Arkham City feels fast, fluid and intuitive, this game feel more like a button masher with clunky gameplay. The combat is not terrible mind you. Grabbing an enemy to use as human shield before an enemy can shoot is fun and movie like, but in the end, a movie is all if feels like since I'm only hitting buttons when the prompt comes up. Not quite QTE but not as involving as it could be.(Editor's note: before anyone tries to tell me again that this style of combat existed first in the Ass Creed series before the Arkham series, let me remind YOU that it in fact existed before either in the Matrix video games for the PS2. And if I make more of a comparison between the Batman games and the Matrix games, it's because both had more refined combat whereas this is sluggish, so there. Don't you feel clever now with your passive-aggressive, cutesy emoticons)Having read other people's reviews on various AC games, I find myself plagued by similar grievances addressed by them in the past, such as the story based missions. Sneaking around as an assassin is fun but sometimes absurd. There are times when you need to jump carefully from place with swiftness and then there are times when you just need to take it slow. But in AC there doesn't seem to be a button for sneaking. You're either walking or running from bush to bush to conceal yourself, not moving slowly in a crouched walk like you ought to. It makes me pine for the days of MGS3: Snake Eater when sneaking around was a simple and easy on my nerves as crawling from bush to bush. Sneaking feels hit or miss in AC 4. It's either fun or frustrating.It's especially frustrating when you've spent an entire segment sneaking your way through without getting seen, and getting caught anyway as the story dictates. After all that, I feel like I've been trolled by the game (because I just spent the last twenty minutes trying and failing over and over just because I didn't act fast enough or failed to notice that one guard!).Even more frustrating are the segments when you have to tail someone just to listen in on their dialogue. I'm too concerned with not getting spotted and staying within the designated listening range to pay attention to what they're saying, so I imagine Edward can't concentrate on what they're saying either (why do you make me do this, game!).For as much as you'd be led to believe there are multiple ways around a situation sometimes there's only one, and not following this very narrow setup as the game dictates will only result in more punishment, via being forced to do it all over again.Fortunately, only the story segments are like this. The rest of the time you can approach a situation however you'd like to during the small time assassinations peppered throughout the game. Sneaking around (when it works) and silently dispatching your hit without anyone seeing is a rewarding thrill, as is running away by scaling rooftops and trees. Although, parkour on trees is very hit or miss as it's not often clear which tree you're supposed to jump to. And trying to climb higher up a tree will have you inadvertently jumping off, which means climbing back up again! But probably the worst climbing segment is when you have to climb a windmill to talk to an important character (who just HAD to choose a dangerous place to climb up to). Be prepared to die a couple times trying not to fall off the spinning blades. Also, as pointed out by another reviewer who hated AC3, sudden QTEs with dangerous predators leaping at you is not very fun at all.What it all amounts to is that AC 4 is such an amazing and addictive game that the occasional moments of frustration will seem all the worse when the game mechanics suddenly feel awkward or asinine. If feels like a truly great game is trying to get out but is being held back by the status quo of the series. This makes you, the player, feel held back whenever a task seems too demanding or when you're reminded that this is all a simulation in the Animus. You're actually some nameless dude sitting at a desk at Abstergo and you have to keep the memories of Edward synchronized or the whole thing goes Matrix on you and the maritime environments suddenly look digitized. I didn't get into the .Hack// JRPGs because I didn't like the idea of a video game about a video game so why does AC need to have this whole Animus conceit? I don't care about the present day, I care about the past! Isn't the whole point of games to escape sometimes and forget reality?Well, anyways this game is still amazing and I strongly recommend it. Just be prepared for frustration to come in the wake (no pun intended) of great fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000WEQL02","reviewerName":"Amozarte","summary":"Great co-op, but not at the expense of solo campaign","reviewText":"Despite giving the impression of a \"more of the same\" sequel prior to launch, RSV2 managed to win my heart in ways the first could never imagine.  There are still a few problems, but overall the game is adequately polished and highly addictive.A tactical shooter, by definition, is geared toward teamwork and strategy.  It only seems natural that such a game should offer a truly superb cooperative experience and RSV2 does just that.  Be it split-screen, co-op campaign, or even terrorist hunting, there is a heap of great team-oriented play to be had here.The best part is that in delivering a co-op smorgasbord, RSV2 (unlike certain other co-op focused games) didn't sacrifice the single player campaign.  With seven acts consisting of several scenes each, you've got hours and hours of solo play available as well.  The scenes and environments, though not particularly unique to Las Vegas, are extremely detailed and offer wide variety.  My favourite place involved an indoor rock-climbing facility- an extremely creative idea, in my opinion.The pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance for me was the character development through experience.  Your character, complete with the myriad of possible unique armour, clothing and weapon combinations, are persistent throughout any game mode- online or off.For all its glory, though, the game is not entirely without flaws.  As cool as most of the unlockables were, some just didn't make sense.  Who thought that pink camouflage was a great idea for a high-level reward?  The AI is also still more A than I, with terrorists stupidly running into your crosshairs despite how many already felt your wrath.  Your teammates can also be complete dolts when it comes to ordering grenade tosses or staying within the cover of their own smoke.In spite of these minor blemishes, the bigger picture of RSV2 is still quite magnificent.  Online or off, there is enough replay value here to last a very long time.  If you can only buy one shooter right now, this may be the one you want!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000RZPW9W","reviewerName":"Timothy Lovett","summary":"Bleh - Nothing Special, Let Me Explain","reviewText":"You may not agree with my review but for those of you who want an honest and objective look into it please stick around.There are several things wrong with this game that make it generally not quite as great as it could have been.These issues are: easy of leveling, tedious collection styled quests, massive empty zones, problems with resource skill gathering, lack of voice content, few zones, lack of a decent travel system, ease of travel between starter cities, darkness, generally bland armor, dumb AI, lack of a good faction system, guild creation, instance zones, and weapon selection.I probably have heated a few of you up so feel free to respond to my comments if you disagree but I'm honestly hoping some of these issues are addressed within the next few months as the game begins to grow stronger.Ease of Leveling:One of the most unique aspects of the game, I believe, is the ease of leveling I've found within it. I understand that with 100 possible levels there is room to allow quick leveling but when your character can handle 3 or 4 same level enemies at once he tends to level much faster than he probably should. I don't know but this is my first week (I got it Friday) and I'm already in the high 30s.Tedious Collection Styled Quests:I understand I can ignore quests altogether but the game seems to focus in on collection and kill count style quests more so than anything else. Why not kill 50 of a certain type of enemy? How about the same quest in a different zone with similarly level enemies? It's just very very repetitive. Not to mention, for the most part, on non-collection quests, you'll be forced to run through dangerous grounds to light something on fire or break something only to find all the enemies in the area are dead from constant farming. Farming is an issue with newer games but I think when you ask your players to kill 50 of a certain type of enemy you encourage it more than anything.Massive Empty Zones:For the most part, when you don't find farmers at every corner, you'll find yourself running alone. The game world is huge! It's just most of the time you'll find yourself running through the huge world. For instance to get to a secondary town in the barbarian area you have to run through a zone that has all of the same level enemies but takes nearly ten minutes to run through. It seems like, yeah, it's much larger than games like WoW but it isn't the size that matters but rather what you do with it?Problems with Resource Skill Gathering:Alright so you're allowed to gather resources from level 20 on. The thing is the resources only exist in this barren zone full of no enemies (from what I've seen) so you can spend an hour running around and find nothing at all --- no people, no resources. The good thing though is while you may not find one resource you may bump into a different type. With Age of Conan anyone can gather any of the resource types removing the significance of the gather role of resources.Lack of Voice Content:When you start the game on the newbie island you'll quickly be amazed to find everyone has voice content. You'll be equally surprised that when you leave the newbie island no one has it anymore. The developers say they're going to add it in over time but I don't really see their incentive given by the 20th level a higher majority of people are likely to stick around regardless of the sound if that's the only thing that bugs them.Few Zones:Again, as a mentioned above, there are massive zones but there are also very few of them. This means that as a level 20, let's say, you're stuck going to any of the level 20 zones setup for each of the different starting cities (3 of them). That doesn't leave people who like to explore (or find a variety of monsters) much to do. If you like the idea of running around endlessly looking for an enemy to fight or camping a certain enemy this won't bother you but I think there is something about variety that this game lacks in general. I also found it unlikely I'd be wandering into the higher level zones until I did hit some barrier level that made it easy enough to handle a few enemies. So I'm stuck with 3 choices (which I stick to one because it takes me a half hour to run to any other through the barren zones).Lack of a Decent Travel System:Binding yourself to a main city is allowed but besides that there is a general lack of a travel system. There are way points in the game which, when you die, you spawn at whichever you select so people often get themselves killed to save time instead of running. The death penalty is laughable so it's not worth wasting the time running.Ease of Travel Between Starter Cities:One of the strangest things about this game is how easy it is to travel between the starter cities. From the minute you leave newbie island you can quickly jump from one city to the next for free making it possible to explore all the cities in the game with little effort (besides a 20 minute walk through the barren cities) almost instantly.Darkness:This is more of my own complaint than something that really should be fixed I guess but the game is way too dark and there are no items (torches please) to turn on the lights. I've known scores of people who actually turn off the game during the night-time parts of it just because they can't see anything. The deserts are the worst with this because it just is so dark. I think it's brighter in the dungeons than it is outside.Generally Bland Armor:The armor doesn't really stand out. You get a new piece at level 30 let's say and it'll look almost the same way as the level 20 one. The only difference will be a +4 to the armor rating. It just feels like the armor lacks variety and it doesn't have a good way of really standing out. Also 'good' armor pieces fall so frequently from monsters I've come out of a run of an area with 3 or so of the same chest pieces. It's just bleh.Dumb AI:I've pulled enemies standing directly next to each other, on several occasion, and watched as the enemies did nothing to alert their friends I was fighting them directly behind them. For the most part there is no real AI and you never really get the feeling it would be all that hard to fix a pull to your liking. Yeah, once or twice a bad pull will happen, but as long as the enemy initially sees you, or walks over to you while you're fighting, they tend to ignore what's going on around them. Doesn't seem realistic.Lack of a Good Faction System:I feel like each quest I'm doing is for the few copper they'll give me and not to award myself any form of faction with a group. Just seems like as soon as I kill whatever 50 things they want me to kill next I move on to the next group of 50 things (from the same quest giver) that were sitting next to those 50 things. It's really this tedious and it doesn't make sense why they made it this way. Not to mention most of the different types of enemies look almost identical so there is little variation between monsters besides location and name.Guild Creation:There is no real control on the process of creating guilds (which may be alright I guess) so there are tons of one person guilds out there. It just seems like the process isn't as well developed as it should be considering a portion of the game is centered towards it. It just seems like a fancy grouping system as opposed to anything significant --- yeah you can rank people but it seems bland at least so far. Perhaps later on it'll get more interesting.Instance Zones:The zones are all instanced including the main cities. This makes the load times really fast, yes, but you rarely see people and it makes group in zone much harder. I tend to group at the dungeon location so I find myself trying really hard to find people with no luck when I need them. You'd think this would stop the camping but it's still there. I can hardly imagine what the world would look like without the instances because the camping would be that much worse. It just seems like to deal with issues like this they need a world with more variety, less collection quests, no instances, and more servers.Guild Cities:I've seen that the guild cities are also instances. I'm unsure how this will affect gameplay and will have to keep an eye on it as more people join but it honestly sounds somewhat stupid... Why build a city if it's within a closed environment?Weapon Selection:The weapons in the game seem to just get a little better each time and you tend to get rewards with weapons of your level or higher so there really isn't a reason to worry about finding a new one. It just seems trivial.I don't know the whole game seems like a good idea but it's just nothing compared to some of the others on the market. A little more time developing a stronger system of travel, the trade skills, and other aspects would have made it more interesting. Cutting down on the size of zones in favor of quality of zones would work as well. Hopefully at the higher levels things get more interesting... I just hope Conan doesn't ask you to kill 50 dragons or something tedious like that.I like the game it's just I don't like it enough to keep paying the fee as it stands now.Also, one last note, funcom has released mounts with some preorders (or Amazon curved bow from amazon). It also releases other items with orders of things like keyboards and mice... It just seems like it's trivializing its own item system to release items that should be gained by normal processes as a reward for buying from them. It's like they're mixing the cost structures of a pay for play with a pay for upgrade which may hurt the internal game economy depending upon how excessively they continue to do so. Who wants to work hard for an item when you can buy a keyboard and get it that way?","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0009XEC02","description":"Third installment of the popular SRPG series.  First for the DS handheld.","reviewerName":"E. David Swan","summary":"The first A+ game on the DS","reviewText":"Advance Wars wasn't just a great game, it was, in my opinion, the greatest game ever for the GBA so Duel Strike had a lot to live up to. It is the first game I really looked forward to on the DS. I imagined it being the perfect title for using the touch screen yet ironically I don't use the touch screen at all. The action takes place on the bottom screen while the information is displayed on the top which is exactly the opposite of what I had anticipated. The only thing this really does is eliminate the need to toggle between map and info. The graphics have been slightly upgraded including a more isometric view as well as occasional birds and clouds that float over the landscape. When a battle occurs the screen kind of swoops into the face-off using some fancy scaling.The core game play remains the same but Duel Strike has a load of additions under the hood. First of all, CO's can gain skills through experience much like an RPG. There are ten levels of growth possible with the tenth giving a surprise. Duel Strike tracks every minutia of playing through an exhaustive charting system that includes things like wins/loses and minute details like how many troops have been joined. After meeting certain thresholds the player will be given a ribbon (up to 300) and possibly a rank upgrade. Oddly enough the designers chose to reward players for both good and bad play. You gain a ribbon after S-Ranking a certain number of battle maps but you also gain ribbons by A-Ranking, B-Ranking and so on. The point is there is a LOT to collect in the game so players will be busy for a long time. To the best of my knowledge the ranks and ribbons serve no purpose beyond bragging rights.The beauty of Advance Wars is in its simplicity. It is a completely stripped down version of a strategy game but simplicity does not necessarily translate to easy. Rather than focusing on large scale resource management and hundreds of troops the player needs to concentrate on a precise, tight strategy. Every tank and every soldier counts. The game also sets up a wide variety of situations so players will need to be constantly coming up with new battle plans.With Advance Wars the DS has finally matured into a full fledged system. As someone who bought the DS its first weekend on the market I can honestly say that I was quite concerned that the DS was turning into a major misfire. If you own a DS this is the first game that you REALLY need in your library.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00HRKE1SI","description":"","reviewerName":"Turtle502","summary":"Completely wired, no bells and whistles","reviewText":"I've used my fair share of Turtle Beach headsets, both wired and wireless. This product is as basic as they come, while providing critical functionality with the Xbox One. They are good, but not necessarily great.Since these are wired, there's nothing to charge. There are no buttons or switches on the headset. There's a permanently wired cable that comes from the bottom of the left ear-cup. The boom-mic plugs into a jack on the bottom of the left ear-cup. Ideally, I wish it were made so you could plug the boom-mic into either ear-cup, in case you have a preference. I find the cable a bit short. While it works great from controller-to-headset, it's a bit short for other applications -- such as using it for listening to music on a PC or phone, for example.The headset has a good construction, very unique as compared to other Turtle Beach headsets I've used. The head band flexes firmly as you pull apart the ear-cups to place the headset on your head, but doesn't close too tightly. Disclosure: I have a small head. There's a strip of leather-like padding that sits on top of your head. I keep a permanent buzzcut, and this padding feels great for long periods of time. The ear-cups are padded with a simple foam and cloth material instead of leather, which in my opinion keeps them cooler -- and you feeling cooler -- while using them. The ear-cups extend lower so they can be sized to your head, and they swivel to provide a decent fit.I've used these for hours at a time with no discomfort.These sound good, with decent overall sound in terms of bass and treble, but I find that the midrange -- especially voices -- seem to be a bit weak. This is surprising considering these are a complete solution, with voice chat being a major feature. Since there's nothing electronic about this headset, there's no way to compensate for this. Additionally, when listening to music or podcasts from another device, your control of the sound is limited to the controls available on that device. Additionally, the volume output is limited to the power that can be provided by your device. Phones are less likely capable of driving these at higher volumes.These are specifically marketed for use with Xbox One, because it includes the headset adaptor which snaps onto the bottom of the Xbox One controller. I ran into trouble performing the update. While my first attempt to update the controller (more of an Xbox One issue than the headset's) failed, a second attempt was successful and provided full functionality. The headset adaptor allows the Xbox One console to send chat AND full game audio to the controller, which is then passed to this headset (or any headset) plugged into it.Unfortunately, it's not a completely wireless solution because you'll always have a wire going from the controller to the headset. If you need to get up temporarily, you either need to take the controller with you (say, to the kitchen) or take the headset off. This is why I wish the cable was longer, because it would allow you to move around your immediate area if you need to put the controller down temporarily.Sound quality wirelessly through the controller is actually quite good. Full game audio is clean and crisp and sound full-spectrum from my perspective. The adaptor on the controller offers the ability to mute chat, change the volume between chat and game audio, and control overall volume. There's no mute, though, for game audio -- which is a bit annoying if somebody walks into the room and needs to ask you a question.The product also includes the necessary in-line amp and cable solutions that can be used with your Xbox 360 and PC.If you are looking for a complete chat and game audio solution for your Xbox One, and don't desire any bells-and-whistles, then you should give these a try. They are pretty much plug-and-play, then forget it. They sound good, fit good, and work well with the Xbox One.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2014"}

{"product_name":"B005VBVQBU","description":"","reviewerName":"OrangeCrush \"Still shooting with Film!\"","summary":"Great Deal on a Great System!","reviewText":"We have had an Xbox 360 in our home since the system first came out and I can easily say that the last 6 years with this console has been the best 6 years I have had yet with a videogame system and that is saying something as I have had just about every console released since Pong was released back in the mid 70's. Microsoft, a company that I was never too fond of given the fact that I am an Apple computer user, has really done an outstanding job with this system. While there were some hardware issues with the earlier consoles, I can safely say that the Xbox 360 S is a top notch console with none of the problems that plagued earlier models. Its superior in almost every way to previous models.My single favorite aspect to this system is without a doubt Xbox Live and all of the things that come along with the service (you get 3 months included with this holiday pack). Basically Xbox Live gives you the ability to play games online and lets you download arcade games, game demos, trailers, TV shows, music and movies. Out of all of the things that MS has done, putting so much focus on the development of Xbox Live is, in my opinion, the smartest thing they have done yet in regards to this console. Xbox live has really become a fantastic part of the Xbox gaming experience. In fact, I couldn't imagine Xbox without Xbox Live. In particular, both my son and I love Xbox Live Arcade. There is now a massive assortment of games on Xbox Live Arcade and the nice thing about the games, besides the lower cost, is that they dont require the time investment that most of the regular Xbox games require. Its a more casual gaming experience and I really appreciate that, especially during my busy season with photography as I simply dont have the time to invest in big games during that time of the year. I love that every game available on Xbox Live Arcade has a demo available so you can actually try it out before making up your mind on whether or not to buy it. Xbox Live also has an on demand game section, which are regular disc based releases that you can buy and download over Xbox live. I personally dont buy on demand games as the prices really aren't competitive and I just cant justify buying a download version of a game when I can actually buy the physical version for the same price or less. Of course, buying the physical copy gives you the ability to sell it later on. This isn't possible with downloaded versions. Given that aspect alone, on demand games should be at least 5-10 bucks cheaper than the physical version and unfortunately that just hasn't been the case and this is one area where Xbox live can be significantly improved.Xbox live also offers additional services like Netflix, Hulu Plus, ESPN, Zune, and LastFM. We currently use Netflix and ESPN and we love both services. Its important to note that Microsoft recently announced that 40 additional entertainment partners will soon be joining the Xbox Live experience including Comcast, HBO GO, Syfy, Verizon FiOS, Bravo, and Xfinity. This really isn't surprising given the fact that Microsoft has stated many times that their vision for the future of Xbox lies in it becoming a hub for entertainment in your home, not just a videogame console. With the announcement of 40 additional entertainment services being added, MS are now one step closer to making this a reality and I expect the list of services will only continue to grow over the coming years. Basically this gives people the ability to individualize their TV experience through Xbox live. I only watch about 5% of the channels I receive through cable, and pay a hefty price to be able to do so. So I am very interested in where this console is going in this regards.I also really like that MS has been focusing more and more on the family side of gaming as my wife enjoys gaming and we have an 11 year old son. In particular, we really enjoy Family Game Night which highlights a different family game every Tuesday. The number of games suitable for younger children has increased substantially over the last few years and the console itself has parental options that allow you to lock out certain content from your children. This includes games, movies and TV shows. I travel a lot so these options are very important to me. I dont have to worry about what content my son is accessing while I am away.As for regular gaming, Xbox certainly doesn't disappoint. There are so many great games available that I literally dont have time to play all of them. Just look at the games released, or being released, in the last quarter of 2011. You have Gears of War 3, Forza 4, Battlefield 3, The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection, Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, Assassin's Creed: Revelations, Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Saints Row 3, Batman Arkham City, etc. Those are just the high profile games. Of course, Xbox has a huge catalog of titles already available and many of those games can be purchased for 20 dollars or less. You can even play a large number of original Xbox titles on the 360, many of which are amazing games and could easily be found for 10 bucks or less at used game stores. Most people have a limited amount of time that the can devote to playing games and given the sheer number of great games available....well, lets just say that the vast majority of people will have the same problem I have, that you dont have time to play all the games you want to play.For those that are looking to get their first console, this holiday bundle is a great deal. It has the 250 Gig HD and comes with 2 of the biggest games released this past year, Halo Reach and Fable 3. Its important to note that the you dont get the physical copy of Halo Reach. You get a code that gives you the ability to download it from Xbox Live On Demand.Bottom line - Microsoft has really done a remarkable job with their Xbox gaming system. They have had a few bumps along the way but overall the Xbox is a top notch gaming system that now offers far more than just gaming. Whether your looking for casual gaming, hardcore gaming, online gaming, family gaming, or even motion based gaming, the Xbox has more than enough to fit the bill. As I stated originally, the last 6 years with the Xbox 360 has without a doubt been the best 6 years I have ever had with a console. Xbox 360 has become a staple in my house in regards to my families entertainment. Whether its for gaming, movies or TV shows, the Xbox doesn't disappoint. I really couldn't possibly give this console a higher recommendation. Its just a top notch entertainment device.5 Stars!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001AWIP68","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"A Different But Exciting Side of WWII!","reviewText":"Concept:  9/10Call of Duty World at War takes place in World War II.  The setting is NOT the `oh too familiar' Normandy Beach Invasion.  Instead this game focuses on the island warfare between the US and Japan and the Russians counterattacking the Germans near the end of the war.  There's a 6-10 hour campaign, Co-op Modes, Multiplayer, and a fun mini-game called Nazi Zombies.Story:  8/10Although the cutscenes are fairly poor, the game's story is interesting because it focuses on some of the lesser known, but epic battles of World War II.  All of this content feels new, even though World War II has been featured in countless games.  You play as a US Marine battling through the Pacific Jungles and a Russian Soldier storming Berlin.Graphics:  8/10The graphics are good, but not as good as the Modern Warfare games and newer releases like Black Ops, but they still do a good job at convincing your brain that you are in intense firefights!Gameplay:  8/10The gameplay mechanics of the Call of Duty series are great.  This series added the \"Grenade HUD Indicator\" warning you if you are about to get blown to bits and the \"Left Trigger Target Lock\" function making aiming much easier.  Shooters that came out before this series were incredibly difficult and players had to side strafe while trying to line up the cursor on the enemies' heads to get head shots.  Now you just aim, Hold the Left Trigger, move up a bit and fire.  It's much easier to feel like a hero this way!The Call of Duty series features intense battles, but fairly generous checkpoints.  There are four difficulty levels:Recruit - This is as easy as the game can get without taking away the danger.Regular - This offers some challenge and it's still fairly exciting, but experienced gamers can run right through the missions.Hardened - This gives experienced fans of shooters a challenge, but the constant bombardment of grenades by enemy troops can get frustrating.  At some points, I was literally hit with 6 grenades at once while trapped in a trench.Veteran - Be prepared to battle for every inch of the map, but if you are an X-Box Achievement Junkie, you get a good amount for finishing each and every level.Missions:  8/10As with all Call of Duty Games, the Missions are a mixed bag.  Some are incredibly amazing, while others are just ok.  The missions take place in the Pacific Jungles and German Ruins.  There's sniping, demolition, tank warfare, firefights, and a mission where you play the gunner on a sea plane sinking Japanese Cargo Ships and shooting down Japanese Zeroes.Co-op:  6/10You can play through the Campaign with friends / split screen or through Xbox Live.  But unlike the campaign, your allies can die, which makes the mission a whole lot tougher.  The lack of a Save Feature hurts this mode.Multiplayer:  6/10The CoD series features some good multiplayer maps, upgradeable weapons and skills, and the Perks System for rewarding Kill Streaks.  If you kill a few guys, you can call in additional AI Firepower.  There are team games and free for all games.  If you're already addicted to the multiplayer of Black Ops or Modern Warfare, there's no reason to play this, unless you really love WWII.Nazi Zombies:  7/10This is a fun mini-game, also featured in Call of Duty Black Ops, where you are trapped in a boarded up house and hordes of zombies are attacking you.  By shooting them and repairing barricades, you earn points.  You use those points to buy better weapons and \"unlock\" other rooms to expand the level.  If you play with friends, it's pretty fun like Left 4 Dead.  If you play alone, it's just ok.  An updated version of this game is also available in Call of Duty Black Ops.Sound:  10/10The sound is amazing.  Explosions, bullets, heroic music bring the action to live.  It also doesn't hurt that your main ally is voiced by 24's Jack Bauer.  How can you not like fighting for America along side Keifer Sutherland?!  If Jack Bauer tells you that you can take the hill, you believe that you can take the hill!Maturity MIntense battles, graphic violence, gore, swearing, real footage from WWII...  This is not a kids' game.Overall:  8/10This game has been out for two years, but at the Platinum Price, it is still a good purchase.  It features Intense Combat, CoD's Good Gameplay, Co-op, Multiplayer, and Nazi Zombies!  It's not my favorite game of the Call of Duty series, but if you like the gameplay and want to experience a different side of WWII, you will enjoy this.Buy it if you are interested in the Pacific Battles of WWII or if you like WWII games in general.Buy it if you love the Call of Duty Series and want to experience another exciting campaign, Multiplayer, Co-op, Nazi Zombies...Rent it if just want to blow through the Campaign.  It should take about 6-12 hours depending on the difficulty setting that you choose.Avoid it if you don't like intense violence, loud noises, or harsh language.If you liked this game, pick up Call of Duty Black Ops!If you enjoyed this game and want to watch a few DVD's, check out Downfall.  It's about the fall of the 3rd Reich.  Or the HBO Mini-series, The Pacific, is all about the United States vs the Japanese as they battle it out on Pacific Islands.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00004TC6E","reviewerName":"Carmilla","summary":"Truly amazing role playing game...","reviewText":"Chrono Cross, which is a semi sequel to 1995's Chrono Trigger, cant even come close to its former games plateua. Chrono Trigger is arguably the greatest RPG ever created. So while Chrono Cross is 'not as good' it still does a whole heck of a lot of things right.The gameplay, story, and battles in this game are all top notch.Its fun to get a handle over the numerous tough boss battles in this game because of the elemental magics strategic system. Black beats white and red beats blue, etc.Its always fun and interesting to see what the next dungeon or boss has to offer. The gameplay is never sluggish and will always keep you on your toes.Also, when you beat the game you have an option to replay the entire game again with all of your beefed up characters from before. And if things are going slow you can speed them up with a fast forward button on your second play through the game. Truly brilliant!So why does this game get 4 out of 5 if it is so darn good?Because of its confusing/tedious magic system and over abundance of characters.Most of the magics and summons in this game are a joy to watch and to behold their might. But in this game there are no magic points and you must 'equip' every single magic spell you have. That could mean 50+ spells to equip per character! Setting up each character late in the game can take upwards of 5-10 minutes easily. And each spell can only be cast once per battle unless you buy multiples of that spell.And probably the games worst point is its ridiculous amount of characters. Chrono Trigger had something like 7 recruitable characters that you can play as, each with their own terrific and unforgettable personalities.Chrono Cross has 44 recruitable characters.95% of your 40+ characters have the personality of a wood stool. Some characters will literally say 'Can i join your party' than join and NEVER say anything else EVER again!Having 44 playable characters instead of 7 spreads each one way too thin and makes them all lose individuality.In the end this game is still one of the greatest rpgs ever made for the first Playstation. While its few flaws keep it from being a true classic, it is still one of the greatest rpg experiences to be had in the past 5 years.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Nakkiel","summary":"Not bad, not good","reviewText":"Ok so first of all after actually playing this game the only reason I can imagine anyone would give it only one star is rage toward the real money auction house. Yes greed is bad... now that is established a real review.This game actually has a lot to like. (A lot to hate as well but I'll get to that.) First of all game play is fun. The best I can think to describe it is a hybrid of Diablo 2 and Dragon Age Origins. (Although DA:O had a lot more content.) The abilities are mostly fairly unique to the class and each is a completely different experience. (Game play not story.) You basically get 6 skill slots but are restricted to a list of spells for each specific slot, and then can further customize it with rune selection for the spell.The other thing I really like about this game is shared achievements across characters, although they still are mostly really stupid \"achievements.\" YOU REACHED LEVEL 10!!! yay?...There are a ton of things that made absolutely no sense for them to do. Base stats are not chosen at all, and furthermore of the 4 main stats only 2 really do anything. Vitality increases health for each class and then each class has one stat that increases damage while the rest do hardly anything at all. Why even have separate stats if they were going to do that, why not simply combine them? The only thing it accomplishes is ruining gear by having useless stats randomized onto it along with useful ones. You also don't choose the spells your character learns but rather they are unlocked as you level and you choose which to use in that skill slot. It is 6 separate spell lists as well, so it is highly restrictive of combinations you can use. In other words there is absolutely no character customization, making your character exactly the same as every other of the same class and level.If you played Diablo 2 you know how important mana was for most classes. Diablo 3 completely changed how it works. Basically all classes have a separate type of resource that is basically mana with a different name, and functions very similarly across each class. You get a very small mana pool, very high regen, and some of your spells replenish mana rather than cost. So after you get used to your spells for most spell setups it turns into clicking the right mouse button until out of mana then clicking the left mouse button until it is full again, then repeating while situationally using the other 4 spells. And again there is not much you can do to change this since there is no character customization. (Although some gear adds to max mana pool.)Speaking of casting spells, they are based on weapon damage. This isn't necessarily bad, but if you are a ranged spellcaster (Witch Doctor or Wizard) wearing melee weapons you will get full damage credit. The problem with this is that when you run out of mana when casting spells it defaults to weapon attack... meaning if you are wearing melee weapons you are going to charge into melee range of the things trying to kill you every time you run out of mana. Considering how high melee weapon drop rates are compared to ranged this is a very big issue.This is something that absolutely confounds me. The only ways to group are an auto-que or direct invite to a player. In these automated groups players anywhere in game get main quest credit. Most XP comes from quests rather than kills so they get most XP as well. It also informs them if you start and side quests and allows them to teleport directly to you to get quest credit. (Or for any other reason.) Now there is a vote kick option enabling you to get rid of players not contributing, but it has 2 very big flaws. First you can't kick someone if they aren't in the same zone as you, meaning that while teleporting to town might let you kick a normal leeching player; the ones with chinese symbols for names sitting in some obscure zone require you to travel all the way to that place just to get rid of them. Second they still get credit for everything you already did before removing them... I was in a game earlier today where 3 people sat in town as me and one other person killed everything, then they just accepted the auto summon for bosses. After awhile we got pissed and left. They still had all that progress without so much as leaving town other than clicking the yes button for summons then teleporting back after the boss died.In Diablo 2 Necromancers were enjoyable to me in part because a part of your strategy was keeping all the pets up while also using direct offensive and defensive spells. In D3 their replacement, Witch Doctors, are nothing like that. Pets are a single cast for all of that type and the cast has a cooldown. There also aren't very many pets. There are really a ton more issues this game has, but that's all I'm writing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2012"}

I don't think the story really added all that much to the Tron mythos but it wasn't as bad as the gameplay.  The light cycle sequences were horribly boring.  Basically drive down the path and avoid stuff that has fallen.  The most fun was probably piloting the tank and shooting other vehicles or running over people.  The multiplayer is a joke.  Basically everybody is running around throwing their discs at each other and it usually ends up with most everyone in one spot just trying to throw their most devastating disc attacks as fast as they can.

In terms of innovation and originality, this goes beyond any platform/adventure game out there.  First rate.  The gameplay, itself, lacks a good deal of the substance and polish that a game of this type deserves.First off, I must say that this game has a well earned reputation for uniqueness and creativity.  The level designs are really, really unique and at times amazing.  There are two levels that I just loved.  One required a lot amazing fast paced gliding, jumping and floating in a fun expansive environment.  Another one required you to move around a game board and then shrink and travel around the game board and convince people to join an army so you can get another board piece.  Those levels were flat out amazing and were nice breathes of fresh air.  Almost all the levels have a central theme, and many of the levels tend to stretch the boundaries of physics and gravity.  Some levels feel more like a Escher painting than a video game level.The characters are pretty fun, the story line is a nice little compliment, and the extremely colorful levels (which represent the people's minds as you travel inside them - thus the title) are definitive stand outs in this game.  I wish most games would supply this attention to detail when it comes to visuals.The main character  is a kid name Raz, and he travels throughout a summer camp and enters people's minds using various powers, ranging from the psychotically fun Levitation ball, to the almost useless fire starting power.  He cycles through people' minds in order to become a true Psychonaut.  Quite brilliant at some points.Their are a lot of problems though.  The voice acting is very repetitive and many times grating.  I often had my television remote next to me so I can mute it quickly.  Almost headache inducing.  The load times are terrible.  Maybe the second worst loading times I've ever scene (Mafia for PS2 still is the worst).  One particular mission was almost an 90s point and click adventure game, where you walk around and try one thing, then walk around and try another thing and continue until you find the right item.  It may be fun for some people, but it breaks up the action.  Also, since it is so creative, it tries to do things and sometimes fail miserably.  There is one part where you follow a badly shaped bubble around the ocean and if you hit the edge, you drown.  Not fun or interesting at all.The main problem, and it's a huge problem, is the fact the game plays like a second rate, cookie cutter platformer.  A game where the mechanics and level design are flawed enough where you feel that your main enemy is bad game design and construction rather than jumps or real enemies.  Grabbing something or landing on something on a jump almost feels random.  Double jumping is a joke that only works one out of every three times.  Camera movements often force you to make blind or awkward jumps, but more often than not, it will move unwillingly, causing you to fall as it moves in the middle of a jump.  An annoying, practical amateur mistake that destroys all possibility of enjoyment in the last third of the game.All in all, it's a great attempt at an original game, but the rudimentary and buggy gameplay just places it in the realm of an average game.Pros:A couple of great levelsOriginal, unique, varied backgroundsFun conceptLevitation ball is really funUsually very little repetition of certain parts of levelsCons:Load times are horrendousVoice acting is grating and annoyingAdventure elements are boringHorrible cameraTerrible jumping mechanicsTerrible grabbing mechanicsDifficulty Level: MediumFrustration Level: MediumTime to Complete: 15 hours.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2005"}

At least they were if you liked 2-D platform games, andYoshi&#x92;s Islandis indisputably one of the best ever made.Yoshi&#x92;s Islandgoes back in time to recount the touching story of the various Yoshis' attempts to unite Baby Mario with his parents.

In fact they&#x92;re joined this time, after the rather plain-looking prequel, by some wonderful pastel-shaded graphics that were jaw-dropping when the game was originally released in 1995 and still manage to impress now.As with the otherSuper Mario Advancetitles, this game also contains a four-player version of the originalMario Bros.arcade game, making it even more of a bargain than it already was.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"A.

The result reminds me of a arm intensive game of Twister. I've used this device with Mountain Crime: Requital, Sorcery, House of the Dead Overkill, and Heavy Rain. Two of these games were virtually unplayable: House of the Dead, and Mountain Crime, with Mountain Crime the most frustrating, and the one with the most likelihood of provoking me to violence against this device. First, the ugly...Mountain Crime: Requital, a incredibly easy point-and-click, and the hidden object game, heavy on the hidden object part, with pretty nice graphics, and interesting story, and relatively simple, fun, game play was a great candidate for the PS3 Move. Having, like most of us, non-gamers, I was hoping the simplicity of the game, and the motion controller, would be the hook. After about a half and hour of setup, I called the endeavor fail and fell back to the PS3 standard controller. The problem was that the controller, through no amount of calibration, would allow me to move the controller within an arms length to touch every part of the screen. I calibrated that thing by aiming the Move controller directly at the camera, which resulted in the pointer never being able to leave the bottom-left controller of the screen. I cheated and aimed it at the bottom right corner of the screen, that let me move the controller about half of the height of the screen by lifting it completely above my head. I then got about half of the width of the screen (all of this the bottom right corner of my TV) by more odd attempts at calibration. All in all, it was a fail. It seems the game excepts the person to be sitting directly in front of the TV for width-wise, and I never figured out how to get both the height and width calibrated to a usable amount at all. My camera is at the top of my 65\" flat screen, could that have been an affect? Could it simply be the game? Could I be an idiot? Well, one of this is likely true, and in-of-itself, worth about less one star.Sorcery was pretty good. All in all, the game play was OK. The story was cliche, but fine as a glue for the rest of the parts. The graphics were sub-par, however, it seems that good graphics doesn't accompany motion controls - I mean, look at the graphics on the Wii... Yes, I realize I'm about to eat these words with Heavy Rain. This game was fair with the motion controller, however, not a show stopper. Younger kids would likely do better with this one, their expectations are usually lower, as their imaginations are usually less bleached with age. There's a star, and one more for the thing working good enough to play a game.Now, House of the Dead: Overkill is why I bought this toy. There really isn't too much to say here. Since it's not a PS3 store exclusive, like MCR, you can read the reviews yourself. As for the Move support, it was fair. When it worked, it worked mostly by YOU working around the inaccuracies. There were parts of the screen that were dead-on accurate, and at the same time parts that required you to move a little more one way or another, to compensate. All in all, I liked the game, however, like a nice, home baked cake, I usually avoid it for all the effort the preparation takes. I give this a moderate score, pretty dead in the middle.Finally, and the best for last, Heavy Rain. I've beat heavy rain before without the motion controller. My next play through, years later, was to be with the motion controller. Now, with that being said, my elderly mother (still somewhat hip, though nearly old enough to have hers replaced), was handed the motion controller and set off into the wild. The results, with minimal setup and effort, she now wants a PS3. Awesome. I think this game works so well because it is more movement reliant. That is, the game barely seems to care about that glowing ball, or the camera. It uses more accelerometer and gyroscope. This worked fairly well. You still need to get used to how dramatic your movements need to be, however, again, it was very easy for non-gamers to play.The conclusion. The game I purchased this for was a flop. Was it the game itself? Probably not. Was it the Move controller itself, or the utilization of the game developers? Probably a mix of both. However, unexpectedly, Heavy Rain was a success. This made up for the other problems. All in all, this device is poorly utilized. One could argue that it's up to the game developers to take advantage, I mean, the Wii's motion controls are to motion, as tofu is to chicken, yet it's relatively successful. I believe it's because they know it's tofu, and instead add extra flavoring, or, in this case, work around the limitations. Perhaps that's what Move developers need to do. For me, a technology like this is only successful as the products that use it, and there you have my score. Is it worth it. No. It's just too frustrating when it doesn't work well, and there just aren't enough games that use it, or work well with it. As the sun sets on the PS3 (PS4 being on it's way with more Kinect-style controls), the PS3 Move will fall into the dust covered boxes with other misfit toy console gimmicks like the Nintendo Game Cube microphone, the Nintendo Gyrobot, or the Nintendo Wii console (lighten up Nintendo fan boys;).","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00006GSO1","description":"James Bond... Solid Snake... Ethan Hunt... Based on their recent games, all these so-called superspies could stand to take a few lessons from newcomer Sam Fisher. His name isn't important; the important thing is that his game,Splinter Cell, comes from Tom Clancy's game studio and offers up the kind of sophistication and control you'd expect from the studio that brought gamersRainbow Six. It's all about the details. When Sam enters a dark area, he's got two options, thermal and night vision. Thermal lets him see the body heat of an enemy soldier, even through walls and doors. Shoot through cover with a high-powered weapon, and you can watch as the heat fades from the body. Not dark yet? Shoot out the lights. Need a distraction? Pick up and toss a tin can. Come up to a door too thick to pass thermal readings? Sneak up to it, slip a fiber-optic lead under the door frame, and peek at what's beyond. When you're ready, open the door--just a little bit at a time. WhileSplinter Celllacks a famous hero in the lead role, it does sport the famous technical military thriller author Tom Clancy in the title. And you can see the evidence of his expertise in every facet of the game.

UT was famous for awesome bot AI and a fun single player experience as well as the best multiplayer experience since Quake 2. Quake 3 entered the arena of multiplayer shooters around the same period as UT, but UT garnered better critical acclaim based on its different modes of play and its superior single player experience.UT2K3 came out a year ago and made a splash due to its graphical overhaul, but it paled in comaprison to its predeccessor because it gave up the &quot;feel&quot; that is UT. The beloved Assault Mode was taken out and replaced with an inferior bombing run mode and the graphics, while great, did little to help the gameplay. The weapons were tweaked to become weaker as well which fans did not like.Now UT2K4 is out and finally takes everything good about UT and improves upon it considerably. I can now finally uninstall UT from my computer! Assualt Mode is back and better than ever plus other new modes like Mutant, which makes you a killing machine if you become the mutant by killing the person who currently is the mutant or by getting the first kill. Another great addition is Invasion mode which pits you and team against monsters from the Unreal universe that come at you in swarms.The graphics are very good and can be manipulated to run on a 1Gh processor with little problem, its very scalable. The music is for the most part very well done, the maps consist of large outdoor environments with vehicles that fly, hover, etc. The Onslaught Mode is the best new addition to the franchise ever! You and your team have to take control over power nodes in order to lower the enemy core defenses on a large outdoor map with tanks, humvee like vehicles, flying machines known as Raptors, the giant multiperson assualt monster known as Leviathan, and more.95 maps with 45 of those being new to this version, the rest are the best of historic UT maps.

It's a pointless game yet it can be addictive for the first few months you have it.  If you keep a journal in your house, and you own this game for over a year or 2, you will notice how empty some of the months are because you never play.It's almost near impossible to make the well happy, the gifts from the mayor are stupid, worthless and again pointless and Nook, Rover and Mr. Resseti never shut up.

Rover is the worst, you just want to get to the other town to get one thing and he blabs on about some crap you already know about since this is your 100th visit.This game can be a good buy, if you really, REALLY like it ... but it will only last a couple of months before you put it on the shelf and it starts to collect dust.

These resources include new weapons, expanded weapon combination/creation possibilities, and even two-player coop functionality. The game also features a 4-player online multiplayer mode, an optional prologue to the game available as downloadable content and a dramatic increase in the number of zombies that can be faced at once.","reviewerName":"M.

Were you frustrated by the ONE save slot and the clock always ticking? Guess what? They didn't fix it.The game saves still suck. There are more than DR1, but not enough. Too few and too far between. LET ME SAVE ANYWHERE.The Good: Lots to explore, but the game saves still suck.Now you can craft weapons, for some really creative kills, but the game saves still suck.There are more vehicles, and the motorbikes are customizable, but the game saves still suck.There is/was? an on-line component (which I haven't tried yet), but the game saves still suck.Overall, they kept a lot of good qualities of DR1, costumes, upgraded attacks, magazine/book perks, but *and I can't emphasize this enough*, the game saves still suck.I definitely will not buy any more DR games, unless they improve the game saves, or have fast travel, or otherwise compensate for how long it takes to do anything in this game.I know my review sounds whiny. I know some games are harder than others. I know some games take time (don't look at how many hours I've put into Fallout 3...). I know I'm not the best gamer in the world. But, it's just not fun after a point. And above all else, games should be fun.Mostly, I just want folks to know that IF you were unhappy with the game save system in DR1, then you will probably be unhappy with DR2 as well.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000ZKA0J6","description":"","reviewerName":"Gargus","summary":"Just buy the original Starcraft instead.","reviewText":"This is coming from a long time fan of the series. I purchased this game the day it came out, I beat the single player campaign and have spent at least a dozen hours playing online.After being a big Star craft fan for so long I was psyched about this when it came out. I bought the original Star craft (with the zerg box) on the day it came out and I beat it 3 or 4 times, played the online for awhile and got many years of enjoyment out of it. So when Starcraft 2 came out it was a no brainer that I wanted it. Well much to my dismay part 2 is by far the inferior of the two games in just about every way possible. So Ill just give reasons why below I did not like Starcraft 2.1) You do not ever get to explore the maps, create your own strategy or play how you want in the single player campaigns. Every single player map basically tells you what to do exactly and almost how to do it, the game holds your hand the entire time and guides you everywhere and giving you a cue every time something needs to be done. The entire game is literally a giant tutorial and nothing else. I never felt like I had a chance to explore, to set up defenses, to try and use strategy or anything on my own. Like for instance when you earn the ability to get siege tanks its because you \"find\" them on a mission, I use find loosely as its unavoidable to find them and then the rest of the map is setup specifically designed to let you use the siege tanks to win and doing so otherwise just doesn't work. Or one where again you \"find\" a vehicle and have to stop these trains, well unless you use the vehicles you \"found\" against the train you won't win. Every map is staged so you have exactly what you need and every map has a specific pre-designed way of beating it. They are all exactly as small as possible so you don't wander off and do something dumb like play your way. Every single player map is like playing a game of chess where the pieces are setup for you already and the only way to win is to do things the way a diagram laid out for you says.2) Blizzards amazing story cut scenes are designed horribly. You'd think this was gears of war in space because all the men are these giant bulked out muscled guys that have to weigh 400lbs of pure muscle with arms so big that they are bigger than my torso. I thought we would get away from the chris redfield of resident evil 5 and gears of war school of character design. This is a little gripe yes but it kind of ruins my ability to suspend disbelief when every male in the game (aside from the skinny nerdy guy) look like they are smuggling car fenders on their clothes.3) I still dislike that I paid 60 bucks for 1/3 of a game. I know blizzard said many times that they couldn't put all of the campaigns in here due to time and so on. But I look back at Starcraft and warcraft 3 where they managed to fir great multiplayer, many single player missions for all 3 races and a complete storyline onto a single 700mb cd but they can't do it with a dvd or two now also? I don't like the idea of paying 180 dollars to play all 3 races. Now since they merged with activision this tactic or more money is becoming more evident, I don't think it has anything to do with time or whatnot. Since merging with activision their prices have gone up, starcraft 2 cost 60 when they used to cost 50 like all of pc games, the starcraft 2 collector's edition now costs 100 when it used to be blizzard only charged 60 for the collector editions, the WOW:CATA collector's edition also got its price raised by like 30 bucks. The game was chopped up into 3 parts so they could sell more and nothing else.4) Every other mission I felt like I was being rushed as much as possible in the single player campaign. It seems like every other mission has a timer of some sort. Save the colonists before the protoss kill them, destroy the trains before 5 get away, get out before the never ending wave of zerg kill you and so on. Way to often the game is rushing you through the map.5) Even if you don't play online, you still have to connect to your online account to play. You have to get a battle.net account, you have to register your games cdkey and you have to be connected to your battle.net account before you can play a offline single player game. I don't like having to login so I can play a game offline.6) There is no LAN support in the game meaning if I want to play with friends we are forced to go online and get funneled through the battle.net service. I don't like that, I liked being able to get on a LAN with my friends right there and play 100% lag free with no problems. But blizzard removed that feature purely so were forced to us their battle.net service in order to keep us on their servers. So the people I play with we tried it a couple times and didn't like it, so we fired up the original Starcraft instead and played on the lan and had more fun actually.7) The multiplayer still sucks because of how the game is designed. Unless you practice and follow the exact same build order as found on online faq's like everyone else you'll get crushed online. The game is inherently flawed for online play to give victory to people who build stuff in a certain way. Play against a terran and watch them and they will all build the same things in the places in the same order. If you enjoy playing others but don't like following the exact same pattern every time you play and play to rush through as fast as possible then you won't have much success online or much fun either.All in all blizzard has made Starcraft 2 vastly inferior to Starcraft 1 in every way possible. Aside from the fact the graphics are nice in part 2 there isn't a thing I liked as much as or better. I can't recommend this game unless it costs 15 bucks or less to you.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8LR","description":"WhenLuigi's Mansionwas first announced, many assumed it would  follow in the legendary footsteps ofSuper Mario WorldandSuper Mario  64. The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

I didn't do anything illegal obviously since I own the game but it's frustrating.  I don't know what it was about my PC that wouldn't let me play but I couldn't figure it out and I'm what's typically considered a pretty advanced user.  I can completely understand why the PC version is rated so low on Amazon because this is frustrating and I imagine other PC users would never be able to get by it if they experienced the same problem.Anyway, that aside, the game is Fantastic! The story is incredible so far, the Big Sisters are terrifying and smart, and the visuals are everything you'd expect from Bioshock.  I bought a new video card to play the game maxed out (upgrading from a Geforce 8600 to a Radeon 4850) but honestly I don't see much of a visual improvement from Bioshock 1 so I don't see why I needed more power.  Highly Recommended! But honestly I'd say the console version is likely much less frustrating (just too bad you can't use mouse and keyboard on there)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2010"}

When you wreck, the  vehicle has actual velocity and force, especially when it rolls down a mountain(you have to try this). Driving is just fun. The shooting and the explosins are very fulfilling and very fun as well. Story and characters are bland, and it all feels generic. Doesn't feel like there is much life to the game.

Resident Evil Revelations has arrived and it keeps both old and new fans alike.StoryFirst of all you are sent to investigate a ship and the stuff that's been happening on it. Little do you know that a virus has been injected into loads of enemies and its your job to find it and stop it spreading.The games plays out like a movie and u will see yourself switching between numerous characters but mainly using Jill. I Got about 8 and a half hours playing on the campaign mode and it being on a handheld game was pretty impressive. Not to mention the addition of raid mode and the new game+ that u can replay on 'hell' difficulty.Good:The 3d effect was great giving it more of a sense of depth instead of popping out of the screen.Gameplay is fun having just enough ammo to kill but not so much till u can waste your ammo. When using Jill, u would have to conserve ammos and occasionally run from enemies and solve puzzles(which were quite simple). There are times where u use other characters like Chris which are more action packed where u get more ammo and simply have to survive the attacks. At certain points u will also get to use machine guns in boats or helicopters which were pretty fun too. There are also areas where you have to go underwater which i didn't really like though as it was tedious as you are unable to use your weapons except for the occasional shock grenades but it was still funBoss Fights were really enjoyable in this game , some being quite creepy esp those half human half zombies that can still speak. The final boss was esp tough compared to the restWeapons and equipments.The genesis is a pretty good addition which allows u to search for supplies and is quite significant in this game. U do not get a wide range of weapons just the main few like the rifle shotgun , machine gun and the magnum. The weapons expands in raid mode though. I felt the knife was completely useless , i only use it in the early game to try it out and stop using ever sinceThe raid mode is fun with plenty of customizations and a leveling system which will last for hours as you play co op online too( I prefer it to mercenaries which is quite crap considering it was a full game) U get around 20 levels but there are three difficulty levelsThe BadLack of variety of enemies. U will see the same zombies or oozes over and over. The hunters are not that interesting too. I guess the only interesting ones are the bosses.Overall OpinionAn excellent entry into the series and a game that rally shows of the 3DS graphical power. A mix of and new and a pretty decent campaign it is a must buy for any 3DS owner. After the dissapointment of Resident Evil 5 this is a return to form and shows there is still alot of life left in this survival horror franchise.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2012"}

Naturally, WarHawk is one of the best games to hit the PS3 yet, and is also one of the most fun multiplayer experiences you'll have on a console.  If you remember the original WarHawk (released way, way, way back for the PS1) you can expect some of the same type of gameplay here, only now you aren't just limited to attacking in the air, but you are on foot and in land vehicles as well.  Combine this with the fact the game supports play for 32 players over a horde of different maps and such and you can already see what makes WarHawk so appealing.  The game looks simply amazing, and the controls using the SixAxis controler are spectacular to say the least.  It should also be noted that WarHawk is also available through download at Sony's online Playstation store with a cheaper price tag.  Which version to lay down the cash for is up to you, but the hard copy of WarHawk includes a Bluetooth Headset, which comes in pretty handy considering the game takes full advantage of voice chat options.  Other than that, the only downsides to WarHawk are some slight choppiness and the fact that a single player campaign would have at least been a nice addition for those whose online options aren't immediately available, but then again, the game is geared towards a specific audience after all.  All in all, WarHawk isn't the killer app that PS3 fans have been looking forward to, but it's still a sight to behold on it's own merits, and it's definitely one of the best, exclusive games to hit the PS3 yet.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2007"}

The cutscenes look great, but the whole premise of a writer who lost his manuscript pages and is trying to find his supposedly dead wife is really BORING.  There were not enough thrills, chills, and gore in this game for me to really enjoy it and classify it as horror.  At best, it's like an Are You Afraid of the Dark? episode from Nickelodeon.The enemies in this game are very poorly conceived, and the weaponry is lacking in variety and modifications.  The game is fairly long, so you're getting your money's worth in terms of time played, but the ending is a real let-down.  I didn't even bother with the two extra DLC episodes either.

{"product_name":"B005IMVP0O","description":"","reviewerName":"O. R. Rodriguez","summary":"Expand your gaming experience","reviewText":"The first thing i want to say is that i have never ever bought a console on launch window, never mind buying a console before the official launch.  But i did it for the PS Vita and im glad i did.As an avid gamer of PS3/360 im constantly looking forward to make time for sitting on my couch and getting my game on with the home consoles.  This meant that whenever i went out for a few days i would pack my console with a small tv and be ready to play on my temporary stay away from home.  I like doing this because it keeps my gaming going, but it does get cumbersome when done many time per month.  This is where the PS Vita comes in.==Hardware==The Vita size and weight is better than i expected.  Because the weight is so well distributed the console does not feel heavy at all on the hands, and the oval design is comfortable for long gaming sessions.  Game control options are everywhere from the front to the back (literally).  It has the touch screen, back touch panel, two analog sticks and the rest of the PS buttons including a PS home button(except R2 L2 but that can be replace by touch controls).  The controls for power up and volume are simple and functional.  The Oled screen is just awesome.  Games play fast while looking absolutely gorgeous (Uncharted does show off how great it is).  Sound from the speakers is weak.  It seems they used very small speakers for obvious reason (space is at a premium).  Battery life is decent.  With the right brightness setting and turning off the WiFi and 3G one can get decent hours of gaming.  At full brightness and WiFi on the Vita is just eating the battery away. (This is an issue i plan to get rid of once Nyko releases the power grip which has a battery for extended gaming, i had one of this for my psp and it works like a charm)The memory is mediated by a memory card. There are options, the prices are steep, but that is the way it is.  I got the 32 Gb stick and i recommend it.  The Vita is best enjoyed with all the content right there and minimal card swapping.==Software==The user interface for the vita is excellent.  Is fast, functional and easy to use.  Is controlled only via touch controls but worry not, it works great.  The web browser is okish.  If you have multiple games on digital form going from one to the next is fast and easy.  All is mediated by pressing the PS button and choosing the game you want.  Games are installed as applications so no matter if the game is on a game card or digital, the bubble showing the game is always there.-GamesThis is the reason why the vita exist.  Some may pick on its short coming with the browser, maybe some think it should muti task more etc.  For me is all about the gaming experience and this is where the Vita makes it happen.  Playing on the vita can be described as getting into the PS3 experience anywhere you are on the go.  Now i want to be clear, this is not a replacement for the PS3/360 consoles.  What it does is delivers a GREAT gaming experience that comes close to that of the home consoles.  Playing Uncharted or Wipeout one can get truly immersed in that five inch oled screen of goodness.  Is just so great to be anywhere, take out the Vita and enjoy high quality games, and this games are not lacking content ports, they are full of content and perform great.************************************Now a brief comparison to the 3DSPS Vita vs 3DS=Battery lifeBoth are equally poor when settings are in the highest brightness.  For the 3DS there are accessories to extend the battery time, and soon the Vita will have too.  So is pretty even=GamingBoth are great.  The 3DS with its 3D feature which i happen to like a lot makes Zelda and Mario feel fresh.  While the Vita with its gorgeous oled screen it makes portable gaming feel like full console gaming.For choosing between the Vita and the 3DS it comes down to preference.  Each is very different, has its own strengths and weakness.  The only one that attempts to offer the home console experience on the go is the Vita.*************************************Final thoughtsThe Vita is worth the entry price.  It has a great launch window games line up and is looking like is getting many games for the rest of the year.  Im glad i took a leap of faith with my Vita, it exceeds my expectations and i is a lot of fun.####Quick update after a week###im having a hard time going back to my home consoles.  The convenience of sitting on the family room with my vita while others watch tv gives a sense of flexibility that I just cant give up. Wipeout and Uncharted get me so into the game is hard to believe this is from a portable.  When I want something light Little Deviants, Marvel vs Capcom r there for the easy going.  Is an amazing all around console.  I love gaming on my man cave, but it is nice to do some hardcore gamig while being out of the cave once in a while.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2012"}

At least as good as the best N64 titles of yesterday.  I can liken this game best to Golden-eye.  It has a solid one-player mode, but it shines in Multi-player.  At this point of writing, the Online wi-fi service has been having some issues, but Nintendo has acknowledged them and is working to resolve them.  My theory is that the game sold so well and so many people were trying to use the online service all at once it struggled with the load.  My reasoning for this is that the service works much better late, late at night or earlier in the day.  In the evenings it's almost impossible to get a game set up.... right now.  I have faith Nintendo will get that resolved.Graphically, the game is great.  The best the DS has to offer, and it would stand up against any Playstation One or N64 title any day.  Artistically, the game is very similar to the Gamecube Metroid games, which is a good thing.  The developers even gave special thanks to Retro Studios for their hard work on building the franchise up.Soundwise, the game is also top notch.  No game yet, except maybe Electroplankton, is better.Control-  Ok, here's my real complaint.  My hands hurt.  I'm cramped up because the DS is shaped weird and it's kind of heavy.  I recommend using the little thumb strap thing that came with your DS.  It takes getting used to, but it's truly the superior control method.  My biggest, biggest, BIGGEST complaint is that one of the shoulder buttons is barely used, and instead of mapping a jump action to the button, jumping is performed by double-tapping the screen.  It works, but I have a real feather touch on the screen and I accidentally end up jumping a lot when I don't mean to.  On the plus side, in multi-player my accidental jumps really make it tough for opponents to get a bead on me!  Small blessing I suppose.Online play is good and you can select rivals and friends or choose to play against strangers.  One feature I am really liking is the ability to set people as \"rivals\" after a game.  If the other person agrees to be your rival, you can later seek them out online and set games up against them.  It's a great feature as you can start to get to know some of your opponents and their styles.Overall, I like the game and it was worth the wait.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2006"}

When I first began the game I thought to myself this is kinda weird because it's a different kind of game for me and something I'm not used to. As I played through the beginning of the game I thought it was really cool and a very chill game. You're just walking around and riding the horses through the different towns and such, found it to be rather relaxing.Graphically this game was a beautiful treat and controls were decent, a little frustrating at times but decent. The story was enjoyable besides the painful route to get to it. The biggest problem I have with this game is it's so repetitive that it borderlines annoying. You do the same thing over and over and over again. The beginning and the end of the game were awesome but the whole middle part was just boring and tedious.I heard that the second game was a lot better so I still want to play that one before the 3rd one comes out. If this game was done differently then It would definitely have a higher rating for me but the painful process it took to get to the end will keep it at about a 3.5. Just feels like the developers were lazy or the game was rushed out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2010"}

But most of the time on this game you are clicking to go thru the dialogue, there are some puzzle solving involved, but they are pretty simple.  Also a lot of the time you need to go to random places to advance the story, example (SPOILER ALERT) at ch 3 you know you are supposed to return a doll to the little girl, but when you go to her room the door doesn't open, well that's because you are supposed to solve this other unrelated puzzle first (the fountain pen) to advance the story, THEN you can go talk to the girl, which makes absolutely no sense.

This mysterious power forms the beginning of all life, is the source of all magic and the origin of all thought. For eons the angelic Seraphim watched over the T-Energy and therefore over the fate of the entire world. But eventually tiring of their burden, they passed their knowledge on to the High Elves. T-Energy helped the realm of the High Elves to experience an unimaginable boost of prosperity, making it the reigning culture in Ancaria. But a force as powerful as T-Energy carries great dangers. Not taught how to deal with this, no sooner did the Elves take control, then a heated dispute erupted among them as to how and to what purpose the T-Energy was to be used. Dispute morphed into irresolvable conflict, then rift and eventually to a civil war among the High Elves, where all participants were losers. Their realm collapsed and with it the entire power structure of Anacaria. In the turmoil all the peoples of Anacaria coveted the right, either openly or in secret, to wield the power of T-Energy and in the end, unmanaged, the T-Energy raged out of control warping creature and lands alike. Can anyone regain control over the T-Energy. And if so, will he/she strive to prevent the world from lapsing into final chaos, or deepen it?GameplayGameplay inSacred 2: Fallen Angelin divided into two campaign paths: Light and Dark. As the game begins players choose and customize their character and choose the path they will follow. This choice determines the ultimate goal and intentions of their character, and as the game progresses through literally hundreds of quests and side quests, the paths of different characters intersect at different junctions. Choose one way and you may be tasked to defend a town and its people, while another path could result in you attacking the same town. The choice is yours and the fate of the world and your well-being are at stake.Key Game Features:A massive, seamless and dynamic world delivering hundreds of hours of freeform exploration.Two deep campaigns: play as the 'Light' or 'Shadow' side, complete with distinct skills, rewards and story-elements tailored to the chosen path.Six exceptional, playable characters, each with a distinct look, capabilities and in-game motivation.Modifiable combat arts: change, upgrade and link together your alter ego's combat skills to match your playing style.Fight effectively from the back of a number of mounts under your control; equip and upgrade your character's unlockable special mount.Deities offer unique combat disciplines and unlock additional quests.Seamless transition between single and multiplayer gaming modes via Xbox LIVE.Captivating online modes of play challenge gamers in cooperative, PvP and PvE play.Extraordinary, cutting-edge graphics and Dolby 5.1 channel surround sound utilize the latest technologies for a truly immersive experience.Character ClassesInSacred 2: Fallen Angelplayers assume the role of one of six characters -- five of which are new to the franchise -- and delve into a thrilling story full of side quests and secrets that you will have to unravel. Breathtaking combat arts and sophisticated spells are waiting to be learned. A multitude of weapons and items will be available, and you will choose which of your character's attributes you will enhance with these items in order to create a unique and distinct hero.SeraphimOften referred to as 'Fallen Angels,' these mystical and angelic creatures are the oldest inhabitants of Ancaria. Fast, elegant and acrobatic warriors from a technological future they fight with light to medium weapons and, if required, with massive technological support. Players can assume the role of a Seraphim and protect the world from chaos.Shadow WarriorShadow Warriors were originally humans trained as elite soldiers in service to the High Elves. Upon their death their souls were stolen by an Elven general, bound to lifeless bodies and imbued with T-Energy. Now free, they travel between this world and the next as undead beings with only the desire to return to the peace of the golden halls of Elysium.High ElfThe best student at the ancient academy of magic in Thylysium, the High Elf character lives and breathes magic.

{"product_name":"B001CRQYBO","reviewerName":"Joey Pimkowski","summary":"Like Indiana Jones but even Cheesier!","reviewText":"I'll admit it, I'm not a huge fan on online multiplayer. This game really brings the single player campaign back to the forefront and yes, they still make these. Wolfenstein is a pretty long game and I really took alot of time to find all of the collectibles as finding them equals big rewards, more on that in a minute.You jump into the combat boots of B.J. Blazkowicz in his triumphant return form 2001. Return to Castle Wolfenstein was a remake of the original and this here is the direct sequel. Here you start off in a small fictional town Isenstadt, which becomes your base of operations for you and the several factions that you help, whose goal is to liberate the township from Nazi control. Your goal is to take on various missions which further the story and allow you to obtain gold, intel, and tomes. In the story, you manage to discover a powerful magic medallian (the veil) which allows you to use cool abilities which you will need against some of the stronger enemies and the even stronger epic boss fights.Gold allows you to upgrade your weapons which adds really noticeble improvements like recoil dampening alterations to cool things like scopes and bayonets. The whole thing is pretty addicting and will have you looking all over for Nazi treasure. Intel plays a key role in the upgrades as well, oftentimes you have to find blueprints behind enemy lines to get some of the additions to your guns. The medallian can be upgraded as well but to improve your abilities even more, you have to locate tomes (books that unlock new skills). I had a lot of fun with the system used here and I wish more fps games did this.The graphics are really decent here. Some areas, like the part in the underground lab flooded with water are well done in particular. Most of the environments are pretty standard to the WW 2 shooter genre, air fields, farms , and things like that, but others like the zepplein feel fresh and new. The whole game seems really campy and more colorful than Return to castle Wolfenstein which was much darker.This game is good cheesy B movie fun. In fact, I rather enjoy the Indiana Jones feel of this game as opposed to the last games that aped their style from Doom. You still have Nazi dominatrix chicks and Nazis flying around in jet packs and a huge arsenal at your disposal. Back as well are the crazy particle guns and rocket launchers which are staples of developer id. The powers of the medallian are a cool new feature and do a good job of making you feel really powerful but not indestructable.If you want a really strong campaign driven fps, this game is for you. The story is kinda ridiculous but it does enough to keep you going and the cut scenes are good but short and infrequent. Overall, the presentation is very good and I really enjoyed playing through this. I can't think of a better way to spend an afternoon with a couple of beers and a comfy couch, besides, what other world war 2 shooter has a giant spider boss from another dimension that looks like the queen alien from Aliens.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2010"}

Take Half Life 2, a little Resident evil, The Ring, and Matrix like movies and you get F.E.A.R. I kind of dislike most games, but I would recommend FEAR as the FPS of the yearFEAR places you in the role of an unnamed soldier who serves in a secret agency known as FEAR. FEAR's job is pretty much to investigate paranormal activity. Its like the men in black expect without the aliens and more cooler weapons. Your job is to hunt down a man who escape from a government facility a man who pretty much as a taste for human flesh.The only thing that is blocking you from this Dr Hannibal Lector wannabe is an army of clone soldiers. Along your way through this game you are haunted by strange visions, whispers, and the haunted image of a little girl who burns everything in her path.And they don't call it FEAR for nothing. This game really does deliver in horror. I would say that its probably scarcer then Resident Evil and Doom 3. There is this one scene that has you walking through a sewer and all of a sudden you hear this girls laughter right behind you. Just as you turn around you see a silhouette of a little girl out the corner of your eye. It gives me ghost bumps every time I see it and I don't scare easily. Play this game with the lights out and surround sound turn up!But of course like any FPS game your not just an average joe soldier. No! You have \"super fast reflexes\". This gives you the ability to slow down the movement of everything around you and go into a matrix like \"bullet time\". I love walking into a room with 4 bad guys in them, hitting the slowmo button and dropping them all with one clip of my submachine gun. Your character's Kung Fu fighting would make Chuck Norris jealous. Jump up in the air and press the right mouse button and your character will perform a jump kick that can take down foes with one hit.  The environment itself is very realistic. Boxes will fly off shelves, windows will break, Its awesome seeing everything around you explode in chaos as your bullets rip into a nearby storage shelf in slowmo. Kudos to the outstanding physics engine in this game. I might also point out that even though you have these cool features, these badees are no push overs. They will duck, seek cover and dive through windows at the slightest hint of combat. The enemy AI in this game is superb. Probably the most smartest enemies I ever see in a FPS.Though the single player is worth the price  i can't say that the multi-player is really that great. I was let down when i saw that most servers only have 8 to 16 players in them. You might be looking for a long time for the kind of game you want. You'll find yourself wondering around the map for a long time due to the fact that the maps are generally too large for a 16 person game. And you only get to choose from either 5 or 6 weapons, can't remember the exact number. Some of these guns like the dual wield pistols are almost pointless to use as anybody with a submachine gun could easily defeat them. The real draw to the FEAR MP is the slowmo games like slowmo DM,CTF,TDM. This gets every entertaining as one player can control the speed of the game for a couple of seconds.Another thing that upsets me is that the producers seemed to make this game with computer geeks in mind. Chances are if you don't have the most expensive most new video card in the market then you aren't going to see the game in its full beauty. Before I installed this game on my Alienware i tried it on my dad's  9500 Radeon computer and the game looked like something out of the early Playstation 2 days. It was a little better on my Alienware that has 9800Radeon installed. If you have a really old computer don't get this game...just hope they make a port for Xbox360 or something cause it would be cheaper then getting your computer upgraded considering that a new V chip can go for 300 dollars these days","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2005"}

I loved Mass Effect 3 so much that I played it through to the end twice already and will likely play it again a dozen times before all is said and done.  I like Mass Effect 3 more than I liked Borderlands and for me up till now Boarderlands was my most favorite ever video game.  Game play was awesome.  The cover system is slightly improved but more like the old cover bugs were killed so new bugs in the cover system could take their place.MASS EFFECT 3 was not without its flaws.  The most brutal flaw of all in MASS EFFECT 3 was the fact that your choices did not drive the game play.  Also in single player mode all your readiness counters stayed at 50% so the most dynamic feature of the game is denied anyone who experiences MASS EFFECT 3's single player mode.  MASS EFFECT 3 forgot that the ability to make decisions that shaped future game play is what made MASS EFFECT 3 a cutting edge joy to play.  I enjoyed the story line myself.  I think the MASS EFFECT 3 story line is strong as any other of the franchise.  The MASS EFFECT 3 storyline is crippled by the fact that no decision you make in game affects the outcome in any meaningful way.Other reviewers say the MASS EFFECT 3 ending is terrible and I agree with that only halfway.  The MASS EFFECT 3 ending is no great feat of story telling to be sure but that is not what people are really upset about.  The MASS EFFECT people forgot the most endearing part of the MASS EFFECT Franchise.  Every decision you made in MASS EFFECT 2 changed in real and visceral ways how the story unfolded and ended.  The story arcs were very different depending on the decisions you made and that allowed players to invest themselves in the story and \"Their Own Varriation on Their MASS EFFECT 2 Ending!\"  In MASS EFFECT 3 the endings are two general purpose endings that are cemented on to all single player MASS EFFECT 3 treks no matter what decisions you made during game play.  The MASS EFFECT 3 ending is seen by many as rather bad because; in game decisions do not allow the player to invest himself in the story by making decisions that count for more than a few bits of changed dialogue.The level of personalization in MASS EFFECT 2 in all areas of play gave the player a sense of identity and relationship with the in game places and creatures that made the MASS EFFECT 2 gaming experience totally engrossing and involving in ways few video games  could match.  MASS EFFECT 3 is an awesome game but, the problem is MASS ERFFECT 3 had the chance to be so much more than awesome had it just stuck to its roots of giving gamers decisions that had a meaningful effect on how the game experience unfolds then ends.  The fact that War Readiness can only be influenced by ONLINE Play is just plain stupidity and greed on the part of Bioware for which their is no valid excuse.  When creating a video game never create a key attribute of the game that can not be experienced by online gamers and single player gamers alike, thats just common sense merchadising 101.  Logic suggests the people at BIOWARE are too stupid to realise you don't create a video game that leaves the single players swinging in the breeze!The great thing about MASS EFFECT 3 is human sexuality is more realistically portrayed and I will leave it at that to avoid spoilers.  ALL in ALL MASS EFFECT 3 was more fun than I have ever had in any video game thus far.  If I had it to do again I would buy MASS EFFECT 3 despite all its flaws.  MASS EFFECT 3 was an amazing game but, given how great the MASS EFFECT 1  and 2 offerings of this franchise was MASS EFFECT 3 turned its back to far too many of the fun strengths of the MASS EFFECT Universe to ever redeem itself and rise to the stellar heights of fun and fascination MASS EFFECT 1 and 2 enjoyed.  MASS EFFECT 3 was a wonderful game but when compared to all other games in the MASS EFFECT Universe this is by far the dim star in the MASS EFFECT Trinary system of Stars!  MASS EFFECT 3 is far from lame but equally far from the awesome game it should have been given its previous incarnations.  All things considered MASS EFFECT 3 is a SO SO game built on bad game play and game design compromises made by Bioware the only thing that makes this game fun and worth buying is the love and joy I've invested in experiencing previous treks in the MASS EFFECT Franchise make MASS EFFECT 3 a victory run where I get to see my old friends, kind of like a class reunion held on battlefields.  MASS EFFECT 3 is not a bad game it just is not all it could have beem and thats sad.  However don't let the weak be the enemy of your enjoyment.  MASS EFFECT 3 is still great fun.  Had I known MASS EFFECT 3 had so many flaws I might have waited till the price dropped and trust me MASS EFFECT 3 as it stands at the time of this rewiew will suffer price drops because; it is not a game worthy of paying full price.  I suggest you rent MASS EEFECT 3 first unless you are a true MASS EFFECT fan like I am.  Honestly I do not feel ill used because; I got my $60 worth from my MASS EFFECT 3 experience but I am hardly the typical human... Thank God!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2012"}

But during that long road, in the mid-2000s, he managed to hit a bunch of speed bumps. Then he was brought back to form with Sonic Colors and Sonic Generations. But how about we go to waaay before those titles? The game that was right before all of those speed bumps?Sonic Heroes features an interesting premise - Being able to control a group of 3 Sonic characters at the same time makes the cool action much more robust. You get a selection of 4 teams: Team Sonic (Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles -- Medium difficulty), Team Dark (Shadow, Rouge, Omega -- Harder difficulty), Team Rose (Amy, Cream, and.....Big -- Easy), and Team Chaotix (Vector, Charmy, Espio -- A unique take on the gameplay, as it offers missions rather than the usual reach-the-end goal).Each team would have formations that fit each of the 3 characters. There's speed, flying, and power. Whenever there's a certain obstacle in the way, the game would tell which formation to use (Meaning you must switch to the character of that formation). I guess it's nice for them to just tell us. After all, it provides a more straightfoward take on the 3D Sonics, not really slowing us down when it comes to having to know what to do (Except for Team Rose when playing their tutorial level...).Speaking of straightfoward, like I said, the game is all about reaching the end of each level, and when beating that level, you go to the next right away. No map, no talking to people, but just simple and to the point. While there are 3D masterpieces that go by that stuff (Mario 64, anyone? With the castle lobby? And certain Toads you talk to give you Stars?), Sonic Heroes proves that there are some cases where they're not needed. The gameplay itself is as perfect as any Genesis or Sonic Adventure-style Sonic game, except, of course, you've got 3 characters to toy with. Oh, yes, and the level design is top-notch.I never actually realized how aged the game feels compared to the more recent Sonic games. The voices are old, the cutscenes also show their age, and the storyline feels weak. Actually, it's quite interesting to see where Sega was going early on in Sonic's lifetime, so I guess it would be fun to notice the differences yourself. The story is still weak, though.Other than the story, the only bad thing about this game is the voice acting. It reeeallly sucks (Although Big's voice = Comedy gold. I keep laughing whenever he says something). Tails sounds like a girl (Of course, this would go on until Sonic Colors), One of Amy's screams is ear-bleeding (I turned down the volume during Team Sonic's battle with Team Rose), and there are sayings that keep being repeated. But personally, I think this is somewhat of a minor issue, as everything else is terrific. If you can get past the voice acting like I did, then you're in for a good time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2012"}

I was first impressed with the quite thick game manual.  While useful, new players will not require reading through the entire thing as the game is fairly easy to jump into and start playing around.  I can only describe the game to newcomers that the play style is similar to that of a Sim-City type game.  The new mechanics added in not only each civilization (America, Germany, etc), but also each ruler (Roosevelt, Washington, Otto Von Bismark, etc) grant bonuses and change how the game will unfold.  The beauty of the game is that it is never the same each time you play it.  Not to mention, I have a blast playing this game over a direct IP connection with a friend where we play cooperatively at first then proceed to conquer each other at the end.  The Civilization games were always very addicting and this may be one of the hardest games to tear yourself away from.  You will always want to play for a few more turns, and then something else interesting will happen.  Before you know it, the clock reads 5:00am!As a side note, I really appreciated the Civilopedia included in the game.  Between turns or whenever, you can read a bit of real-world history on any of the technologies, civilization, super buildings, units, and wonders.  And they have Leonard Nimoy as the narrator for the game.  I plan to never get rid of this timeless game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2008"}

I previously played the PSP version of the game and was so impressed I felt I had to have Road Trip as my #1 launch game. The controls are slick and it looks just as good as it does on PS3, but it does occasionally give off performance issues when tons of things are happening at once on-screen and at worst it can totally ruin your progress in a race. I've only run into FPS issues a few times during the eight or so hours I played this but it only lasted a few seconds each time. Either way, I'd say this and Wipeout tie as the two prettiest launch games, they're just too stunning for me to comprehend.My biggest knock against the game? It was rushed to meet the Vita's launch when Wipeout, Ridge Racer, F1 and Asphalt already give racing fans everything they need on the system. It clearly could've used more polish and it doesn't have online play. Let me repeat for clarity: Does not have online play. For $30 I'd say this is totally worth having Modnation Racers even just in single-player mode on the go. Racing my friends' ghost racers is also much easier than setting up a multiplayer match with them, so it honestly seems really suited for the handheld platform. Any way you look at it this was totally a missed opportunity to make the best handheld kart racer ever(yes, even above... Toy Story Racing on the Gameboy Color xD).Buy it if you don't care much for multiplayer or you want to have the option to create whatever you want on the go and take advantage of its cool hybrid kinda-multiplayer ghost-racing features.Do not buy if you must have online play and you cannot stand your games ever having performance issues.If the developers do end up patching in online play(they said they're working on it) I'll update my review and you should totally buy it no matter what the cost ohmygawd.

I did a full review of that already, on the base XBox 360 unit. We have had one since launch and we LOVE it and play it far more than we ever touch our Wii or PS3. This review is specifically about our upgrade to an XBox 360 elite.The Xbox 360 Elite - with its shiny black case - is the latest version of the Xbox 360 with several important upgrades. First, it comes with a 120 gig hard drive, which is very important for people who love to download games, music and movies. Next, it comes with a built in HDMI port!First, the disk space. We got an Xbox 360 base unit right when it first came out, and we play *constantly*. It was very easy to get those 20 gig of space on the basic hard drive filled up with all sorts of things. We had music to play as background music in some games, we had lots of game demos we were trying out. We had videos to watch and downloadable games from the marketplace. We definitely needed more space.For graphics, we can easily notice that the video quality from the HDMI feed is better than what we were getting from the high def feed on the regular Xbox 360. The regular one offers component (red-green-blue) as its only high def feed. So if you're a gamer with a high def TV and want the best quality signal, you'll be happy about this HDMI output.Yes, you get a black wireless controller, a black headset and Live Silver membership along with this package. But really, most Xbox gamers have those things already. And most of them have Gold Live, since without Gold you can't play online. So these three things are certainly nice to have, but not a reason you would buy the Elite system.The package comes with a single disc containing 2 games - Forza and Marvel Ultimate Alliance. Both are old games and not that thrilling; we had them already. Still, free games are at least things you can give away to friends.Perhaps best of all, the Elite has a new motherboard inside it which is much more reliable. It's called a FALCON. How can you tell what motherboard your Xbox 360 has? Here's the trick.  It works for any 360* Turn your 360 off and take off the hard drive and remove the game.* Turn the unit upside down.* Put a flashlight directly against the bottom grill.* Look in from the SIDE grill at the inside of your 360.If you see 3 red rings that \"stick up\" from the green motherboard, you have an old launch motherboard. If you see 3 red rings that \"lay flat\" on that motherboard, it's the middle Zephyr version. If you have only TWO red rings that lay flat, you've got a Falcon!I highly recomend having an Xbox 360 in your house for gaming, and I highly recommend going with the Elite. The hard drive space is VERY useful, the HDMI graphics are great, and having a 360 in general is just superb.  Again, we literally play with the 360 all the time and rarely touch our other systems. The whole reason we had to get an Elite is that we were fighting over who could play on the 360 even though we have all these other game systems in the house.Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2007"}

Unfortunately, it fell flat and for many reasons.  It's not to say that it's a bad game, necessarily.  It's just that it's not very good.  The graphics are sub-standard and the animations - especially that of patrolling enemies, which look more like robots than humans with tank-like movements - are lacking.  The voice acting is pretty bad, too...almost like something out of a cheesy B-list action movie.  The gun play is not bad, but you will find yourself frustrated at the lack of accuracy, especially early on.  And the hand to hand combat is borderline embarassing.  For comparison's sake, if the close-quarters combat of Splinter Cell: Conviction is a 9/10 (which I think it is), then Alpha Protocol's rates as about a 2/10.  Not that it's difficult, it just looks unrealistic and almost cartoon-like.  The game does have a slight RPG element to it, in that you can upgrade the protagonist as you progress and as you see fit.  Whether you want to be a stealth-based operative or an assault first soldier is up to you.  Now, for all of the negatives there are to be said about this game - and there are a few - I still find it curiously fun.  I don't know why, but I was compelled to continuously pick up the game where I left off until the bitter end.  I mean, I just found it strangely addictive.  The game is not necessarily fulfilling in any way, either.  It's not like it has a blockbuster ending.  I guess I just had a decent time playing it.  In the end, I guess that's what counts the most, right?  You can pick this game up for under $10.00 just about anywhere (I paid $7 bucks for it).  Even though this game is wraught with problems and really isn't full of redeeming qualities, it's fun and probably worth buying for the bargin bin price.PROS- It's strangely addicting and fun- Has some decent RPG elements, such as (limited) character and weapon customizationCONS- It's not very pretty to look at- The music, voice acting and story are all fairly bad- The hand to hand combat is comicalOverall score: 5/10","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2012"}

I gotta hand it to them. They pulled one over me really good. One reviewer said that this game is something really new and cannot be categorized into one niche. This is obviously a platformer. It may seem new to someone who has never played too many games especially the old platformers such as Super Mario or Mega Man. This platformer is nothing original, really. It takes all the platforming elements from all of the platformers of old.The game gets pretty challenging but that's not the problem. The problem lies in its cheap traps that will kill you many, many, many times. I'm sure that they did it to make the game challenging, maybe even to make you feel like you got money's worth. When you die you have to go back to the beginning of the segment and start all over. When you have passed a very frustrating challenge and then get killed to only start all over that quickly kills all the fun. They should have made it so that you can restart from the point that you died. Because of that this game becomes a chore. I am for challenge and have completed many, many challenging video games that I cannot begin to count. But this is ridiculous. Yes, the platforming elements are quite ingenious but when you go through them they can quickly become a TORTURE CHAMBER. If you do not have finger dexterity, do not even try this game. If you are buying this for a young child, do not even do that because they will quickly tire of not being able to advance because of the frustrating challenges. I am an adult who grew up on video games and I found myself cussing up a storm. I really felt like some demented group of people laughed as they created this game knowing that it will bring some poor soul excruciating pain.One thing that this game made me more aware about is the Playstation 3's controller. The pressure sensitive buttons are a disadvantage when it comes to games such as this. You see, this game relies on a lot of precision jumping whether it be from one platform to another to jumping onto or into objects. You will find yourself jumping and finding that you did not jump hard enough and find yourself missing the edge of a platform and dying cheaply. This happens too often. Or you will find yourself jumping to hard and overtakng the platform. Or worse yet, you will move on a narrow platform and finding yourself falling off a cliff just because you could not stop yourself. Again, the button response on the Playstation 3 can partly be blamed for that. I've never had this problem with the Xbox 360's controller which I find more comfortable and responsive. After dying many, many, many cheap deaths you will put the controller down and give up for the day. Then you will go back repeat the self torture. This game requires a lot of practice in each challenge. After many, many, many attempts you will complete the level only to find a more devious torture chamber awaiting you.Do not get me wrong. Some parts of this game is fun. But I am rating this one star to offset all the overly high ratings that this game received.I would not recommend this game to anyone who is not a hard-core gamer. Only sadomasochists should apply on this one.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2010"}

Really, there isn't too many &quot;oooh, look at that eye candy&quot; moments in the game.  The graphics are nice, but nothing spectacular.  But with all the noise and commotion going on, you forget all about it.  From that moment in the first mission when your allies drop in all around you in parachutes and enemy MG's starts to fire up...you are immersed!I was, at first, a bit confused when the game switched over to the SAS side.  I was getting used to being called Private Martin, and all the sudden, people are calling me Sgt. Evans!  The game switches again to a Russian campaign, then finally, you get final missions as Sgt. Evans and Pvt. Martin to finish the game off.The single player game isn't a long one, but a very satisfying one.  It's worth playing over in the 'veteran' mode (I think that's what the highest difficulty is).  Although you'll have to save pretty much every time you kill an enemy, it's quite a fun challenge!  It helps you learn the higher reflex tactics needed if you want to succesfully transition to online play.  Or you can  just belly flop into it.  Multiplayer is fun, and as of now the online players are helpful sorts and try to work as a team.Speaking of multiplayer, one great aspect of FPS these days are the mod community.  Already there are mods in the works, and with the games popularity steadily rising, I only see good things for the future of CoD and its mod.This game will stay in my HD (which is now down to 3 GB) for quite some time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2003"}

The character you play has a nasty greasy mullet and is ugly as can be (even though in the game he is supposed to be a stud which makes me wonder if he is modeled after the lead developer or something).Well after the game had been out a few years I saw a sale I could not resit and decided to give it a try.  At first I did not think it was much.  The fighting appeared really simplistic with not a lot of action.  However that was before I got the hang of timing your hits and expanding the character abilities out.  Once you were able to spend points on your abilities things got a lot more interesting.The Story is certainly interesting and fun to follow over the 70+ hours I put into this game over the course of 3 months.  Without giving too much away, the game has a lot of twists and turns and leaves things open for a sequel which we now know will be out soon.While I did enjoy the story, I did not care for a lot of the choices you are given.  You get thrust into choosing the lesser of two evils a lot when I would have rather taken a different path as both choices suck.  I get that is part of how they wanted the story to go but I do not enjoy being forced into the shades of grey they want your character to go.Another forced story element that turned me off was the focus on sex.  I get that some people enjoy making your character sleep lots of people but for me it distracted from the game.  While you could avoid a lot of those encounters, there are many that you can not.  The ability to turn this off would have been welcome.While the combat was better than I first thought, it still could have used a bit more options.  You get 3 types of stances with 2 types of swords.  You hit the button and it goes through the animation on your opponent and you time when you hit again.  That is about it.  I would have liked to see more ways to attack with things like sneaking up on opponents, throwing devices charging them, etc.  Also splitting into two swords with 3 stances and then having each stance have its own skill tree was too much IMO.  I would have rather just seen it split by stances instead of stances for each sword.Magic abilities could have used some more work.  I enjoyed the 'force push', 'fireball', and 'Shield' abilities but found the others to be a total waste of time.  Fireball is a great offensive spell but some variety here would have been nice with lighting, ice, etc.One big element of RPGs is usually all the neat equipment you get and how to use those items for your character.  Well there is very little of that in this game.  You get armor which only updates a few times the entire game and a few weapon slots.  The problem here is if you want to use your abilities you have to use the witcher or steel swords.  Anything else and no abilities... so all other weapons are worthless.  So no picking boots, gloves, helmets, etc.  Also the inventory you get is rather limited so you leave almost all weapons behind and can not sell them for some extra cash.Overall other than the few things I have pointed out it really was a fun game.  I enjoyed exploring the levels and all the environments.  I know a lot of the things I have mentioned here have been drasticly improved for the sequel and so I am very much looking forward to that game coming out May 2011.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003O6JIVE","reviewerName":"D. A. Theisen","summary":"They don't make 'em like they used to. Until now. Sorta.","reviewText":"The strangest thing happened as I entered a new episode... I was excited to clear my way through the city under horrible circumstances. Enthusiasm in dungeon adventuring in a Final Fantasy game? How long has it been? Not just interested, or knowing it should be fun, but honest anticipation and a craving to jump into what looks like a mostly hopeless situation without entirely thinking through my options ahead of time and not knowing what the eventual outcome would look like.It's been ages.Honest-to-goodness plot twists, turns and surprises (for better and worse). A vague concept of where you 'should' go next to continue to primary storyline but never any rush or ever forced to go anywhere. All the time in the world ... er. For time travel. Sorry. No pun intended. Usually I can't stand the idea of time travel in games, since it's most always represented poorly. It's rare for total causality to actually play through, so how to fix? Up to three variations of any time jump-- a \"before\", an \"after\" and often a totally alternate timeline created by certain actions you've taken in the past. What you do in the past changes the future, and what you do in the future changes how things are done in the past in its own way.Sure, at the end of the day it's still a stereotypical RPG gimmick, but the timeline traveled in XIII-2 branches off in more directions than I can offhandedly recall seeing before.A lot of the good has been held over and this can be considered a 100% sequel after the events of the original XIII. The already slick battle system and schemes are here and even a little improved. The exp system is made more simple yet offers customization. Every Final Fantasy trademark noun, verb and adjective are all here... So what's managed to make things go wrong? The quite interesting cast of characters of the original have disappeared, and not unreasonably considering how the original ended. The premise, as such, has scraps to work with from the start and it shows. A previously secondary character as the lead, a totally new face inserted as a lone travel companion, a lovable Moogle as a conversing party member, and things are so lonesome that your third battle spot is held by any variety of monsters you capture.Before even opening the game packaging, the player gets a still kick in the teeth with the absurd tease that the inspiring Lightning is back. She is, but not as an active character. The game is, if you want to simplify, a fancy detective case to solve Lightning's kidnapping.Part of a not-a-5-star review is a scolding to Square-Enix for toying with consumers. It's terribly evident that XIII was a somewhat unfinished product and heaps of criticism were easy to pile on. Most of those issues are fixed... it's pandering. Pandering isn't bad, but it is a sign of weakness to games on both ends of a 'before and after' development cycle. I really hope some more use can be found for this game engine after I realized its scope. The game contains absolutely massive cities, and, upon throwing my Moogle for treasure hunting purposes (rather fun!), in a free-falling area one can watch him/her(?) bouncing off the walls and plunging endlessly downward for a good 10-15 seconds. Not just that the space is created as part of the environment, but that even the land and background features are functional outside the field of play and in the entire \"zone\" is very impressive. Hurl your Moogle off some skyscrapers and watch it bounce off other buildings, balconies and walkways that are all rendered by not in areas the player can reach.It leaves me all the more saddened that XIII was so lacking in sprawling environments, and saddens just a bit more that XIII-2 is obviously still not using the full potential and has been left to run on fumes for story.Go, have fun, It hits everything from the 'checklist' of player complaints and goes far deeper than I think most people would have expected (myself included). Now that all the pieces are there-- the characters or the original and the grander physical scale of the sequel-- combined they would have produced an absolutely stunning sole product, but unfortunately we'll forever be forced to settle with many of the best bits separated out into two. For shame.Edit-- Wanted to add (to make entirely clear!) for the record that I have wholly enjoyed the game. It might not have the story, charm and originality of the best modern RPGs, but it has a production value a million miles beyond what they only dream of, which is something I do hope corporate finances will allow to continue in the future.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2012"}

Boone \"DaClint\"","summary":"A Gamer's Dream Machine","reviewText":"PlayStation 2 is a lot of fun.  The graphics are pretty realistic and the games are a lot of fun.  There are so many features that make it the best gaming system out there.First, it has there biggest game library available. PS2 & PS1 games can be played on PS2 so there's a game out there for everyone.Next, about 85 million Americans (about 7 out 24) own a PS2 so there are a lot of people to play with.  And PS2 gamers are all different ages from five years old to forty year old \"kids\" and probably a lot of people even older than that.Also, The new PS2 model comes with a network adapter built in the PS2 so you are ready to play people online without buying any extra accessories (except a phone (dial-up) or Ethernet (DSL or Broadband) cable).  Some games can play online with a dial-up and Broadband Internet access but most games play online with a broadband access only.  Broadband users need a broadband or DSL modem and an Ethernet cable (wired users) or an Ethernet adapter (wireless users but not all wireless accessories are compatible with PS2 so make sure to check first).  Dial-up users can just plug right into a phone jack and play.  The best part of PS2's online play is that its FREE!!! (unlike XBox for $49.99 a year or GameCube's $9.99 a month for the two games available for online play).Another good thing about PS2 is accessories and games are easy to find and abundant in many places.  I also own a GameCube and games are harder to find and are more expensive.  Also, most GameCube games are intended for little kids and also there are pretty much no online games (except for two).  PS2 games are available pretty much anywhere (I've seen some racing games at Pepboy's and Auto Zone and some games and Menard's [a hardware store in the Midwest]).  Memory cards and controllers are cheap and available in a lot of places.Another good reason is the size.  It's very small (the picture makes it look big).  It's about a little more than an inch high, nine inches long (from the left to the right) and about 6.5 inches from the front to the back.  A vertical stand is available to make it take up hardly any space.One last good reason to buy it is the extra things available for PS2.  One reason is the EyeToy.  Its exclusive to the PS2.  Its like a web cam you put on top of your TV.  You use your body to play the game. (games include fighting a guy, riding a skateboard, heading a soccer ball, using your hands to dance and use maracas, and to swat away evil things.  A LOT MORE games are available).  Also, a dance mat is available for dancing games (like the games available in the arcades).  These games are a lot of fun and make a great game for parties.  One last accessory is a gun controller.  You shoot guys on the screen (for certain games [Time Crisis 1, 2, 3, and more]) like the games in the arcade.Also, PS2 can play audio CD's and DVDs without buying any extra accessories (a DVD remote is available but not necessary unlike XBox).This is why you should buy a PS2.  The numerous features make it a the best system to buy out of PS2, GameCube, and XBox.  For choosing a system, I recommend to choose based on which system your friends have, what games you like on that system, and what features you want.  I recommend NOT choosing based on who has the better graphics or to pick a system for just one game.  PS2 is definitely worth the $149.99 and is my favorite system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2005"}

InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"Robb Boutros","summary":"Great graphics, cool setting, repetitive gameplay","reviewText":"There are some gameplay genres that prove the old adage \"the more things change the more they stay the same\". Medal of Honor: Frontline proves that no matter how you dress up a first person shooter, at it's core Frontline is basically the same as most other first person shooter games. The game degenerates into the same static formula of running around and arbitrarily blowing away the enemy the only difference is you are doing it in a World War II setting.The graphics in this game are terrific. It's almost too bad they are used in a game that gets this monotonous. The Nazi uniforms are very accurate and detailed. The environments are nicely rendered. There is the occasional slowdown where the framerate slows to a crawl but that's is forgiveable. Electronic Arts really went the extra mile to make sure that this game authentically portrayed the era as faithfully as possible. The sound is also very well done. The weapons have great sounds when you use them. Glass breaking, footsteps on creaky floors. The game gives you some excellent audio effects. The controls are also good but they will take you a little while to get the handle of using both analog sticks to aim.Unfortunately it's the gameplay that leaves something to be desired from Medal of Honor: Frontline. No matter how hard you try to dress it up, the game play is extremely repetitive an mind numbingly so. No matter what weapon you use, it doesn't change the fact that you are doing the same thing over and over again. Alot of people who play first person shooter games will tell you that it's \"more realistic\", but it comes at the expense of gameplay. If this game were presented in third person perspective I can't help but think that it could have opened the door for more diverse gameplay. Such as commanding squads and even some stealth elements. But there are certain segments of the gaming public that would consider such an idea as \"blasphemous\" as if it were violating some sort of FPS doctrine. With that mindset you get what you have here, basically the same game as countless other FPS out there now just in a differnt package. The game is also VERY linear in nature. You go from Point A to Point B with no deviation and with zero room to improvise along the way.I gave this game three stars mostly for it's graphics, however I still can't recomend it. If you're looking for a different take on the shooter concept then I would have to recomend Freedom Fighters also from Electronic Arts. It takes combat shooter a step further by giving you a third person view and mixing in squad commands and a non-linear style of gameplay.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2004"}

I am not, nor have I ever been interested in the club scene.  I know virtually nothing about what it takes to be a DJ, what kind of equipment or software you would need, or the culture of hiphop/rap/disco/dance music.  I was given the opportunity to try out DJ Hero before it was released, so I took it on a lark.  I've enjoyed some of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band games (using guitar, drums, and microphone) mainly because I'm into heavy metal, hard rock, and alternative.  I do like some pop tunes here and there, so I thought having the opportunity to mix tracks together in the context of a rhythm game might be fun.  What I came away with was a rather awkward, painful experience.I'm using the wired DJ Hero turntable, which came with a demo disc of the actual game.  It only had about 4 tracks to play, but it was enough to get a taste of how the game operates.  The controller is about the size of a medium box of donuts that can either sit on a table or in your lap.  You can also add a guitar controller on some tracks.On the right side of the controller you have a large platter with three colored buttons (red, green, and blue).  On the left you have a crossfade slider, a couple of other buttons (they basically control \"star power\"), and your typical Xbox 360 buttons under a plastic tab.  All of the buttons work well and are very responsive.  The slider allows you to switch between audio tracks, the 3 buttons control most of the rhythm, and the platter allows for scratch work.The 3 buttons on the platter must be positioned on the inside (toward the middle of the controller) and operated with the right hand while the slider is operated with the left hand.  This is where things didn't work out so well for me.  Trying to press the colored buttons and scratch with the platter left my wrist aching and sore.  It just felt awkward.  I would have preferred the buttons be positioned on the outside (right side of the controller), but the game doesn't work that way.  Plus, it was simetimes hard to discern why I would need to press a certain button at a certain time.  It just seemed arbitrary.  With Guitar Hero, you knew that pressing a button and strumming indicated that a note was being played.  It didn't seem to work that way with DJ Hero.  Again, it felt awkward.The game on screen looks very similar to what you'd see in Guitar Hero.  There is a scrolling track with colored dots on it that basically spins toward you, so you have to press the right button in rhythm with the song (sort of).  You also have to slide the crossfade in the appropriate direction and scratch when prompted.  This is very challenging at times.  You accumulate points and earn so many stars based on how many points you get, just like in Guitar Hero.  As with most of these rhythm games (except for maybe The Beatles: Rock Band), the graphics aren't anything that special.The songs are fairly interesting to listen to, and the mixes are creative.  If you enjoy dance, pop, and hiphop music then you will likely enjoy DJ Hero.  I couldn't really get into it as the controller felt awkward and left me a little sore.  Trying to find a rhythm was difficult as the button presses often felt arbitrary.  Maybe that's the way DJ'ing is supposed to be, but I'll stick with Rock Band.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00008DHNL","reviewerName":"Maria Marienthal","summary":"Didn't live up to the hype.","reviewText":"Yes, rent it first.  If I could, I'd give it 2.5 stars because that is all this game is....flat average.  It does have replay value, but there are many MANY flaws.  First off, the hand-to-hand combat system is possibly the worst I've ever used, the overall control setup is extremely cumbersome, the diologue stinks, and the game is just too short.  If one chooses to simply play through the story, the game could be over within two hours.  This is really just a good rental.  I  actually played it for the whole time that I had the game, which makes it worth the $5.00 at the rental shop.  The feature of solving random, optional street crimes also provides to the gameplay experience, but other games have pulled off the genre in a much better way.  If you want excellent hand-to-hand combat and you have the original Max Payne for PC, there is a free Kung-Fu download which is extraordinary.  If you don't have the game, try out Dead to Rights.  The shooting system and hand combat are much more fluid.Wait.....did i mention that the Bullet Time setup in True Crime is horrible?  The free aiming system that was available in both Max Payne games isn't there for Bullet Time in True Crime.  Instead of simply slowing down for your dive and quickly rotating your aim, you must use the right analog stick to switch who you are aiming for.  The right analog stick aim switch only works half the time by the way.  It's frustrating because you can freely spray your opponents with bullets like you can with other mostly run-and-gun shooters.Being able to update Nick Kang's, the main character, equipment and fighting combos is a nice feature.  It makes things just a tad bit more interesting.With an appropriate rating of Mature, there is tons of vulgarity in the diologue.  The people on the street do carry on coversations and will respond in certain ways to Nick depending on his Good Cop/Bad Cop rating.  If you run in to a few people with your car, be prepaired to be sworn at heavily.  The S-Bomb is quite possibly the most used word in the whole game.  So don't play this game with the kiddies around.Driving is probably the most fun part about the game.  The targeting system while driving actually works rather smoothly, especially for being the first game (I'm pretty sure) to feature a simultanious driving and shooting experience.  Switching into the precision-aim option while driving slows things down and allows you to shoot specific areas of an assailant's car, such as tires and gas tanks.  Outside of precision aim, the one good thing about the targeting system in this game is the auto-lock on the car that contains the perpetrators which Nick is trying to catch.  But be careful, people and other automobiles are infamous for diving into your bullet path and you will frequently kill pedestrians and blast the tires of innocent drivers.  Heck, maybe even a gas tank here and there.One fact about this game that will probably raise mixed feelings is that this game is really never difficult or frustrating.  The sneaking missions get extremely boring, but otherwise everything plays out in a simple manner.  The advantage of the very short story mode is that it does keep the action from being repetative.  About that story mode, there are 3 possible different endings...and all together, the game is still extremely short.  After the games is finished, the nice things is that you can go back to anywhere in the game, weilding your new gear and sweeping criminals off of the street as mercilessly as you so please.The amount of hype that went into this game encouraged many to purchase the game, and this game certainly didn't live up to it.  When I rented the game, I had high expectations about the much acclaimed hip-hop game soundtrack.  That had to be the worst hip-hop I have ever heard in my entire life.  All the creators did is pick up the most vulgar hip-hop that they could find and put it in this game.  The soundtrack is a deep insult to what hip-hop is supposed to be.  True hip-hop fans will be disappointed, and people who already hate popular hip-hop will be adding a little extra morter in their Berlin Wall against the style of music.If you want a chaos-ridden driver-shooter, the GTA series is probably a better fix.  But if you prefer to be the good guy that is causing absolute entropy, then try this game out.  You will find replay value in it's free-roaming style, but there are much better games out there that do a lot of things much better.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2004"}

And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"D.N.","summary":"Last time I played a new Mario game was 7 years ago.","reviewText":"Rated 3.4After six looong years past without a new Mario videogame, Miyamoto finally decides to grace us with another. If you were aching to get back in the mushroom kingdom (which the 'me generation' may recall as Mario's hometown and today's generation are unaware of), too bad! He's on vacation! It's a lot similar in form to Mario 64. The island is the Hub world, upon which levels are placed. They are fun, inventive levels and have a fair amount of different missions in each. I dislike the addition and reliance on the water cannon, which detracts from the simplicity and most all of the problem solving requires it's use. I hated having to beat on the same Octopuss, who kept coming back. Some of the this gameplay is like busywork, we've all done it before (except today's generation, which does not remember 'Mario'). The game seems to borrow a lot of Sonic's style and with less Mario characters around, it's like a different game, we get a lot of what we craved but some ideas are better suited to new franchises, instead of changing the format. Is this title enough to single-handedly prolong Mario's popularity for another 6-7 years or a decade? Absolutely not. I think if you buy a Gamecube and support Nintendo for 300 dollars (Canadian, as I did) or less than you deserve to get at least 3 full games of each major Nintendo character, if that means Miyamoto can't handle them all, fine, set up new dev. teams, but there's no excuse for the slack they've displayed on N64 and look like they're repeating now.

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Katie \"Dark Musashi\"","summary":"Cool Game","reviewText":"For one thing, don't look past this game as soon as you see the word Disney.

I have said it before and I'll say it a bunch more in the future, but FPS games are not typically my preferred game.  That being said.....Black Ops was an absolute blast!  Single player campaign  is full of tense action that never lets go and the built-in soundtrack is fantastic.  The only real issue I have with it is the same issue I have with alot of FPS games: story.  While the story isn't a complete wash, I found it hard to really get in to it.  It is almost as if they were trying too hard to make it great.  While it's got some good moments, I ultimately found it far more interesting to skip the scene(s).Online is an absolute blast.  While I never played MW2, I understand that fundamentally it is the same setup with some tweaks here and there.  However, this is the bulk of the game experience and, for most people who want to own this, the reason they want it.  This is also where my biggest complaints come in.Issue #1:  Playing a match is an exercise in both patience and futility.  It takes SUCH a long time to get in to a match.  If this was the only issue, it probably wouldn't be so bad, but when you wait for (literally) half an hour in some cases to get in to a match only to be booted five minutes in or to have the match lagging so bad that it makes it almost impossible to shoot anything; something is wrong.  This really should have been addressed a while ago, but so far I have seen little improvement.....unless you want to play at 3AM (I am typically a night owl so this isn't necessarily bad for me, but if I want to play during any \"normal\" time....it's a crap shoot.)Issue #2:  The reason I ultimately jumped on this game was because I wanted some local multiplayer.  Split screen was fun while it lasted.  Notice I said \"was\".  That is because as soon as I got my patch it began requiring an internet connection to play local multiplayer.  WTF?!  I take my deck over to a friend's house who doesn't have internet.  Basically this makes the game useless to me to play with friends unless I want to hop online at home.  Come on now!  Local multiplay should never REQUIRE a connection.  If anyone knows a work-around on this please let me know in a comment because google searches have been fruitless.  In any case, though, this is a major hassle that may affect only a few of you out there, but it's worth mentioning.  If you plan to locally multiplay this title without internet....make sure you NEVER get the patch for it.Sadly, I consider each of these isues to be \"star-dockers\".  It hurts me to score this game lowly, but these issues are stupid to have on a game that touts its multiplayer.  I will say this though, I love this game and if these isues ever get fixed; this will be a five-star powerhouse.  Unfortunately, until that time.......","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2010"}

Let me clarify why in succeeding paragraphs that this game is a five overall and a four in fun.Personally, I couldn't help but notice that this game feels very polished; with colorful graphics and a very unobstructive 3D effect. The courses are varied and interesting with plenty of secrets, the Karts and upgrades are unlocked randomly; creating almost a Russian roulette feeling to the game.  And while most of our favorite characters make a return the absence of some can't go unnoticed (I never thought I'd miss Waluigi, but I do and his absence is really noticed when you race on his track). I don't like that there was also no option to have two racers on a kart (I realize this feature was removed after the apparent \"bomb\" that was double dash, but that was one of the highlights of that entry and I think it should be considered for the next one).  Then there is the issue of difficulty, which spikes dramatically from 100 cc to 150 cc; where if a player shows any amount of skill on the latter they are likely to get MANY blue shells coming their way in single player, making for some very frustrating moments (although I guess we've kind of come to expect this and the AI isn't quite as \"cheap\" as the infamous Mario Kart Wii, it's still pretty bad here, if you're REALLY good you can expect to see a lot of blue shells even on 100 cc as well, but that's a different story).  However, I still say this game is really fun overall and stands out on its own as a strong entry.  If you don't believe me, play this then go back and play the other entries in the series after playing this, and I promise you'll notice they feel a bit disappointing in comparison to this entry (even if they're still good fun).Oh, I will also add the online component when I can connect (I am unable to do so at the moment so I will not judge that portion of the game).9/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2011"}

And second, SOULR3AV3R55 \"SOULR3AV3R55\" no one told you to keep playing you could have stopped and third this game is completely and utterly amazing.I agree that the teammates dying does get old, but that makes the game that much more realistic. The weapons are completely unique and fascinating to just chainsaw a Locust in half then do it again and again.This is my opinion but I like this game better than Halo. I love the Halo series, I cannot wait until Halo 3 comes out but for right now, my gaming life, and Xbox LIVE is completely full of G.O.W.

{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"RPG Fan","summary":"A Must Have","reviewText":"I've been skeptical about spending so much money on a \"next-gen\" console, particularly with the 360 because of all the issues regarding crashing and the \"ring of death.\"  I finally broke down and got the 360 in large part because of this game.  I vist IGN all the time to keep track of how systems are progressing.  Yes, I'll be missing out on my beloved Final Fantasy by not going with the PS3, but man is it expensive and hard to come by.  I'll be missing out on Zelda by not going with the Wii but with the exception of that one game it looks like Nintendo is still following the \"family-oriented\" route with most of its games (Rayman: Raving Rabids?!  Come on, already!).So far I'm incredibly happy with the 360 and Gears of War is simply amazing.  This game is next-gen, folks.  It reminds me a lot of Winback for the N64, the first 3PS to use a cover system.  The numbers alone speak for how great of a game this is-- it's sold over a million copies already.  Everyone's already commented on how great the graphics are, etc...  Gears definitely lives up to all of the hype, it is an absolutely incredible game.  The chainsaw-bayonet I'm sure will be in the top-5 most ingenious wepaons in videogame history.Get this game, it is worth every penny.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2006"}

To survive her first adventure and uncover the island's deadly secret, Lara must endure high-octane combat, customize her weapons and gear, and overcome grueling environments. The Definitive Edition of the critically-acclaimed action-adventure includes digital versions of the Dark Horse comic, Brady games mini-art book and combines all of the DLC.","reviewerName":"Sreenadh","summary":"A New Era of Tomb Raider, Amazing Graphics!","reviewText":"Ever since Crystal Dynamics got their hands on the Tomb Raider franchise back in the mid-2000s, they&#8217;ve been cranking out some solid games in that franchise. Solid, but hardly legendary. 2013 however, resulted in a total reboot of the series that got the formula down perfectly, creating a new foundation for the franchise that was enthusiastically welcomed and appreciated.It was a far more human Lara Croft running around this time,a  young explorer who was fighting to stay alive in a gritty reboot that had no time for skimpy shorts or cheesy one-liners. It was a reboot that didn&#8217;t just recapture the spirit of the original games, it surpassed them.Enter Tomb Raider: The Definitive Edition. It&#8217;s Lara Croft, re-realised in glorious HD visuals and platform specific bonuses that throws in some of that extra DLC for a complete package. Do you need to own this game? Well yes. And no.The biggest draw of the Definitive Edition, will no doubt be the visual upgrade to the game. It&#8217;s more than just a simple port or upscale of those graphics. It&#8217;s a genuinely massive upgrade, with Lara and her pals looking better than ever.There is no hyperbole hidden here, as the game looks downright stunning. Playing on PlayStation 4, Lara sports dirt, wounds and scars as her journey unfolds. There&#8217;s still that uncanny valley hurdle to overcome, but dammit, these are some fine-looking in-game characters.Are the little details are in there with these graphics. Skin that has texture and marks. Clothing where you can almost feel the fabric, Makeshift weapons that sport unique hand-me down touches. The island of Yamatai that Lara finds herself on, is equally beautiful, with lush vegetation and various ruins from the ancient and modern world helping to shape that arena.Tomb Raider may have had a ton of concept art behind the scenes that helped imagine this island, but the definitive edition is the version of the game that has made that vision a digital reality. And on the PlayStation 4, this game runs at a consistently high frame rate.Rare are the frame drops in Tomb Raider, as the action unfolds smoothly and vividly. It truly is a beautiful game, and one that has now replaced Killzone Shadow Fall as my go-to title to show off the hardware power of the PlayStation 4.There are other features that have been added to this platform specific version of the game as well. Owners of the optional PlayStation 4 camera can issue voice commands to Lara, such as telling her to switch from a stealth weapon to a louder and more practical shotgun, while the controller is also taken full advantage of.The Dual Shock lights up when you use a torch in the game, the touch pad makes for a handy map reader and hidden journals are broadcast through the controller speaker. All in all, a few nice touches of the hardware that is present.As for content, the retail release of the game nets you all those wonderful visual upgrades, new practical outfits for Lara to wear, a digital comic book, videos, multiplayer DLC and a new tomb to explore. But the thing is, with all those new flourishes and enhancements, this is still very much the same game that was released last year on Xbox 360, PC and PlayStation 3.Tomb Raider&#8217;s biggest strength is in its impressive single-player campaign, a story that can only be told and completed so many times. If you&#8217;ve already completed that version of the game, it;s hard to recommend paying full price once again for this prettier and slightly more substantial version of the game.But if you&#8217;ve yet to dip into the new Tomb Raider, then this isn&#8217;t just the definitive edition of the game. It&#8217;s the definitive new-gen console game to have. It&#8217;s an ambitious reboot easily balances a fantastic story with solid controls and action, and it should be on the bucket list of every gamer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00006F7S8","description":"It's hard to believe that creator Will Wright had trouble selling his originalSimCityconcept to publishers. That first game went on to fame, notoriety, and great praise--from critics, gamers, and even educators--and spawned countless imitators, not the least of which include Wright's own smaller-scaleThe Sims, which went on to become a phenomenon in its own right. Now on its fourth edition,SimCityreturns to our hard drives, and would-be city planners everywhere will be busy for a long, long time.SimCity 4functions much like its predecessors. You've got the power to zone land as residential (green), commercial (blue), and industrial (yellow). You control the budget. You decide where to place crucial services like police, fire, medical, and even utilities like power and water. You place schools, parks, roads, water towers, and scenery as you accede to the many demands of your Sim citizens. Do a good job and your city will grow and the money will flow into your coffers. Do a bad job and the people will pack up and move away, leaving your city treasury in horrific debt and landing you what the game cheekily considers to be a far easier job: senator. The game requires a balancing act that takes both planning and a persnickety nature. There are charts to read, reports to watch, and, above all, needs to juggle. It's rewarding when it all comes together, and frustrating when you fail, once again, to build anything worthwhile.That's why I wish the game came with a better manual. The included book glosses over most major information and then neglects important aspects, such as the RCI indicator (which explains zoning needs) and parts of the budget. At the very least, the manual should include tips on handling debt. There are two tutorials which cover the basics, but again, they won't help you get out of trouble once you get in too deep. You can find this information in thestrategy guide, which is sold separately, but you really shouldn't have to go that route.The graphics are amazing, showing a vibrant metropolis with scurrying traffic, wandering Sims, smoking chimneys, and sparkling lights when night falls. Fireworks reward each year of service. And wait until you see the cool disasters you can unleash if the mood strikes you--fire, lightning, tornado, volcano, and giant robot. Oddly, there's a significant performance hit even on fast systems. Thankfully, the stuttery scrolling and slow-to-respond zoom don't hurt the game too much since you can pause it at will or fast forward if you need to wait for your cash reserves to build. The most significant flaw is that the game only offers one save slot, which discourages experimentation.Despite minor imperfectionsSimCity 4is an awesome game. You can build several cities next to each other on the map and make them dependant on each other. (You can build the greater L.A. area, in other words.) You can even import your Sims fromThe Simsto live in your city. Such familiar characters can tell you a lot about what your city needs. Put simply, city planning has never been this fun, this challenging, or this deep.--Andrew S.

Drawing inspiration from classical military conflicts of the 20th century, Killzone demonstrates a unique graphical style that captures the grit and realism of intense military warfare.","reviewerName":"Matt Mabry","summary":"A Gritty and Uncensored take on Wars Past","reviewText":"This game really is THE premier game for thePS2. It leads all fields in gameplay, graphics and most of all, fun.Alright, First of all this game is just an all out frag-fest. And it's one of the better ones at that. Ofcourse as any educated buyer, you already know the story, but I'll tell you a little about the game it's self. All throughout the game I noticed striking similarities between killzone and Wars that had happened before. For instance, there's a hefty dose of Trench warfare that can be considered a rehash of WWI. Also there's gritty urban combat, which can be seen as WWII. and then there's soe Jungle warfare, which could be taken as a juiced up futuristic version of the Vietnam War. It's actually really cool. Knd of lick a campaign of the Wars America's fought in.The Graphics Are great. The whole game looks like film footage from a war. There is a grainy overlay that makes everything hazy and there is a sort of dinginess about the game. Also all of the environments are detailed and bring out the best that the PS2 has to offer; from brightly lit rooms to debris ridden subway tunnels, this game's graphics brings even the all-mighty X-BOX to it's knees. Explosions look amazing, and a thick smoke hangs over the blast area for some time after the blast, making for some frantic moments of blind shooting. Killzone has some of the best particle effects I've ever seen, meaning that every bullet hits and couses a plume of smoke, blood or bits of concrete to be thrown up into the air. It's great to see bullets fly towards you and hit a patch of ground in front of you, sending dirt into your face, that makes for some frantic moments of scrambling for any cover you can find. Also the Weapons look amazing. From the M86 silenced weapon Lugar carries around, to Templar's M84, the weapon designs and graphics really are a sight to behold. The scopes reflect in certain lights and the guns are so well rendered they actually look real. This comes in handy when you see the enemies' menacing, glowing eyes, in a dark and damp boiler room or a steemy jungle, because you feel like you have to right tools for the job.Which brings me to my next point, all of the character layouts are great. The Helghast (Your enemy) is a hulking menace, that dons an oxygen mask and has glowing orange goggles. They really do scare you when you first incounter them; Which in turn makes it that much more fulfilling to pump one of the bug-eyed suckers full of lead.Also, when these guys drop, they fall hard, their bodies twisting and contorting, which really does add to the realism. Also, bodies are thrown in the opposite direction of a grenade blast or rocket explosion, causeing their riddled corpses to slump over metal railings or Slam into a concrete wall and be thrown to the ground. It really is cool to see the helghast bodies litter a room, it's strangly exciting to see what will happen to a helghast trooper if you throw that grenade by them, or hit them in the stomach with a high-powered shotgun slug. The Character models and brilliant physics make this game a real treat for the eye. Also, a welcomed innovation is that an enemy soldier's body will lay in the same location throughout your romp through the game, they don't dissapear like they do in countless other games. To me, there is no greater joy in this game, then to walk around the room and admire the work you've preformed on 20-30 Helghan bodies.The sound effects in this game really set it apart. From Grenade explosions to the crackle of gunfire, everything sounds realistic, adding to the thrill of \"opening up\" on a Helghast platoon. My only gripe would be that the Helghast troops repeat some of the same phrases over and over. So frequently, in-fact, that it is not uncommon to hear the same phrase screamed more than once. But still, it does add to the realism of the game, because in those frantic moments when you're surrounded by Helghast, it doesn't matter what they're screaming, it's still frightining.The gameplay of this game is superb. From the function of weapons to the enemy AI, this game is top notch. The enemies will engage, take cover and throw grenades when appropriate, making even the most comon troops a challenge to take out. The Helghast will work together and give covering fire for their pinned down comrades, they'll ambush you in a hot, sticky jungle, they'll do pretty much anything that a normal person would do, which really does make them a worthy adversary. The controls are easy to learn and make the game fun to play. The addition of a 3 button engage button is smart. Meaning that you tap L1 to throw a grenade, spit out a hail of bullets with R1 and then use your secondary weapon with R2, it's a brilliant scheme that allows you to always be in the middle of the action, and allows quick access to every weapon in your arsenal.Of course, you can only carry 3 weapons at a time, so deciding when to get rid of that Hish-Magnification Sniper rifle in exchange for the No Magnification M42 Machine gun can be a challenge in itself, The whole game has kind of an action-reaction relationship. From Wheather or not to pick up the Heavy Machine-gun instead of keep your sniper rifle, to decideing shich enemy to take out first, each decision makes for a seperate reaction, good or bad, you just have to suck it up and live with it.This game's single player is extrarodinary, but the multiplayer aspect of Killzone is where it really shines. There's nothing more fun than Running around on a gritty beach, taking out enemies or sprinting back to a base with a supply pack, with bullets whizzing past your head. The online is fun too, it's pretty much the same, but there's 16 REAL people in a map at once. It's honestly all out insanity. My only complaint about the Multiplayer is that there are very few multiplayer maps, but still, the maps that exist, are THE BEST multiplayer maps I've ever played on.Now it's time for a little \"Attacking\" I like the way the Reloading and Grenade tossing animations are. It gives a nice touch to an already realistic game, and it makes it makes the game really look like it's title, a First Person Shooter. Here's a Summary of the game:Gameplay: 13/10 A lot of fun, and sometimes tough when deciding whick weapon to ditch and which weapons to pick up.Graphics:15/10 Guerilla goes for an edgy, gritty look and pulls it off. Great character models and detailed environments give this game an above average score in the graphics department.Difficulty: 10/10 Very hard at times, Sometimes this game seems hopelessly hard, but once you conquer that challenge, there's a great feeling of accomplishment.Fun: 20/10 Wheather sitting back with your freind and dueling it out along with up to 14 other bots, or romping through the Single player campaign, it's a blast to hear the Helghast screams, and just all out fun to be in the Killzone.Overall: 48/40 Above Avaerage score, for an Above average game.This is THE game for the year of 2004 on any Console. I don't want to say anything negative about halo, but I personally like this game more.From the way the amount of ammo you have left in your clip (A drawing of bullets in the lower right hand corner) to the overall presentation of this game, it really is a groundbreaker in the Genre of FPS. And it even shows us just how much our \"out dated\" PS2s really can do. KILLZONE IS THE BEST GAME OF THE YEAR 2004 AND IS TRUEY AMAZING.This is a definate must for anyone who wants a challenging, fun and at times frantic, shooter. You MUST get this game.P.S- this game does have it's fair share of blood, so it's not recommended for anyone under the age of 13. Seeing as dead soldiers' blooding handprints can be seen down a hallway, and even shots that make contact send a plume of blood into the air.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2004"}

I just found out there's a glitch in this game that will let you play all characters alternative costumes for FREE!The only thing is...you have already have at least one alternative costume to be able to use this \"glitch\". All you need to do is select a character with their alternative costume already. Then select their assist type, (pick any one). Now scroll over to a character that you want an alternative costume for. Here's the very important part, you must be quick and it must be timed right. You have to press the cancel button twice and as you as you press the second cancel button you press \"LB button\" right after. The LB button is the \"key\". It can't be too fast, but it can't be too slow either - it has to be perfect! It's almost like you're pressing both buttons at the same time, but it's a millisecond off. If you did it right, you will see the character now say he/she has the alternative costume available to pick.Remember it's all about speed, timing, and luck! Don't expect to get this trick done on your first, second, or third, fourth, even fifth try. I don't know how many times, I had to try it before I saw the alternative costume appear and got it. Oh almost broke my fingers trying to do it. lolFinally, afterwards, I don't know how many attempts - I got it!!! At first I thought it not working, but when I got it, the clouds open up and the sun comes in to see the NEW FREE COSTUMES.Also, you can only do the glitch for your first 2 characters and the 3rd character will just have to pick a regular outfit or something.This also works with the Herald costumes to get more Herald costumes.I don't expect to ever update this game ever again! Oh Capcom...you really surprised me sometimes. But, I'm on to you. Thanks for the glitch! Now leave us alone with it. ha haThis glitch will save you $20 buck! Got to love it!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I got the first MVC3 game when it came out at launch day at midnight. I waited over 10 freaking years to play MVC3. When I got home, it was totally not worth the money that I paid for it, $60 plus tax!!! I already notice that there were no additional modes then the standard arcade mode, training, and missions. This game quickly became very boring to play.9 months later, UMVC3 came out. I bought this game from Amazon at launch day, Nov. 15. I started to play it and what you know, it was better than the original. This game should had been the REAL MVC3 from day 1. If they needed to make the fans wait 9 more months for this than why not? We waited over 10 years already, what's 9 months!The 12 additional characters did make the original game better than without. The old characters were better to play with because they all did get more moves to play with. The additional stages helped. Later we got an additional mode, heroes and heralds mode. But, I could not shake the feeling that Capcom did rip off the fans by making MVC3 dead with UMVC3.Yes, yes, one can argue that Capcom did not force me or any fan to buy UMVC3. Yes, we did get 12 characters more and they would costs less than buying 1 at a time. Yes, Capcom has been doing this kind of stuff for years since Street Fighter 2 by upgrading their game. Yes, $40 is worth the money for all the stuff in UMVC3. So, yes, I do see the reasoning for Capcom actions, but in no way do I agree with it.Capcom is one of those companies that want to milk a person for all they are worth with this game. Is the Galactus mode and H&H; mode really all the sorry the fans going to get since they bought MVC3? People that just got UMVC3 won't even get the DLC characters, Jill and Shuma for free. Capcom still want to milk people for those characters, but hey, if you buy them, you get a free costumes in UMVC3. Worth it?Since we are talking about costumes, Capcom likes doing this new thing while playing against the AI in arcade mode. Now when you fight the AI, you will get teased with a character alternative costume. Before in MVC1 or MVC2, you could probably get these costume by just beating the game over and over by unlocking them. Now, you won't get those costumes by doing that.How do you get those alterative costumes you ask? You can buy those costumes of course! Yes, yes, just give Capcom more money and you can unlock the key for them on the disc and now wear those nice new costumes. So, Capcom way of promoting or selling the player the idea of buying more for this game is in game adverting!But wait, if you didn't think that was bad enough, you were wrong! There's more! You can only buy the costumes in pieces of a group bundle, but you can't buy costume 1 by 1. If you want 1 costume in 1 bundle and another costume in another bundle, guess what? You have to buy 2 bundles! But, hey, you're in luck! If you're going to get many different bundles, you might as well get the overall Value Pack and get all the characters alternative costumes all at once! Yup! You can pay $20 bucks and get all the new costumes all at once! Why of go Capcom, find different ways to take a player for all that they are worth.What could Capcom do next for milking the customer?  There is still the idea of UMVC3 SUPER, EXTRA, MEGA, TURBO, ARCADE EDITION! Meaning yet again version of MVC3 is yet to come out. Sure, some people say it won't happen. Sure, some Rep said it won't happen. But, if it does, what are you going to do about it? NOTHING! You can't tell Capcom what to do! Capcom does what they want. So, if they're wanted to make another one to milk out the game further - they will!!!If the new version will be in disc form it's will be another $40. If it's a DLC form, it will be $20 or more. But the point is, it yet another way of milking the customer.Can Capcom do yet anymore damage? Sure. For the next game, there will be in game stages and sounds previews just before matches resume. Wouldn't you just love to see that? OH yeah, I would love to play that stage. $3. Oh man, that soundtrack rocks! $2. Why stop there? \"Let's go crazy!\" Buy the all bios and endings for $10.Capcom TAKE MY MONEY!!!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2012"}

The game offers jaw dropping graphics, tight controlls and lots and lots of combos and moves you will be practicing for hours.  Did I mention the gameplay is intence and incredibly insane?  Lets start off by saying Ninja Gaiden IS a challenging game(and we're taking about Normal mode people!), for any avid button mashers you better start changing the way you play games because button mashing will get you killed, EASILY in this game...heck you'll be dead in less then 3 seconds!  The great thing about Ninja Gaiden is that the more you practice and getting some of the great moves pulled off you will be more then ready to fight some pretty nasty creatures and tough bosses and defeating them feels SOOOO satisying!  Speaking of enemies, they arn't just going to stand around there and let you slice n' dice them, THEY WILL KILL YOU....AND THEY WILL DO IT FAST if you don't do anything about.  The enemies will range from normal/taking them down easily to frustrating as hell/I hate Black Spider Ninja Clan!!!  The number one thing your finger should be on is the block button(it IS your best friend in this game)as it will block LOTS of the enemies attack(except for a few magic attacks and boss attacks).  Ok I'll get back to the enemies and bosses later, I've already said a few things about the gameplay now let me get to the graphics department.......THE GAME IS FREAKIN' BEAUTIFUL!  It is the 2nd best looking Xbox game next to Conkers BFD.  From the mountains to the sky, the beautiful looking water, amazing character models and I hate to sound wierd but I loved how smooth and soft the water would flow in the game, and boy oh boy there will be alot of pars where you'll be starting at the water and enviorments in the game!  Not only are the visuals incredible but the CGI are great as well and a sight to see!  the visuals in the game totaly earn a 10/10 in my book.  Now lets get to the music...How do I start?  The music is like the graphics...BEAUTIFUL!  The music is so good and yet so different in each Chapter, they fit so perfectly as well!  It's a shame the creators didn't want to release a soundtrack to this amazing game because it would be a must buy, the music is just so damn good(I especially loved the 2nd chapters song)!  Now let me get to the second half of the enemies/bosses..Well I've said a few things about the enemies now let me get to the bosses.  Some range to really really easy(chapter 3 boss)to really frustrating(Chapter 7 boss)and some range to just plain normal.  If I had to put the bosses in Ninja Gaiden in one word it would be \"epic\"...There are so many bosses in this game and they are all different and varied in there owns ways, they'll range from a simple Worm to a huge dragon, the game just feels epic when it comes to boss battles(and you'll have to dodge alot in the boss fights).  Did I mention this game also is chuckfull of Sub Bosses?  They are spread through out the game and you will need to make mence meat out of them if you're going to want to survive this game.  Some Sub Bosses go from 1 in a chapter to 3 in a chapter, not to mention the chapters BOSS!!!  Now that I've mentioned some of things about the enemies/bosses of the game how does it stack up with the games level of difficulty???...Well like I stated before if you are just a button masher, you will be pumled withen 8 seconds before you are even half way through of the first chapter!  But if you practice for a atleast 30 minutes with the moves you DO have with you(untill you upgrade it later)then you will make enemies you face look like little school girls.  So if I had to say how I feel about the difficulty, it would be...Not hard, just challenging and abit frustrating at parts, overall if you are a type of gamer that is looking for a short/breez game to play for maybe a 30 minutes a day don't even think about touching this game(it will take you awhile just to beat ONE chapter)because this game is well...I can't say incredibly long but it has an awesome lengh(it took me about 24 hours my first try)including the fact that you will be hunting for goodies such as magic, and life of gods and Lives of a Thousand gods which are items that will increase your health meter and get you one step closer at getting vengance and finally grasping the Dark Dragon Blade..So let me just get this over withThe Good-Stunning graphics-Intence action and gameplay-The bosses in this game are incredibly awesome and intence-The music is amazing-The controlls are perfect-Tons of moves to master and weapons to upgrade-Lots of Sub Bosses in the game!-CGI are a treat to see-Fun and challenging at the same time!-Second Best video game on the xbox(first being Shenmue II)-One of the greatest action games ever made-Very good lengh for the Normal modeThe Bad-Button mashing in this game = quick and painful death-First 2 chapters are a pain since you don't have alot of health and the bosses are pretty tough.-Very frustrating at times but not to the point where you'll leave the game-If you dont use the block button alot in the game, this game will tear you to shreadsOverall I've said all my ranting, so I'll make it quick and sweet.  Ninja Gaiden is not only one of the greatest action games ever made it's also one of the best games ever made on the Xbox next to Shenmue II.  Stunning visuals, tight controlls, good atmospher, the music is just amazing and the enemies/bosses in this game are intence!  Normal Difficulty will bring a challenge to any gamer and others for more to come.  I loved the game and I  am very proud to say that Ninja Gaiden is the second xbox game in my review section that gets a.........5 out of 5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2005"}

Honestly the only racing game I've played and truly enjoyed as of late has been Mario Kart Wii, which is a blast by the way. I've purchased Split/Second after hearing the premise of the game, I thought it sounded really interesting and very unique. Looking back I'm very happy I took a chance on this title, I wasn't let down at all and have been really enjoying it.Once you play this game and understand what it's trying to do you will come to the conclusion as I have that the \"cons\" are what makes this game different than most other racing game out there. \"Rubber banding\" is necessary to play the game as it was intended to be played. Consider this, if you were able to break out in first place and never have to look back it takes away from some of the main points of this game which is to cause destruction and to trigger traps on your opponets. Besides, if you can't pass the car in front of you do the next best thing, which is to drop a plane on him! Also, a lot of people complain about \"drifting\", which I must agree there is a lot of, however there are many other ways to fill up your power meter like \"drafting\" which in my opinion is the easier way to play. My final point is in regard to the lack of customization as far as the cars are concerned, again this is not what this game is about so if that is what you're looking for invest in a different title. This game is not about the cars (as strange as that is to say) it's about the havoc you can cause and to what extent you can cause it.I hope my review has been helpful to you and thanks for reading, sorry for being long winded LOL.

{"product_name":"B004NRN5EO","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"teejay","summary":"Dark Souls is like crack. Once you start, you can't stop.","reviewText":"There are few games on the market these days quite like Dark Souls, other than the game's spiritual successor Demon's Souls. This game combines stunning graphics, challenging gameplay, a deep game mechanic, and an interesting (if minimal) story, and combines it with some of the best (when working) multiplayer you can get on a console. The game is not flawless, but as of the latest update (1.05) it's pretty darn close.First, a little background: For those who don't know, Demon's Souls (the games predecessor) came out on the playstation in 2009 to little fanfare, but caught on like wildfire becuase of the incredible multiplayer. The game straddled the line between an old-school Zelda type experience (and I'm talking NES Zelda, not Ocarina of time), and a modern MMORPG. How is this possible? Well for starters you were online pretty much all the time. You were constantly seeing 'ghosts' of other people playing the game, and when you were in human form were constantly under the threat of being 'invaded' by another player looking to steal your body for their own use. If you died, the game got HARDER, as you lost half your max HP while in soul form, among other things - but in this situation you could drop a summon sign to be summoned by other players to help them beat a level (theirby earning your body back), or you could be the invader and kill some other hapless player, thereby taking their body for yourself.  You could leave little hints on the ground for other players to find, but there was no in-game voice chat - and this was done on purpose.  A lot of the challenge involved finding things out on your own, but beyond that, hearing some 10 year old over the intercom would certainly ruin the immersion, and I think the developers were well aware of that.Did I mention if you died you lost all your accumulated unspent XP? You had one chance to reclaim them if you could get back to your bloodstain, but if you died again, they were gone. Yeah this game was unforgiving.Anyway, back to Dark Souls. In a nutshell, Dark Souls is Demon's Souls's(?) unofficial sequal. It uses the same basic game engine, borrows heavily from the Demon's Souls look & feel, and similar multiplayer, although this has been modified, sometimes for the better, and sometimes for worse, as we will get to in a minute. For various reasons Sony ended up owning the IP rights to \"Demon's Souls\", so when From Software went to develop a sequal (which they wanted to release on both the PS3 and the 360) they had to start from scratch with the IP.  The result is a game that has a totally different world and story, with a darker, grittier feel than the original (if that's possible).Gameplay:The combat is unforgiving, but very fair. There are litterally hundreds of different weapons, and although they more or less fit into six or seven different catagories, each one has its own quirks that make them all feel unique. One of the nice things about this game is that there is definitely no 'best weapon', as effectiveness has as much to do with your own skill as it does with the weapon itself. All weapons can be upgraded throughout the game, and crafting better weapons becomes a major part of the game. This is another area where the game takes on the MMO aspect as the combinations of weapons & armor, and how one upgrades each, can lead to literally hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of permutations, so there are many meaningful ways to customize your character.As with demon's souls, you're online most of the time. In fact, in order to play offline  you have to jump through a few hoops, as the default mode is online.  Online mode is seemless however, there are no lobbies (that you can see, anyway), and matching happens more or less in the background as it would in an MMO. brough back from Demon's Souls are player ghosts, so you can see when an area has activity in it, as well as the co-op and invasion mechanics. While in human form, you are constantly at risk of being invaded, although this happens much less frequently than In Demon's Souls as there are few hoops that need to be jumped through in order to perform an invasion. Unfortunately, there are those that have abuse the invasion mechanic and tend to invade low-level players early on in the game with super powerful gear which can lead to a lot of griefing. It is reccommended new players play through the first through areas of the game as \"Hollows\", or undead, so as not to be invaded and constantly harrased. Fortunately, the griefing seems to be limited to the Undead Burg & Parish levels, and after that, invasions tend to me more or less on even ground.The gameplay is -VERY- difficult at first, but once you get the hang of it, becomes immensely addictive and rewarding. Fortunately, when you are in human form, one thing  you can do is summon other players via signs left on the ground to help you through whatever area you are in. If you are in hollow form, you cannot summmon other players, but you can be summoned yourself, and successfully helping a player beat a boss character earns you \"humanity\" which you can use to restore your body, among other things.This game has literally hundreds of hours of replay value. For completionists, you are looking at AT LEAST 3 playthroughs to get all the trophies/achievements. And some of the rarer items are incredibly difficult to get without a lot of luck and patience (if you ever come across a Symbol of Avarice, consider yourself very lucky).So if this game is so great, why not give it a perfect score?Well, it IS great, but it's not perfect. First of all, even though this is probably my favorite game to date, and a game I've invested well over 250 hours in and still haven't beaten yet, this game isn't for everyone. As stated before, it's hard at first, and doesn't hold your hand, unlike most other RPGs these days.  This is definitely a thinking man's game, and if you aren't into that, don't bother.The multiplayer is not without its issues. This time around the online component was implemented via lobbies & PTP connections, as opposed to the single server model of Demon's Souls, which unfortunately means you won't nessacerilly see everyone in your game zone at any given time. This is of course problematic for matchmaking. While certain patches have fixed this issue somewhat, there are other issues that still need to be addressed and probably won't be. For example: the \"Gravelord Covenant\", one of the factions you can join, rarely (if ever) works, and furthermore you can aquire the faction rewards simply by farming one specific mob in the game. The object you need to collect to advance rank in this faction is the same object you need to actually engage in multiplayer for the faction, which kind of defeats the purpose of it. there are other issues, like the level matching requirements (or lack thereof in some cases), which can lead to horribly unbalanced fights in certain areas.Overall, this game has everything the fantasic Demon's Souls had to offer, and a great deal more. The game is not perfect, and there is definitely room for improvement in the next iteration, but this is easily one of the best games of 2011, and every hardcore rpg gamer should give this game a spin.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000G7PMX2","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"Red Bronze. It's better than Steel but still no Silver.","reviewText":"Red Steel wasn't the blockbuster Nintendo Wii launch title that we all expected it to be. Sit tight, let it sink in, and take a deep breath. Still alive? Not going insane? Alright. Now that we're over that, let's take a look at its accomplishments and fairly judge where it stumbles.Starting positive is always nice but for the sake of getting all of that enjoyable critical bitterness out of the way I'll start off by saying that Red Steel has a joke of a story. The plot puts you in the shoes of Scott, an American man whose engagement to a beautiful Eurasian woman thrusts him into a Yakuza gang war for a sacred sword known as the Katana Giri. Scott, as that loopy Asian lore would have it, ends up being the first American ever to touch the Giri and though it is blasphemy in the eyes of most, some simply want to help the poor guy find his girlfriend and have a happy ending. I truthfully thought Prey set the bar too high for its \"I'll do anything for you, my damsel\" storyline but Red Steel takes that bar and whacks Prey's Tommy right in his Native American forehead. That's quite a target to hit, he had a rather large head.Another slight stumble is the cumbersome control scheme that takes some learning before it starts working for the player rather than against him or her. Once you've figured out the screwed-up turning and the dreadful zoom function, you'll be more than halfway there. Once learned, the controls are still a little tough and don't ever do much to make one think, \"I'd rather be pointing this damn remote than pushing around analog sticks.\" Now, never should one think, \"I'd rather be pointing a gun at my own head than pointing this damn remote.\" Red Steel isn't that unplayable, and after only an hour few if any players should have trouble finding success.Get this: Red Steel is actually fun. It really is! For those of you who put the game down after a level or two (I know who you are), or perhaps returned your copy of the game, I pity you. You missed out, because you didn't give the game a chance to unravel whatsoever. It's like you stopped toilet papering a house after you threw the first roll. Let it all unravel. Red Steel's got a lot of depth that goes into the gameplay rather than the blockhead storyline or characters. It's already a known thing that you can shoot and participate in sword duels, so I'm not going to go into depth about it. You know it's there, so that's good enough. Now, the cool thing is that you can unlock a whole bunch of weapons and new sword attacks to help you shoot and slice through any of the game's poorly-accented enemies and boss characters. You do this by training between missions, so to get more stuff in the game, you simply have to prove your skills. Fair enough, I say, because then you can go into each of the game's challenging levels with the best guns, fully-loaded, ready to blow everything up.Visually, Red Steel is a great-looking Wii game. Now, one could argue that that statement means nothing because the Wii isn't a visual-centric console. I concur, but that's unimportant. Red Steel has a handful of visual tricks, like impressive lighting and highly detailed environments. Sure, the textures can be a little blurry, and by that I mean someone at Ubisoft needs to put away the Vaseline. Sure, the enemy models are repeated too frequently, but the game never looks bad and always looks pretty good. Those twelve people in the world with Nintendo Wii Component Cables will have a real treat if they play Red Steel.Now, if you have a mute button, take advantage of it. I'd truthfully listen to nineteen cats simultaneously in heat before I'd enjoy listening to Red Steel's voice acting and ridiculous, PG-rated dialogue. C'mon, Ubisoft, your game features a bunch of grown-up men shooting guns at each other, more or less trying to blow brains out. They're going to have a bit too much adrenaline and energy pumping through them to shout out insults such as \"Moron!\" at each other.Red Steel's a good game. That's all there is to it. It's a good, fun game that had too much hype, both internally at Ubisoft and externally by the media. It's a victim of that, and other than some awful voice acting and a joke of a storyline, nothing more. It's got the depth and length to keep the Wii gamer entertained for at least a dozen hours, which makes it worth the $50 price tag.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2006"}

For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"Maximus \"MIRR\"","summary":"A must have (My review is of the Gamecube-remake)","reviewText":"To me this is one of the greatest games of all time.

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"Courtney L. Osborn","summary":"I love alt History","reviewText":"Intro:Resistance 2 is a science fiction first person shooter developed by Insomniac Games (known for Ratchet & Clank) released in 2008. I have slowly been losing interest in first person shooters lately, but after hearing one of my favorite journalists rave about it for years I finally decided to give this one a shot.Story:The story picks up where Resistance: Fall of Man left off which was released two years prior. Here&#8217;s a little background information for those who missed the first game: the setting is in Britain during 1951 and the protagonist, Sgt. Nathan Hale, is trying to lead a human resistance force in getting rid of a strange alien-like invasion. An alien race known as the Chimera have spread through Europe and are infecting humans virally, which causes them to mutate into similar Chimeran monsters. Hale eventually saves Britain, but is believed to have been killed in action. Resistance 2 starts off with the same cutscene that the first game ended with; Nathan Hale being picked up by the Special Forces. He is then transported to the United States where the battle is continuing. Hale is now a part of a Chimeran infected elite squad called the &#8220;Sentinels&#8221; and has to defend the US from the invasion. I found the story to be pretty cool because it is an alternate take on history. I love everything about history and alternate versions of history and this was definitely a cool way of considering how things could have changed after World War II. Most of the time I find myself not caring whatsoever about the story in a first person shooter but Insomniac found an interesting way of making the story actually matter. You want to save the United States from invasion. You want to stop the unknown forces from destroying the planet. Above all else, you want to know what in the world is even going on and how all of this began.Presentation:After my time with the first game, I thought that Resistance 2 was probably going to look like crap; I was severely mistaken. That does not mean that this game blew me away with its presentation by any means, but it was good. It took a giant step forward from the first game, which comes as no surprise since it was developed as a launch title on the PlayStation 3. The graphics were above what you would expect from a sci-fi FPS released in 2008. It reminds me a lot of games like Killzone 2 and Bulletstorm that were both released later on. The voice acting was superb so there is nothing really to complain about here. Other than your typical yelling and screaming from soldiers during missions, the only other real dialogue is during the cutscenes. Speaking of the cutscenes, I believe that they were placed evenly throughout the game. This is not one of those games where you can expect to play for an hour and then watch cutscenes for an hour. Normally they lasted about two minutes at most so you were never out of the game for very long. They explained what they had to and then put you into the next mission. There were also a few minor cutscenes in the middle of missions in order to show you things they way Insomniac intended for you to see them, and so you didn&#8217;t miss them. A quick example would be that you go through a hall and something starts happening outside the window; the game will take control of your character and turn you so that you can see what is happening outside, and then give you the control back. This is a great way to show you everything you need to see because otherwise you could miss all sorts of things if you weren&#8217;t taking your time.Gameplay:This is not your typical first person shooter that you can mindlessly shoot your way through really fast. It plays just like any other FPS would in that you can run, shoot, throw grenades, change weapons, etc. The major difference is that this game is not easy by any means. Even on easy mode (yes I played it on the easiest mode), this game was freaking difficult. There were numerous occasions where I set the controller down and thought that there was no way I would ever be able to finish the game. I always ended up coming back once I calmed down and was able to figure out how to get past the parts I was stuck on. Resistance 2 is so difficult for a few reasons. First, there are many different kinds of enemies and second, some levels drop you in with what seems like unlimited enemies. The different kinds of enemies are difficult because they don&#8217;t all die as easily, they have different styles of attacks, and some are faster than others. You have to pay attention to who you are shooting at or else you could end up dead quickly. The seemingly unlimited enemies are difficult for obvious reasons. I do not think that there are many situations in the game, if at all, that there are actually unlimited enemies, but it sure seemed like it. Sometimes, if you don&#8217;t take out the front line of enemies fast enough their backups will start swarming into the area and then you are left with tons of enemies to kill all at once. This game makes taking cover almost mandatory because if you try to run out in front of 20 enemies all firing at you at once you will die VERY fast. I hate taking cover in games so it was a difficult concept for me to learn, but eventually I was able to take advantage of all of the debris lying around every map for cover.Gameplay also changes based on the weapons you choose to use; and there are tons of them. This game is set in an alternate history where an alien invasion happens. Rather than only having post World War II guns, you also have the option of using a multitude of alien weaponry. This makes the game much more fun than a normal military FPS. I will give you some examples of weapons I found extremely fun to use. The first that you get a chance to use in the game is a magnum. This in itself is not all that exciting, but it has a secondary attachment on it that is freaking amazing; an explosive detonator for each bullet. All you have to do is fire the magnum like normal by hitting R1 and wherever the bullet hits it will stick, then you hit R2 to make the bullet explode. There are also a few laser assault rifles in the game as well that have cool secondary attachments like being able to tag your enemies. This allows you to see them behind walls and cover so that you know where they are at all times until the tag wears off. My favorite weapon in the game is called the Auger. This is a laser-like assault rifle that allows you to actually shoot through walls. While wielding the Auger, you can see all of the enemies in the area behind the walls automatically until you change weapons. This makes shooting them through cover extremely easy and fun. Its secondary attachment lets you throw down a giant force field shield in front of you to block any incoming bullets, but still allows you to shoot through it with your Auger. I had a ton of fun with all of these weapons; it really changed the mundane FPS shooter mechanics that most games have.The Verdict: 8.0 out of 10Resistance 2 is one of the better first person shooters I have played in a long time. While most shooters stick to the same boring gunplay, Resistance 2 changes it up by making it difficult. I love that there are several different enemy types that you had to learn to change your play style for. I love the fact that the game is set in an alternate past. It is cool to see soldiers using futuristic alien weapons during the 1950s. As a history major I thought the story was a really cool take on what the Cold War could have been. This is not a game for everyone because of its sci-fi story, but the solid first person shooter mechanics make it a game worth playing for anyone who loves a good shooter.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"V. Berk","summary":"Rest easy: Halo is in good hands","reviewText":"Wow!  That is all I have to say.  My expectations were not very high going into Halo 4 but now I can't get over how pleasantly surprised I was.  I was growing distant from the Halo franchise and thought I might abandon it all together, but never have I been so wrong!  Halo 4 reminded me of the greatness of sci-fi universe of the series and made me care for its characters in ways I never had before.Let me explain my thoughts going into this game: I was bored of Master Chief and Cortana.  Master Chief was becoming a relic, a near silent first-person shooter hero in a day when players expect more from video game protagonists ad Cortana had struck me as a nuisance in much of the original trilogy.  After Halo Reach gave you the ability to create your own character, even if it wasn't developed it was still YOUR character so you had some attachment.  I never felt anything for the two characters' relationship.  When he was separated from her in Halo 2 and went to get her back in Halo 3 I felt nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  Needless to say, going into 4 all I could think was:  \"Give me more Halo Reach and put Master Chief and Cortana in cryosleep.\"Then, much to my amazement, 343 Industries did the unexpected: They made them characters I wanted to follow.  Following the events of Halo 3 the Master Chief and Cortana find themselves on another Forerunner artifact.  Cortana is old and on the verge of going \"rampant\" (where an A.I. thinks itself to death) and Chief refuses to let this happen.  While a new enemy threatens to exterminate the human race it is the interactions between MC and Cortana that fuel this game's heart.  I played through that campaign always wanting to know what would happen to them instead of just my drive to complete a sci-fi shooter.A small gripe I have with Halo 4 is the amount of characters and ideas that pop in and out that you -the gamer- won't understand unless you've read the expanded universe novels/comics.  I never felt truly lost in the plot, but I clearly would have appreciated more if I'd kept up on the novels (I used to read everything up until Halo 3, but that game disappointed me so much that I completely lost interest in the Halo universe...guess now is a good time to get back in).  That isn't a negative, but I think it's something gamers should know up front.If I seem to be spending a lot of time on the relationship between Master Chief and Cortana it's because the writing of Halo 4 is truly what sets 343 Industries apart from Bungie.  Bungie had solid stories, but 343's writing team has constructed a narrative with a far greater emphasis on character than.  Where 343 falls short of Bungie is in the game play and level designs (especially in multiplayer).  Bungie was --and likely still is-- a master of level design and multiplayer.  343 does their best, but Halo: Reach remains the best multiplayer experience for Halo.Then there's the visuals.  Halo 4 is without a doubt the most beautiful Xbox 360 game ever released!  And I know it might seem strange saying this, seeing as Halo is such a well publicized franchise, but in a sea of gray and brown military and post-apocalyptic shooters Halo's universe is refreshingly vibrant!  This game pushes the 360 to its limits and provides some of the best science-fiction landscapes of the console generation.Ultimately this boils down to being an immersive science-fiction story centered around the Master Chief and Cortana.  As a single-player campaign the game delivers all the gunplay, weapons, power-ups, vehicles, and alien landscapes you could hope to have in a Halo game only with the added bonus of character drama.  If you're a fan of Halo multiplayer I suppose you could make a point that 343 isn't quite as good as Bungie, but I was here for the single player campaign and it didn't disappoint.343 Industries has proudly shown that Halo can carry on without Bungie and sets foundation for future entries in the franchise.  Anyone who thinks Xbox's flagship  franchise was becoming stale couldn't be more wrong.  It gave this longtime Halo fan a new hope for the franchise and I now look forward to the continued adventures of John, Spartan 117 in the future.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2013"}

I plugged them and the Playstation recognized them immediately, the problem is that, after messing with the settings for a while, they just did not work for me. The volume was too low and the headset was not as comfortable as my prior one (PULSE Elite).The mic is nicely located and is not intrusive as with other similar devices.It has been announced that an update for the PS4 will enable headsets that could be used with the PS3, if that is the case, I should be able to eventually use the far superior PULSE headset from Sony (true, the PULSE is way off the price range the P4C is). I will have to admit they work and perform well, but after using them for a while I see little difference from using these to using the mono earpiece included with the PS4 out of the box. Since what we care the most is about performance, I guess that would be the easier way to summarize how I felt about the P4C.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2014"}

Mok","summary":"Fairly good game, spoiled by many annoying features.","reviewText":"For the first hour or so of playing this game, my hopes soared -- could it be that Electronic Arts finally came up with a game that was just enjoyable, without so much of the crap that they so often put in just to mar a perfectly good game?Alas, deeper into the experience, the annoyance factor crept in.  Again.At first, everything about this game's mechanics, graphics and design made sense.  Controls were smooth enough, the graphics (especially the cut movies) were superb and almost lifelike, and the presence of Pierce Brosnan lent credibility.  And there are no fewer than four Bond girls in this game, all famous faces -- supermodel Heidi Klum, Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie), Misaki Ito (Ju-On:  The Grudge) and, just to be weird, singer Mya.  I was definitely not a big fan of the last choice, either for the theme song or the character, but at least you get variety.  In the beginning of the game, I was mightily impressed with how the game kept you in the know about where you are and what you're doing -- there are step-by-step training sessions, the first of which was very cleverly designed as a classic Bond film opening, and the control scheme was simple and effective, instantly manageable.Then, slowly, the game began to deteriorate.  More and more, the same strengths started becoming weaknesses.  You're thrown into missions where you're not told what to do, and most of them have a timer on them.  I was most annoyed with the \"Serena St. Germaine\" mission, where you have to drive to a location and supposedly \"avoid the patrols\".  But all paths that don't have patrols on them are guarded by impassable, unbeatable tanks...until I looked it up online and found that you had to drive right into the patrols, then lose them.  Didn't the game just tell me I was supposed to \"avoid\" these suckers?  In another mission, you're told to get \"beneath\" a train with your speeding car.  Turns out you have to get \"behind\" it closely until it sails over a bridge.  So it's the old \"play it over and over until you luck out on a solution\", which I never consider a good thing -- good for keeping the player stuck, but it annoys me to no end.As in Syphon Filter:  The Omega Strain, you're forced to listen to an arrogant voice that berates you for every mistake you make, and in this one it's Judi Dench's \"you are a complete failure\" speeches, regaling you with insults every time you fail an objective.  In one level where you have to drive through a twisty town in the rain and avoid pedestrians, I just threw down the controller and called it quits -- Dench became too irritating, and every time you replay the mission, you have to do this first part over where you're just driving to a park to take a phone call.  It's called \"checkpoints\", you nimrods!Such a pity, because for the first three or four missions, I was almost ready to give this game the first five-star rating I've ever given to a video game.  But it's typical of Electronic Arts, who in the past three or four years have made the Medal of Honor series so joylessly difficult that they ruined my memory of the franchise.  So it is with Everything or Nothing -- would've been great, if they hadn't decided to screw it up royally midway through.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2005"}

As the title implies, Revenant Wings is a sequel to last year's PS2 title Final Fantasy XII.  Those who played that excellent RPG will remember it as being the best game the series had seen since the legendary Final Fantasy VII, with one of the most engaging stories since the aforementioned game as well.  Revenant Wings picks up after the original FF XII concluded, with Vaan and crew being the stars of this RTS/RPG show.  In terms of game design, Revenant Wings bears the most resemblance to Heroes of Mana for the DS.  Unlike that title though, Revenant Wings won't aggrivate you to death, and instead pulls out some pretty impressive moments to be had.  There is a nice amount of depth to be found in item and skills, even though the combat itself is a bit slow and repetitive.  The game's presentation though is wonderful, from some great 3-D work to an incredible music score, Revenant Wings proves to be one of the better looking and best sounding games to hit the DS yet.  While there's no Wi-Fi connectivity to be found here, Revenant Wings does offer some bonus missions, but the real meat and potatoes is to be had in the game's main story.  All in all, Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings is an impressive excursion on the DS that continues one of the best stories the series has ever seen.

They draw me in at first, but repetitiveness and what for me is one of the least intuitive control configurations wear me down.  I usually finish the stories but it absolutely becomes a grind.  RDR does have its faults, some of which are similar to its GTA brethren.  But for me the setting, characters and story kept me involved to the end and beyond.  I encountered some of the visual glitches described by others here and there, but overall this game looks amazing, especially for a sandbox game.  RDR also accomplishes something else important that even GTA IV could not...at least a few mini games I actually wanted to play again!  Rockstar succeeded in completely immersing me in the old west.  I would absolutely recommend this game, it definitely deserves its critical status as one of the best of this year.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2010"}

Join Mario as he ushers in a new era of video games, defying gravity across all the planets in the galaxy. When some creature escapes into space with Princess Peach, Mario gives chase, exploring bizarre planets all across the galaxy. Since he's in space, Mario can perform mind-bending jumps unlike anything he&#x2019;s done before. He'll also have a wealth of new moves that are all based around tilting, pointing and shaking the Wii Remote.","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"4.5 stars....a spectacular game!","reviewText":"Mario's last game, Super Mario Sunshine (Gamecube), left a mixed bag of reactions and criticisms. For those who played it either loved it or hated it and since then most of them waited for his next big adventure. Nintendo was under intense pressure to deliver something epic for their brand new Wii console and Super Mario Galaxy was released in 2007. Did they deliver? Absolutely!While there is not much of a story behind this game (or any Mario game but that's to be expected), this time around Mario goes from one galaxy to the next one, beating up (classic & new) enemies and using power ups, all to collect stars he will need to reach Bowser. There are many galaxies to explore and they can all be reached via a floating space hub. Collecting stars unlocks parts of the space hub that leads to more galaxies. Get 60 stars and you face Bowser. If you get all 120 stars, you will unlock Luigi as a playable character. Play as Luigi and get all 120 stars and you'll get access to a secret galaxy.The PROS: Just like Metroid Prime 3 Corruption showed what the Wii can do, Super Mario Galaxy doesthe same thing and it shows. This game is beautiful! The presentation is top notch, the controls are spot on (motion gestures are kept to a minimum), the music sets the mood perfectly and the sounds are exactly what you expect to hear in the game. The new power ups are cool and so are the themes for the galaxies you get to explore. There is an incentive to get all 120 stars since you'll be rewarded for all the hard work. Speaking of hard work, SMG is challenging but not overwhelming so it will take you some time before you truly beat the game. This time, there is limited 2 player co op support (though the second player takes control of a little star who can help shoot and collect Star Bits; that's about it.)The CONS: It seems that with every major Mario title, the camera is really the only issue in the game. It's a lot better since the days of Super Mario 64 but it's only slightly better than the camera in Super Mario Sunshine. One day we will get a Mario game where the camera works flawlessly.Do not read what the 1 and 2 star rating reviews say. There are many people who play the Wii but aren't used to the demands of certain games where you do more than just point and shoot so they go ahead and give this game a bad rating. If you've been playing games for a long time and are into more than first person shooting games, then you will see why this game earned glowing reviews and praise. Super Mario Galaxy sold very well and with the recent announcement that certain older Wii titles (including this one) will be sold at $19.99 each, now is a perfect time to play it for yourself if you hadn't done so already. I highly recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2011"}

Nintendo's Wave Bird isn't the first wireless controller ever brought  to market, but it's a whole lot better than what came before. You may remember a  brief fad a few years ago with spotty infrared devices. These units failed  because they were a lot heavier than standard controllers, and also because they  required a direct line of sight between the controller and the infrared  receiver. The Wave Bird is much lighter (it weighs a bit more than a regular  controller) and uses radio frequency signals for reliable game control at  distances of up to 20 feet. Unless your playing on a stadium-size TV screen,  that should be more than enough. The unit will last for about 100 hours of use  on just two AA batteries and has 16 channel frequencies, so you'll easily be  able to hook up four controllers without interference.","reviewerName":"BRIAN","summary":"WAVEBIRD IS THE BEST WIRELESS CONTROL EVER","reviewText":"THE WAVEBIRD BRINGS GAMING TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND IS EXCEPETIONALINEXPENSIVE COMPARED TO OTHER AFTER MARKET CONTROLLERS.THE RANGE IS WITHOUT QUESTION TOP NOTCH I CAN PLAY FROM UPSTAIRS IN MY HOUSE AND IT STILL WORKS I PAUSED A GAME FROM MY DECK OUTSIDE VERY COOL.NO MORE WIRES AND NO MORE HAVING TO SET YOUR CUBE IN RIGHT POSTION SO U DONT KNOCK OVER OR PULL OUT OF THE PORT.I BOUGHT ONE AFTER 2 HOURS OF NONSTOP MARIO GOLF I WAS BACK AT THE GAME STORE FOR ANOTHER SO MY FRIENDS AND I DONT FIGHT OVER WHO GETS THE ADVANTAGE WITH THJE WAVEBIRD.IM TOTALY SEROUS THER IS NO REASON WHATSOEVER DO NOT HAVE ONE VERSUS THE OLD  WIRE CONTROLLER.

Paying tribute to Mega Man creator Keiji Inafune, Capcom's Mega Man Anniversary Collection anthology set will collect Mega Man 1 through 8 in a single package in addition to two arcade titles never before released in the U.S., Mega Man: The Power Battle and Mega Man: The Power Fighters. In addition to an updated soundtrack, fans of the blue hero will also find a cache of unlockable bonus features that include 30 minutes of anime (PlayStation 2 version), producer interviews (GameCube version) and a history of the series.","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"The games that started it all ported to perfection!","reviewText":"I have always loved Mega Man, but have never been able to own the entire series. My copies of Mega Man 1-3 disappeared over time, and I was never able to get 4-7, never even got to play 6, and then I got 8 for my PS 1, which eventually got used to trade toward something else (a move I regretted). When Capcom announced Mega Man Collection my response was a mix of \"YAY\" and \"It's about time!\"There is not a Mega Man game from the main series that isn't at least good, if not great, and I've been having a blast playing through all the classics, especially since Atomic Planet and Capcom took the time to polish the titles. The original NES was too weak to be able to properly handle these games without some technical problems. While some could be taken advantage of (Such as the elec beam glitch in the first Mega Man which allowed you to make short work of the games most difficult battles) most dragged the original games presentation down significantly. There is no slowdown, or flicker in any of these ports. Not only that but they bumped up the resolution too. Don't get me wrong, these games are not graphical marvels al la Campcom's Resident Evil 4, but they are not only a collection of the ten greatest Mega Man games ever created, but the best versions of those games ever released. Additionally the remixed music is awesome, the navi mode helps the games instead of hurting them, and the bonus material (especially on the GameCube version of the game) is both fun and informative. Fans of the Mega Man Anime will want to pick up the PS 2 version for the anime episode it contains, though mega man die hards will likely already have the Mega Man DVD sets, and won't be gaining anything from it. Fans interested in the making of and history of Mega Man may be more interested in the GCN version, which features interviews with the series creator. These of course, must be unlocked, and with the glitch fixing that went on that won't be easy. No more taking advantage of the elec beam glitch, its not there. Good luck getting past the Yellow Devil, the Clone, and Dr. Wily now! These games will challenge you in ways that few games do anymore.Kudos to Capcom, and thank you for a compilation that is long overdue! Thank you to Atomic Planet for fixing a lot of the annoying bugs in the games (although I liked the elec beam glitch, oh well.) I highly recommend this collection for all gamers, as the collection is large enough (including two never before domestically released Mega Man Fighter games) to have something for everyone, and the price is simply too good to be true for such a huge collection. The GCN version is the better version over all as it loads much faster, and has no slow down or flickering at all. The PS 2 version does have some slow down, but it doesn't affect game play very often. I also preferred the bonus material of the GCN version. The only advantage the PS 2 version has is the control scheme. The GCN has a great controller for most next gen games, but has always been a bit awkward in fighters, and old school retro games. It will take some getting used too, and it would have been nice to have an option to let you change the button configuration. A should be the jump button with B being the single shot button. It is awkward, but after a bit of adjusting works just fine. In all, I recommend the GCN version with my only real complaint is that most of the older games still have that black bar on the left side of the screen, and the titles never even filled a 4X3 screen before, let alone a 16X9 (slightly stretched out of course.) I also am disappointed they did not include Progressive Scan, but the resolution is still very good for a collection of 8 and 16 bit games. It's surprisingly very smooth.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2004"}

The story is harsh, dark and mature.-The player starts out weak but grows more powerful through a rpg-like progression system (experience is rewarded for kills, exploration, etc that can be used to purc0hase &#34;upgrades&#34;).-There are a variety of guns, mines, grenades, and other weapons that can be unlocked.  Each gun offers a different style of gameplay so everyone can find tactics or combat styles that fit their play style (stealth, heavy gunner, long distance sniping, etc).-A lot of fun vehicles to use to traverse the vast jungle (the map is HUGE).  Boats, four wheel land vehicles, and even hang gliders to take to the air.-Enemies are fairly smart and will react to your appropriately.-Jungle creatures!  These vary between prey and predators.  There are non-hostile animals that will not attack and there are the ones who will, such as dogs, bears, and even tigers.  These hostile animals can even become an ally if utilized properly to attack pirates.  These animals can (and should) be killed and skinned to use their hides to make new items (like bigger loot sacks, more held ammo, grenades, etc.)The story is nothing stellar, it involves pirates, friends, and revenge, but the gameplay and characters (especially Vaas!) are fantastic.There is also a co-op mode, online or local (couch co-op!), but the story is rather shallow as well - but again, gets the job done.For anyone who is a fan of FPS and/or Open World games, this is a definite must buy.  A fantastic experience that I highly recommend.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2013"}

Forty games will give you some things you like.  Clubhouse Games will definitely kill many hours for you.  However, the AI for the card games is nothing to write home about, and some games cannot be played at all until you get to them in \"Stamp\" mode.Ah, Stamp Mode.  Stamp is a sort of career mode, in which you must play pre-selected games in order.  Winning gets you past a game, lose and you have to play two or three times.  You start with games you played as a three year old, and move on to the ones which can kill hours for you all by yourself.  Old Maid is merely pointless, the skill in real life of deducing where your friend is holding the Maid can't be recreated on a DS.  But these can be got through if you just play for a while.  Then there is \"I Doubt It\".  The game is not only pointless, it goes on forever.  It's like War, only more annoying.  Plus, eventually, War ends!  I Doubt It isn't the War and Peace of card games, it's the In Search of the Remembrance of Lost Time of card games.So odds are you won't be playing the games you access through Stamp Mode.  Career mode is is usually a good game extender, here it's pointless.  A Pogo-like career (with game choices) would have made the lesser games interesting.

Somewhat disturbing so not for the faint. If you couldn't handle Doom 3 (creeping noise effects and music, cheap spook spawn, weak weapons, useless melee combat, aggressive AI & tight corridors) then this game is not for you. Resembles RE4 in terms of control and third-person aspect. I think the Inventory screen is terrible. It takes too long to display and doesn't pause gameplay (should be optional) especially during battles when you need to use items (Air, Stasis, & Med Kit (use square button w/out holding down aim)). Unlike most gamers who start with Easy or Normal my first play through is on Hard setting. I read several source reviews to start on Hard mode since all items acquired were not transferable to other settings similar to RE4. So I didn't feel like playing through just to start from scratch knowing I would play more than a couple times through. I used the limited time free download Obsidian Suite/Armor which adds much needed additional rows of inventory slots and higher armor defense.Low and random ammo drop, expensive store price, low money drop, and lots of enemies in tight space and door/gates that at different times may take 5-10 seconds to open (loading other area) pretty much means running is not always an option. So yes, every freaken shot counts more often than not. It's meant to be played through more than once due to all upgrades not possible to max on first attempt. I don't know how many times I reloaded due to an encounter to see if I could survive with minimal ammo and med kit use. I know I'm playing Hard mode so enemies are tougher but I don't think the overall design changes much from Normal mode. Struggles with ammo & med kit will be issues early on (3 chapters in for me). Obviously, this game was designed this way for a purpose (survival horror genre/action adventure combination) so I am only pointing what I've observed. Not that the RE series didn't use these designs either but running and door opening/loading were never issues even in tight corridors with low ammo & health kits. I'm in Chapter 9 and it's tough at this point. Every new room seems to have surprise spawning with varied waves of quick and tough enemies from all direction. Stasis is your bestfriend, upgrade it when possible and keep it full (2 or 3 stasis recharge kits onhand) then you will survive most of these difficult encounters. Enemies eventually learn to dodge and duck to counter.As much as I hate the slow inventory screen and doors I have been entertained so far since purchasing it late OCT 16th. Frustration and fun. Frustration during battles such as blind spots. I haven't figured out if there is option to switch views like MGS4 can (left or right using L3) nothing mentioned during tutorial and didn't see it under in game menu option so most likely not possible. Melee is useless (swinging punch & stomp) when attempting to conserve or low ammo and clear room of enemy waves is objective (quarantine situation). Saw gun is awesome but doesn't stay on target when extremely close combat (cornered situation) as sawblade extends past target so backing up required to keep it on target. Turret sections went on a little too long and aiming was too loose. Story has been okay and I think a lot of it has to do with solo play losing it's appeal. Issac is supposed to be some avg ship technician but then he becomes Rambo and takes command from his two surviving peers to go on solo missions without any backup. If you've grown accustomed and have been spoiled by CoD4, Gears of War, etc. where you're majority of the time accompanied by an NPC companion then be prepare for the complete opposite. Issac has no personality of any kind.I loved RE4 (NGC version), played through it on Hard mode several times and loved the challenge mode as well. This game took aspects of RE4 but majority of the game design is a clone of Doom 3 in third-person instead of first-person. D3 was a decent game but wasn't very enjoyable as the story was lame, it was always too dark, scare factors were good up to a certain point then they start drowning you in it. Never know what you're fighting until it spawns right in front, beside or behind of you. Aggressive seek and destroy AI and darkness blinding you from enemies until their taking chunks out of you. Lots of similarity between DS and D3 (obviously the same out of space theme).DS has it's moments and is a decent experience so far. Graphics are good even if Anti-Aliasing isn't great. I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a challenge and isn't afraid of the dark. Mental and psychological distress are all part of the experience so be prepared.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00CMQTVUA","description":"","reviewerName":"Joseph Sayre \"Venom Computing\"","summary":"Kinectless review of the Xbox One","reviewText":"This review is not for everyone, this is a review for how usable the console is without one of its key features, the Kinect.The Xbox one utilizes the Kinect for gestures and voice, My room is about the size of a closet, and I personally hate voice and motion controls because they would literally cause me injury where this console will be used, and because I can input commands faster with my fingers than with my voice.That said this review is for how well I feel the overall performance of the console is handled, but without the use of Kinect, which as I've stated, I cannot effectively test, nor do I want to, and to be honest for games I play I'd rarely use the device anyway.The console is bundled with a headset, the power cords, a hefty HDMI, the Kinect, a controller, and documentation, I'll review each as I come to it.The headset has a flash of green but really the quality is no better than the old 360 headset, it's still wired, and it's still cheap, but it does work, and provides a good alternative to the Kinect Microphone if you don't have it connected.The power cord is pretty much word for word the 360's, it's an in line, external power supply, and given the console is ENORMOUS I really cannot figure out why they had to have the power supply outside of the console, the one is over an inch wider than the ORIGINAL XBOX, and that thing was huge. So no bonus points there for convenience unless the power supply toasts itself.This is the first console I've purchased with HDMI bundled in the box, and it works as expected.The Kinect is larger than the 360 version, and as I've said, I didn't want to install it so I am reviewing the console sans Kinect.The controller I really like, That's a really good thing since that's my main interface with the screen, the D-Pad is massively improved over the xbox 360 counterpart in my opinion on both a concept and execution level.The controller is smaller by a little bit than the 360 controller, reaching size to about the S controller of the original Xbox. In fact it really feels a lot like if the Xbox and Xbox 360 controllers were melded together almost to create this, and those two being amongst my favorites, that's an excellent thing. The plastic isn't hard and smooth, much like the 360 controller giving it a soft feel, while providing grip. The sticks themselves are supple rubber that's ridged around the edges to prevent sweaty fingers from slipping, and the buttons are all within easy reach for your fingers or thumbs. All buttons depress easily and are quick to depress and rise giving good response and the triggers have been revamped to include their own set of vibration motors to provide feedback directly to the finger providing action.An example is that in Forza 5 you can feel wheelspin caused by acceleration through the right trigger, giving you an idea of how much push you're giving in a corner, while you can feel ABS and brake lock up through the left trigger. This changes how quickly you can understand and gauge throttle or braking in the game, giving you feedback faster and more efficiently.This is coupled with body of the controller vibration which provides the feedback you already received last generation, and it does help the experience of games that utilize it,The controller unfortunately still takes batteries, this is 2013 microsoft, come on include, a NiMh or a NiCd battery pack. I have to admit the location and profile is improved with the battery situation, but launching with these battery powered controllers and saying \"Hey you can buy our play and charge\" for 30 bucks is ridiculous. I don't love Sony, but the PS3 controller is much more convenient for users. Gamers like me don't have 8,000,000 batteries in their rooms anymore, because almost all devices include a rechargeable battery. It really does seem MS knows this which makes the money grub for a little, insignificant rechargeable battery for an exorbitant $30 all the more transparent because no one wants to pack rat a dozen batteries. The controllers don't even have a dongle to be used tethered to the console for use if your batteries die mid game, you either have spares, and you're ok, or you don't and your game ends. That's not a fun, fair, or intelligent way to force someone to stop playing.That being said they do include a couple of copper tops for you to use and the controller seems to get very good life out of them, so battery life is good at least.Finally to the main event The console:The Console itself:Besides looking like a Betamax from the early 80's, there is nothing nostalgic, sleek, impressive, or beautiful about the design. The console is essentially a big block with a disc drive in the front of it, aligned to the left and a bunch of slots in the roof to prevent it going nuclear. It does have a glowing Xbox logo you can poke on the right side of the console to turn it on or off, as well as a pokey bit next to the BD drive to make it ingest or regurgitate a Disc with either a movie or a game on it, possibly music if you're one of those people who still listens to CD's. The console is pure functionality, no heart, no soul, just Bauhaus design with a bit of chrome. Its quite ugly and I'm a bit sad I have to put it next to an Xbox 360 Slim, which is absolutely gorgeous.The U.I.:Unfortunately things don't get a lot better once you're staring at the screen instead of the console, the Xbox needs to update out of the box or it won't work properly, (this was communicated by MS thanks to all the crazy revisions to the Terms of Service and OS changes) But once that's done its a straightforward setup to create or use an Xbox Live account and then choose your color for the user interface, which is very Windows 8. If you've never used W8, think lots of tiles, each representing a clickable and interactive option in the unit.There are 3 screens, using the controller, you can navigate these screens but using the bumpers (for you PS2,3 people that's R1/L1) The left most screen contains apps such as Skype, IE, and Netflix. The center screen is the business end containing your profile info, the app you're using, the snap feature, the guts of the OS (options and accounts on the console) and the last 5 things you did. in a renewing ticker tape that updates as you use apps or games. The Right screen is the shop essentially containing the live store movies, music, and other items related to entertainment that allow you to purchase or rent multimedia for listening or viewing pleasure.The center screen is far more trouble than its worth in my opinion, while the center title defaults to games or whatever you were last doing and is very easy to use and interact with, the tile next to it containing your account information is largely wasted. It tells you who you are, your gamer score and how many friends are on. But you have to click it to see WHO is on. and there is more than enough room to display a few friends in that tile, it's a big tile and it's not used to a good effect in my opinion. The app though contains a lot of info about what your friends are doing, when they logged on, and who's on right now, but it's hard to get an idea straight from the menu like it was on 360 on boot. The 360 had an entire page dedicated to your friends, which showed them snoring offline or a speech bubble showing what they were doing if they weren't offline as well as their avatar and achievements. At a GLANCE. This is an excellent show of more is more, the condensed menu has an air of rushed and incomplete about it.The right side includes locations like your account, avatars and account management, this is the place to go find your Wi-Fi settings, if you're not anal about bandwidth like me and aren't concerned about the minor drop in performance from a wireless vs. wired connection. This is also the place to go looking for the way to activate your online codes from games such as your car pass from Forza. (Took me a long while to find this little gem)Snap in is a hugely touted feature, and on a controller, what may be a good app to use with voice is turned into complete crap. On the controller, you can hit the guide from in game, choose snap, select a dockable program, interact with it, and then hit the guide button, reselect your game, and finally choose to play that again. It may be good for video, but for anything else, its cumbersome, intrusive, and there is no way to adjust the snap in ratio so everything is either docked and small, or not docked at all, and I prefer the second one.All in all this menu is usable, but it feels rushed, incomplete, and clunky on a controller, and I know its supposed to be used with Kinect, but I don't think that's an excuse to make the controller so sluggish through the menus. But there is I'm afraid even more wrong with it. Playing a game and returning to the menu via the guide button results in a serious drop of frame rate in the menu and its very obvious. It doesn't ruin anything, it just looks unattractive.Applications still sit behind a membership fee I'm also disappointed to admit, applications like Hulu Plus, Netflix, and Amazon Movies still require an Xbox live gold membership which is normal price, $60. In addition to the fees you're racking up on those website's billing structure, MS wants their own cut to even access them, and they really should be free to use as they are free to use on the net, windows 8, android, Wii, PS3, Apple anything, and all kinds of internet ready devices and TV's. Again this is 2013, this app lockdown stuff isn't something buyers should have to circumvent to access their content they're already paying for, they're used to being able to access their content from anywhere and a device that's designed to lock them out unless they pay is not seen as a gateway, its seen as a hindrance, and it is.Cable route through works and is usable as long as you have the supplies to connect it, but again, see above, there may be a device that you already own, that might manage all of this stuff better.So the final rating sits at very very average. The console has a lot of potential, but the launch leaves a lot to be desired, Microsoft, if its to gain any ground needs to realize their system can't be a full entertainment center with all the lockdowns and focus on making the UI more usable to people without Kinect if they do not want to use it, as well as improving social plug ins and social gaming input. Xbox live can't stay at the forefront of gaming as a large charge for service without some serious injection of new stuff, and right now, the social features, and social interaction options are not in place, or accessible enough for a gaming machine of 2013/2014. The console may improve, but for 500 dollars, I have to say the old \"wait and see\" might be the very best stand you can take.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2013"}

I just bought mine yesterday morning, and love it (now). When you first buy it and bring it home you have to have internet at least to update the system before you can even do anything else. It takes a while just for that to finish! Once that is done, you start setting up your settings,e.i. time,date,language,the kinect,ect...Then, you go to play your game finally.

I recommend logging out of Live first. It will install quicker. And if you begin installing one way or the other. Then try to back out and re-install.....You must first go into the green \"activity\" box on the home menu. Find your \"queued\" install. Then cancel it. Then start over whichever way you decided to install then. Install time depends on the game too! On average, about 10-15mins. Once you install your game. You actually can play the game straight from hard drive w/o your disc, if signed into Live. Also you gotta love having a built in DVR to record your gameplay and upload straight from the One. You can play games with or w/o the kinect. And can unplug the kinect if you feel creeped out by it!?! The system comes with 1 controller (batteries included),1 headset, HDMI cable,Power supply,kinect, and 2 weeks of free Gold on Live. You can control your system by voice, if you like, via the kinect.

Battlefield 1942 is set in the World War II stage of time, where times are most dire and demanding. The game features a rendered functional and beatiful engine, with very nice geometry, optimizations, a mix dynamic lightning maps and static bitmaps, good shadow renders, nice character detail and environment detail, great animations, realistic sound effects and the standard awesome use of hardware 3-D sound support, great interface, etc. SO on.

{"product_name":"B002I0K3CK","description":"","reviewerName":"Sumbudy \"buriedatlantis\"","summary":"More New Super Mario Bros...","reviewText":"I was actually pretty excited by the prospect of New Super Mario Bros. U.  I enjoyed the Wii version immensely.  It was just a lot of fun to play and to enjoy with family.  So, when the Wii U came out and this game launched at the same time, I didn't have a problem with that.  Sure, I tend to like the 3d Mario games a bit better, but that doesn't take the fun away from the side scrolling counterpart.And I did have fun with New Super Mario Bros. U.  There are things that keep it from being as fun as why I liked the Wii version, but that doesn't mean this one isn't a blast to play.  It is.  But let's get the negative out of the way first.I don't have a DS or 3DS, so I've never played any of the other New Super Mario titles.  When the version came out for the Wii, it was like a blast to the past, reminding me of all the fun I had with those platformers on the NES and SNES growing up.  For me, it fit comfortably alongside those titles in all the ways that mattered, namely challenge and fun.  But the thing with all those titles is that each one felt like an upgrade from the previous.  Mario 3 was upgraded from Marios 1 and 2.  Super Mario World felt like a step up from 3.  With this one, it doesn't really feel like a big step up from New Mario Wii.It kind of felt like more of the same.  Sure, the HD is very, very nice, but all in all it feels like a side step, an add on if you will.  The art style and graphical look of the game is almost identical, which you could never say about the first four Mario platformers.That out of the way, it's still worth owning.  If the greatest sin of the game is that it plays too much like it's Wii counterpart, then we can all live with that, I think.  The levels are all designed as well as you've come to expect from this series and it controls like a champ.  Playing with the family is still a lot of fun and the mechanic of using the gamepad to add blocks to the screen helped my less skilled wife get through a level or two she might not have made it past.I also noticed that sometimes the difficulty level felt a little more advanced than it's predecessor and that's a good thing as well.  Like all great platformers, there's nothing more satisfying than figuring out a level and finally running through it like a pro after numerous frustrating attempts that leave you wanting to plant your gamepad into someone's skull.I especially like the challenge levels.  Trying to beat a certain time or getting all the coins in a level is fun and challenging and frustrating in all the right ways. It brings a replayability to the game, even after you've gotten rid of Bowser's persistent self yet again.I certainly wish the game felt like a step up in the way Super Mario World was a step up from Mario 3, being on a more powerful system and all, but I'm not at all unhappy I have it.  It's still a great game that's a ton of fun to play by yourself or with friends and family.  High profile Mario games are never really disappointing and this isn't either.  In fact, if you have any Nintendo System, Mario is always a must own.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00488PZ2S","description":"","reviewerName":"D. A. Theisen","summary":"Disappointed, Dejected, Depressed","reviewText":"Though I was not really a fan of the original Shift (though it offered some fun), I walked into Shift 2 thinking \"well, they could take the first and just make some changes that the community was very vocal about, it'll be better than the first, and we'll have another serious racing sim franchise!\" ...Setting the bar as low as \"some changes\" was apparently far too much. The only thing more disappointing than the experience of this EA racing offering is that it's clear that a great deal of time and effort was spent developing it to be this miserable.Follow-up: After a good deal more play (I like to finish 'career' modes in all games, just for completion purposes), most problems below became progressively worse at the endgame stuff as the cars got faster and the AI more aggressive.Well, what did I get myself into? One aspect I've respected is that the Shift series is a Racing sim, not a driving sim. It's about the whole driving experience and not just moving the car on the track, and there are important differences between the two. In this respect, I suppose Shift 2 does what it's billed to be... \"the driver's battle\" (as stated on the case) with significant \"immersion\". Problem is, it's an implementation in all the wrong ways. In trying to make the cars sound more \"race-like\", extremely overdone and obviously faked sound effects of gears and suspension clanking around are thrown in. Engines sound reasonable, but kind of generalized per type, like V8s, V12s, Turbo L4s, etc all sound familiar regardless of car and could vary on an exhaust tweak at best. I've run into various audio bugs, as well... when there are many cars within range, the sound simply cuts out, with the game apparently too confused on how to mix all the samples.To make the player further feel as though he/she were driving in a racing situation, bugs splatter and splashes of water come to the front of the car, but this happens even away from in-car view, and is not something that can be turned off. When making contact with something, the screen goes to gray and becomes blurry to \"simulate\" a driver's reaction to an incident, but it makes seeing ahead impossible, takes 5+ seconds to go away, and is another something that cannot be turned off.Such details are impossible not to notice, and eventually become humorous in the ironic \"wow, won't this go away yet?\" sort of way.Exceptionally annoying is Shift 2's attempt at a Career Mode, and is yet another feature implemented for all the wrong reasons in all the wrong ways. In this case, a Formula D champion gives you orders/instructions/tips no matter what mode or event you're participating in. Okay, so I'm sure he can help me with drifting events, but how is he offering me track tips when I take a GT1 car around the timeless Monza or Spa? Though there are rivals (bosses) at points during the career mode, why is he my rival in the \"Muscle\" category events? How is he giving me tips while I'm racing against him?Again, the sort of thing that becomes funny over time because of its sheer stupidity.Speaking of GT1 cars, the game does sport an official FIA license for the series, which one would think could add some credibility. Alas, no, as the races in the 'official series' lack such basics as pitstops and run about 10-20% the length of a true feature race. \"Endurance\" in Shift 2 means 20 laps, and despite the fact that the folks at EA figure you'd appreciate a GT1 license, they fail to connect the dots to realize that players might want the experience, too. Personally, as someone who enjoys the 2-4+ hour events offered in other games, I'm flat-out insulted that the developers assume I have a maximum attention span of about 30 minutes for a race. Then again, without the ability to repair damage or need to change tires, I guess dragging it on more would be pointless. The signature championships are generally 5-10 race series of measly 3 lap races.Soundtrack? Catchy, but in a bad way. Graphics? Nothing special sticks out and it's nothing compared to banner games from Sony, Microsoft or Codemasters. The advertised \"helmet cam\"? Causes nausea and makes it very hard to drive since the game will change your viewing direction on its own. AI? The old Burnout games didn't have opponents this aggressive, but at least those featured a heavy catchup assist. Yup. One mistake in a 2-4 lap race? Forget it. Car handling and tuning? Every car feels like an SUV behind the wheel... one gets the sensation of floating while driving, yet in every turn the car will bog down with understeer. Difficulty? Unforgiving, even on the lowest setting. Damage? Exaggerated. \"Simulator\" aspect? It has an awesome telemetry mode to view you motion and grip while driving, so it's a shame that the driving itself is so fake. In-game ads? Shameful, though not as bad as the original Shift.There ARE things on the positive side of note, I'll admit. It's just unfortunate that they've been wasted in this game and not somewhere else where they might actually be appreciated. The profile save system online (Autolog) stealthily records just about everything you do, compare with friends, and it will even notify you when you've been upped on an event.Exceptionally sad as a 'positive' for me is the absolutely incredible track selection which I'd argue isn't matched by anything else currently on the market. Really, it's an amazing list of locales and something other games should be envious of. The car selection is perfectly acceptable and varied, and it can be fun to just think \"what if...?\" and drive something at a track you like. It's a huge collection of real-world tracks from the GT3, GT1, DTM, BTCC and F1 championships + even more.Racing fans should do themselves a favor and avoid this tedious \"simulation\" game that functions as a sandbox arcade racer at best... not without a good list of reasons to play. In the future, this may turn into a passable budget title for people just looking to flog some quick cars around famous global locales. At a $40-60 price tag? No.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2011"}

Alice: Madness Returns continues the downward spiral into madness that began in American McGee's Alice, with absolutely brilliant art design and well done gameplay mechanics.Positives:- Artistic Design - Alice: Madness Returns is absolutely genius in its approach to level design and art assets within each level. Each level is unique, immersive, and packed with so much attention to detail. Alice has hair that moves more realistically than any other character that I've seen in a video game.- Story - Twisted, surreal, and quite haunting; Alice: Madness Returns is a strange journey through a beautiful and hellish world.- Gameplay - Both the melee and ranged combat works well and is easy to perform. There is a lock-on available to those who would rather focus on one enemy at a time. Platforming is a large focus of the game, and this part of Alice: Madness Returns can be both challenging and satisfying.- Characters - The world of Alice: Madness Returns is full of quirky and odd characters that are unlike those found in any other game.Negatives:- Minor Texture Issues - Sometimes textures will pop in and out depending on your distance from an object.- Camera Issues - When you're using lock-in, sometimes the camera can get a bit jarring and you can lose your place in the environment.Alice: Madness Returns is a game that needs to be experienced. It's a wonderful journey through a weird and haunting place. This is a game that feels fresh in today's gaming world.

{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"Lionheart","summary":"Half a Legendary Game -- Not There Yet","reviewText":"Like most GTA fans, I had high hopes for this title. After all, it's been four years since the last Grand Theft Auto (the Liberty City Tales add-on). Unfortunately, this does not live up to the hype. The positives first:1. A better story than the one presented in GTA IV, richer, with more entertaining characters and interesting plot points.2. Much, much better acting and voice-over talent. Missions involving Franklin are especially well done.3. You can change the look of your character as fits your mood: many more clothing options than in previous GTA games.4. Lots of trophies and awards to be earned.5. The ability to switch between characters (on certain missions) adds a certain dynamic intensity ... For example, if your crew is fleeing from the cops, be the driver, or  be the passenger shooting out the tires of the five oh. That is a pretty neat idea. Badly executed here, but still, a neat idea.6. Funny as the original San Andreas, if not more so. The dialogue play in cut scenes is brilliant, but I think you'll especially like the in-between goodies, like Trevor waking up drunk in a dress on top of a mountain. There seems to be almost no end to things like these. Waste of effort? Maybe. But they'll make you laugh.7. A country environment as well as a city one to play in. Hop on a four wheeler and attack desert sand dunes if you want, or stick to a gritty, inner-city, L.A.-like environment: it's all up to you.8. Much more waterplay: ocean that really looks like ocean, long-distance swimming contests, deep-sea diving, submersable cruising, and more.9. \"Heists,\" which are really just longer missions with bigger payouts, but are nonetheless more intense because of the stakes.10. Another top-notch soundtrack.11. Adults only. Violence is same old, same old, but sex and language in this game sets a new standard: full frontal, simulated sex, whatever you want.These are the things I really liked about GTA 5. Especially appreciated the sense of humor in the script. It was great fun playing Trevor missions.But here are the negatives:1. The world is not much larger than in previous games; it's a myth that it's otherwise. And there is no casino area, no Reno or Vegas strip. Grove Street area is smaller than in original. Why? I don't know. Hopefully in the add-on?2. A new combat system that, quite franky, stinks. The ones employed in GTA 4, Red Dead Redemption, and even the latest Max Payne were good, but this? Enemies crop up and inexplicably disappear from the radar, sometimes in front of you, but sometimes behind. And although I don't mind them flanking me (that only shows intelligence), I don't like them popping up from nowhere and shooting at me; that is unfun to play through. Challenging? Sure. But not fun. Please, Rockstar, don't fix what ain't broke.3. The aggravation of money: early in the game, complete a mission that earns you tons of money -- now you can buy a lot of ammo, mod your car, buy clothes, or whatever. Cool, right? No. Because that is really the limit of what you can do at that point: some properties are available for purchase, but most are too expensive. Many of the weapons and mods are locked, even though you have the money to buy them. You have to keep completing missions, but don't get paid, or you get paid a pittance compared to your previous haul. Even after finishing the game, there are several properties you can't afford, like the golf course. There are tons of places around the city to be bought --but you can't buy them, apparently. You can't purchase new safehouses or apartments -- just a garage here, a heliport there, or a dirty bar.4. Heists: great idea, but no follow-through. You develop a crew for one or two missions; then it's over. And you wonder why you bothered to choose the silent caper over the loud if that was the only caper there was. Why can't you rob any bank you want with your crew? Or break people out of prison? Or anything? Rockstar tutors you on how to play a heist, then you complete two or three, and the game is over. Not fun.5. Activities: Bowling is gone, replaced by tennis. No air hockey, but golf. No arcade games. Triathalons that require merely a persistant tapping of a button to win. Only a few races per vehicle: car, motorcycle, ATV, skiddo, etc. Once those are done (and again, you get pocketchange for winning), why keep playing? No dating. When you hang out, eating is taken off the table, and it seems every character in your passenger seat is up for whatever, no penalty, and no benefit for pleasing them.6. Characters that are either too easy to develop, or it's pointless to develop them. My Franklin maxed his driving skill within the first three hours of playing, yet it's taking endless time to develop his lungs: and what's he gonna do with all that extra breath? I finished the game easily without developing any of the characters to any extent.7. It's short. Play mission to mission, and you can finish in a day or two. Then go online, or put the game away. Fun while it lasted, huh? This could've been solved by making getting to each mission harder (for example, you have to win a street race before you can start the first heist), but that wasn't done.8. It's not focused, but spread between three characters. You might like Trevor, but you can't begin certain missions as Trevor. Others you MUST begin as Trevor. Some properties can only be purchased by certain characters. Again: unfun. Let me play the whole game as Franklin if I want -- isn't it my dime?9. Many pointless wastes of programming space -- like the internet feature. Nobody much cares what Michael's \"friends\" are posting on their pages, or tweeting, or blurbing, or whatever. Do they? A giggle or two at first, and then many yawns. So what if I can go on a carnival ride at the pier? Do it once and yawn, because there's no benefit. So what if I beat the challenges at the shooting range? Do I get money for getting a silver placement? A new weapon? Unlock a mission? Anything? So what if I can parachute through rings; what's the point, other than going \"weeee\" the first few times? You don't get much of anything by even a perfect landing. So you earn some money driving a cab or towing cars -- what's the point? You get to know the city a little better, that's about it. Tons and tons of amazing buildings you can't get into. Movies? What the heck is going on here? Yeah, it's clever, but we want to PLAY.10. No city takeover theme: the idea is simply to progress the plot, not improve your character. But I want to make my Franklin big, bad, ruler of the streets, downtown, and the desert! Can't do it. Sometimes people will try to rob or shoot up a little business you own, but that's about as close as you get to the old San Andreas.Final word is, I hope the add-ons address these issues, and more. Introduce gangs, more important side missions, more chances to switch between characters while on missions, etc.I want to encourage Rockstar to go from this, not settle. Because this is not the game. This is only the basis for what could be the game. If they do it right next time? Or in the add-ons? Then who knows? But again, this is not really the game you want, though it is still a lot a fun. You'll probably play it (like I did) for a week or two before getting bored.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2013"}

Beating the tracks with my siblings when I was younger was the highlight of our gaming experience. They eliminated this for no good reason.32 maps, sounds like a lot but 16 of them are maps from older games, they could have at least included more of the olders ones or offered them as a downloadChat on WiFi, you can't actually type anything. You have to choose from a limited selection of short sayings (not full sentences) and it has yes and no questions without the yes or no answer. This might have been done to \"protect\" children from talking to others, but it's over done. Last I heard, there are parental codes they could have tried to use for that, beyond that, there are the parents themselves!.The Friend codes system (separate from the Wii friends codes) is awkward and can take awhile to registerThere is no AI online, its strictly player vs player, and is so limited that there is at least one map that behaves different as it lacks the AI to guide the ducks to attack the players (again proof that little was done to this older map)Battle-Mode, last man standing no longer available. There are team options for battle-mode and vs team mode which sounds great but only works when you have an even number of players (for the most part). At least for battle-mode, no excuse for getting rid of the last man standing game, everyone for themselves.

MGS 2&3 are the special re-releases of the original's. One common complaint is that MGS 3 doesn't include the 2nd disc,I see were you guys are coming from (not being able to play Metal Gear 1&2) But you have to understand that the 2nd disc was mainly for MGO (Metal Gear Online) And it would have been useless to include a disc for servers that are no longer online.What I really like about this bundle is the redesigned cases for all three MGS's gives it something a little more unique, and all the discs are one color,witch is a nice touch.As seen in some of the pictures above MGS 1 is the PS1 ORIGINAL. Not a single pixel has been touched (aka-this does not include the Gamecube remake) and its still on 2 CD-Roms. One thing that really makes me mad is people saying \"I didn't really get into MGS 1 because the graphics were crap.\" Guys,this game is from 1998, Kojima used the hardware available to its fullest and you would be hard pressed to find a better looking game from the PS1 era (with the exception of FF9 witch was released right at the end of the PS1's life )If you give the game a chance,you will see that it trumps MGS 2&3 and is, in my book tied with MGS 4.The only thing that I don't like about this bundle is that the games aren't individually shrink wrapped.(Nitpicking here) Whereas the other essential collections are.Overall PERFECT if you want to enter the world of MGS and with the recent news of MGS 4 going greatest hits(witch is now at the budget minded price of $27.99) you can have the whole collection for under $70!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

There are so many games in the real-time strategy genre - you have classics like Age of Empires 2 and Command &amp;  Conquer, or total stinkers like Tiberian Sun.It's important to remember  that Starcraft was created at least two years before Age of Empires 2. It's  obvious that AOE2 borrowed some good ideas from Starcraft. The main one  being those of unit limits. In Starcraft you have a 200 unit limit, so it's  still possible to build a huge army. But you also have to balance that  against the number of units you use to gather resources.Another unique  feature of Starcraft is the totally different sides. It absolutely amazes  me that a single game can have such diverse armies and yet still manage to  be so well balanced. There isn't a single unit in the game that can't be  neutralised by another unit - which is no mean feat, considering how  powerful they are.The most interesting aspect to these units are their  special abilities. Certain units in each race have special attacks they can  use to neutralise or destroy an opponent. For instance, the Terran Ghost  soldier can fire an EMP blast that can knock out mechanical units. Zerg  queens can fire parasites, which attach themselves to enemies, allowing you  to see whatever that unit sees. The Protoss have the Templar, a unit that  uses a chain lightning `psionic storm' to eliminate whole squadrons of  units.There are certain features which I wish had been implemented. It's  not possible to control the behaviour of your units (ie. setting them to  guard or defensive mode, etc...). This makes it entirely possible for your  entire massed army to chase after a single unit, when really you want them  to stay in one place. Fortunately, a `hold' command is provided, but I  still would've preferred to give my units more advanced commands.The  other annoying aspect is map size. It's blindingly obvious that the maps  are too small when compared to the size of the units. Try leading a group  through a narrow canyon - because there is so little room individual units  will often take a different path to get to a destination.Starcraft's  other strength is in it's storyline. I have never seen such powerfully  realized characters like this in a computer game. In truth, there are no  real good guys or bad guys in this game. Everybody has their own  motivations for their actions. The sequential compaign design only  strengthens this aspect. It's unfortunate that Tiberian Sun's Michael Biehn  and James Earl Jones didn't have a script like this to play with.In  conclusion, Starcraft is everything that Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian  Sun wasn't. It has the best designed units of any strategy game. It has a  strong storyline which is beautifully realised in the single-player  missions. And the addition of StarEdit means you can create your own  missions once you tire of the Blizzard approved ones. No wonder why this  game has stood the test of time. However, the omission of advanced unit  controls mean I have to deduct one star.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2000"}

It consisted of the first level which, obviously, was simple enough. Still, anyone familiar with games in this genre know \"simple\" lasts for about three songs. I promptly bought it first thing the day it was released.The premise of the game, while seemingly cheesy to describe, is absolutely brilliant.Ready? Here goes: You are a trio of elite special agents who go around and assist people by dancing.Each story conflict is told through an anime comic style on the top screen, with the dancing happening on the touch screen. There are animations occurring  on the top screen during gameplay, but you don't really have time to watch it seeing as you're too busy concentrating on getting your dance on.To get through a given level, you'll need to tap, spin, or drag numbered circles to the rhythm of the song.There are two difficulty levels to begin, being able to unlock an additional two.With gaming classics like \"Walkie Talkie Man,\" 80s flashbacks such as \"Material Girl,\" and Pop tracks like \"La La,\" Elite Beat Agents is filled with hours of gameplay.As with most multiplayer DS games, I'm kinda disappointed you can't play the game over WiFi Connect.Also, and this really shouldn't be filed under \"con,\" but it would have been great if there were an option where you could play your unlocked songs while the DS was closed.

{"product_name":"B00005ME7X","description":"Originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System,Dragon  Warrior IIIis a Game Boy Color port of one of the all-time classic  role-playing games. The game reunites two of Japan's greatest RPG talents in Yuji  Horii (story and game) and Akira Toriyama (character design). Toriyama is also  known as the creator of the immensely popular Dragon Ball cartoons and comics. A  prequel to the first two games in the series,DWIIIcasts you as the  child of a great hero who must defeat an evil demon. New additions to the port  include improved graphics, new minigames, new items, and a better translation of  the original Japanese dialogue.The game starts off with a personality test that loosely determines how other  characters will react to you. Gameplay is standard RPG fare: exploring, building  experience levels, acquiring allies, gaining weapons, and ultimately going after  a large monster. There are some interesting minigames to mix things up. The  Monster Medals feature adds a collectible aspect to the game. Monsters may leave  medals behind after you defeat them. Some monsters only appear during certain  times of the day. Getting all the medals unlocks a secret dungeon. You can trade  medals via link cable to make things easier. Most RPG fans will love this game,  but those raised on modern RPGs might find its combat a bit tedious. This game  is compatible with Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance only.--Raymond M.

The game was ahead of its time in a way, similar to how Blade Runner (the movie) was ahead of its time for back in the 1980's.  With this new release, DX: HR, does the game fall into mediocrity or does DX continue to be a a beautiful melody of various gameplays in an immerse environment?....  A few technical details aside, I would say this game easily marks a new generation in the Deus Ex line and could just be one of the best SP based campaign game released in 2011.GAMEPLAYAnd a whole lot of it!  This game is massive and the cyberpunk vision of the future is captured beautifully.  DX:HR I feel, tends to be a blend of FPS meets Stealth meets Espionage meets Social.  You play as Adam Jensen who is a security officer for an Augmentation company.  After an attack leaves him so badly wounded he needs heavy body augmentation the game begins.  Who plotted the attack?  Why? Terrorism? Self-Sabotage?  The conspiracy runs deep and it is your job to figure out it!  At your disposal is a very immerse and game changing set of mechanics that shapes how you play the game, yet adapts to your play-style.  Need to get to the 5th floor and hack a terminal.. no problem go in guns blazing...or maybe stealth past the guards taking them out one at a time... or maybe break in through a vent system...or combine all 3!  Not only can you approach objectives and quests from various methods, but there often are quite a few options available to you.  You don't always need to take that grate on the left.  You could hack the janitor's closet and steal the keycard and just walk right in on the objective. Maybe there is a guard wandering who has a keycard also, or someone wrote it in an email message that you found when hacking terminals.  The variety is just huge and never gets old!  To top it all off you can upgrade Mr. Jensen to better suit your play-styleAs you complete objectives, side quests, or basically do anything you gain XP.  Shoot a mob you get XP, stealth him instead XP, Avoid combat all together get XP!  Hacking amounts to bonus XP as hacking is more of a mini-game than a mandatory tool in this game, but I found it worth my time to hack. It was fun and provided some interesting bits of information that paid off in the long run.  Anyhow, the XP you gain is used to level up Jensen, and as you level you gain the ability to further boost the level of mods you have.  What is so beautiful about this the upgrades compliment your play-style.  You are not forced to pick upgrades you do not want, however I rarely found that I picked something that felt like a waste.  It is a solid system that gives you the freedom to play as you want for the most part.GRAPHICSDeus Ex: Human Revolution is not the flashiest of games.  It isn't the latest and greatest game engine that might choke your PS3/360 or stress your video card until it explodes.  The game still looks very good though.  It captures a cyberpunk / blade runner style atmosphere very well and uses a darker color pallet which makes for a slightly darker vision of the future.  Character animations can seem a little stiff or awkward at times, but do remember people are walking around with augmentations so the body  movements might seem a bit unnatural for a reason.  On the PS3 version the Frame-rate dropped from time to time, especially during one or two intense cut-scenes but it wasn't that bad.  There was similar frame-rate issues on the 360 but occurring in different areas spots so the drop is probably relating to how the system is handling the engine itself.  Graphically, the PS3 vs the 360 have differences but not enough to sway me to one or the other.  It really depends on what you are looking at, at the time you are comparing.  Sometimes PS3 looked better, sometimes 360.  PS3 lighting was better in some spots, yet the 360 had better coloring in others.In short...  The Graphics, while not the best, are very good and despite the PS3 and 360 having some frame-rate issues, either system is a perfect option for this game; each boasting pros and cons over the other.SOUND/STORYThe music for this game is awesome!  The style of music chosen fits the environment and setting of the game perfectly, going well with the cyberpunk theme.  It helps immerse you into the game which is a big plus.  Voice acting however is a sub-par as often the same voice actor played multiple characters and didn't even change their voice.  You may even find multiple characters who say the same line of text.  I'm not surprised by this though as the original Deus Ex had some of the Worst-yet best! voice acting of any game I played.  ....  Storyline wise, while I honestly have not completed the game at this point (the game is LONG!), the storyline is great!  Everything you do has influences on the game, and the storyline is very deep and balanced.  It is full of plot twists and surprises that had me hooked.REPLAY/LENGTHWhile this game lacks multiplayer, you are getting your $'s worth here.  The game easily has 25+hrs of gameplay, more like 30-40 hrs if you factor in side quests and taking your time to really immerse yourself.  Not only does this game boast a huge amount of varied gameplay, but I could easily see myself picking it up and doing it all over again!  The variety in gameplay is just that amazing.  You stealthed your way into the building for Mission 6, replay it and try going Rambo. You might find new items or bits of information, or even slightly influence events of that mission.  Deus Ex reminds me a little of Mass Effect in this sense.  Every new gameplay can be filled with little bits and pieces you may of missed, or simply did not see in a previous playthrough; plus there are multiple endings to this game which only tempt you to try alternative paths and methods.CONSNormally I integrate my Con's into each section, but Deus-Ex is the kind of game that you need to see the entire picture.  The game can clock it easily +25hrs and has such a wide variety of elements to it things were bound to go wrong in some spots.  This comes in the form of frame-rate problems(see graphics), boss encounters, and AI problems.  Frame-rate has been covered but Boss Encounters were a disappointment simply because there is only one real way to fight them.  RAMBO style!  If you specialized in hacking that won't help you during the fight.  The illusion of choice is removed here and you are forced into a play style you might not enjoy.  This isn't a major problem but for someone who didn't specialize in guns, since the game is forgiving, it feels like bosses were rushed in rather than fully thought out.  AI problems well, it was to be expected.  Sometimes enemies just become stupid and forget you are there or have such obvious pathing it makes you wonder how they were even hired to be guards.  Despite their AI problems however they seem to have eagle eye vision when it comes to accuracy with guns (which makes for a good challenge!)OVERALL ... 93% (9.3 / A)Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a product of its sums.  Individually each part of the game, from the shooter, to the stealth to the social aspects 'could have' been done better.  Instead each element was created specifically to balance the other and what you end up with is a game that has multiple play-styles, gameplay which caters to the needs of the player, immerse storyline and environment, and a wide variety of methods to tackle the problem; so much so alternative play-throughs are a must!  DX: HR has technical issues, but when a single game can easily surpass 25-30hrs and contain such variety, a few problems might slip through the cracks or be inevitable.In the end, we have a beautiful game that will keep you glued to your PC, 360 or PS3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2011"}

We are your average XBOX 360, Nintendo DS & Wii players that enjoy games that keep us entertained and keeps our competitive streaks satisfied.  Once out of the box, the orange color stands out and it does suit the guitar.  If the stand is purchased, one may just walk by this \"toy\" and believe that it is real.  I am not sure how it compares to a traditional guitar in weight/size, but to my untrained eye/hand it looks and feels real.  It has a wonderful weight and the strum bar is SILENT.  That seems to have been an issue with the buttons clickety/clacking on the plastic guitars.  The tune pegs on the top actually rotate 360 degrees making the guitar even more realistic.  It was a pleasant surprise to actually see that the head stock (top of guitar) and fingerboard (where the buttons are)backing is made of wood.  This makes the hefty price tag just a bit more bearable... only a bit though!One issue that I personally have is that the whammy bar is right near the strum bar.  I have heard endlessly that the proper way to \"rock out\" is while standing... but I love to \"rock out\" from the comfort of my couch with the guitar laying on my thighs.  This position causes me to constantly hit the whammy bar while strumming.  The other only issue that I feel is the fact that the price tag is very hefty and just too high for an add-on to a game.  I can understand how the companies feel that it is necessary because of the quality construction but at the end of the day this is a toy for a video game.  Compatibility is not an issue and even though the guitar is advertised for Guitar Hero it works just fine with the Rock Band series.Highly recommend for true fans of the Guitar Hero & Rock Band series respectively and for the niche market that wants to really feel like they are playing a true guitar; for those individuals this is the perfect high-end toy with countless & endless hours of fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2009"}

First there was the original Super Mario Brothers and Super Matio Brothers 3 for the NES, to Super Mario World for the SNES, and now Super Mario 64 for the N64.  The game is 5 years old now, but it's still just as fun to play as ever.  The graphics and sound make excellent use of the N64's capabilities to create a 3D world that was just jaw-dropping in 1996 and is still pretty awesome today.As others have said, the basic story of the game is classic Mario:  Bowser has kidnapped the Princess, and Mario must rescue her.  To do this, he must collect a minimum of 70 stars from the 15 worlds in the game.  These worlds are accessed by jumping through paintings and other objects scattered throughout the Mushroom Castle, plus there are 15 stars contained within the castle itself.  Although you only need 70 stars to finish the game, there are a total of 120 stars available for collection, and you won't be satisfied until you have collected each one.  The 15 worlds have varying levels of difficulty, but each and every world has some easy stars and some that are very difficult.  It took me about 100 hours total to collect all 120 stars and rescue the Princess the first time.  Each level has a different theme.  Some are on mountains, some are in water-filled caves, and there is one set inside a giant clock.  My personal favorite is the haunted house level.The gameplay in Mario 64 is exceptional.  Mario has many different types of moves, ranging from tiptoeing around sleeping enemies, to a great long jump, to a very difficult-to-master wall jump.  You must master all the moves if you expect to get all 120 stars.  Also, there are three special hats scattered throughout the game that allow Mario to fly, walk underwater, and become invisible.  Again, all are vital for 120 stars.After you finally win, you might expect that you will never want to take on such a huge task again.  But, such is not the case.  Even though you have all 120 stars, you can go back to levels you have beaten and play them over and over, as much as you want.  You'll be tempted to do just that.  The experience of playing through the incredible world of the Mushroom Castle is such that you will be coming back for many repeat visits.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2001"}

E Jackson","summary":"banjo kapooie","reviewText":"Banjo-Kazooie is a strange platformer, but ultimately misses the mark in all key areas of being entertaining.  It tries to be funny without actually being exciting to play.  All the attention on humor and yet, the game itself is hardly ever fun.  This means children would probaly be able to overlook the games flaws and focus on the humor, which I'm sure was Nintendo's intentions- to market the game for kids and assume they wouldn't be able to detect the lousy game design.  I guess the Nintendo 64 struggling to make a profit at the time meant Nintendo had to do absolutely anything to try and get *any* type of crowd interested in their products despite the poor quality we're forced to persevere, so that explains Banjo Kazooie's existence.Anyway, Banjo-Kazooie is basically nothing but an item-collecting quest with graphics that are admittedly prettier and just better than 90% of the stuff the N64 was pumping out at the time.  The waters, grassy lands, mountains... everything is a beautiful sight to behold with crystal clear authentically pleasing environments.  But seriously, why am I basically doing nothing but walking around collecting items the entire time?  If you think \"That's what ALL platformers do!\" guess again: many of them focus on exciting enemy variety, diverse surroundings and a gradual increase in challenge which this game sorely lacks.  The only challenge is to avoid falling from high narrow platforms while collecting musical notes- these are dirty tricks and artificial challenges.  I found sharks you have to swim away from, crabs you can stomp on top of, and weird gigantic green enemies that come out of walls while you're trying to make your way across high paths without falling.  These enemies only appear like 10% of the time- the rest of your surroundings aren't very threatening.Let's see all the things you have to collect.  Honeycomb pieces, jiggy pieces (mandatory to open entrances to new locations and you need to obtain a certain number of them per world), 100 musical notes which is a total ripoff of Super Mario 64 with the 100 coins needed to get a star, mumbo tokens used to cast spells, and jinjo tokens used to win vehicle parts.  You can turn into animals and insects which is somewhat satisfying for the sake of seeing the occasional brief moments of diversity, but otherwise nothing to get really excited about.  Often you have to climb trees to reach the items on top and it gets boring after a while, believe me.Oh and the game is a victim of underwater tragedies- you're constantly adjusting the camera for a more appropriate angle but finding that it's much harder than it needs to be.  I will never understand why Nintendo refuses to fix water portions in 3D platform gaming.  It's mind-boggling.  They didn't even fix them in Super Mario Galaxy 2, a game released a good 10 years after Banjo-Kazooie.  The characters are all forgettable, including the ponytail-sporting female bear and Banjo himself.  Kazooie the bird is probably the only tolerable one of the bunch.Whereas the Mario series can be enjoyed by kids and adults respectively, Banjo-Kazooie is certainly intended solely for children and no other age group.  It's too shallow of a game overall to satisfy adult gamers.  Banjo-Kazooie is like walking into the nicest looking restaurant in town and everything is great except for one thing- you get a small quantity of food so you ask yourself \"Is it worth my time to return here again?\"","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2013"}

The game was met with a lot of hate though and after it dropped considerably in price I had to see it for myself.  I played this game mainly co-op with my friend (that's right this game has co-op!) and it actually is a lot of funPlaying by myself, honestly this game felt like a B movie version of an FPS. It just wasn't impressive, and in fact made me kind of crave playing other FPS games in my collection.  It is pretty much as generic as they come with some iffy AI at times, iffy voice acting and average sound effects and graphics.The game really failed in its presentation.  The concepts in the game actually are pretty cool but everything is just presented as if the developers were in a \"haze\" while producing this game.  It just doesn't feel memorable or even worth playing through at times.  As harsh as I am being though, the game isn't BAD like some sites and reviews say.  This game is far from being an abomination of a game.  If you enjoy FPS games this will entertain you and keep you on your toes.  It has a nice old school shooter mentality to it which helps to keep you busy throughout the campaign.  Is it enough , honestly no.  What truly saves this game is the co-op ability.Without the co-op I probably would score this game 2 star;  however even with today's big budget titles you don't often see Co-op campaign.  Add up to 3 friends into the mix and the game becomes an absolute blast!!My Overall score for HAZE is 71% (7.1 / C-)  While Haze is not a horrible game, it is mediocre at best.  Picking it up to play solo you honestly might want to save your money.  However if you got a few friends willing to pick up a copy also then this game could actually be quite a bit of fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2011"}

Well guess what? I sat back and i played it! I'm the idiot everyone i knew yelled at when i told them \"oh its not that bad.\" Next thing you know, Bethesda recycles everything from Fallout 3, making New Vegas, and making it into a dang technological mess!! I honestly do feel bad that i cant recommend this game becuz everything in the game looks fantastic and it plays well. It is better than Fallout 3 with its new nuclear fallout world, but another thing i dont think anyone wants to happen is for their system to freeze up becuz of game.

If you buy this game used, you are out of luck. You have to create and account and pay a fee to play their games online. There are other options such as Call of Duty which do not charge a fee to play online. I will never purchase any more games from Electronic Arts because of this practice. If you buy a game new or used, you should not have to pay a fee just to play the online portion. Most people, like myself, who buy this type of game purchase it to play online. By the way, the campaign on this iteration of Battlefield is sub par and totally different from the online portion. The online portion is where the meat is at. But I can give this up for Call of Duty any day. And for all you fan boys of Battlefield who will idiotically criticize my review and other people's reviews just because you disagree with them, the world doess not revolve around you. I am not a fan boy of Call of Duty. I am a fan of great games and a hater of cheap tactics by companies like Electronic Arts that nickel and dime you after you have paid a hefty price for their games. We already have to pay for map packs. And I can understand that. But to simply play the game online? Give me a break!Update:Both Call of Duty: Black Ops and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 are still being played. Black Ops actually has a stronger following than Modern Warfare 3. They are now being sold at a bargain price used and do not require a fee to play online. Battle Field 3 is still as problematic as ever and still require a fee of ten dollars to play online if you buy it used. So, not only are you playing a whole lot more for this game but you are getting a terrible playing experience online.

Yet Different - And More Action Packed!","reviewText":"I was a huge fan of Dragon Age: Origins and played through it several times so I have been excited for Dragon Age 2. As soon as the first battle started I could feel that the game was a lot different than its predecessor. The fighting was a lot more hack n' slash, making battles a lot faster and a bit more forgiving (well, not the boss battles).The characters models as well as Kirkwall are rendered beautifully, and you can see that upgrades that have gone into the game. The story itself is fairly involved and fun to follow and uncover; it's nice to have a main character that speaks! It really does that extra bit towards making the story feel more involving, and that you have a bit more control over how conversations play out.I'm playing through the game a second time and it is just as fun. I always play through once as the nice guy and once as the jerk, so, it's fun seeing how certain events play out differently, and I appreciate the replay value.I haven't experienced any of the bugs or glitches that others are mentioning, so I'll keep my fingers crossed that I don't. My only personal gripe is that there is a lot less wandering around and personal initiative in terms of direction. In DA:O I was able to choose which order I did major events in, now, it's very linear.Overall, great game and highly recommended.Pros:Crisp graphicsBetter menu systemTight controlsFaster battlesCons:Shorter than DA:OMore linear than DA:OI know I can't expect the same game with a different plot, but I always enjoy wandering around thinking I'm in control of the plot.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2011"}

As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed. Taken together all these changes add up to more action, more fun and moreDead Spacefor players on the Wii.Key Game FeaturesAn All-New Prequel Exclusively for the WiiFollow the lives of several different Aegis VII colony members as they carve a bloody path to survival.Meet a new cast of characters, destroy fearsome new enemies, and wield brutal new weapons.Real TerrorStunning graphics, panic-inducing audio, and a frenetic first-person perspective thrust you headlong into the terror.Play through an engrossing, interactive horror movie experience that raises the bar for storytelling in video games.Intuitive ControlsStrategically dismember your enemies with pinpoint control using the Wii Remote.Wield a powerful arsenal of abilities and weapons to freeze enemies, manipulate gravity with telekinesis, solve puzzles, and fight off attacks from every direction in zero gravity.Co-Op GameplayTeam up with a friend to fight off the invasion on the USG Ishimura with jump-in cooperative play.Combine efforts on engineering puzzles or determine specific roles to create a unique experience with each play session.","reviewerName":"merrly hill","summary":"For the PS3 version that came with Dead Space 2.","reviewText":"Okay I haven't played any On the rails shooters until this.

Having played all the way through the campaign (and I took my time with it - much exploring, all side-missions played, etc.) I have to say, I'm a little less enthusiastic. The character's repeated utterances when searching through containers gets pretty annoying after a few hundred times. \"Can't hurt to look\" and \"Hmm, what's in here?\" Can't hurt to look. What's in here? Can't hurt to look. Can't hurt to look. Hmm, what's in here?Animation is actually pretty rudimentary. Faces are not great. This would have been state of the art 3 or 4 years ago but in 2011, we have the luxury of being very picky. Half-Life II has better facial animations.As noted in the original review, the maps are pretty big. There are a great many rendering / mapping errors. Surfaces that disappear showing the underlying 'void' in the map, places where you get stuck (I had to restore a checkpoint twice from just getting stuck in a part of the floor or wall).The gameplay also gets pretty annoying at points. Because this is geared towards RPG / co-op play, you will re-spawn after dying with all status preserved. Unfortunately, the closest spawn point sometimes occurs in front of where you were. So... you might end up in the middle of a pack of Infected who are several levels higher and will kill you in two-three hits (i.e., almost instantly). And you die again... and again... and again. Four, five, six, seven times. Just keep getting in a slash or a kick but really not inflicting much damage. That seems like a pretty serious game flaw. There's no way to \"win the scenario\"; you just keep getting your butt handed to you because you re-spawn in the middle of a crowd of difficult enemies.Finally, semi-spoiler-alert, you kind of play up the resort and you're done. You don't really come back to it. The later environments are really more \"stock zombie environments\". Without enumerating them specifically... you've seen them all before. Many times. The luxury hotel / resort concept just really stoked up the uniqueness of this game's theme. It should have been the hub of a wheel. Or, minimally, I was really hoping that the game's crescendo would occur back at the resort. It should have been. Instead they went out into other - large, decently well-constructed, but still over-used - environments. Honestly, the creepy zombie apocalypse sensation stopped after you left the resort and the rest of the game was just kind of a job to get done. Sort of fun, but not at all unique.Quibbling aside, it's still a very good game, but unfortunately, having finished it, I can't stick with the glowing endorsement I gave it to begin with. I wanted to love it. I really, really looked forward to a brilliant zombie apocalypse entry. But this isn't a top-10 game. It might be a top-25 game. I'd now recommend picking up a copy for half the retail price, or just rent it.==============Well, to start with, I'm a serious fan of the zombie game genre. Left 4 Dead? Oh yeah. Dead Rising? YES YES! I love how the video game developers juxtapose the formulaic \"undead nightmare\" over otherwise mundane, commonplace places. Suburban neighborhoods, shopping malls... and now, a TROPICAL ISLAND RESORT!I have been looking forward to this game for months. I own almost every zombie game made for Xbox, 360, PS3, and I've played all but one or two... I needed a fix. I needed to see what the state of the art is. And at least the premise of this game was very intriguing, and reasonably distinct from any of its predecessors: a tropical paradise, full of promiscuous vacationers, ordinary people on holiday, with all the architecture and landscaping to make you think, hey, this is NICE... I'd like to stay here! Except, of course, for all of the bloodthirsty zombies. This amount of anticipation might make me WANT to see a good game where it's not; but it also sets me up for major disappointment if I pre-order the thing for release-day delivery three months in advance and check every week to make sure the release date hasn't changed.So here we go.The map is huge, and there is a great deal of zombie-slaughter to complete in every nook and cranny. When you progress through sections of the game, it just gets bigger and bigger... it's almost mind-blowing, every bit the equal of a GTA IV or Elder Scrolls.This also has the RPG element. Each character has certain specialty skills. As you gain experience, you can enhance certain skills that do this and that, active and passive, and generally, make killing zombies in certain ways just that much more fun (did I say fun? I meant effective...)It all works. It is actually gorgeous scenery. A tremendous amount of thought went in to just modeling the resort. It IS nice! It looks comfortable. It looks like a place you would really want to go. The scenic vistas are actually breathtaking. You climb a long series of stairs or a long mountain path and look back out over the ocean, the bay, the place you just came from... and it is actually worth a pause, just to take it all in.The sound effects are great. The voice acting is great. The bar for a \"good game\" in 2011 is really quite high, and this makes it over that bar. In every single conceivable aspect of the experience of playing this game, there is only ONE genuine flaw, and you'll be surprised how trivial it is: When you're carrying a heavy object (propane tank, crate), sometimes you get stuck on stairs, or at the edge of a garden or road. You have to drop the crate, walk over it, pick it back up. There are a number of simple mapping errors you'll encounter if you spend a lot of time running around holding a propane tank (which is advisable, as it turns out). Everything else... the light... the flora... the mountains, the beaches, the people, the zombies, the vehicles, the objects, the sounds, they're all extremely well-executed and engrossing.The gameplay is interesting. The landscape is interesting. The architecture is interesting. It really is. Everything is interesting.It is a great game. It is worth playing. It is worth paying the sticker price - no need to wait. This isn't a \"get it on the discount rack next year\" or \"wait until you can rent it\" game. If you like anything like FPS / RPG / zombie types of games, you really do want to play this game. Have a glass of scotch (or if you're under 21, have... um... coffee?), get into it, appreciate the stellar art, perfect voice acting, just take in the environment. The environment is really a lot of what differentiates this game. It starts a bit tediously, but believe me, it just blasts off once you really get into the groove of the game.I haven't finished the game... but I feel pretty confident that it's going to end up being in my top-10 list. Along with Return to Castle Wolfenstein, FarCry, HalfLife 2, the GTA games... this is serious stuff. This is plainly one of the heavies of 2011. We'll see how the next installation of Assassins Creed, Elder Scrolls and Uncharted turn out, but this one is high quality, and it's a home run.Buy. Play. Enjoy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2011"}

The Empire has set its sights on invading a small neutral country called Gallia, which is situated in the middle of the two great empires.

Everything from the look of the game to the character fluff to the levels and tactics is perfect. The game takes place in a fantasy version of Europe on the eve of WW2. Here Gallia (basically Belgium) is trapped between the invading Imperial army (Germany) and the indifferent Federation who is more interested in playing power politics than helping. Storywise, this game goes about where you would expect and includes numerous battles based on real WW2 battles only with new tech and superweapons. It's a typical war story but told like an Anime, complete with a large number of cut scenes. And the melding works!The visuals in this game are gorgeous. They combine cell-shading with watercolors to create a visually stunning Anime-like world. The characters are great as well starting with the lead character Welkin, who is a typical Anime protagonist except that he's not 16 and is obsessed with bugs and nature. He also has an awesome tank. There are four other mandatory playable characters and around forty or so optional ones. These include Vyse and Aika fromSkies of Arcadia, which is a nice touch. There is a great deal of background information for each character that you can only access by using them in battles. It doesn't really affect the story but it's nice to have it there nonetheless.The gameplay is like nothing else I've ever played. It has a basic tactical RPG setup where you lay your characters out on a map and decide where to position them to best advantage, but when you move them you control them using normal third person action game controls. This sort of combination is usually the result of a game studio hedging their bets and generally results in the game satisfying neither type of player. Here it works miraculously, bringing the best of both together in one. Another nice twist is how the leveling system works. When you level up your characters you level up the entire class, which means that all your Scouts or all your Lancers will benefit from your choices.This game is in essence a combination of several different games and genres. The difference between it and other games that try to branch out in this way is that Valkyria succeeds in everything and makes the different genres work better together than they do apart. And this is a notable achievement.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00006LU9L","reviewerName":"Walter Reade","summary":"Highly Recommended.","reviewText":"Ghost Recon is a welcome break from death match, you-must-be-on-speed-to-keep-up type games. Instead of pulling a trigger and running around until you kill someone, this game forces you to develop detailed strategies to accomplish your tasks. The action you do encounter (and there is plenty) is intensified by the fact the stakes are much higher -- a couple of bullets or a well-placed grenade takes you out of the game. This forces you to develop a properly planned and well executed course of action.The game is squad based. During single player mode, you play one of six soldiers and can switch between them at any time. Your player leads one squad of three, and you set a course of action for the other squad which is controlled by AI. As you complete missions and tasks, you unlock addition items such as new soldiers to choose from. Surviving missions also increases soldier skill.Ghost Recon has significant replay value. It has 15 levels and 50 different tasks to complete, but because there are so many strategies that can be used to complete a level, they can be played numerous times with the same enjoyment level. Of course, on-line play adds tremendous replay and excitement.In my opinion, the mark of a good game is how quickly time slips by while you are playing. Time after time I have intended to wrap up in 10 minutes only to find that an hour has passed. This is a fantastic game.I do have a few complaints. The graphics are generally good, but can be on the choppy side at times. I have also experienced instances where the AI squad didn't do what I had mapped out. But, for the most part, the game is a welcome addition to my game library.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2002"}

Even worse is that Sonic's friends have been captured by Eggman and held hostage.As a result, in the beginning, Sonic is the only available player but as one beats the boss machine at the end of the stages, more characters are unlocked and the game begins to branch into different versions of itself. My favorite is a tie between Tails and Cream.The problem with this game though is a frustrating part. Although not completely, I've found it almost downright impossible to find all seven special rings in order to access the special stages at the end of each regular stage. (I've managed to get to special stage one after \"Leaf Forest\" but that's it) The last six regular stages make it like looking for a needle in a haystack.Otehr than that, this is a very good Sonic Adventure game and is another good addition to the Sonic Legacy.

It's World War 2, and the Nazis are trying to gain supernatural powers. The Allies are trying to figure out what is going on and to stop the Nazis.In this XBox iteration, you learn that back in medieval days, a sorcerer managed to lock away a nasty, immortal warrior. This is who the Nazis have uncovered. You begin the single-player game as an Allied soldier in Africa, being sent in to figure out what the Nazis are up to. The game is a good mixture of action, stealth, and puzzle solving. If you just go in to a \"kidnap\" mission with guns blazing, you're likely not to succeed. Instead you have to sneak around and achieve your mission quietly.The graphics are rather impressive. Candle flames flicker, light reflects off your hand-held knife as you walk through the streets. Lights reflect off of surrounding surfaces. The XBox version also boasts Dolby 5.1 sound, from the various weapons you use to ambient noises and rockets whistling overhead.While the basic gameplay and new missions are quite fun, where the game *really* shines is in XBox Live gameplay.

There's a reason for this. Their systems are reasonably priced, feature great sound and graphics, and are lots of fun ! The thing about a portable gaming system is keeping all of the bits and pieces together. The early Nintendo handheld were simply game and cartridge. The newer systems have added a stylus and the ability to charge on the go. All of this stuff needs a place, both at home and as you travel. Enter this great carrier.The outer shell is a rugged yet lightweight material. It holds the game unit, cartridges, and accessories firmly while providing easy access at the same time. An outer pocket is held shut with velcro, while the console and cartridges get a nice beefy zipper for two separate sections. There's also a sturdy handle to grab or loop through a belt. It would have been nice to include a dedicated belt loop, but its certainly not a deal breaker that they skipped it.The side that keeps the DS also has several loops to carry a stylus or four and a charger for the wall or the car. There's a velcro strap to secure the console and the lining for this pouch is soft so that it won't scratch up your Nintendo portable. The carrier is marketed for the new 3DS, but it could just as easily work with the Lite or the DSi.The back pocket of the carrier is straight up nylon with stretch pockets to hold games. Both the regular DS games and the new notched 3DS games fit snugly in the pouches. There's a total of 12 slots, so being limited to your top three isn't a problem for the next road trip. At the end of the day, this carrier is a real bargain and a great value. The need for a good carrier is important, especially if you were one of the lucky few who got to spend more than $200 on the new 3DS. Better protect that investment, right ?

It was not only the last n64 game that came out but it was also one of the best looking video games ever created at that time(yes it was even better then most Dreamcast games, back in 00')and it was one of the best n64 games that came out since Zelda and Perfect Dark.  Well..5 years has passed and now we have conker back and reloaded on a next gen console and I'll say this for the record....This game is excellent(Just as good as the original if you ask me).  First off the controls are fan#@$%^#^tastic, they respond so well though I had some trouble with Conkers Bat bashing.  The Controlls are solid just like the game.  Now one thing that I loved about Bad Fur Day on the N64 was the brilliant yet very child like music(especially the one in Dinosaur themed cave)Rare pulled it off so well and it went with the games inviroment so well.  Theres nothing different about this remake(well atleast a little).  The same brilliant music is back and you can tell Rare made some changes with the music(adding some different kind of beats which I loved at somepoints but also disliked at other points (like the one with the bull, they took out one of my favortie music parts in the game and replaces it with clapps).  But other then that the music is superb.Ok I always say this about alot of games(this is one of the best looking games ever made/the visuals are superb/yada yada yada)But this time I mean it....Conker Live and Reloaded is without a doulbt in my mind THE BEST LOOKING VIDEO GAME EVER...I say that alot but this time I mean it(forget all the new next gen visuals like ps3 or anyof that crap)but I mean it this time.  Conker for the Xbox has got to be the prettiest looking xbox game since Doom 3.  Every inviroment, every character, is so detailed and visual beautiful....the game looks and IS simply...beautiful, Rare did a good job taking full advantage of the Xboxs visual power(wait till you see the water, ponds and pools in the game).  They are just jaw dropping.Something that I didn't like was the fact that Rare didn't add that much(I.E no new bosses, new levels or anything like Resident Evil for the Cube)sure there were a few surprises like the new enemies that are chuck full of em' from beginning to end and that surprise in the beginning but c'mon!  And what is up with the censoring??!?!  Now they censored even more of the words that wern't censored in the original Game on n64 which is just plain sad..Why did Rare do that?  I have no Clue but I wish they had a good explination.  Another thing that keeps this from getting a perfect 5 was that well..the original bad fur day was just well SHOCKING, everything about the game was just shocking and unexpected(This remake seems like a toned down version with less gore and violens).  I mean the blood in this game looks like little chocolate balls!  This game isn't as violent or dirty as the original N64 game but it's still a darn good game.Ok...I don't have xbox live but after a few hours of Dumbot multiplayer and some buddies this games mp is fantastic!  I love the level settings and the different types of characters you can choose which is great.  The only down fall is the fact that you can only have two different weapons(in the original mp you could choose from a magnum to uzis to a Chainsaw!!!)but other then that the MP is very solid...The Good-A great remake-Superb Music-Fun little surprises for BFD fans but not that much-The visuals in this game are just beautiful, amazing, jaw dropping, simply THE BEST LOOKING GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED-Now instead of a frying pan you use a baseball with nails in em' which is kind of a cool-Multiplayer is friggin' awesome!!!-for new players to the conker it should take you a few days to beat bfd(especially seeing how the game doesn't give you a clue on were to go)The Bad-Why did they censore even more bad words in this remake!!  They even censored words that wern't censored in the original n64 game!!-They should have added more weapons for one individual for MP-Some of the music beats were changed and I was abit disspapointed-They took out the part were you have to get this electric eel to chase you and start the main power back on in the War chapter!!!  What's up with that???  Why on earth would Rare not put that portion in this remake???-Not as violent or as mature as the original BFD....if you ask me but hey this is one mans opinionsOverall Live and Reloaded on the Microsoft Xbox is an excellent game and a very great achievement that Rare has done.  Solid Controls, great fun filled action, awesome music and amazing looking visuals with a great multiplayer equals a must own for any Conker fan or anyone whos looking for a good xbox game..Though a bit disspaointed this is over all SOLID...Just as good as the original and is a great entrance to the next gen consoles(though I've heard that Conker Live and Reloaded IS the last Xbox exclusive game ever.....which is sad but atleast we still get Multiplatform games)I give Conker Live and Reloaded...a4.7 out of 5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2005"}

Wii, like all the previous releases in theSuper Mario Bros.franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros.

David Swan","summary":"A Must Own Wii Title","reviewText":"New Super Mario Bros is the kind of game that makes one contemplate the whole reason video games are played. Here we have a classic side scrolling platformer, a genre that's been around since the NES. It wont blow you away with it's graphics or push the system to its limit but it does one thing exceptionally well and that's deliver a tremendously enjoyable gaming experience. Its aggregate score on gamerankings is just under 88% which is a very solid score but I think the professional reviewers are underrating this game. Personally I would put this game more into the low to mid 90's range and I suspect it's being punished for being more evolutionary than revolutionary but that brings me back to the whole point of video games. If New Super Mario Bros is only evolutionary instead of revolutionary like Mario 64 (a game which holds a monster 95.9% aggregate score) but is ultimately more fun to play then shouldn't NSMS have a higher score? In this case the fans seem to have shown a better perception of quality as New Super Mario Bros is now the fastest selling single system game in history to reach 10 million copies sold.What really sets this game apart from previous Mario side-scrollers is how organic the worlds are and how much attention to detail is placed on the physics. The backgrounds have moving clouds and the foreground contains all sorts of motion including rotating wheels, revolving blocks, moving fences, rolling lava and on and on. This is the most dynamic Mario platformer ever and players will need lightning reflexes as well as a sharp mind. For example in one level Mario runs across a series of stone wheels while spiked balls roll towards him. In order to jump the spiked balls the player needs to account for changes in speed since the stone wheels are revolving at varying rates. A spiked ball might suddenly accelerate when it hits a faster moving wheel and players need to anticipate rather than just react. New Super Mario Brothers does more with the interplay of darkness and light than any previous Mario game and for the most part I enjoyed it but in one level where Mario is underwater and the only illumination is from bioluminescent sea life I found it just too difficult to see. Luckily this level stands out as weak only because the rest of the game is so spectacular. I absolutely loved the level where Mario is essentially on a roller coaster ride leaping over lava flows and fiery plumes. I could play that level 100 times. What's funny is that this rollercoaster experience only exists in one level, in other words this game has such an amazing variety of level designs that there is very little repetition.New Super Mario Bros does an excellent job of balancing the difficulty level keeping the challenge up but not so hard that it becomes overly frustrating. If you fail a level eight times in a row the game will offer a super guide to show you a safe path through the level. After playing the game all the way through I was only offered the super guide once in other words except for that one time I was always able to beat the level in seven tries or less. If your only goal in a level is to get from start to finish it's really not exceptionally difficult. The difficult part is trying to collect all the Star Coins and if you're not up to the challenge just don't bother. The final battle in particular was one of the most intense moments I have ever experienced playing a video game. I was literally shaking when I won and although I let loose some profanity in previous attempts it never reached the level where I wasn't having fun and when it was all over I was ready to go back and play more. That is the hallmark of a superior game.If you own a Wii you should own this game. Please do not be put off by the retro appearance of the game or the sometimes less than gushing reviews by professional reviews. This is a game with so much polish it just shines. In many ways New Super Mario Bros is the poster child for the Wii. Just like the Wii itself it doesn't aim to break any graphical benchmarks or push a new level of immersion. It just aims to be fun and nails it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2010"}

I can honestly say I'm very impressed with it. Now is definitely the time to buy one I think. Wait another year, and the prices will only continue to drop. I finally broke down and bought the PS3 based on a bundle sale that only cost me around 400 bones for the console and a couple games.I mentioned the above, because I think there are way too many fan-boys out there to skew people's decision what console to buy that still don't own any of these consoles, and are thinking about purchasing one. After using the PS3 for about a month now, it's become painfully obvious to me that neither the 360 or the PS3 is better than the other. Rather, it's a matter of opinion what you are going to use the console for.For me there was only a couple of reasons to own the PS3: Blu-Ray and to play the Sony exclusive games. The PS3 is by far the best available Blu-Ray player in my opinion. It's designed to play just about any Blu-Ray disc, it can be updated with firmware updates, and thing connects wirelessly to the internet via a wireless router/modem. Blu-Ray looks and sounds phenomenal. If you have an HDTV, and you have the extra cash to spare for Blu-Ray, ... I don't know what you're waiting on then. There truly is an incredible difference in sound and picture between Blu-Ray and DVD. The Sony PS3 allows you to view Blu-Ray in all of its glory. With all the extra features and such, maneuvering through all the menus on the PS3 is a breeze, too.The Sony exclusives for games isn't as compelling I think in comparison to the 360. However, that's all up to opinion. You'd have to play 'em to really grasp what you'd prefer. I'm more of a sports and action kind of gamer. I really love the 360 when it comes to Gears of War, Halo, and Mass Effect. The PS3 offers games such as Resistance, MLB: The Show, Killzone 2, and of course, Metal Gear Solid 4. It really comes down to what games tickle your fancy a little more. After you read all the reviews, and all of the hype, you really have to just play the games. I've played the games like Infamous and Little Big Planet. Those games have received great reviews, but I didn't like them too much. So my point is, if you're stuck on which system has the best games, my advice is to just play them and see for yourself. One fact remains about the PS3 exclusives, however, and that is that PS3 does provide the better graphics. The graphics card within the PS3 is produced by nVidia. If you're a PC geek like me, you know that nVidia's graphics cards have always been on the pricier side. There's a reason for that, and I'll just leave it at that.The PS3 offers many things that make it better than the 360. The hard drive isn't proprietary, and easily exchangeable with a bigger hard drive. The controllers have built in rechargeable battery backs that charge via USB, and connect via Bluetooth. You can use a standard USB keyboard/mouse. Wireless capability is included with the PS3. It runs with a faster processor and graphics card. You can even install a separate operating system on the PS3. Browsing the web is surprisingly easy as well. It's not my browser of choice by any means, but it is 100% compatible with every website I've thrown at it. The PS3 is a Blu-Ray player, which makes it a gaming console, and your main movie player. The PS3 also up-converts your DVDs.The PS3 is not perfect by any means, however. If you play online games you'll want to stay away from the PS3. Paying for the Xbox Live experience was always annoying to me, but after engaging in some online matches with Killzone 2, it has opened my eyes. The play is laggy and slow. Finding matches accourding to your skill level is also found wanting. The store and browsing for demos and such is done far better with Xbox's Live experience. The Xbox also offers instant streaming via Netflix, and PS3 doesn't. I find the controller for the PS3 a little uncomfortable compared to the Xbox. The buttons at times can be too sensitive, and the controller feels cramped at times. Bottom line for the controller, though, is that is strictly opinion. My wife's hands are much smaller than mine, and the controller for the PS3 to her is 100 million times better than the 360. So it just depends on what feels right to you.The bottom line for the PS3 is that whatever your preferences are, those should dictate what system you'll choose if you can only choose one. There are many features available to you other than what I mentioned, and you can view those via Sony's website, or by browsing through the other reviews posted here. There's really no reason to not own a PS3. If you're looking to make the step towards Blu-Ray, you have a wireless network in your house, and you love solo gaming, then PS3 is probably for you. If online gaming is a big deal, and you're not really convinced that Blu-Ray is the way to go for you, than you should probably go the route of the Xbox 360. The whole exclusive gaming thing is really just a bonus. Both systems offer quality exclusive games that will make you happy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2009"}

I bought it after playing with friends, and I've been playing it for a solid two months.  I've bought several other games in the meantime (Halo 2, THUG 2,  Call of Dut), but I keep revisiting Battlefront instead of all the others.At first, I didn't want to buy Battlefront because I thought Rebel Strike was awful.  I took it back in disbelief in 48 hours.  Lucasarts has a tendency to take on too much in a game.  Shooters that are flight sims, flight sims that are RPG's.  Don't even get me started on the lame space battles in KOTOR!  Battlefront, though does it all well.  You control vehicles, you shoot as infantry, and they both work very well.  The XWing and TIE are bit chucky, but they're fun additions.The game isn't story driven at all; it's more like a first person shooter chess game.  You battle for a planet and then move to the next.  You don't play a character; instead, you pick a character class and play that class (snipers, heavy weapons, rifle men, pilots, wookies, dark troopers, droidikas, etc.  All with different abilities).  They all have excellent secondary weapons (in fact, two secondary and two primary weapons).  The first time your sniper's probe droid calls in airstrike is a real treat.You don't play jedi, just grunts.  And it's fun.  This game has simple controls; you learn it in about ten minutes and can play it well out of the box if you're good with shooters.  The main thing I like about the game is if I want to play for three hours or for ten minutes, this game satisfies.  This is in the top five games of the year for me.

There are classics are sure to you back to memory lane like Funhouse, where you make your way through a wacky carnival, battling your way to the top and dealing with a egotistical side-show barker named Rudy, who doesn't want you medeling with his fun, and the classic Taxi, where you'd have to commute your way through the city picking up passengers from Pinups, and even Santa Claus, all the way to joyrides and airport terminals, collecting points for extra cabfare, all the classics like Whirlwind and one of their first games, Jive Time. The graphics are absolutely stunning, and bring back the feeling of classic gameplay for gamers of all ages. The control is very simple to pick up for anyone young and old, and the sights and the sounds of the game really take you back in time well.All in all, while there are very few games that really are that are inexpensive for the Nintendo Wii that are actually worth it, and Pinball Hall of fame: The Williams Collection is worth it at that price. My only gripe is that I wish there could've been a few other greats here like High Speed and its sequel The Getaway: High Speed 2 on the game, but overall, it definitely is a bumping, pinball-flipping great time.Graphics: B+Sound: A-Control: A-Fun & Enjoyment: B 1/2- for solo players; B for multiplayerOverall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2008"}

But while Rockstar and other RPG makers like Bioware (pre EA) have always delivered deep multilayered storylines and engaging companions, of late Bethesda has focused more on salient storytelling (where the gameplay itself creates its own little storylines and memorable moments and gives a bare bones main quest just for completionists) the flaws of Oblivion, lack of interest in the Fallout franchise and general dislike of FPSs lead me to avoid for almost 5 years installing Fallout 3. But being a HUGE Stalker and Metro fan and after a particularly nasty cold that left me bedridden for almost a week I decided to try it out...and I found it to be simply magnificent.Yeah yeah it is a PAIN in the youknowwhat to get it to run properly in Windows 7 (nowadays it runs mostly stable with buttery smooth 60 FPS and the occasional random loading crash) and the main storyline is a bland as melted butter (complete with 200 year old Nuka Cola and immortal bloodpacks; they could have just based it around the time of the first game to have plausible explanation for all the loot just lying around) but the gameplay and design is oh so polished that it is all worth it. Some reviewers have commented on how it almost played like a rollercoaster ride of Fallout highlights in a FPS coat of paint, but somehow the pseudo survival horror vibe of it all finally made me \"get\" the Fallout setting.Now before you get all hot and bothered let me point out that the Fallout I am playing might differ a bit from the Fallout the designers intended; I am running a good amount of hi res textures, mods, patches and INI tweaks to make the game more FPS than RPG (especially in its combat, where my main char dies in 3 or 4 shot if not careful, and I LOVE it like that).The mood and setting of the ruined pseudo retro civilization feels so alive and organic, and while the dialogue can be a bit amateurish the quest themselves where quite an improvement over Oblivion and even Skyrim, with multiple twists, turns and all those salient gameplay moments I enjoy so much, like finding the remains of another wanderer surrounded by corpses of ghouls in the middle of an abandoned warehouse or the frantic sneaking around with no more bullets or healing pack to get out of a robot factory are some of the most memorable moments of the game for me.The game has held up really well over the years and I feel somewhat foolish for having waited so long to play it, but with New Vegas and inevitable announcement and release of Fallout 4 sometime next year, this seems to be the perfect time to hop in and become hooked with the franchise.For a detailed take on the game there are lots of more reviews, but as a new Johnny come lately fan this get my highest recommendation...plus ask in the comments for my tips and tricks (believe me I tried them ALL) for getting the game running on modern operating systems","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2013"}

They appear in the Sinnoh reigon's myths and old folklore. One is called Dialga, and is said to have the power to control time. The other is called Palkia, who is said to have the ability to distort space. The sinister organization called Team Galaxy is trying to rule the region by utilizing these two Pokemon's power. During your adventure to complete your Pokedex and become the Champion, these two Pokemon, and Team Galaxy, will intertwine into the story and lead you on a fantastic journey across the Sinnoh region.When you set off on your travels, you'll be able to play as either a boy or girl Trainer. You will also utilize the DS's dual slots to transfer Pokemon from the GBA Pokemon games and be able to link up withPokemon Rangerto access more special content.

Not because it never interested me(as I'm a level grinding fanatic), it's just I've always had a problem with buying two games just to 'catch 'em all'. It seems wrong to me when the other game has very little to no changes in it that would warrant me getting it when one game would suffice. At any rate, I was compelled to get the new Pokemon game for the DS. I think it was more out of curiosity to see what Game Freak would produce on the DS. For the most part, I was pleased with the game. Pearl offers more of the same deep and addictive gameplay we've played in Pokemon all these years with just enough new monsters and things to do to keep me interested. It's easily the best Pokemon game yet. A game any DS owner should add to their library. However, even so, there were a few things I found fault in with the game. Due to technical limitations of the GameBoy, GameBoy Color & the GameBoy Advance; I could understand why they resorted to keeping the game 2-D with odd yelps and grunts for your Pokemon yet we now have a handheld that can produce full 3-D and great audio so why have only the overworld map in 3-D & not the battles and why keep the same odd yelps and grunts? It's been proven a game like this can be done in 3-D...just take a look at Dragon Quest Monsters-Joker. It would have been cool to see battles in a more Pokemon Stadium/Colosseum vein. 3-D is the natural evolution of games like these. It wouldn't have to have been done quite like DQM-Joker to have its' own unique style but 3-D would've been nice. Second, why not add a little more story to the game to give me more incentive to play the game? I love games with a good story. Thirdly, like I mentioned earlier- why two games when only one will work??At any rate, Pokemon Pearl is a solid game worthy of your hard-earned buck if you can get past those minor quibbles. I did, at least. Maybe Game Freak will take the hint and make a good change with the next round of Pokemon games. You've got to keep things fresh to keep people interested... ;)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2008"}

It was written in 1997, so the premise is kind of funny/anachronistic.  I guess the internet and a connected city were futuristic back then.  The characters are 1 dimensional, and pretty dull.  The voice acting is top notch though.The gameplay really shows its age.  Released in 1997, you can expect pretty basic movements and dungeon quality.  Moving requires the use of the 3ds' crappy d-pad.  It is very very annoying,  especially after playing Persona 4 Golden.The art is Ok, but really blurry and low rez, especially during battles.  Part of the fun of these games is the monster design.  Again, Persona4 Golden on the Vita was great for that.  SMT: Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers on 3ds is really bad in this dept.Anyway, this game is definitely not for me.  I'd suggest that you look at some gameplay videos before purchasing.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2013"}

The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"GarionOrb","summary":"Epic!","reviewText":"Ok, everyone knows the graphics are incredible.  That's to be expected from a Final Fantasy game.  But the storyline is truly epic.  It even rivals the masterpiece, Final Fantasy VII!  The sphere grid is a bit odd, but new innovations such as being able to control Aeons or being able to switch characters mid-battle more than makes up for it.  The voices are wonderfully done.  I must admit I was a bit nervous about what it would sound like.  The characters are interesting...especially once you find out the scoop on them in Zanarkand (I won't give any spoilers here).  Then, to top it all off, this game has the greatest ending I've ever seen in a Final Fantasy game.  It is totally breathtaking!  I cannot wait for FFX-2.

That being said the PX22 is a decent all around good headset.  The sound is great.  I use mine on the PC and you hear everything so crisp and with base, making it feel like you are literally in the game.  Minute noises are amplified so that you hear feet walking and know where the are before they come around the corner.  The microphone works great too.  It's a USB headset which is a plus, but you have multiple options on how you want to set up.  It is compatible with my Xbox 360 as well, although I didn't use it much for that and can really speak about that.  I also have an X12 and can't really notice a difference.  I guess you are paying about $30 more for the ability to use it on multiple types of devices?  Not sure, but for my use the X12 is better than the PX22, simply because it is cheaper and performs the same.  Still, I would recommend as it is a great headset.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000P46NKC","description":"Resident Evil 4 Wii","reviewerName":"Sky","summary":"You'll Only Wish That You Were Fighting Zombies","reviewText":"This game is fun, scary, exhilarating....It's awesome. But be advised that the following review pertains to play with a Classic Controller (available pretty cheap here at AmazonWii Classic Controller), not the Wii Remote, and players can switch between the Wii Remote and the Classic Controller at any time.So...I popped open a cold one, sat down with my new RE4 game and proceeded to have a heart attack from the terror the game caused. No, not really. I'm old, but hopefully not that old.The game starts you (Leon) out in the woods in front of an old house on the outskirts of a Spanish speaking European village. You're a third person controlling Leon. The graphics look stellar and the sound is as realistic as it gets.As you walk through the spooky woods towards the house your footsteps in the leaves are clear. Upon entering the house you are immediately attacked by a crazed local that doesn't seem to be a zombie. Based on the movies (and previous games from what I hear) you expect zombies. As you exit the house you are attacked by more locals (that will viciously kill you unless either you do them in first or safely make your way past). Zombies would have been a welcome adversary versus this unexpected enemy.But don't worry; if you're looking for more than just crazed locals, you get them. Be careful what you wish for, because unless you know what you're doing, these boss/mercenary/creature battles are difficult (if your playing in the normal game mode which I'd recommend as opposed to the amateur and easy mode).A map is provided for you to follow to your chapter destinations. There are typewriters scattered sparsely through the game where you can save progress (do NOT miss the opportunity to save when presented with one).As you make your way to the target destinations, you are introduced to a variety of enemies that will try to stop you at every turn. As you are successful in doing so you are rewarded with the opportunity to explore areas that have a barrage of items that will be (very) useful for you to take. A word to the wise, however, clear any area of enemies (if possible) before going exploring!The main objective is to rescue the daughter of the President of the United States. You are provided with only a few weapons at first to defeat the enemies in your way, and you really don't need a lot. A few are found free throughout the game, but most are available from The Merchant (that you will encounter somewhere towards the end of just about every chapter) using money and items you find along the way that you can trade. You can also trade your weaker weapons with The Merchant for more powerful ones.I completed the game without purchasing most of the weapons; however, \"Tuning Up\" the weapons I already owned with The Merchant was crucial. By default at the start of the game you get the handgun, a knife and some grenades. I traded out a handgun twice and shotgun once for better versions. For what it's worth, in addition to regularly tuning up my already-owned weapons, the only weapons that I purchased/obtained/traded that ultimately were critical to survival were--in order--the shotgun, the Punisher, the Red 9 (with stock), the semi-auto rifle (with scope from Merchant and be sure to find the free Infrared Scope), the Striker, Broken Butterfly and the Rocket Launcher (in hindsight I'd suggest not wasting money on the ONE SHOT Rocket launcher; it gets you past most adversaries quite easily, but it depletes your cash for more important items with more longevity).If I had to find a negative in RE4, it would be a stretch, but...the game doesn't start you out with a big enough attach&eacute; case to fit all of the weapons and health that you'll acquire along the way; you'll have to spend precious Pesetas with The Merchant on bigger cases a couple of times.Bottom line: RE4 is the best game that I've ever played, but I'm a relatively new gamer so take that with a grain of salt. Finishing this game was a bittersweet moment, because it was so dog-gone fun.Combine some green herb with some yellow and red herb for better health, then sell a Gem-Laced Beerstein to The Merchant so that you have enough Pesetas to add Resident Evil 4 to your Amazon cart.The Wii game features all the extras of the PS2 version (two bonus games and other fun extras). The Wii version of RE4 also includes a trailer for Resident Evil: The Umbrella ChroniclesResident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles, scheduled for release only on Wii in late 2007. X Boxers and PS3ites will get Resident Evil 5 in 2008 (according to GamePro magazine Gamepro - Ca ).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2007"}

And is that good or bad?","reviewText":"Anyone who knows Animal Crossing knows  it's hard to really rate the game until you have played for a year or so, but I thought some people might like to hear some first impressions from a huge AC fan of the latest game!My BIG first impression---very little seems to have changed.  This game seems like a real cross between the Gamecube version and the DS  version, both of which used up many hours of my time! The setup of the city is a LOT like the Gamecube version.  The town have the same feel,with lots  of slopes and rivers and the same somewhat tiring to get around town plan.  Tom Nook, the Able sisters, Pelly, all are there in stores that look about the same.  Blathers is even MORE long winded, and it's just as long a routine to get a fossil identified.  It sounds  like I'm complaining, but I'm not really, it's the AC I know and love.  You have  to go through the same internship with Tom Nook,and do even the exact same tasks you always have,and the first payment on the house is even just the same amount!You DO get to pick your house, though,from four around town.  You don't share a house, and they aren't all in a square.  I picked a house on the beach, for easy fishing.I  bought a shovel and a fishing rod.  Shoveling up things is the same,fishing seems initially a little easier---and yes,my first fish was indeed a Sea Bass!The animals I visited all had furniture I recognized---modern black and white, cabin themes,etc.  The animals were also about half ones I've had before, including Ruby, who I think has been in every town I've virtually lived in!A few things I did  notice---the sound was noticably better.  One resident, Reuben, had a scary sort of voice, and it was really echoey and cool.  The tops for sale at Able's  and the designs on display were impressive---they looked a lot more detailed than previously.I know at some point I will be able to take a bus to the city---I haven't yet---and I know as I go along I will find a lot more changes (I hope) but for  now, I feel like I'm  returning to a town I know well.  I love Animal Crossing, and I will be happy even if there doesn't turn out to be much new.  If you love AC too, buy this.  If you have never tried AC, you are in for a treat---BUY IT!

Giant Gryphons rule the skies, Werewolves tear the innocent limb from limb and cities are held under siege as creatures we'd dismissed as the imaginings of our ancestors prove to be very real and very angry at being prisoners for untold milennia. As the only person able to seal the box, Deckard finds that he must work with a shadowy secret society to save civilization before it's torn apart by tooth and claw.","reviewerName":"Michael J. Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"Hardly legendary","reviewText":"Legendary is one of those games that seems like it was created for me.  It combines fantasy monsters and lots of guns to create a modern-day first-person shooter that takes on the creatures of Greek myth.Wait, did I say Greek myth?  Where did you get that idea?  Oh, probably from the notion that Charles Deckard opens Pandora's Box (which is, you know, Greek) and unleashes: griffons, minotaurs, werewolves, firedrakes, Nari (evil little pixies), Tscuhigomo's Children (spiders that explode), a golem, a kraken, and poltergeists. Minotaurs and griffons make perfect sense. You could make an argument that the myth of Lycaeon places werewolves in Greek mythology. The firedrakes are modeled after the mythical salamander, a myth that harkens all the way back to the Talmud. But the rest? The rest is an excuse to throw monsters at you to blow up.My delicate historical sensibility aside, Legendary is still a peculiar beast. Deckard's supposedly a jewel thief, but his lock-picking skill consists of standing at electrical panels and waiting for a counter to finish so the door opens.  It seems like there was supposed to be a lock-picking mini-game that didn't make it into the finished product.Deckard also has the ability to absorb energy from every monster he kills.  This allows him to heal, shoot a burst of energy at his opponents, and power certain gadgets to defeat bigger monsters like the golem and the kraken. Reminiscent of Lost Planet: Extreme Condition, this \"kill more to survive\" game mechanic is only slightly less forgiving.Every game has a developer's favorite monster, the one that the designers clearly put a lot of thought into, sometimes to the exclusion of the actual focus of the game.  In F.E.A.R. it was the amazingly life-like, intelligent, and vulgar clone soldiers.  In Legendary, it's the werewolves.  They climb, they throw stuff from afar, they regenerate unless you chop their heads off, and they're hideous-looking. You will learn to hate werewolves with a passion in Legendary.What's curious about Legendary is that it wants to be a horror game.  There are several scenes wherein everyday citizens are torn apart by the supernatural horrors unleashed by Pandora's box, right before your very eyes.  Which seems a bit out of place for a game about mythical creatures taking over the world.  Given the range of monstrosities foisted on thus in most modern horror games, a man being eaten by an eagle/lion isn't all that scary.Legendary is pretty linear too.  You can only shoot the bad guys you're allowed to shoot (no putting those civilians out of their misery!). You can only go in the designated areas not blocked off by debris, which is everywhere of course. And you can't jump. Period.The ending has to be the most hilarious, over-the-top, death scene of a villain ever.  Assuming you even make it to the end (spoiler alert!), you will have the distinct pleasure of watching the main villain killed in a Rube Goldberg-ian game of monster volleyball, with each monster mangling and then tossing the bad guy off to the next until he it tossed over a ledge...and then bounces on the way down!This isn't a bad first-person shooter, merely a mediocre one trying to compete with superior action horror titles.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2009"}
